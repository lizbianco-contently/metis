Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 956.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     956), a bill to establish legal standards and procedures for \n     product liability litigation, and for other purposes, having \n     met, after full and fair conference, have agreed to recommend \n     and do recommend to their respective Houses this report, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased, after a lapse of almost 1 \nyear, to present to the Senate and to support the conference report on \nH.R. 956, the Common Sense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996. \nThis is a bipartisan proposal reflecting, essentially, the decisions \nmade here in the U.S. Senate last year, without the broader additions \nthat were passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, during the course of this 5 hours today, there will be \nmany statements--passionately held--about what the future holds with \nrespect to both our legal system and our economic system, and whether \nthis bill should pass. As a consequence, Mr. President, I want to start \nmy remarks with a statement about what has already happened as a result \nof a very modest product liability reform that was passed by the \nCongress of the United States, and signed by the President, just 2 or 3 \nyears ago. I am going to do that because that action speaks louder than \nany words we can say about the desirability of this broader \nlegislation.\n  On August 17, 1994, President Clinton signed the General Aviation \nRevitalization Act of 1994. That act created an 18-year statute of \nrepose on general aviation, piston-driven aircraft. That single \nprovision, in less than 2 years, has already had a magnificently \npositive impact on the general aviation industry.\n  Since the enactment of the bill, the general aviation industry has \nrecorded its best year in more than a decade. In 1986, as a result \nlargely of product liability litigation, Cessna, a famous name in \naviation, stopped producing piston-driven aircraft. It has now \nreentered that field. In July, Cessna will\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\nopen a new $40 million facility in Kansas and, once again, will begin \nto produce piston-driven aircraft. The facility will employ about 2,000 \npeople.\n  Cessna is not alone in this connection, Mr. President. Piper \nAircraft, just 2 years ago, was having an extremely difficult time \ngetting out of a bankruptcy proceeding to which it had been subjected. \nNo investor wanted to come to the rescue of that famous American \ncompany because it would have to assume its liability risks. Since the \nenactment of that simple piece of legislation, however, investors have \ncome forward. The Piper Aircraft Co. has come out of bankruptcy, and \nits employment has increased by 30 percent. More generally, employment \nis up at every general aviation manufacturing facility in the United \nStates by 15 percent. We went to the Internet last week to find the \nkind of job openings that have resulted from this resurgence in general \naviation activity. Here is a brief list of some of the jobs we found: \nAvionics technician, Cessna; computer control technician, Cessna; \nsystems designer, Cessna; weights engineer, Cessna; senior cost \naccountant, Raytheon; senior engineer, software systems certification, \nRaytheon. Exactly the kind of high-skill, high-wage jobs that the \nUnited States needs in order to continue its leadership in world \ntechnology, and in order to provide jobs for coming generations.\n  Mr. President, that bill less than 2 years ago was criticized as \nrestricting the rights of plaintiffs. Yet, Mr. President, I am \nconfident when I say that there is not a single Member of this body--\nor, for that matter, of the House of Representatives--who ever, in the \ncourse of a political campaign or to meet an obligation, turned down a \nride in a Cessna aircraft on the grounds that those aircraft were \nnegligently manufactured. Those who most eloquently defend the present \nlegal system--a system which for all practical purposes bankrupted \nCessna and Piper by reason of lawsuits claiming negligent manufacture--\nnever once acted on that and said, ``Oh, no, I cannot get on the plane; \nit was negligently manufactured.''\n  Mr. President, I cannot imagine that there is a Member of this body, \nor of the House of Representatives, who ever said, ``I won't allow my \nchild to get a whooping cough vaccination because the materials in that \nvaccination were negligently manufactured.'' And yet they will stand up \nhere today and say, ``We cannot change the law. We cannot protect those \nmanufacturers against lawsuits like that because it would be unwise to \ndo so.''\n  The present system has driven every such manufacturer--except one--\nout of the business, and has caused the cost of that vaccine to be \nmultiplied by 400 percent. It is less available and more expensive \nbecause of the insistence that we continue to allow absurd lawsuits to \nbe brought against those manufacturers. The people of the United States \ndeserve, we all agree, a system that is fair and efficient, yields \nreasonably predictable results, holds parties responsible in accordance \nwith their fault, and perhaps most importantly reduces the wasteful \ntransaction costs associated with all kinds of litigation, but in this \ncase product liability litigation.\n  Estimates of total tort costs of litigation and associated activities \nrange from some $80 to $117 billion a year. Every dollar of these costs \nis forced back on consumers through higher prices on products used \nevery day, and not at all, incidentally, limits the choice of those \nproducts as well.\n  Listen to just a few facts about today's product liability system in \nAmerica. The current system accounts for about 20 percent of the cost \nof a ladder. It accounts for 50 percent of the cost of a football \nhelmet. Injured parties, on the other hand, receive less than half of \nthe money spent on product liability actions, with the other half going \nto lawyers and their associated expenses. Nearly 90 percent of all of \nthe companies in the United States can expect to become a defendant in \na product liability case at least once--90 percent of all of the \ncompanies in the United States. Are 90 percent of them negligent \nmanufacturers or product sellers? No. Many win these lawsuits, but they \nhave to pay their attorney fees and they have to pay their insurance \ncosts, in any event.\n  Product liability insurance costs 15 times as much in the United \nStates as it does in Japan and 20 times more than it does in Europe. \nAre their manufacturers, as a result, automatically negligent and \nindifferent to their consumers? Under the present laws in most of the \nStates of the United States, manufacturers can be sued for products \nmanufactured in the 1800's--manufactured a century ago.\n  The present system costs too much. In a book published 5 years ago by \nthe Brookings Institution the following note appears:\n\n       Regardless of the trends in tort verdicts, most studies in \n     this area have concluded that, after adjusting for inflation \n     and population, liability costs have risen dramatically in \n     the last 30 years, and most especially in the last decade.\n\n  I have already spoken to the proposition that more of the money in \nthe system goes to the lawyers and to their associates than goes to \nvictims. Liability insurance costs affect every manufacturer in the \nUnited States.\n  One example from my own State is a water ski manufacturer, Connelly \nWater Skis of Lynnwood, WA, pays an annual premium every year of \n$345,000 for product liability insurance even though it has never lost \na case. It has never lost a case--but still has to pay that huge \npremium.\n\n  The present system takes forever--years--to settle cases. \nCompensation, ironically, is unfair. The smaller the amount of damages, \nthe larger the percentage of recovery. The larger the actual damages, \nthe actual losses to an individual, the lower the percentage of actual \nrecovery.\n  Unpredictability. Last year in a hearing before the Commerce \nCommittee a Virginia law professor, Jeffrey O'Connell, explained:\n\n       If you are badly injured in our society by a product and \n     you go to a highly skilled lawyer . . . in all honesty the \n     lawyer cannot tell you what you will be paid, when you will \n     be paid, or, indeed, if you will be paid.\n\n  What is the effect of a broken down system on people in the United \nStates today? First, it is increased costs. I have already referred to \nthe fact that one manufacturer of vaccines has raised its price 400 \npercent, from $2.80 to $11.40, solely to recover the cost of increased \nlawsuits, and that in 1984 two of the three companies manufacturing the \nDPT vaccine decided to stop production because it just simply was not \nworth it, by reason of the cost of the product liability. Later in that \nyear, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that doctors stop \nvaccinating children over the age of 1 in order to conserve limited \nsupplies of that vaccine.\n  Second, it is very clear that the fear of product liability \nlitigation hinders the development of new products in the United \nStates, and the marketing of those products once they are developed. In \nan American Medical Association report entitled ``The Impact of Product \nLiability on the Development of New Medical Technologies,'' they wrote:\n\n       Innovative new products are not being developed, or are \n     being withheld from the market because of liability concerns, \n     or the inability to obtain adequate insurance. Certain older \n     technologies have been removed from the market not because of \n     sound scientific evidence indicating lack of safety or \n     efficacy but because product liability suits have exposes \n     manufacturers to unacceptable financial risk.\n\n  Rawlings Sporting Goods, one of the leading manufacturers of \ncompetitive football equipment for more than 80 years, announced in \n1988 that it would no longer manufacture, distribute, or sell football \nhelmets. Two manufacturers in the United States out of 20 that were in \nthis business in 1975 remain in that business today.\n  A recent article in Science magazine reported that a careful \nexamination of the current state of research to develop an AIDS vaccine \n``shows liability concerns have had negative effects.''\n  It points out that Genentech halted its AIDS vaccine research after \nthe California legislature failed to enact State tort reform. Only \nafter a favorable ruling did they renew or resume that research.\n  On that same topic, consider a recent comment by Dr. Jonas Salk, the \ninventor of the polio vaccine. I quote Dr. Salk:\n\n       If I develop an AIDS vaccine, I do not believe a U.S. \n     manufacturer will market it because of the current punitive \n     damage system.\n\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\n\n  Not only does the current system hurt medical innovation, it also \ninhibits small companies from producing everyday goods. For example, \nagain in my own State, Washington Auto Carriage in Spokane distributes \nvarious kinds of truck equipment throughout the United States. Here is \nwhat its owner, Cliff King, says, and I quote him.\n\n       We have been forced out of selling some kinds of truck \n     equipment because of the exorbitant insurance premiums \n     required to be in the market. As a result, this type of \n     equipment tends to be distributed only by a very few large \n     distributors around the country who can afford to spread the \n     costs over a very large base of sales. Ultimately there is \n     much less competition in these markets.\n\n  Many arguments are made against this proposal on the basis of \nfederalism. The United States is a single market, however, a single \nmarket now with 51 different product liability regimes. As a result, \none of the associations that is most interested in a devolution of \npower to the States, the National Governors' Association, recognizes \nthat the current patchwork of U.S. product liability law is too costly, \ntime consuming, unpredictable and counterproductive, resulting in \nseverely adverse effects on the American consumer, workers' \ncompetitiveness, innovation and competence.\n  Mr. President, we will have a considerable period of time today \nduring which to debate details of this legislation, but I wish to \nreturn just for a moment to the point with which I began this \nexplanation of the bill.\n  First, the Members of the Senate, even those who argue most \npassionately and eloquently to retain the present broken down system, \ndo they act in their own lives as if these manufacturers were engaged \nin nefarious activities indifferent to the safety of their consumers? \nDid they, during all of the years in which Cessna and Piper were being \ndriven out of business by the system they defended, refuse to fly on \ntheir airplanes? No. Do they tell their families or do they themselves \nrefuse the latest medical devices, the latest serums, the costs of \nwhich have been driven sky high by product liability litigation? No, \nthey do not. They use them. They use them for their children. Do we \nhave an example of what even modest reform in this field means to the \nAmerican economy? Yes, we do, in the general aviation industry. And so \nI am convinced that we can and should pass this modest product \nliability reform, and we can expect an immodest and positive result: \nmore competition, better goods and services, lower prices, fewer \nlawsuits, and a higher degree of justice for the American people as a \nwhole.\n  This issue has been debated in this body for more than a decade at \nthis point. It is time to bring that debate to a close, to pass this \nlegislation, and to see the relief that the American consumer, the \nAmerican manufacturer, and American competitiveness needs to be \nsuccessful in the world of the 21st century. As a consequence, I \nurgently ask my fellow Senators promptly to pass this bill and send it \nto the House and then to the President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, [Mr. \nHollings], is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield so much time as will be necessary.\n  I am thoroughly bemused by my friend from the State of Washington \nstarting off on aircraft with the very categorical statement that no \none ever got on a plane saying that Cessna's planes were unsafe or the \nmanufacturer was negligent. If they thought so, they were not going to \nget on the plane. They would not have to say it. Come on. Who are we \nkidding?\n\n  By coincidence, just last Thursday, I saw it reported that a Cessna \nplane down in Florida took off with the Blackburn family from my \nhometown and it had barely gotten off, I observed, to fly over the \nwaters, and it turned and went down in about 5 to 10 feet of water at \nthe most. We saw the pictures of them trying to save the family. The \nhusband and wife and two of the children were lost, the pilot was lost, \nand the little 11-year-old hangs on as we talk.\n  Being an observer, I wondered what had happened. Stories have come \nagain and again that the pilot was most experienced. Someone saw the \nengine streaming smoke. I cannot tell. You cannot. No one can at the \nmoment. But it appears that it is a product liability situation. There \nis not any question in my mind. It occurs again and again.\n  It brings me right to the point, Mr. President, of the shabby nature \nof this whole proceeding. I say that because we passed this bill in the \nSenate last May and finally agreed to a conference on the House side in \nNovember. They had one short, brief meeting. Under the rules in the \nHouse, you have to at least have a meeting. But thereafter there was \nnothing.\n  It really bemuses me when the distinguished Senator says we are now \nto consider the conference report. We now consider the conspiracy \nreport. It is not a conference. I never conferred. I was appointed by \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate as a member of the \nconference but was never told, never consented, never conferred, and \nnot any on our side of the aisle or our staff were invited other than \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Here is what is happening in the Congress of the United States. I am \ngoing on my 30th year now, and this is the first time I have ever seen \nthis happen this year and last year where they fixed the jury; namely, \nthey get together on what they want and, since they are the majority \nparty, can pick up a vote or two. They then go and bicycle around: Now, \nSenator, will this please you if we change this little word? And you \nhave a ``gerrybuilt'' bill in front of you that never would pass muster \nin a conference.\n  Having fixed the vote, they went ahead and we heard last week that \nsomething was happening. In fact, I could tell it. On Thursday night \nRichard Threlkeld on CBS came in at 7:20 and he said the U.S. Congress \nis about to consider these dastardly, ridiculous lawsuits, and he went \non to talk about a man in the men's restroom where women came in and he \nwas insulted. The proponents talk about the coffee case from \nMcDonald's, and they have these anecdotal, nonsensical matters that \nnever tell the complete facts. And the truth of the matter is, since we \nmention the coffee case, I have the finding right here that confirms \nthat the jury did award $3 million. But the judge reduced that. After \nall, judges do have sense. Jurors do have sense. All wisdom is not \nvested in the Senate. And they reduced that amount to $640,000 and the \nlady who was hospitalized with third-degree burns, requiring skin \ngrafts, settled for even a lesser amount. But you hear on CBS national \nnews, ``All you have to do is spill coffee and run up and get your \nmoney.'' Come on.\n\n  Regarding all the planes, now they are back in business and \neverything. We always allocate to ourselves that everything begins and \nends right here with the wisdom of the U.S. Senate. They want to tell \nhow we passed a good budget bill that has corporate America going like \ngangbusters, the stock market through the roof, and, yes, people are \nbuying planes, but they do not want to talk about the budget we passed \nthat none of them ever voted for. Categorically, one Senator on the \nother side of the aisle said, just 2 years ago, that if we pass this \nbudget they would be hunting us down like dogs in the street and \nshooting us, the economy would collapse, there would be a depression; \neverything would go wrong.\n  Here now the stock market sets record levels, corporate America is as \naffluent as it has ever been, and they are buying airplanes. And my \ncolleagues want to attribute that to themselves passing a bill? Come \non.\n  The next thing the proponents say is the present system costs too \nmuch. Mr. President, it is like a college education. A college \neducation is most expensive. The only thing more expensive is not \nhaving a college education. If product liability costs, which it does \nvery little, the worst would be to not have product liability, because \ninjuries occur. We have a safe America.\n  I wish I had time to go down through a list of these injuries. When I \nsay the conference was ``a shabby procedure,'' I mean that last week I \nwas struggling on Friday to try to find the bill. The bill's supporters \nwere changing words down to the last minute. They filed a cloture \nmotion at the time they filed the bill, which means they have the votes \nfor cloture, and the jury is fixed\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\nbefore they hear any arguments. And thereby they can come in with the \nfixed jury and say, bam, bam, they have cloture--today I was limited to \nan hour postcloture. They could have called for the cloture vote in the \nnext 20 minutes, since we came in at 10 o'clock. So you are under the \ngun when they offer you only a few hours of debate. You are not allowed \nto talk sense.\n  Oh, boy, we could spend an afternoon pointing out the good that \nproduct liability has done. We do not get blown up by that Pinto gas \ntank. Cars all have antilock brakes. That elevator is checked. The \nsteps are marked. Little children do not burn up in flammable pajamas. \nThe women of America are not threatened with Dalkon shields. And \nfootball helmets are much safer--yes, we have had some wonderful \ndecisions against their unsafe nature. When you and I played football, \nMr. President, we ran into the line and there was just a piece of \nleather and what you would get, many, many a time, was traumatic \ncataracts. That does not occur now in high school and college ball, \nbecause of the better construction of football helmets--and product \nliability.\n  We could go all afternoon and try to explain the wisdom of a tort \nsystem that is working at the State level. But the proponents do not \ngive you time to do that. They come up here with the anecdotal stuff, \nthat it is costing too much. Let me cite some reports about what it \ncosts, because the Rand Corp. and the Conference Board have studied \nthese matters. The Rand Corp. said that less than 1 percent of product \nliability injuries ever result in a lawsuit. Over 50 percent of civil \ncases are business suits, incidentally. Business is suing business, \nlike gangbusters. Pennzoil against Texaco, a $10.2 billion verdict, \nthat one business against business result is more than all the product \nliability for personal injuries in the last 20 years, that one case. \nAnd they are talking about, ``It costs too much.''\n  But what did the Conference Board do? They interviewed 232 risk \nmanagers. We have it in the Record. The Conference Board interviewed \n232 risk managers, of the blue chip, Fortune 500 companies, who said \nthat less than 1 percent of the cost of the product was due to product \nliability. It was not a problem.\n  The proponents knew this. They come in here because they have Victor \nSchwartz and there is still a movement against lawyers. This is \npollster driven. We all come here per political poll. Lawyers get rid \nof the lawyers.\n  Ah, Mr. President, ``the trial lawyers have paid them off.'' Yes. The \nproponents had a news conference even before the bill was called up. \nYou see they have radio, TV shows, news conferences, before we even \ncall the bill, and before those who oppose it have even a chance to say \nso. That is why I say it is a shabby operation. But I will quote, \nbecause you have to get the news clips about how two of the Senators:\n\n       . . . who will appear on the ballot with Clinton in West \n     Virginia this fall responded angrily to Clinton's weekend \n     threat to veto the House-Senate compromise of a bill that \n     limits damage awards in product liability cases. The two gave \n     an ``unusually harsh accusation'' to the President, saying \n     Clinton was ``rewarding'' the trial lawyers who are \n     ``bankrolling his reelection bid.''\n\n  That is from the Baltimore Sun.\n  Come on, it takes a bankroller to find a bankroller. Let us go to the \nindividual Senators, namely this Senator. I hope I have gotten some \ncontributions from the trial lawyers. I have been one. But I have been \na business lawyer, too. I have handled antitrust cases. I have sued a \ncorporation before the Securities and Exchange Commission. When you \ncome from a relatively small town like I grew up in, you represent all \nsides. And look at the record. I have been elected six times to the \nU.S. Senate. I will guarantee I have gotten more business contributions \nthan trial lawyer contributions. So let us dispel this notion about \nwhat you are doing for the trial lawyers. We are thinking of the \nConstitution in this case. That is one of the big reasons the American \nBar Association opposes it.\n  We are thinking of that seventh amendment. We are thinking of what \nthe bill's supporters said in the original instance about simplicity, \ntransactional costs, but how this particular measure now increases the \ntransaction cost and makes complex the so-called simplicity, if there \never one was.\n  More than anything else, let us go to the original doctrine of the \nContract With America crowd, from the 1994 election. Oh, they won on \naccount of the contract. Did you not get the message of the contract?\n  They have a bunch of children Senators running around, hollering, \n``The contract,'' and ``We gave our pledge.'' This Senator was elected, \ntoo, on a pledge: To stop a lot of this nonsense if he possibly could.\n  None other than the distinguished majority leader said, at the \nbeginning of this particular Congress:\n\n       America has reconnected us with the hopes for a nation made \n     free by demanding a Government that is more limited. Reining \n     in our government will be my mandate, and I hope it will be \n     the purpose and principal accomplishment of the 104th \n     Congress.\n\n  Senator Robert Dole, now the Republican nominee for the Presidency \nhere in November. I further quote Senator Dole:\n\n       . . . We do not have all the answers in Washington, DC. Why \n     should we tell Idaho, or the State of South Dakota, or the \n     State of Oregon, or any other State that we are going to pass \n     this Federal law and that we are going to require you to do \n     certain things . . .?\n\n  The majority leader then went on to say.\n\n       . . . Federalism is an idea that power should be kept close \n     to the people. It is an idea on which our nation was founded. \n     But there are some in Washington--perhaps fewer this year \n     than last--who believe that our States can't be trusted with \n     power. . . . If I have one goal for the 104th Congress, it is \n     this: that we will dust off the 10th amendment and restore it \n     to its rightful place.\n\n  Those powers not reserved under the Constitution are hereby delegated \nto the several States.\n  Here we go with the devolution group. We started off with unfunded \nmandates. They said we had to give everything back to the States. Every \nmeasure that has come up here says, ``Send welfare back, send the \nhealth problem back''--of course, it is all political pap. It is trying \nto get rid of responsibility. They do not want to pay the bill.\n  We have been spending $250 billion more than we have taken in each \nyear and both budgets--the President's and the Republican budget--will \ncall again for another $250 billion in expenditures with less than $250 \nbillion in revenues. So they do not want to speak the truth. They want \nto get boiled up into term limits, and we have gotten the lawyers now \nbecause this says ``kill all the lawyers,'' as the butcher said in \nHenry VI.\n  People do not realize how he said it. He said anarchy cannot \npredominate unless we get rid of all the lawyers. The lawyers, Mr. \nPresident, have been the bulwark of this great democracy. Every \nPresident from Washington up to Lincoln was a lawyer. They are the ones \nwho founded this country, gave thought and wisdom and direction and \ngrowth.\n  I hearken the words of Patrick Henry: ``I know not what course others \nmay take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.'' A Virginia \nlawyer.\n  Another Virginia lawyer, a 34-year-old lawyer sitting there and \npenning, ``All men are created equal.'' Thomas Jefferson.\n  James Madison foresaw our problem right here this minute 200-some \nyears ago. He said, ``But what is Government save the best of \nreflection on human nature. If man were angels, there would be no need \nfor Government, and if angels governed man, there would be no need for \ncontrols over the Government. The task in formulating a government to \nbe administered by a man over man is first frame that government with \nthe power to control the governed and thereupon oblige that same \ngovernment to control itself.'' James Madison, the lawyer.\n  This Government is out of fiscal control, and no one wants to talk \nabout it. I wish you would pick up the business section this morning. \nThey do not talk about that. They said, ``Well, the idea of deficits \nnow has gone sort of out of style.'' Why? I can tell the Washington \nPost why.\n  For all last year the Republicans had a fraudulent budget, 7 years to \nbalance. It was a fraud. It did not balance. Finally, President Clinton \nsaid, ``Well, monkey see monkey do. I will put out a fraudulent budget, \ntoo.'' So when he put one out, they said, ``Ah-ha, fraud.''\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\n He said, ``No, that's what you have,'' and that is why they stopped \ntalking, because neither side can possibly balance the budget without \nan increase in taxes, and both sides are trying to buy--trying to buy--\nthe vote in November with a tax cut.\n  Sheer nonsense, but that is what is going on. That is why they do not \ntalk about deficits anymore, because you cannot realistically talk \nabout it and give a tax cut at the same time. So they are moving on to \nabortion, immigration, they pick up lawyers--term limits--any kind of \nsidebar that is not a national problem to get by the election.\n  It is all applesauce. It is all Presidential politics. We are \nspinning our wheels, and it is a shabby process to come and bring this \nwithout any debate, limited as we are to talk about a national need \nthat every one of the States over the years has addressed--the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island got up on the floor and talked \nabout the years we have been discussing this. He is right. We have been \ndiscussing it for years and years, and the reason it has not passed is \nbecause the States have long since taken care of the problem, whether \nthe problem was the inability of finding insurance, whether it was \ntrying to get uniformity, whether it was international competition--you \ncan go down the list, like Sealtest ice cream, the flavor of the week, \nthey had a different reason every time.\n  Every time that the law professors looked at it, they came en masse \nand testified, ``For Heaven's sake, don't pass this measure.''\n\n  Every time the State legislators came, or the State attorneys general \ncame, they said, ``Look, we're doing the job. It's a nonproblem.''\n  Every time the chief justices of the States--the States that they \nrevere so much in devolution but that are totally repudiated here--the \nAssociation of State Chief Justices came and said, ``Don't pass this.''\n  The American Bar came and said, ``Don't pass this.''\n  I do not know who they represent other than themselves trying to get \nreelected on a pollster hot button. That is all it is. We can go down \nthe list of those who oppose this measure still.\n  The AFL-CIO, do you not think they represent working Americans? Find \nme a working American who says this is a good bill.\n  The Coalition for Consumer Rights; the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica; the National Conference of State Legislatures; Public \nCitizen--I can go right down the list.\n  Mr. President, I challenge the supporters of this bill to say what \ngroup, other than the Business Advisory Council and Victor Schwartz, \nwants it. I represent people in business, and I can tell you about the \ncost of it.\n  So the Senator mentions the cost. Then he gets into the amount of \nlawyers. Since we are talking about the lawyers, I should have \ncompleted my thought. Again, it was a lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, who made \nthe Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Roosevelt in the darkest days \nof the Depression, a lawyer, said: ``All we have to fear is fear \nitself.''\n  I was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in December \n1952, Mr. President. We had then the school segregation cases. Brown \nversus Board of Education of Topeka--actually the lead case was Briggs \nversus Chaney. We had John W. Davis, the former Solicitor General, \nargue on behalf of the State. Thurgood Marshall, the lead attorney \narguing not the Kansas case but the Briggs versus Chaney case. I can \nsee Justice Marshall, a lawyer, standing there now talking about \nfreedom and bringing this Congress and the people in this land to equal \njustice under law.\n  ``Get rid of the lawyers,'' they say. I can go to Ralph Nader, I can \ngo to Morris Dees, and all the others. I can go down and then I can \ncome to the 60,000--did you hear the figure?--60,000 registered to \npractice downtown in the District, all on billable hours, hardly any in \na court, all fixing us politicians, $200 an hour, $400 an hour.\n  I have talked to some with ethics charges, and they have gone broke. \nThey have not paid their bills yet. They got rid of the ethics charge, \nbut to go back to all the records, they had to pay lawyers $400 an hour \nto come and just look over the records in the office.\n  The billable hour crowd is behind this bill. That is one group. They \ndo not want to mention it. Lawyers, yeah, they have the Persian rugs, \nmahogany desks, and the drapes. They never worked. The trial lawyers \nhave to convince 12 jurors in their community, all 12--all 12--and have \nto withstand judicial review, as the coffee case did where it was \ncut. They did not get paid anything. The presumption is, on the amount \nto the lawyers, that these injured parties without a lawyer would get \nthe money. That is why they are having a product liability case, \nbecause they are denying payment. They are denying payment.\n\n  But, yes, we had in the committee--I will read about who gets what, \nand that this is just a plaintiff's lawyer--people ought to know about \ndefendants' lawyers and about the billable hours thing. It is \nwonderful. We are talking about the time it takes and the backlog. Who \nis interested in time and backlog? Then there is the insurance company \nlawyer out there on the 20th or 30th floor, and the Persian rugs. He \ncould care less. He gets his money. If the insurer can put the claim \noff and never pay it, at least when they do pay it, it will be in \ninflated dollars. The insurance lawyers are the ones who are asking for \ncontinuances and motions and who call their secretary and tell her to \nput 52 interrogatories in. Then, they get the discovery going. All they \ndo is just sit there and answer the phone and go out to the club and \neat lunch and have their martinis and say how smart they are. And they \nget paid.\n  Plaintiffs' lawyers, the defendants' lawyers. I read from the \ncommittee report:\n\n       According to calculations derived from the survey conducted \n     by the insurance services officer of the Institute for Civil \n     Justice, for every dollar paid to claimants, insurance paid \n     an average of an additional 42 cents in defense costs. While \n     for every dollar awarded to a plaintiff, the plaintiff pays \n     an average contingent fee of 33 cents out of that dollar. \n     Thus, in cases in which plaintiffs prevail, out of each $1.42 \n     in total litigation costs, including damages, about half of \n     that goes to attorney's fees, with the defendant's attorneys \n     on average paid better than the plaintiff's attorneys. Of \n     course, defendant's attorneys are paid regardless of the \n     outcome of the case, while the plaintiff's attorneys are paid \n     only if they win their case; otherwise, they take a loss for \n     the time and expenses they have incurred.\n\n  Mr. President, coming to the Senate, I left a lot of money on the \ntable. I can say that poor person now in the Boland case--this guy had \nbroken down between Georgetown and Charleston. As he went back to get \nthe spare tire out of the trunk, the bus rammed him, dead. The family \ndid not have any money, whatever it was. I said, ``Well, I'll take \nit.'' We spent quite a bit of time and money, won the case, took the \ncase on appeal, trying to chase down to Florida the particular \ndefendants in that case, everything else of that kind. We just had to \nleave that.\n  Plaintiff's attorneys understand that is the cost of doing business. \nOtherwise, how is poor America ever going to be represented? I take my \nhat off to trial lawyers. Heavens above, yes, if they make it, some are \nmaking in these class actions, I guess, healthy amounts. But the \nexperience is otherwise. As we have heard in the hearings and \neverything else like that, the cost is not trial lawyers, the cost is \nbecause of the defense lawyer.\n  The cost of the enactment of this particular so-called conference, \nwhat I call conspiracy, report, is that individual rights would be \nseriously, seriously inhibited. There is not any question about the \nmatter of the studies that we have had. In 1991, the Rand Corp. showed \nthat only 2 percent of product liability cases are ever filed. The \nmajority of the 2 percent are business; 90 percent never get to court.\n  I have already mentioned the Conference Board. The Rand study said \nthat less than 1 percent of corporate America is ever named in a \nparticular lawsuit. Of course, Cornell University's most updated study \nshows that in the decades of the 1980's, coming into the 1990's, there \nhas been a decline of litigation. There used to be what they call, I \nforget now, but they had a panic that they just had a plethora of \nsuits. Actually under the Cornell study the suits have declined 44 \npercent.\n  The States have moved in. They have moved in a responsible fashion. \nAnd here we come--in the State of Arizona, for example, they had a \nreferendum on\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nthis. This bill abolishes the public vote of the people of Arizona. If \nthat is not senatorial arrogance, if that is not congressional \narrogance, if that is not Washington Government at its worst--\neverybody's campaigning on the stump, Republican and Democrat, that we \nare going to get rid of that kind of Washington Government--if that is \nnot it, I do not know what is.\n\n  I could go on, Mr. President, into the matter of the bill itself. The \nvery interesting thing is that they are talking, oh, so reasonable, \nabout how they are struggling and how it works and how they have \nbalance. I hope they do not use that word ``balance'' because I heard \nthat in the caucus yesterday. Balance, my Aunt Edith. This does not \napply to the business of the majority of people bringing product \nliability cases. Oh, no. Hum-mm. No. It does not apply to coming back \non punitive damages and having a separate hearing nor to joint and \nseveral liability. None of this balance talk is about pain and \nsuffering, none of this at all--\n  Oh, look through this obstacle course they have here for the poor, \ninjured party. Not an injured business, no. United Airlines is looking \nat suing the Dallas manufacturer, I take it, of the baggage handler out \nthere in Denver. No. This bill will not apply to them. That is a \ncorporation. No, siree. That military airplane that crashed--oh, boy, I \nthink we have had 31 of those F-14's in a period of a few months or \nyears. We put those planes on line 23 years ago. That last crash \nkilled, I think, two or three people on the ground there in Nashville. \nNo case under this bill. No case because they have been exempted.\n  You have to read this thing. I am proud to stand here and tell the \ntruth and expose this nonsense, this conspiracy, that has taken on, on \nthe one hand, a political poll hot button issue, that is a nonproblem, \nand expose the movement that is in behind it and continues and \ncontinues because who is paid, when they talk about the trial lawyers \nand being bankrolled, who is paid and bankrolling this?\n  So you have two classes of injured parties. If you are a business \ninjured, do not worry. If you are instead an individual who struggles \nbecause you not only have to get the investigation cost, you have to \nget your medical cost, you have to get it all assumed by that rascally \ntrial lawyer, and he is assuming the plat to be made, the diagrams, the \nphotographs and everything else to bring the truth to the 12 men and \nwomen on the jury and suffer all the legal motions and everything else. \nThe trial lawyers are bankrolling injured parties, for an average, I \nwould say, of anywhere from 1\\1/2\\ to 2 years at least on these cases.\n  If they do not prevail with all 12 or with the supreme court of the \nState on appeal, they are goners. They are goners. That has happened \ntime and time again.\n  But you have two classes. There the bill's supporters have been very, \nvery careful to talk about fairness and trying so long. You have two \nclasses of individual parties: the CEO and the fellow who is working in \nthe plant. The CEO makes $5 million. Ask AT I think the CEO got up \nto $16 million. If he comes in and he gets an injury, he can get twice \ntimes the economic damages. So, if he is out for a year, he can get $32 \nmillion in punitive damages.\n  But if the same fellow in the car that is driving with the CEO--if \nthe CEO will give him a ride--that fellow will only get $250,000 in \npunitive damages. Oh, boy, what a fair bill. It is so studied, so nice, \nso pleasant. We have been holding it up because trial lawyers have been \nbankrolling everybody, and everything else of that kind.\n  I wish this crowd would sober up and read this thing. You have the \npoor women. You have two classes there. If you have the breadwinner, \nthe man in the family, he can get all his economic damages and \neverything else, but she can be expecting a baby and lose that baby and \nnever be able to produce a child again, but that is not economic \ndamage, that is pain and suffering. So there is going to be a separate \nhearing there.\n  Mr. President, later, if the time permits, I want to get to the \nuniformity and the global competition that they talk about, because \nwith respect to, say, the State of Washington which does not have \npunitive damages, this law would not apply. To my State of South \nCarolina that does have punitive damages, this law shall apply. They \ncall that uniformity. They call that uniformity.\n  Interstate commerce is a many splendored thing and the lawyers are \nbolixing it up. As for global competition--I have foreign industries \ncoming in like gangbusters. I have been in the game at least 35, nearly \n40 years. This is why I challenged the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina; I know his State; we compete together. We have never had the \nblue chip corporations that we have today--I have Firestone, several \nGE's, I have several DuPont, American industries. Right here in the \nlast 2 or 3 months, we have BMW, we have roller bearings, Hoffmann-La \nRouche, the most wonderful pharmaceutical firm that you have ever seen. \nCompanies from everywhere--Hitachi, in the TV industry.\n  I want to thank publicly the Washington Post for that Outlook article \non Sunday. I have been trying to bring this trade issue to the U.S. \nSenate now--this is the 30th year, this so-called protectionism. \nPresident Ronald Reagan, under section 301, started moving in these \ncases and got voluntary restraint agreements. As a result of the \nvoluntary restraint agreements in things like Sematech--protectionism, \nif you please--we are not only holding on to the old jobs but we are \ngetting new jobs.\n  I remember the Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, when \nthe former Governor said, ``Free trade, free trade. Look at this, BMW \ntaking Senator Dole through its new plant. It was there on account of \nfree trade.'' It was there on account of protectionism. When we got \nvoluntary restraints, that is how we got Honda, how we got Toyota, how \nwe got BMW. Who is kidding whom?\n  When the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens and I, \nput into the defense bill the Buy America provision on roller bearings, \nwe got Koyo and INF up in York County. That is why they are there. \nVoluntary restraint agreements on steel, voluntary restraint agreements \nwith respect to semiconductors, Sematech, Hitachi. You can go down the \nlist, Mr. President. Trial lawyers, protectionism. Competition is what \nAmerica is interested in at this particular moment, not the tort system \nbeing handled by the States, not term limits and all the other fanciful \ngames played in political polls. They want America. They want this \nCongress to get competitive.\n  There is nothing wrong with the industrial work of America. The \nindustrial work of America is the most competitive. What is not \ncompeting is us up here, where we have a failed policy of the cold war \nthat we had to enact trying to keep the alliance together. Now with the \nfall of the wall is the time to build up our economy. Now is the time \nto go forward with the protectionism that we have for the environment \nthat they are trying to get rid of--clean air, clean water, proper \ntrial at the State level.\n  I have to read aloud the seventh amendment because I do not believe \nthey have ever read it. You ought to see what it says. The seventh \namendment to the Constitution:\n\n       In suits at common law, where the value in controversy \n     shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be \n     preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise \n     reexamined in any court of the United States, according to \n     the rules of the common law.\n\n  They have reexamined the amendment in here where they say, ``Mr. \nTrial Judge, do not tell the jury about that $250,000 cap, but if they \ncome in, then you go and you factually proceed in violation of the \nConstitution and come out with your trying of the facts in your \ndecision.'' Come on.\n  They say now they have worked over the many years to pass a product \nliability bill, and the general aviation bill lets manufacturers sell \nairplanes that are working so well. Global competition, we have to get \ninto the global competition. I am going to write a follow-up piece for \npublication. Over half of what is coming in here in imports is American \nmultinational generated. We are competing with ourselves. The \nmultinationals that have lost their country as far as business imports \nare concerned have gone overseas and they are coming back in and the \nforeign entities, foreign governments are coming in here with a \nhistoric chant. It is devastating our economy. Everybody can see it but \nus politicians. Everybody can see it but us politicians.\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\n  It is a given in manufacturing that 30 percent of volume is the cost \nof the employees, the workers; now we call them the associates. It is a \ngiven, further, that you can save as much as 20 percent of sales volume \nby going to a low-wage country in manufacturing.\n  So if you have $5 million in a sales corporation you can keep your \nexecutive office, your sales force, but move your manufacturing \noffshore to a low-wage country and save $100 million, or you can \ncontinue to work your own people and go broke. That is not greedy \ncorporations. That is a stupid Congress that allows that to happen.\n  If I ran a corporation and my competition headed overseas and started \ncutting his costs that much, I am forced to leave. We have a veritable \nhemorrhage of industries leaving. I pointed out that Baxter Medical \nthat I brought here years ago, with 830 workers, has just gone to \nMalaysia. Secretary Reich says, and the Congress says, now what we have \nto do is retraining, retraining, retraining. Come on. I have skilled \ntraining coming out of my ears. We can train them to do anything. We do \nnot need a Federal program. We have BMW without a Federal retraining \nprogram, and all these other industries.\n  But assume they are right and they are retrained into wonderful \ncomputer operators, 830 of them, the next day. The average age is 45. \nDo you think they will hire the 45-year-old computer operator or the \n25-year-old? With the cost of retirement, with the medical costs and \neverything, the answer is obvious.\n  What we are dealing with here is not a cost of doing business. I am \nidentifying our injury. Our injury is the failure to, as Lincoln said, \n``disenthrall'' ourselves from free trade, free trade, free trade. \nThere is no such thing as free trade. In the 1930's, we had reciprocal \ntrade, and tariffs as the instrumentality--protectionism. Everybody \nwants to flatten the income tax--flat tax, flat tax, flat tax, is \nsomething else going on. Well, we lived on tariffs and protectionism \nfrom the beginning of the republic up until 1913. A country, an \neconomic giant, built on protectionism. But they are all running around \nhere like children and hollering, ``Protectionism, protectionism, free \ntrade, free trade. Product liability is such a weight on doing \nbusiness.'' And all of the business statistics, findings, insurance \ncompany results and everything else of that kind show otherwise.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THOMAS). Who yields time?\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Craig \nWilliams, a fellow on the staff of Senator McCain, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the Senate session today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from West Virginia \nsuch time as he may desire.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I am very happy that the Senate, at long last, is \ntaking this bill up. We have been here before; we have been here many \ntimes before. I wish we could have gotten here sooner this year. \nNevertheless, I am glad we are here. I think there is a natural \ntendency in Congress to wait until absolutely the last minute before \nimportant decisions are made, and that is what we are doing again this \ntime. But so be it.\n  I am here to report to my colleagues that the Senate product \nliability bill has maintained the Senate's standard, which is products \nonly. It has to be fair. It cannot include a whole lot of extra things \nthat the Contract With America wanted, or that others wanted, or, \nindeed, that earlier generations within this body tried to add on to \nthis bill. It was always my intention--and it was always the intention \nof the Senator from the State of Washington--to keep this bill \ndisciplined, on products only, not to expand and include all kinds of \nother subjects, so that we could keep faith with our colleagues. I \nbelieve we have done that. All of this is now embodied in H.R. 956, the \ncommonsense product liability legal reform bill.\n  I am enormously proud of the fact that the Senate really does want to \nsee meaningful product liability reform, to fix our broken products \nsystem. Most of those on the other side of the aisle feel that way. \nThere is a merry band of us on our side of the aisle who feel that way, \nand we have for a long time.\n  We can announce to our colleagues that we have done what we promised \nwe would do--hold to the Senate position in virtually every respect, to \npreserve the balanced, reasonable Senate product liability reform \nprovisions that will provide Federal uniformity to the hodgepodge of \nState laws, which deal with product liability today. This will improve \nthe product liability system for consumers and for business alike.\n  There is a feeling sometimes in here that the bill has to either be \njust for consumers or just for business, and that you are over here or \nyou are over here. This bill is trying to reach to both sides. We do \nsome things to help manufacturers, and we do some things to help \nconsumers. That was the point--to make it a balanced system. The \nstatute of limitations is one that occurs to me mightily. California, \nfor example, has a 1-year statute of limitations, and that means, in \nCalifornia, I presume--and I am not a lawyer--that if you are injured \nand wish to sue, you have 1 year within which to do it, and after a \nyear is passed, you cannot sue. I consider that to be anticonsumer, and \nI consider those who are defending the status quo to be defending an \nanticonsumer position, which is, in fact, virulently anticonsumer.\n\n  Our bill says that one has the right to go 2 years after one \ndiscovers, first, that one is injured and, second, what the cause of \nthe injury was, so that one knows who to sue. Now, in an era of drugs \nand toxics--and we are seeing this, for example, in the Persian Gulf \nwar with the so-called mystery illness, which is no mystery to me, but \nwhat seems to be a mystery to the Department of Defense--sometimes it \ntakes 4 or 5 years. Sometimes it takes 15 or 20 years for a toxic or a \ndrug to show up as an injury. So then you know that you are injured.\n  But under our bill, that is not enough. You have to know what the \ncause of the injury was so you know who to sue. Now, that is clearly \nproconsumer, and those who are defending the status quo--that is, those \nwho oppose this legislation--wish heartily to deny consumers that \nwindow to get into the courthouse door. I find that stunning. I find \nthat, in many ways, shocking. I am very proud that we have that in our \nbill.\n  Opponents of this legislation have, I believe--and this has been true \nin the past--used gross distortions and out and out misstatements about \nthis bill to try to suggest that it has been significantly changed from \nthe Senate-passed product liability bill. We are spending our time \nrunning around taking examples, which are patently false, which have \nbeen raised as though they were patently true. That is not a \ndistinguished aspect of Senate life on this bill.\n  The fact is that this report is virtually identical to the Senate \nbill in every single respect--virtually. Senator Gorton and I, in what \nI thought was a rather extraordinary colloquy from the floor, delivered \non our blood oath, in which we both said that if we did not deliver on \nthis promise, we would vote against proceeding to the bill or vote \nagainst the bill; and that was that we promised to delete the provision \nproviding a defendant with a right to a new trial under the \n``additional amount'' provision. That was an issue. We pledged to \nremove it. We did. We also took the House timeframe on the statute of \nrepose. That was the one change that we made, maintaining the Senate \nbill's limited scope, importantly, to durable goods in the workplace.\n  Now, again, some of the distortions being used are that by reducing \nthe statute of repose, which was the only area in which we gave the \nHouse what they wanted--we gave them the 15 years, but we did not give \nthem what they really wanted. They wanted this to include everything, \nnot just durable goods in the workplace. We maintained the Senate \nposition even on that.\n\n  Beyond that, no substantive changes were really made. Technical and \nconforming drafting changes were made, as in any report of this sort. \nBut that is it. That is the sum of the changes from the Senate-passed \nbill, no matter what the opponents of the reform will assert, and will \nassert this day. My colleagues need to know that, and they\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nshould be reassured that this means that the product liability report \nis yet one more opportunity to go on record in support of moderate and \nbeneficial reform of our product liability law.\n  Senator Gorton has gone through, and will continue to go through, a \ndetailed legal analysis for the minor changes that were made, \nconforming changes. He will also rebut--certainly better than I--the \noutrageous claims that are being circulated by the opponents of the \nreform. I heard them in the Democratic caucus yesterday, and I am sure \nI will hear them on the floor today. However, as coauthor of the Senate \nproduct liability bill, I would like to go on record with my own \nanalysis of the opponents' wild claim about the report. It is not in \nlegalese because I am not a lawyer. But it is in English. I want this \nRecord to reflect what is actually in the bill, rather than what the \nother side will, as I have said, continue to misinform Members about \nduring this crucial debate.\n  There is a lot of confusing misinformation being circulated. Here are \nthe facts.\n  Fact No. 1: There is no cap on economic or noneconomic damages--no \ncap on economic or noneconomic damages. Claimants will continue to be \nable to recover whatever they are awarded in a court.\n  Fact No. 2: The statute of repose remains limited to durable goods in \nthe workplace only--only. Statements being made that they now cover all \ngoods are wrong.\n  Fact No. 3: Product sellers, lessors, or renters will not be \nprotected from negligent liability. That is precisely why the negligent \nentrustment exception was moved to the product sellers' section of this \nbill.\n  Fact No. 4: Dow-Corning and other companies who made, or make, breast \nimplants will not be shielded from liability--will not be shielded from \nliability. We went through this last year, and groups, in particular, \nwomen's groups, gave impassioned, very emotional press conferences in \nwhich they said they would be included and that they would be shielded \nby this bill. It was not true last year. It is not true this year. \nWhether or not they supplied the silicon, they remain as liable as any \nother manufacturers who produce a defective product, if they do.\n  Fact No. 5: And this is very important because this involves a \nsubject which has struck a number of people on my side of the aisle \ndeeply, and it has to do with a letter that Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving--obviously an incredibly excellent and wonderful group--have \ncirculated. But we have been trying to reach them to get them to make a \nretraction because they have made a mistake. It is a mistake which has \nbeen persuasive, unfortunately, to at least two Members on our side \nthat I can think of.\n  I repeat, drunk drivers, gun users, et cetera, will not be protected \nfrom liability in any way. Opponents are intentionally trying to \nconfuse harm caused by a product--that is, harm caused by a product \nwhich is covered in the bill--and harm caused by the product's use by a \nperson, or persons, which is not covered in the bill and remains \ntotally subject to existing State law. Specifically, for those inclined \nthat way, section 101(15) and 101(a)(1), definition of ``product \nliability action,'' includes only ``harm caused by a product, not \nuse.'' That is an enormous difference.\n  If I have leased a car and then stopped off at several bars and \nbecome drunk and then cause damage to somebody, I, as a person, can \ncertainly be sued, but the use of the car, if the car is not defective, \nis not actionable under this bill, nor should it be, because this is a \nproducts-only bill. It is the products we are talking about, not the \nuse, or the user.\n\n  Fact No. 6: In all States that permit punitive damages, they will \ncontinue to be available and the additional amount provision--we used \nto call that judge additur, but we now call it additional amount \nprovision--will apply in all those States regardless of whether caps \nare higher or lower in that State.\n  Fact No. 7: Tolling, this was raised in our caucus yesterday; it has \nbeen raised since. Tolling of the statute of limitations will be \ncovered as they are now by applicable State and Federal law. For \nexample, for those so inclined, see 11 U.S. Code 108(c), ``automatic \ntolling in bankruptcy cases.''\n  Nothing in the bill, Mr. President, or omitted from the bill, will \nchange State law on tolling. That is a fact.\n  Fact No. 8: State law will continue to control whether or not \nelectricity, steam, et cetera, is considered a product or not.\n  Fact No. 9: This is not a one-way preemption bill but a mix of State \nand Federal rules, as it ought to be, in a bill which is moderate. \nProducts are in interstate commerce--we have said this over the years \nso many times--70 percent. There was a day when things that were \nmanufactured in California were probably sold in California for the \nmost part. Today, on a national average, 70 percent of all things that \nare manufactured are interstate and are sold outside the borders of \nthat State and thus are in interstate commerce, and they should be \nsubject to more uniform rules for business and consumers.\n  Let me just say again, as I did last year, that the European Economic \nCommunity--which is close to 400 million people and an enormous \ncompetitor for the United States of America economically--all 13 \ncountries have a single product liability law, a uniform product \nliability law--all 13 countries, not provinces within those countries \nbut the whole country.\n  Japan has just adopted a uniform product liability law, a law uniform \nfor the country, but we have 51. We have 51 different laws. For \nexample, in the case of punitive damages, I think about 80 percent of \nall punitive damages come from three States--California, Texas, and \nAlabama. Why is that? Probably because of something called forum \nshopping. Because we have so many different laws--51 different laws--\npeople can simply try to find the place which is most effective for \ntheir particular case, and there they go. So this is not a one-way \npreemption.\n\n  Fact No. 10: On joint and several liability--there has been a lot of \ntalk about that and this is an extremely important issue--30 States \nhave modified joint and several liability at this point. The Federal \nproposal follows the California law affecting only noneconomic damages. \nIt is interesting on this point; the States clearly recognize that \nthere are things they want to change in joint and several liability. \nTwelve States have eliminated joint liability altogether. Two States \nhave eliminated joint liability for noneconomic damages. That is \nCalifornia and Nebraska. Ten States have otherwise limited the \navailability of joint liability as to noneconomic damages or damages \ngenerally, with the result being it is significantly less likely that \nnoneconomic damages would be subject to joint liability. Three States \nhave eliminated joint liability in cases in which the plaintiff is \nnegligent and five States have capped awards of noneconomic damages. In \nall, 30 States have done this, and these include 8 of the 9 largest \nStates in the Nation.\n  For the remainder of my time I wish to remind my colleagues and \nwhoever else might be listening why some of us have wanted so much to \nact on this legislation and to outline the opportunity that this reform \nin fact holds for this country and for our people as consumers and as \nhuman beings.\n  Product liability reform has a very long history in the Congress. \nMembers in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle have been trying \nto reform the product liability rules for over a decade, in fact for \nsubstantially longer than that, and we have done it for the most part \nby working together, Republicans and Democrats. No matter what anyone \nsays to try and hone this issue as truly partisan or divisive, the idea \nof product liability reform is a legislative idea with a complete, \nthorough, aboveboard, open, and honest history of hearings, of markups, \nof floor debate, of cloture votes, and everything and anything else \nthat one could call the way to legislate.\n  Yes, we have been persistent, those of us who want to see this law \nenacted. We have been dogged. We have been focused because we think \nthis country and its people need the change. The status quo is hurting \nAmerican workers, American business, American consumers, and American \ncompetitiveness. When products by definition cross State lines--at \nleast 70 percent of them--it makes no sense, absolutely no sense for \nproduct liability rules to be different in all 50 States, which they \nare--50 different sets of rules. It breeds unpredictability, delay, \nconfusion, and\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nunfairness that hurts everybody, not just businesses being sued but \npeople, too.\n\n  Senator Gorton and I introduced a bill last year, once again to \nreform product liability. And I have to say I have enjoyed enormously a \ntrue partnership in spearheading this effort with Senator Gorton. \nBecause I said everything good I could think of last year and ran out \nof the English language, I can simply thank him once again for his \nlegal acumen, extraordinary integrity, and extraordinary sincerity in \ntrying to enact reform.\n  Different legislation was passed in the House earlier in the year, as \npeople know, and fortunately one part of it was product liability \nreform. In the discussions, many of my colleagues in the House and some \nin the Senate deeply wanted to pursue nonproduct liability legal \nreforms--nonproduct liability legal reforms, all kinds of ideas--making \nit available to all civil torts, putting it on medical malpractice, \nwhich I personally favor but which has no place in a products bill. \nThis is a products bill. The problem was that the Senate did not have \ncompanion legislation to consider or to conference on the House's ideas \nfor malpractice reforms or legal reforms beyond product liability. \nWhile I am not opposed to looking at other kinds of legal reforms, I \nbelieve I owe it to my colleagues to whom I and Senator Gorton and \nothers have made this pledge and to the legislative process to have the \nSenate first take up legislation through the relevant committees and \nthe regular process.\n  The history of product liability reform legislation makes it obvious \nthat it is still a very contentious subject, and I always say to my \ngood friend, Senator Hollings, that I do not like disagreeing with him \non anything, on anything, but I think there is an immensely compelling, \nurgent, and clear-cut case for product liability reform.\n  Senator Gorton and I introduced a bill that is bipartisan, moderate, \nbalanced, and focused as a way to begin fixing the problems in the \nproduct liability system. The report is in essence the same bill with \nimprovements suggested by the administration--I repeat, with \nimprovements suggested by the administration--and others interested in \ngetting responsible product liability enacted into law. Even the \nNational Governors' Association, usually the most insistent that the \njob should be left to the States, which we have seen in Medicaid and \nwelfare reform and many other things, even in these last 10 months, has \nsaid in formal resolutions that ``uniform standards'' are needed in \nproduct liability. They have so said. One of those resolutions was \npassed.\n  In fact, the original task force on product liability--one of the \nmembers was then Governor Bill Clinton, and he was the leading force at \nNGA--had a unanimous report in favor of uniform standards and twice the \nPresident of the United States voted to support that position.\n\n  Last August, the Economic Strategy Institute, the organization headed \nby Clyde Pressler, with whom I believe the Senator from South Carolina \ngenerally agrees, and a voice for tough action on trade and other \nareas, issued a report called--and this is not what I would call the \nbest title I have ever read in my life, but it is called ``Tortuous \nRoad to Product Liability Reform.''\n  To paraphrase, when the institute issued the findings of its recent \nresearch, it said that America's unique approach to product liability \nhas brought enormous and growing costs to the resolution of disputes, \nand the costs are borne by consumers and U.S. business alike.\n  It goes on to say that costs are eating up money that could be spent \non wages, on research and development, on training and other \ninvestments to be competitive with the rest of the world where our \nprincipal economic opponents have adopted uniform product liability \nstandards. The institute's report underscores that product liability \nreform would significantly benefit consumers and business.\n  I think everybody knows that I obviously am disappointed by the \nPresident's recent statements indicating that he intends to veto this \nreport, particularly when the administration issued a statement by the \nPresident on May 4, when the Senate was debating amendments to expand \nour product liability reform bill, that concluded with the final \nparagraph which I think shows how much consensus we have managed to \ndevelop over the years on the point that action on product liability is \nneeded. It said in that statement, ``The administration supports the \nenactment of limited but meaningful product liability reform at the \nFederal level. Any legislation must fairly balance the interests of \nconsumers with those of manufacturers and sellers.''\n  It was this President who just 2 years ago signed legislation \nproviding the American aviation industry and its consumers with \nprovisions very much like what is in the current report for product \nliability reform. That bill, the general aviation bill, thoroughly \ndescribed by Senator Gorton, has helped the small plane industry make a \nmajor comeback since its enactment, and the President when he signed it \nsaid he felt that this would create many, many jobs for Americans. The \nPresident was correct then in arguing for reform, and I hope, hope and \nhope and pray, that he will seize the opportunity of moderate, balanced \nreform that our conference report presents to him now.\n  Mr. President, I believe this conference report is the legislation \nthe President was calling for last May. I truly believe that it is. I \nconsulted with the administration every step of the way during this \nlong process to meet its parameters and those of many of my Democratic \ncolleagues. I felt an obligation to so do. I think and believe that my \ncolleagues know how hard I have fought to stay within these parameters.\n  Now we are voting on the conference report that produces the product \nliability reform the Democrats and Republicans in both Houses have \ntoiled in the vineyards to achieve these many years. At a time when \nAmerica clearly faces threats to our jobs and economic growth across \nthe world, where they do not have the same maze of conflicting laws, we \nshould do everything we can to suit up, not surrender. Consumers should \nnot have to bear the costs of ridiculous delays or be denied the \nbreakthrough drugs or other innovations that the current system scares \noff.\n  So I think this conference report, in concluding, Mr. President, has \nearned the votes of those who support meaningful product liability \nreform in good faith, those who sincerely mean it. The final decision, \nof course, is the President's. He said he is going to veto it. Having \nso said, obviously, he has a chance to hear this debate, to rethink his \nposition, and to change his position itself and, in fact, to sign the \nbill. He could still do that.\n  As I have said, I hope he will take that time and see this vote as a \nreason to reconsider his position.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 25 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 25 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller, I am sure, has \nendeavored to live up to his commitments to not expand the conference \nreport, to the best of his knowledge, but being a nonlawyer, I am \nafraid some of his advisers who are writing it did not explain to him \nthe vast expansion of this report over what the Senate passed before. \nThere are numerous changes, subtle changes in many instances--for \nexample, the changing of the word ``and'' to ``or,'' which greatly \nexpanded the bill.\n  The proponents are referring to the various special interests who \nhave concerns about this legislation. You know to whom they are \nreferring--trial lawyers and advocates on behalf of the American \nconsumer. But there are a lot of other special interests that are \ninvolved, particularly those who have been endeavoring to save money \nand to make a bigger profit. In that category could be many elements of \nbusiness from manufacturers to wholesalers, distributors, retail \nsellers and also including the insurance industry. These can certainly \nbe called special interests.\n  This report's section on punitive damages has, with regard to small \nbusinesses, a provision about ``the lesser amount'' and therefore \nproviding a maximum cap on punitive damages of\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\n$250,000 if a business has less than 25 employees. I doubt if there is \nany company that has 25 employees that does not carry substantial \nexcess liability insurance over and above $250,000. Most businesses \ncarry liability insurance in large amounts, and the relationship of \nemployees to the policy of insurance that is carried, that protects \nthem, is not really germane at all.\n  The conference report is greatly expanded by lowering by 25 percent, \nfrom 20 to 15 years, the statute of repose. For example, the statute of \nrepose will apply to a bridge. Most contractors' negligence and the \ndefects in the production of a bridge do not occur during the first 5 \nyears, 10 years, or even 15 years of a bridge's use. A defect in a part \nor component product of a bridge manifests itself by a bridge \ncollapsing, or giving way after a period of time in excess of 15 years.\n  Under the definition of the term ``products,'' it is anything that is \nused in the construction of a bridge under this bill, and there are \nmany component products that are manufactured for the purpose of \nlasting many, many years.\n  So, as we see in particular mountainous areas where bridges span big \ngaps, or cross between mountains, you will have a real danger after 15 \nyears of a collapse and under the statute of repose of 15 years, an \ninsured person or his estate is outright prohibited from bringing a \nsuit to determine fault. Also, consider that it is 15 years from the \ndate of the delivery to the first purchaser that the statute begins to \nrun. There are many consumer items, products that are delivered to the \nfirst purchaser, which is not the consumer, that may stay on the shelf \n2 or 3 years. What do we have? The statute running even sooner against \nunwary consumers.\n  We should also consider workplace products and their safeguards that \nare supposed to protect innocent workers. What you protect is a person, \na farmer from losing a hand in a corn machine, which harvests corn. Or \nyou can have any type of other situations where there is an absence of \nor defect in safeguards associated with machinery. I have charts to \nshow the various items of where safeguards are left off. Consider a \nplastic injection molding machine or a tractor, manufactured more than \n15 years prior to the accident where a 34-year-old person was killed, \nand where the manufacturer failed to equip it with rollover protection \nsystem. Consider a punch press which lacked guards and safety devices. \nAll of these items illustrate how an innocent person could be adversely \naffected by the 15 year statute of repose contained in this conference \nreport.\n  Then the statute of repose has some language that says ``not caused \nby a toxic material.'' The issue arises in regard to whether or not, \nfor example, asbestos is a toxic harm or toxic material. There are \nvarious and sundry people who would say a position can be taken that \nasbestos is not a toxin or a poison, but that breathing it, is unlike \npoisons like chlorine or benzene. They say that asbestos is simply a \nrock fiber and asbestosis, the most prevalent asbestos-related disease, \nis caused not from toxic interaction between the asbestos fibers and \ncells but, instead, because the needle-like asbestos fibers pierce and \ndestroy air sacs in the lungs.\n  It takes generally 15 or 20 years of exposure to asbestos material \nbefore the disease develops. But under the statute of repose, you do \nnot have a right to bring any suit. You are forever barred from \nbringing a suit after the passage of 15 years from the date of delivery \nto the first purchaser.\n  Now tell me this is fair. This, to me, is a great expansion of the \nconference report from the Senate-passed bill. But let us look at some \nof the other expansions in this report.\n  The report has a change of a slight word about a standard of \nliability other than negligence. For years and years, product liability \nbills have excluded natural gas and electricity, but this report comes \nback from conference with a change in language providing that if \nnatural gas or electricity is subject to a different standard than \nnegligence, then it is subject to all of provisions of this \nlegislation--this is a vast expansion.\n  Now, natural gas and electricity are looked upon, in practically all \nStates, to be highly dangerous and are subject to laws that say that if \nthey are sold, the producer and seller must be held to the highest \nstandard of care in order to protect the public. But the conference \nreport contains an expansion for the first time in about 18 years. Was \nthis merely an inadvertence or was it intended?\n  Natural gas is odorless, and producers have to add a fluid to it for \npeople to smell it in order to detect it. It is generally referred to \nas ``skunk juice.'' But if somebody fails to add it or fails to put the \nproper amount in and a devastating accident occurs, are those in the \nproduction chain allowed to reap the benefits of this legislation's \nprotections, say, as to the caps on punitive damages? Is that not a \ngreat expansion of the conference report? I just wonder how many homes \nare heated with natural gas, and there is a particular case that just \noccurred recently, a Seminole natural gas case out in Texas where there \nwas an explosion and three people were killed and many were injured. \nPunitive damages were awarded by a jury.\n  Obviously, that brought to mind a very crafty, highly intelligent \ndrafter, who now says we can take care of similar situations by a \nlittle sleight of pen and make these type of these cases come within \nthe ambit of the bill. I am sure that the distinguished proponents of \nthis legislation did not realize or never were told about this \nparticular change, but it greatly expands the bill, make no mistake \nabout it.\n  Consider the provision regarding negligent entrustment. There was a \nprovision in the Senate-passed bill that said that the limitations of \nthis bill shall not apply to any suit brought for negligent \nentrustment. The Mothers Against Drunk Driving had insisted that that \nprovision be in the Senate bill. That is where you have the State dram \nshop laws, where liability is provided where tavern or bar owner sells \nwhiskey to a minor or to a drunk who then drives a car under drunken \nconditions and kills an innocent victim. Under the Senate-passed bill, \na defendant was not provided with the limitations of this bill such as \nthe caps on punitive damages. But now a defendant could come within the \nlimitations contained in the conference report. Gun dealers, who have \nbeen subject to negligent entrustment actions on the State level for \nselling guns to known incompetents or criminals, would now benefit from \nthe subtle change between the Senate-passed bill and the conference \nreport which is now before the Senate.\n\n  The negligent entrustment provision was moved from one place in the \nSenate-passed bill to another place in the conference report, and this \nsubtle change allows defendants in negligent entrustment actions to \navail themselves of the limitations in this conference report. The \nMothers Against Drunk Driving are utterly opposed to this report and \nare urging Senators to vote against cloture.\n  Then there is the issue of the statute of limitations of 2 years \nwhere a court orders an injunction, like a company goes into bankruptcy \nand you, therefore, are enjoined by law from filing a product liability \nsuit. Under the bill that was passed by the Senate, that time did not \ncount--the statute of limitations was suspended or tolled. It said that \nthat time did not count on your statute of limitation running of 2 \nyears.\n  But, by sleight of hand, it is removed from the bill and it is no \nlonger there. The President, in his veto message that he sent, points \nthat out. I had read the bill, and I had not discovered that. I went \nback and read it again, and I saw how craftily that had been omitted \nfrom the conference. So, therefore, if your company goes into \nbankruptcy, there is an automatic stay against being able to file a \ncivil suit. Therefore, that provision that gave you protection against \nthe running of time is removed.\n  I mentioned a definition of durable goods, how the adding of a \n``comma'' in the durable goods section now brings in many, many \nhousehold goods--baby cribs, lawn mowers, razors, electric razors that \nare used--any type of thing that has a projected life of 3 years is now \nin it. Before in it, it had to be related to a business. No longer does \nit. But it includes household goods that are there.\n\n  There is another change about remediation relating to Superfund in \nregards to the environment. I am not sure that I understand it, but it \nwas\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nchanged for some reason. The conferees did not make these changes \nunless they are trying to give some sort of protection to some company.\n  Another change to me that was unusual was the conferees changed the \nname of the bill. When the bill was in the Senate and passed the Senate \nit was called the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995. I made a \nspeech about it and said that was the biggest misnomer and pointed out \nthe unfair provisions. For example, business can sue for commercial \nloss, and they are not subject to these provisions. The report exempts \nbusiness in their suits against each other. But they contain provisions \nthat it would apply to individuals, to injured parties. But if you are \nan injured business, you can sue for loss of profits, you can sue and \nare not subject to the bill's limitations.\n  For example, you have a statute of limitations for 2 years here, \nwhile in most States the statute of limitations, under the Uniform \nCommercial Code, is anywhere from 4 to 6 years, just for example. \nBusiness suits are not subject to it. Yet the biggest verdicts that \nhave been rendered relative to punitive damages are business cases. \nPennzoil versus Texaco and so on. But anyway the proponents changed the \nname to the Commonsense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996.\n  I just do not believe that it is common sense or fairness either way. \nI think it is a misnomer. Is it common sense to include governmental \nentities, the Department of Defense, the GSA, and subject them to the \nprovisions of this, but not subject business by allowing them to be \nable to sue for their commercial losses? But does it make common sense \nthat in this time of deficits where we are trying to reduce Government \nspending, to put the Federal Government at a disadvantage as regards \nthis bill?\n  The Department of Defense has helicopters, tanks, trucks, et cetera. \nAlmost all products that the military buys are built with the idea of \nhaving a long life.\n  But does it make common sense, in these days, to have the Government \nsubjected to the statute of repose of 15 years? Does it make sense, in \nthese days of where we are trying to take care of local governments and \nnot to have unfunded mandates, to impose this bill's limitations upon \ngovernmental entities?\n  Does it make sense, common sense, to allow them to not subtract time \nfrom bankruptcy from a statute of limitation? Does it make common sense \nnot to show in a trial in chief that the engineer who designed a \nrailroad bridge was a known alcoholic, and the company knew it, and \nthey still did not take steps to review his works, and a bridge on a \nrailroad collapses? I mean, let us go down the list relative to \ncommonsense matters.\n  But this idea of fairness is a smokescreen for patent unfairness. \nWhen you get movements, say, started, and the questioning of all the \ntrial lawyers, therefore it gives you an opportunity not to just maybe \naddress one issue or two issues, but it addresses all of these issues \nthat you have lost cases on. So therefore you want to protect the \ninsurance company and you start adding and adding.\n  I think there is also the question of fairness where the issue of a \nseparate trial on punitive damages is requested. If a separate trial \nhas been requested, it is automatically granted. But the report says \nyou cannot show the conduct of the defendant which exhibits a \nconscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of others. That is the \nstandard in this report that allows for punitive damages.\n  A claimant cannot show that type of conduct in the trial in chief for \ncompensatory damages--that is the trial for economic nor noneconomic \ndamages. Remember noneconomic damages include pain and suffering that \nmay be caused by conscious, flagrant indifference to one's safety. Is \nthat fair to a person who has been badly disfigured, scarred, or \nsuffered a loss of limb by a product whose manufacturer knew of its \ndefect but refused to take steps to recall the product.\n  I would like to give this illustration of commercial loss. There are \ntwo commercial airplanes, one of them Delta, one of them American. They \ncollide and we will just say here, for a hypothetical viewpoint, the \nAmerican is at fault. The passengers that are killed in any one of them \nare subject to the limitations of this act. But Delta can sue for the \nloss of profits which are not limited and can have a different statute \nof repose or statute of limitations; it can sue with no limit on \npunitive damages for their commercial loss relative to this accident.\n  But the passengers are limited under the provisions of this report. \nIs it fair that businesses have a double standard? If it is good for \nthe goose, it ought to be good for the gander. But why do the \nproponents exclude civil actions for commercial loss? That shows how \none sided this legislation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielded 2 more minutes, if \nthere is no objection. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. If that plane falls on Yankee Stadium, and has killed or \ninjured people--they are bound by the limitations of this act. But the \nowner of Yankee Stadium can sue for the loss of profits due to the \ndestruction of his grandstand. None of the provisions pertain to him.\n  So this is a grossly unfair bill, and it does not make common sense. \nThe conference bill greatly expands the Senate passed bill. It is \nextreme in its provisions. It denies an injured party rights. It is \nparticularly harmful to women in title II's provisions regarding \nbiomaterial suppliers, giving a complete immunity or bar to suit to \nsuch suppliers. I wish I had time to go into all of that, and I urge \nthem to review title II carefully. I urge that my colleagues vote \nagainst cloture on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield such time as the Senator from Connecticut \ndesires.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from the State of \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic supporter of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 956, called the Commonsense Product Liability \nLegal Reform Act of 1996. In this case, it is not just a title. This \nbill is full of common sense. It is reform. This is a moderate bill. It \nis a thoughtful bill. It reflects compromise. It reflects years of \neffort to solve a real problem.\n  Sometimes when we get into the back and forth of the arcane legal \nconcepts involved here, we may lose sight of the fact, as Senator \nGorton pointed out in his excellent opening statement, and Senator \nRockefeller, there is a real problem out there. Our tort system, our \nsystem for compensating those who were injured as a result of other's \nnegligence, has gone off the track. People in this country know there \nis too much litigation. People know that they are not benefiting from \nit. They are actually paying more for it in higher consumer prices and \nlost opportunity for jobs and lost opportunity to use new products that \nrequire some risk. People in this country, businesses, are afraid to \ntake that risk. Why? Because they are worried about being bludgeoned by \na lawsuit, regardless of whether they are negligent or not.\n  I have to tell you when I was attorney general of the State of \nConnecticut, I was involved--and my friend and occupant of the chair \nmay have gone through the same experience--I was at a national meeting \nof the attorneys general. I recall voting for a resolution that spoke \nout against product liability reform. I did not know much about it. We \nwere oriented in a different direction. I started going around the \nState of Connecticut. I made it a practice to visit businesses, \nparticularly small businesses in the State. People out there are the \nheroes. They are out there, day in, day out. They are not making big \nmoney. They took a risk. They are working hard. Maybe they have 10, 20, \n30, 40, 50 people, maybe a few more, in their business.\n  I am interested always in knowing, how did you get started? How did \nyou raise the money to get into it? How are you doing? What can I do to \nhelp you? Over and over again, right there at the top, one, two, or \nthree, ``Do something about all this litigation. We are constantly \nbeing sued, and even though we are not negligent we have to pay so much \nmoney to lawyers.'' Or, ``We get\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\nfrightened because they come after us not just to pay the cost of an \ninjury, medical, lost wages, et cetera, but the intangibles of pain and \nsuffering, or so-called punitive damages which go well beyond the \nspecific injuries suffered. Please help us with this.'' That is how I \ngot into this battle.\n  It seemed to me this was a real problem. There is a real problem out \nthere. The bill that comes out of conference is a real commonsense \nsolution to that problem. It puts some very moderate limits and lines \nand parameters on the existing system. It does not deny an injured \nplaintiff the right to recover any wages lost, any medical expenses; \nindeed, even the so-called noneconomic intangibles of pain and \nsuffering, loss of consortium, et cetera. What it does, basically, is \nto say in the category of punitive damages, punishment, I guess created \nat the outset for probably a good reason, which was to add to this \ncivil justice system some sort of extra punishment to a truly negligent \nproducer of a product, to get that person not to do that anymore. It is \nalmost a kind of criminal penalty; in fact, it is quasi-criminal.\n  What has happened with this presumably well-intentioned concept of \npunitive damages, it has become a club held over the head of \ndefendants, worried that juries may come in with multimillion-dollar \nverdicts. So they settle regardless of whether they are negligent or \nnot. So it is a limitation of the greater of $250,000, no small amount, \nor twice the compensatory damage that is economic and noneconomic as we \nhave talked about--that is the basic limit on punitive damages that \nthis bill provides. Very moderate.\n\n  Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller have spent the 9 months since \nthe Senate passed this bill, saying ``No'' to just about everyone who \nsought to change the bill passed on the Senate floor last May. They \nsaid ``No'' to Democratic Senators; they said, ``No'' to Republican \nSenators, and they said ``No'' to the House conferees.\n  What they have produced is a bill that is remarkably similar to what \nthe Senate passed last year with overwhelming Republican and Democratic \nsupport. Frankly, Mr. President, I do not understand why anyone who \nvoted for this bill last May will not vote for cloture and vote for \nthis bill today when it comes up.\n  Senators Gorton and Rockefeller deserve our thanks, but to speak in \nmuch more tangible terms--they deserve our votes this afternoon to \nbreak this filibuster. They have spent these many months in the \ndisagreeable position of saying ``No'' to so many, specifically so that \nSenators who voted for the Senate bill last May--we understood the \nmargin was not greatly over the 60 votes required to break a \nfilibuster. Again, not 51 for a majority, but 60 to break a filibuster. \nThey kept saying ``No'' so that the 60-plus votes last May would stay \nthere when the conference report came out.\n  I think they have achieved what most people thought, frankly, was \nimpossible in the conference report they brought up, because the House \nyielded to the Senate on almost every proposal, every measure, every \nitem in controversy.\n  What now do our colleagues, Senators Gorton and Rockefeller, face? \nLast-minute concerns, distortions, new arguments. I would not blame \nthese two warriors if they were dispirited. I admire them for not being \nso. Unfortunately, it is what we have come to expect in these debates. \nThe hostile fire keeps coming in from every different direction. It is \nlike having a shot fired; it is defended against; another shot fired on \nanother perimeter; it goes on and on. It is meant to blur over the \nbasic requirement for this bill, and the basic moderation and common \nsense of the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I have a particular interest in title II of this bill, \nthe so-called biomaterials provision. It is almost identical to a bill \nthat I was proud to cosponsor and introduce with our colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, in 1994. We reintroduced it in 1995. Happily, \nthe Commerce Committee incorporated the bill into the conference report \non product liability early last year.\n  Mr. President, among the attacks that have come up here at the last \nminute as we come close to finally doing this after 18 years, now, that \nwe have been working at this. I make reference to the Bible. I hope we \nare not going to have to wander for the 40 years the children of Israel \ndid before they got into the promised land. I am looking at my \ncolleague and dear friend, Senator Gorton, he deserves better than \nthat. Here we are, close to this vote. We look like we have worked out \na very sensible bill and now new crossfire comes in after this proposal \nhas been up for years. I want to answer a few charges raised against \nthe biomaterials provision.\n  In the middle of last week as the final conference report had been \nunder discussion for months, was being completed, we are suddenly \nconfronted with claims that the provision would ``devastate the chances \nfor recovery,'' of claimants in the so-called breast implant cases; \nthat those claimants then presented proposed amendments to fix the \nallegations that there were problems in the bill. Of course, we have \nalso seen some extraordinarily active lobbying on behalf of those \nsuddenly urgent amendments.\n  Since so much confusion and concern seem to have been generated as a \nresult, I want to respond. First, the product liability bill and the \nbiomaterials provision is prospective. It does not go into effect until \nit is enacted.\n  The bill only applies to civil actions filed after it is adopted. It \nwould have, therefore, no effect on the thousands of breast implant \nclaims already filed, pending--no effect. It would have no effect on \nclaims filed in Dow Chemical's bankruptcy proceeding, past or future. \nIt would have no effect, as Senator Rockefeller pointed out earlier, on \nthe capacity of bankruptcy judges and State judges in product liability \ncases, including breast implant cases, to toll the statute of \nlimitations, to stop it from going while the bankruptcy proceeding is \ngoing on. Finally, to the extent that any claims are filed after this \nbill becomes law, it would have no effect on the overwhelming majority \nof those cases, for the following reasons:\n  First, Dow Corning was the originator and largest single manufacturer \nof breast implants. The biomaterials title explicitly preserves the \nliability of manufacturers and sellers of implants like Dow Corning.\n  In other words, if you are claiming to be a supplier but you are \nactually a manufacturer or seller, there is no protection under the \nbill.\n  Second, the provision has no relevance to litigation in which \nclaimants are seeking to impose liability on Dow Chemical and Corning \nCorp., the two corporations that own Dow Corning, since neither was a \nbiomaterial supplier under the title II definition of a supplier. To my \nknowledge, no one has argued that they were biomaterial suppliers.\n  Third, while Dow Corning invented silicone breast implants and was \nthe single largest manufacturer of them, they also sold silicone gel to \nother companies that manufactured breast implants. Those companies, \ngenerally, are the large pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies. \nMany claims have been made against them, and the biomaterials provision \nwill have absolutely no effect on those claims.\n  Now, what if a raw material supplier knew the product might harm the \nperson in whom the medical device was implanted? Will that person be \nlet off? No. Biomaterial suppliers who sell raw materials or components \nthey know are going to hurt somebody will find no protection under the \nbiomaterials provisions of the bill. If the raw material supplier knows \nits material will cause harm, and fails to disclose it, that supplier \ncannot be said to be providing the product described in the contract \nbetween the manufacturer and the supplier because it departed so \nsubstantially from the expectations of the parties. That, too, in the \nlegislation before us, is an exception from the general protection \noffered to suppliers. They are not protected if, in fact, they are \nmanufacturers, if, in fact, they are suppliers, and if they breach the \nspecifications of the contract with the manufacturers or the \ndescription of the product as certified by the FDA. A supplier who \nprovides a product that does not meet contract requirements, or these \nspecifications, is not eligible for protection under the provision.\n  We have tried to construct a liability scheme where suppliers would \nhave some comfort that they would have the opportunity to prove their \ninnocence early in the litigation. The responsibility of ensuring that \na medical device is\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nsafe for the purpose intended should rest with the manufacturer \nresponsible for the design, testing and research of that product, not \nwith the supplier who is supplying a component that, of its own, will \nhave no benefit and cannot be used as an implant for the consumer \ndesiring it.\n  The suppliers have been sued because they are viewed as ``deep \npockets.'' The cases against them have almost always been dismissed \nwithout a finding of any liability. Raw materials suppliers are \ntypically supplying generic products with a lot of different uses. I \nwill get into what happened in the field that has generated a need for \nthis provision in a moment.\n  So let me repeat, Mr. President, that this provision will not \npreclude present or future breast implant claims filed against these \ncompanies. They remain available to satisfy judgments.\n  Plaintiffs will likely argue that Dow Corning, for instance, was so \ninvolved in the creation of the product originally to be a manufacturer \nin all instances, or they violated applicable contractual requirements \nor specifications by supplying silicone gel that ``did not constitute \nthe product described in the contract'' because it departed so \nsubstantially from the expectations of the parties. Those arguments are \nconsistent with title II, and they will be in order if this bill is \nenacted into law.\n\n  Remember what I said earlier, that the major difference here, even in \nan extreme biomaterials case, is that the arguments by the suppliers to \nget out of a case because they are innocent will be able to be made \nearlier in the litigation. Under our current system, these innocent raw \nmaterial component suppliers who have supplied small amounts of \nmaterial and have not been involved in design, testing, or manufacture \nof medical devices, fear the cost of being kept in these lawsuits for \nyears more than they fear the judgments, because they know they are \ninnocent. We have found very little evidence that such raw materials \nsuppliers are ultimately ever found liable in these cases.\n  So why the provision in the first place? This, again, is why I say \nthis bill is not just an exercise in legal theory; it responds to a \nvery real crisis out there in the real world.\n  Title II, the biomaterials provision, is a response to what I would \ncall a genuine public health crisis. It is there to end a frightening, \nartificially caused biomaterials shortage that doctors, patients, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the American College of Cardiology, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and other major medical societies, scientific \norganizations, and patient and consumer groups have all pleaded with \nCongress to solve.\n  What is the cause of this artificial shortage of biomaterials, the \nstuff that you need to make the devices I am going to describe? It is \nnot because we are running out of those materials. It is because the \nfear of litigation by the suppliers, who make very little money in \nsupplying the raw materials and component parts for these extraordinary \ndevices, far outweighs any benefit they can incur by selling these \ndevices. It is just not worth it to them. But it is worth it to the 8 \nmillion people whose lives are either being sustained or made normal by \nthe miraculous array of medical devices that technology makes possible \ntoday.\n  What are we talking about? Pacemakers, hip and knee joints, \nhydrocephalic shunts for children, balloon angioplasty catheters, \ndefibrillators, vascular grafts, and even, in some cases, sutures used \nin common surgery. We all know people whose lives are either being \nsustained or made better by these unbelievable devices. Fifty years \nago, who would have guessed that life could be sustained by these \ndevices? The fact is--and we have heard testimony before committees of \nCongress--that the people who make these devices obviously need raw \nmaterials to make them. They need resins, plastics, rubber, and other \ncomponent parts. And the suppliers either have cut back or have given \nthem a warning they are about to do it by a date certain. The most \nrecent date is January 1, 1997, next January, because they cannot \nafford the millions of dollars that they have to pay to defend lawsuits \nfor supplying a nickel's worth, a dime's worth, or a quarter's worth of \nplastic resin or rubber.\n  The problem is not a genuine shortage. It is an unnatural shortage \ncaused by a system of litigation that has gone wild. The economics of \nthe decision that these raw materials suppliers make are unfortunately \nunderstandable because of the small amount of money that they make on \nthese devices. The fact is that since 1994 12 raw material suppliers, \nincluding three major chemical companies, have decided to simply stop \nselling to medical device manufacturers. The medical device \nmanufacturers are scrambling to find substitute products but sometimes \nthey are simply not available.\n  If you doubt whether this is a crisis just check the congressional \ntestimony. Listen to the father of the young man--boy--who passed out \nbecause he had water on the brain. They put in a hydrocephalus shunt \nthat takes the water out of the brain. The child was living a normal \nlife. He actually came and testified before one committee hearing which \nI had. He is a wonderful looking young man, and very active. \nPeriodically they have to replace that shunt. And, if there is not the \nraw materials to do that, this young boy faces a tragedy, and his \nfamily with him.\n  It is worth noting that the administration in the statement of policy \nissued by the President over the weekend opposing the product liability \nbill singled out the biomaterials provision for praise and acknowledged \nthe importance of ensuring that ``biomaterials suppliers will continue \nto provide sufficient quantities of their products to medical device \nmanufacturers.''\n  Contrary to what some of our colleagues I am afraid may have heard in \nthe last week or so from those opposed to this bill, this provision is \nnot a trick nor a ruse to protect bad suppliers from legitimate claims. \nThis is an effort to respond to a genuine public health crisis, one \nthat is well documented, and, as I say, acknowledged by the \nadministration in its praise, in its statement of policy.\n  The biomaterials provision does nothing to reduce the liability of \nmanufacturers, or other responsible parties but consistent with the \nfundamental and fair premise of this legislation--this conference \nreport--it places responsibility where it ought to be--on those who do \nwrong, and protects from unnecessary harassment and enormous cost those \nwho have done no wrong.\n  Mr. President, this bill actually in that sense so fundamentally \nrelates to the broader questions of values in our society and the fear \nthat people often have that our legal system has gone astray, that \nthose who do wrong are not punished and too often those who have done \nno wrong suffer. We most often hear that cry about the criminal justice \nsystem. But it has unfortunately become true in our civil justice \nsystem as well. The guilty parties do not pay enough. The innocent \nparties pay too much. And all of us end up paying, and the price we pay \nfor consumer goods and lost jobs are paying for this irrational a \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, that is what this bill is all about. There are those \nwho oppose the bill who describe it in ``either/or'' terms. Either you \nare probusiness or proconsumer. You are either proinnovation or \nprosafety. That rhetoric misses the point--preventing us from dealing \nwith the central issue. The fact is that this bill is probusiness and \nproconsumer. It is proinnovation and prosafety. It is aimed at putting \nliability back where it should be--on the parties who are actually \nresponsible for any harm and so are best able to prevent injury.\n  It is aimed at protecting the defendants from being frightened by \nlawyers and lawsuits into paying legal fees and settlement costs when \nthey are in fact not responsible for any harm.\n  All of that contributes to the cynicism and mistrust of our legal \nsystem which is so fundamentally corrosive to the way we live in our \ncountry, and so costly to our society.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of raw material \nsuppliers and their action withdrawing various products from the market \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\n\n\n                                     SUPPLIER WITHDRAWAL AS OF DECEMBER 1995                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Supplier                   Raw material               Withdrawal date             Device affected  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAllied Signal Chemicals..........

Mr. President, I did not always support a national \napproach to product liability reform and I can well understand the \nhesitancy, particularly of newer Members, to support Federal \ninvolvement in what traditionally has been the province of state law. \nIn fact, as attorney general of Connecticut and a member of the \nNational Association of Attorneys General, I voted for resolutions \nopposing earlier Federal product liability legislation that would have \nswept away virtually all State product liability laws and repealed the \ndoctrine of strict liability for product defects.\n  But as I traveled around the State of Connecticut, this problem--\nproduct liability litigation--kept coming up in my discussions with \nsmall business men and women, with small and large manufacturing \ncompanies, and with plant managers. They told me of problems they had \nexperienced with the product liability system, of the expense of \ndefending yourself even when you win, of the cost of settlements to \navoid paying litigation costs, and of the time and energy that product \nliability suits diverted away from the business of designing new \nproducts and bringing them to market.\n  At a time when we need to be rebuilding our country's manufacturing \nbase, to be promoting innovation in our manufacturing sector, to be \ndesigning, building, and bringing to market the next generation of \nhigh-quality, high-value added products the world will need, our \nliability system chills innovation.\n  The debate should really center around consumers, because it is \nconsumers who suffer because of this system, not simply businesses. \nConsumers are the ones who have to pay higher prices in order to cover \nproduct-liability-related costs. If a ladder costs 20 percent more \nbecause of liability-related costs, consumers--not businesses--end up \npaying that 20 percent premium.\n  The best interests of consumers as a whole are not always identical \nto the interests of people who are seeking compensation. The people who \nsuffer or die because a new drug or medical device was never developed, \nor was delayed in its development, are hurt as surely as those who \nsuffer because a device malfunctioned or a drug was improperly \ndesigned. These silent victims of our product liability system's \nchilling effect on innovation are consumers whose interests also \ndeserve protection.\n  Of course, even for its intended beneficiaries, people who are \ninjured by defective products, the legal system hardly can be said to \nwork well. GAO, in its 5-State survey, found that product liability \ncases took an average of 2\\1/2\\ years just to reach trial. If the case \nwas appealed, it took, on average, another year to resolve. This is a \nvery long time for an injured person to wait for compensation.\n  In some instances, too, our product liability laws have erected \nbarriers to suit that just do not make sense. For example, in some \nStates, the statute of limitations--the time within which a lawsuit can \nbe brought--begins to run even though the injured person did not know \nthey were injured and could not have known that the product was the \ncause. In those States, the time in which to bring a suit can expire \nbefore the claimant knows or could ever know there is a suit to bring.\n  Mr. President, no one will argue that this bill will cure all the \nills in our product liability system. That would require a gargantuan \noverhaul and we are not likely to reach reach agreement in the near \nfuture as to what that would look like.\n  I make no secret of the fact that I would have preferred a broader \nbill. Product liability cases are only a part of the problems in our \ncivil justice system. I have very real concerns that when we fix some \nof the problems there, some lawyers will just target nonmanufacturing \nclients, like financial service providers, municipalities, nonprofit \norganizations. I would have preferred a bill that covered much more, \nbut clearly that was not to be.\n  By working incrementally to eliminate the worst aspects of our \ncurrent system with respect to product liability, perhaps we can begin \nto create a record that will allow us to restore some balance to our \ntort system overall. The enactment of the Federal General Aviation \nRevitalization Act of 1994 has demonstrated that reform does not mean \nthat injured people will go uncompensated and bad actors unpunished, \nbut that reform means more jobs and safer aircraft. I hope we will have \nthe same chance to build the same foundation for more reform with this \nmodest, balanced product liability bill.\n  For people injured by defective products, this bill makes a set of \nvery important and beneficial changes. First, it enacts uniform, \nnationwide statute of limitations of 2 years from the date the claimant \nknew or should have discovered both the fact he or she was injured and \nthe cause of the injury. Injured people will no longer lose the right \nto sue before they knew both that they were hurt and that a specific \nproduct caused their injury.\n  Second, this bill will force defendants to enter alternative dispute \nresolution processes which can resolve a case in months rather than \nyears. If the defendant unreasonably refuses to enter into ADR, it can \nbe liable for all of claimant's costs and attorney's fees. On the other \nhand, if a plaintiff unreasonably refuses to enter ADR, they will \nsuffer no penalty.\n\n  For workers who face possible injury in the workplace, this bill will \nreform the product liability system to give employers a stronger \nincentive to provide a safe workplace. Under current law, an employer \nis often permitted to recoup the entire amount of workers compensation \nbenefits paid to an employee who was injured by a defective machine, \neven if the employer contributed significantly to the injury by, for \nexample, running the machine at excessive speeds or removing safety \nequipment. This essentially means that an employer can end up paying \nnothing despite the fact that their misconduct was a significant cause \nof the injury.\n  This bill would change this. When an employer is found, by clear and \nconvincing evidence, to be partly responsible for an injury, the \nemployer loses recoupment in proportion to its contribution to the \ninjury. This does not change the amount of money going to the injured \nperson, but it makes the employer responsible for its conduct.\n  Manufacturers of durable goods--goods with life expectancy over 3 \nyears that are used in the workplace--will also be assured that they \ncannot be sued more than 20 years after they deliver a product. This \nwill bring an end to suits such as the one in which Otis Elevator was \nsued over a 75-year-old elevator that had been modified and\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nmaintained by a number of different owners and repair persons through \nthe decades. By the way, this same provision will not apply to \nhousehold goods such as refrigerators, and is only intended to cover \nthose workplace injuries that are already covered by workers \ncompensation.\n  Manufacturers will also have some protection against deep pocket \nliability. While the bill still permits States to hold all defendants \njointly liable for economic damages such as lost wages, foregone future \nearnings, past and future medical bills, and cost of replacement \nservices, noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering will be \napportioned among codefendants on the basis of each defendant's \ncontribution to the harm.\n  For wholesalers and retailers, they will, in the majority of cases, \nbe relieved of the threat that they can be held liable for the actions \nof others. Under current law, for example, the owner of the corner \nhardware store could be sued for injuries resulting from a power saw \njust as if she was the manufacturer of a power saw, even if she had no \ninput in the design or assembly of the power saw and had done nothing \nother than to inspect a sample to make sure there were no obvious flaws \nand to put the items on the shelf.\n  For our American economy and industrial base, passage of this product \nliability reform legislation will move us back to promoting innovation \nand the development and commercialization of new products. Passing this \nbill will create and save jobs here, not overseas.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that I believe this bill can be a \nwin-win situation. It provides real balance. It balances the scales of \njustice to ensure that the victims of defective products will continue \nto be compensated while consumers receive the best products available. \nIt is incremental reform. Frankly, it is a lot less than I had hoped \nfor and that I voted for. But I think it is incremental because it is \nhoped that is the way to begin the road to genuine legal reform in our \ncountry.\n  In this debate today, we hear a lot of charges, countercharges, and \nattacks coming from every which direction as we come close to the vote. \nOne thing should not be lost. This bill does not absolve a company that \nhas not made a safe product. If a company has made a defective product, \nit will and must be held fully accountable, period. But when a company \ndoes follow the rules and makes a safe product, it should not have to \nsettle frivolous claims simply to avoid the expense of litigation and \nprotect against the risk that a huge and irrational judgment will be \nawarded against it.\n  Mr. President, once again I thank my colleagues, Senators Gorton and \nRockefeller, who have really been extraordinarily able and honorable in \nthis task.\n  I honestly believe that what is on the line here today in this vote \nis not just the fate of this product liability bill, but it is a \nbroader question of whether this Congress is able to function on a \nbipartisan basis and get something done to respond to a real problem as \nwe have described out in society.\n  The critics who say--I hear this all the time when I go home--``Why \nare you folks all so political? Why don't you get together and get \nsomething done, and respond to some real problems? Why don't you \ncompromise?'' A compromise is not just to reward the people who send us \nhere to serve them. Compromise is getting something done.\n  Senators Gorton and Rockefeller--Republican and Democrat working hard \nfor years now but particularly the last year and 3 months--bipartisan, \nand willing to accept compromise, get the bill past the hurdle of \nbreaking a filibuster here in the Senate with over 60 votes, get it \npassed, take it to the conference committee, again compromise, get \nsomething done to start us down the road to a response, to a real \nproblem, and now we are faced with these last-minute attacks and a \nthreat of a veto by the President.\n  I think what is on the line here is whether, with all the procedural \nintricacies at work, we can produce. I hope that the answer is yes. I \nhope that we will vote this afternoon to break the filibuster, that we \nwill then tomorrow pass this bill and that President Clinton will then \nreconsider his decision to veto it.\n  This is a moment of opportunity. It is a moment of test for this \ninstitution, and it may not come again in this way for quite a long \ntime.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut would also include me in his thanks but, of course, not \nbeing in the conference and not making any contribution I am not due \nany thanks at all. We just could not participate.\n  I was rather interested to hear for the first time that the House \ngave in on all of these things because we never conferred on any House \ngiving into anything.\n  Just highlighting, of course, the nature of this endeavor, the fact \nis this Senator spoke and shepherded over a 3-year period a \ncommunications bill that passed this Senate on a bipartisan vote of 91 \nSenators. So I know how to work in a bipartisan fashion. But this thing \nis a hijacking, if I have ever participated in one.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank very much the \nsenior ranking member of the committee for yielding, and for the work \nhe has put in over the years on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the legislation for a number \nof reasons but principally because it is bad policy. It is bad public \npolicy. And, second, it is not necessary. It is not needed. There are \nsome who have argued that there is a rash of product liability suits \nand everybody who makes a product in America is just about on the verge \nof not making products anymore because they fear they may get sued if \nthey make bad products that injure people, whether they do it with \ngross negligence, or it is just the egregious nature of what they are \ndoing; but they may get sued and put people out of business.\n  The facts are just the opposite, and that is one of the issues I wish \nto focus on, plus the punitive damages question.\n  First of all, is there so much litigation out there that companies \nare not producing products? No. The legislation is trying to fix a \nproblem that does not exist. Product liability cases account for only 4 \npercent of all of the injury cases that are filed in this country--4 \npercent. Only 4 percent of the cases dealt with defective products. \nThere is not an explosion of product liability cases.\n  Then if you look at the statistics, out of 762,000 civil cases \nresolved in the Nation's 75 most populous counties in the whole country \nin 1991 and 1992, only 360 cases out of 762,000 cases dealt with \ndefective products. Is there an explosion of litigation from products? \nI think the facts are just the opposite.\n  Something else. In all of those 360 product cases, do you know how \nmany had punitive damages awarded? Three. Three. And yet the principal \nfocus of this legislation that is before the Senate is that we have to \npass this legislation because the country is in chaos because of \nproduct liability suits, when the truth is that only 4 percent of all \nof the civil cases filed are product liability cases.\n  The second point I wish to focus on is this part of the bill that \nsays Washington knows best. Our Republican colleagues want to block \ngrant just about everything in Washington to the States and let them \ndecide--Medicaid, welfare, you name it. ``Give it to the States; \nWashington does not know what it is talking about'' is the statement \nthat I hear from my colleagues on this side of the aisle except when it \ncomes to this legislation, it is just the opposite. Their position on \nthis legislation is that the States do not know anything, that the \nStates are messing it up so bad that we are going to have Washington \ndecide what is the appropriate remedy for people in the various States \nwho are injured by defective products back in their States. Welfare, we \nare going to do it in the States; Medicaid, we are going to do it in \nthe States, but when it comes to product liability we are going to do \nit here in Washington.\n  This legislation says that no matter how egregious the actions of a \nperson or a company that makes a product, the cap on damages, punitive \ndamages is $250,000. My friend from Connecticut\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\nsaid that is really a lot. Let me give you an example of the problem. \nThe $250,000 figure is out of the air. It is something that they just \npicked up. It has no basis in fact. This legislation says that if a \nperson is going to be entitled to punitive damages against a company \nfor the most egregious type of behavior that we have ever heard of, the \ncap is going to be $250,000 or two times the economic damages.\n  The courts have said that unlike damages which are awarded to \ncompensate an individual for his injuries, punitive damages are unique \nbecause they are based on an entirely different public policy \nconsideration, that of punishing the wrongdoer to change that \nwrongdoer's behavior, and, second, to set an example to others that you \nshould not do that type of behavior. Punitive damages are generally \nawarded for egregious, morally repugnant conduct, conduct that is so \noffensive to the average American that we say that person who has done \nthis should not do it again. We have to make an example of this type of \nmorally repugnant behavior so that others who may think about doing it \nwill not do it again.\n  That is what punitive damages is all about. And that is on what this \nbill arbitrarily sets a cap of $250,000. Let me tell you what is wrong \nwith that, why it is not based on anything.\n\n  Say you have a person, I call him Joe Six-Pack in this case, and Joe \nSix-Pack is just as mean and ornery a fellow as you ever want to meet. \nAnd one day Joe Six-Pack is walking down the street in his hometown and \na guy is coming in the opposite direction, and when he gets next to \nJoe, Joe just hauls off and knocks the ever-living everything out of \nthe guy because he did not like the way he looked. He smashes his fist \ninto the guy's face, and he breaks his cranial bones, permanently \ndisfigures him and sends him to the hospital. They have to do surgery \nto reconstruct this individual's face.\n  The individual, after he finally recovers, says, ``I am going to sue \nJoe. I want him to pay for my suffering, my hospital bills.'' And the \ncourt says he is right; that was repugnant, morally offensive behavior. \nWe are also going to assess punitive damages because we do not want \nthis to happen again. So how much is the right amount? OK, they take a \nlook at what Joe Six-Pack is worth. Say Joe Six-Pack is worth $10,000. \nThat is the savings, the money he has. If the court says we are going \nto fine him maybe half a percent of his assets, that is a $50 fine.\n  Does anybody think a $50 fine is going to change Joe Six-Pack's \nbehavior? Is that enough to tell Joe that he should not do that again? \nProbably not. The court could say, ``Well, let's fine Joe 1 percent of \nhis assets.'' Is that enough to change Joe's behavior and set an \nexample for others they should not do it? That is a $100 fine. I doubt \nwhether that really will affect Joe's behavior. He may do it again just \nbecause he is an ornery fellow or he does not care.\n  The court may say, ``Well, maybe punitive damages are 5 percent. \nLet's fine him $500.'' Is that enough to change Joe's behavior? \nProbably getting close. Probably he will think a second time before he \nwalks up to the next person and smashes him in the face if he knows the \ncourt said, ``Joe, that's morally repugnant behavior. You are fined \n$500.'' Joe is going to say, ``I don't think I am going to do that \nagain.''\n  So let us take another example. How about a Corp. Let us call it XYZ \nCorp. It is a small Corp., with only $50 million of assets. And I say \nsmall because of the Fortune 500, the number 500 company on the Fortune \n500 list has assets of $4 billion. So XYZ Corp. with $50 million of \nassets is pretty small.\n  Let us assume XYZ Corp. starts making a product. Let us say they make \npajamas for children, and when they make those pajamas for children \ntheir engineers say, ``Mr. CEO, we just found out that these pajamas \nthat you make for children are flammable; these pajamas catch on fire \nvery easily, and we are making them for children. We could fix that by \nadding this retardant chemical to it so it will not catch on fire.'' \nThe president and the board says, ``Forget it; we have this whole \nwarehouse full of them. We are going to sell them. We don't care; we'll \ntake our chances.''\n  XYZ Corp. starts selling their pajamas all over the United States, \nand, lo and behold, the inevitable happens; a child catches on fire \nwalking in front of the fireplace, is horribly burned and disfigured \nfor life. The engineers come back to the chairman and the board and \nsay, ``Look, we told you that was going to happen. This is our study. \nWe saw it. It's flammable. Let's change it.''\n  The president and the board say, ``No way. We still have half a \nwarehouse full of pajamas. We are going to sell the rest of them. We \ndon't care. We don't think it's going to happen again. We don't care \nwhat your studies say. Forget them. File them away.''\n  Sure enough, a second child who is wearing the same pajamas catches \non fire in front of a fireplace, is horribly disfigured and burned, \nwith economic damages, pain and suffering, disfigured for the rest of \nthat person's life, and they file suit against XYZ Corp. The court \nsays, ``Your behavior is morally repugnant to this country. Your \nbehavior is indefensible. Your behavior needs to be punished. How much \nshould we punish XYZ Corp.?''\n  Well, if we said half a percent was not enough to affect Joe Six-Pack \nbecause it would only be $50 of his assets, a half a percent of XYZ \nCorp. would be $250,000. That is the cap in this bill. That is the cap \nin this bill. And if we said that that was not enough to affect Joe \nSix-Pack's behavior, a $50 fine, why should the same percentage be \nenough to change XYZ Corp.'s position in manufacturing defective \nproducts that they know are defective?\n  We said that a 1-percent fine of $100 was not enough to affect old \nJoe. Joe was still going to do whatever Joe was wanting to do, smashing \npeople in the face. It was not enough to change his behavior. How about \na 1-percent fine for the XYZ Corp.? That is $500,000. We said it would \nnot have an effect, but it is also twice the cap in this bill. We \ncannot even do that under this legislation.\n  So we say 5 percent was probably getting pretty close to affect Joe's \nbehavior. That is what, $500. That probably changes his mind about his \nsocial behavior and society. How about XYZ Corp.? A 5-percent fine is \n$2.5 million. But forget it when this legislation is passed, because \nsomebody in Washington has decided that $250,000 is the magical number.\n  Let me show you something. The No. 500 corporation on the Fortune 500 \nlist in this country has assets of $4 billion. If this cap is in place \nand they make a defective product and they are fined the maximum of \n$250,000, do you know what percentage of their assets that turns out to \nbe? That is .00625 percent. Does anybody think that a maximum fine that \nis .00625 percent of that corporation's assets is going to have any \neffect on their social behavior? I bet they do not even consider it. It \nis a dot on their asset sheet.\n  So, if we get back to the point that punitive damages is to tell a \nreckless defendant, who has had a jury say that this is morally \nrepugnant behavior, if we tell them that from here on out, Congress in \nWashington, in our wisdom, has decided that the maximum fine is \n$250,000 and it has no relationship to the ability of a defendant to \npay, we are making a serious public policy mistake. We should, I think, \nbe ashamed of this legislation with this type of cap. I am. The States, \nI think, are doing a good job. It is not a problem. In addition to not \nbeing a problem, this arbitrary proposal makes no sense.\n  You wonder why a lot of the very big businesses think it is a great \nidea? It is because a cap of that small amount is such a small \npercentage of their assets, they can continue to make those pajamas. \nThey can continue to say, ``We are not going to listen to our engineers \nwho have told us it is flammable. We are not going to listen to our \nengineers who told us that children can catch on fire wearing this \nproduct and the only thing we have to do to fix it is to add a fire \nretardant ingredient. Do you know what? We are not going to do it \nbecause we still have that warehouse full of pajamas and we are going \nto keep selling them.''\n  How many young kids would be in danger? That is just one example. \nThere are literally hundreds of them.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude simply by saying this legislation is \nnot necessary, it is not needed, there is not a problem. In addition to \nthat, it is a bad public policy statement.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a historic day. For more than a \ndecade we have tried to pass product liability reform. In every \nCongress, until this Congress, the opponents of reform have mounted \nsuccessful filibusters. But this year we broke through the filibuster, \nand the Senate passed a modest bill. Now, the conference report is \nbefore us, and we must again break a filibuster.\n  The American people are frustrated with the legal system. Cases take \ntoo long to resolve and too many injured don't get fairly compensated, \nwhile a few win the lawsuit lottery.\n  Litigation drains billions from our economy, adding a tort tax to \ngoods and services. For example, the average price of an 8-foot ladder \nis $119.33, but the actual cost is less than $95.00, with the \nlitigation tax responsible for a 25-percent increase in the cost. \nLawsuits drive the price of a heart pacemaker up 20 percent, from \n$15,000 to $18,000.\n  If we don't fix the problems of our legal system, consumers will have \nfewer choices and American companies will have a smaller share of the \nglobal market.\n  This bill is a significant, although imperfect, step in the right \ndirection. But before I mention what the bill does, let me explain what \nthe bill doesn't do. The opponents have scared many into believing that \nthis bill cuts off the right to sue for injuries. But it doesn't. Those \nwho are injured by defective products will be able to sue and recover \nall of their losses--their lost wages, all medical bills, any costs for \nhome assistance, and even so-called pain and suffering damages.\n  This bill does not close the courthouse door to any injured party. \nSo, there will be no horror stories as predicted by the opponents, of \nthose injured by cars, household appliances, or workplace machinery \nshut out of the legal system. It's simply not true.\n  The bill does contain a modest limitation on punitive damages, which \nare supposed to punish the responsible party, not be a windfall for the \ninjured party. Punitive damages are limited to the greater of $250,000 \nor two times compensatory damages. But this bill contains no limitation \non economic damages or pain and suffering damages.\n  The bill also provides some limited protection to those who have \nnothing to do with the defect in the product, but who sometimes get \nstuck with the tab in a lawsuit. An injured will be able to recover \nfrom those who are responsible for the defects in the products--the \nmanufacturers, and not the sellers who simply put the merchandise on a \nshelf or in a showroom. And, if the injured party can't find the \nmanufacturer, or if the manufacturer can't be sued, or if a damage \naward can't be collected from a manufacturer, then a product seller \nwill be responsible. So, injured parties will always be fully \ncompensated for their injuries. The opponents of this bill are only \nscaring and deceiving consumers when they claim this bill will cutoff \nthe ability of injured persons to recover.\n  And, this bill make a necessary change in the assessment of pain and \nsuffering damages against multiple defendants. Each defendant will only \nbe responsible for its proportionate share of noneconomic losses. This \nwill, hopefully, discourage suing someone who is only remotely \nconnected to the defective product on the basis of that defendant's \ndeep pockets.\n\n  Mr. President, the time for this bill is long overdue. The problems \nof our legal system--long delays, inefficiency and unpredictability in \ngetting compensation to those injured--are only getting worse. And that \nmeans more burdens on productivity and invention in our economy.\n  I regret that the President has announced his intention to veto this \nbill, based upon false assumptions about the bill. As I've already \nsaid, the bill won't prevent injured from recovering; it won't limit \nthe recovery of damages that compensate victims for their injuries. The \nPresident's assertions to the contrary just simply aren't true.\n  Survey after survey and poll after polls show that the American \npeople are frustrated by our legal system and particularly dissatisfied \nwith the legal profession. Those lawyers who misstate the facts about \nthis bill in an effort to scare the public do their profession a \ndisservice. Not only does this bill protect the injured party's right \nto compensation, but it would also restore some public confidence in \nlawyers and the legal system. It is unfortunate there's a failure to \nunderstand this fact at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I urge my colleague to vote for this conference report. Let the \nAmerican people know that this Congress wants to improve the legal \nsystem and protect the injured consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose this conference report for a \nnumber of reasons. One of the principal ones is the fact that it does \nnot provide uniformity when it comes to product liability.\n  The statement of the managers says that one of its purposes--this is \non page 3--``* * * is to establish certain uniform legal principles of \nproduct liability.'' Its sponsors on the floor have said the same \nthing, that it is aimed at providing uniformity when it comes to rules \ngoverning product liability. But, unfortunately, this bill fails to \nlive up to its own statement of purposes. Indeed, it violates its own \nstatement of purposes because there is no uniformity that is provided \nin this bill. There is no fair balance among the interests of product \nusers, manufacturers, and product sellers.\n  This bill has what perhaps could be called a one-way preemption \napproach. Under this approach, States are allowed to adopt laws that \ndiffer from the so-called uniform standards, providing that States are \nmore restrictive on the rights of injured parties. But, if States seek \nto be less restrictive on the rights of injured parties, they are then \nprevented from doing so. This is not uniformity. This is not a bill \nwhich says that we are going to have a 15-year statute of repose, that \nis it, that is what injured plaintiffs have, that is what defendants \ncan count on. That would be a uniform standard. This bill does \nsomething very, very different from that.\n  This bill says that if a State wants to be more restrictive than the \nprovisions of this bill, more restrictive in terms of the ability of \nplaintiffs who are injured persons to recover, that they are allowed to \ndo so. It is only if a State decides they want to be less restrictive \non the rights of injured parties that they are prevented from doing so, \nthat they are preempted from doing so. That is not uniformity. That is \na one-way street. That is preemption of the rights of injured parties.\n  I want to go through some of the language in these titles to make \nthis point clearer, to make the point that we are not going to have one \nlaw that governs all the States. We are not going to eliminate the \npatchwork of product liability laws. We are still going to have a \npatchwork. We are still going to have States that are more restrictive \nthan the particular ceiling which is set forth in this statute. There \nis not going to be a uniform rule which is fair. There is going to be a \nso-called rule, which is applied if this passes, but not really. States \nare allowed to be more restrictive if they choose to do so.\n  Let us take a look at section 106 of this conference report. Section \n106 provides that:\n\n       Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), no product liability \n     action that is subject to this Act concerning a product, that \n     is a durable good, alleged to have caused harm (other than \n     toxic harm) may be filed after the 15-year period beginning \n     at the time of delivery of the product to the first \n     purchaser. . . .\n\n  That sounds pretty uniform. It says, ``Subject to paragraphs (2) and \n(3), no product liability action * * * may be filed after a 15-year \nperiod.'' That is the statute of repose. As a matter of fact, the \nheading of that section, 106, says ``Uniform Time Limitations on \nLiability.'' The word ``uniform'' is right in the heading.\n  Then you read paragraphs (2) and (3). Paragraph (2) says,\n\n       Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if pursuant to an applicable \n     State law, an action described in such paragraph is required \n     to be filed during a period that is shorter than the 15-year \n     period specified in such paragraph, the State law shall \n     apply. . . .\n\n  How do the sponsors use the word ``uniform'' in the title, when in \nfact they permit diversity, providing it is downward, providing it is \nmore restrictive on the rights of injured parties?\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\n That is allowed. The title ``uniform'' is used, although a patchwork \nof laws is permitted, providing they are more restrictive than the 15-\nyear limit which is provided for in section 106. How is that for a \nmisleading label? Uniform? There is nothing uniform about it.\n  My dear friend from West Virginia said this morning that when \nproducts cross State lines, it makes no sense for product liability \nrules to be different from State to State. Well, if it makes no sense \nfor product liability rules to be different from State to State, how \ndoes it then make sense to allow States to be more restrictive than the \n15-year statute of repose?\n  They cannot be less restrictive. They cannot give more rights to \ninjured parties, only less. But to use the words of my dear friend from \nWest Virginia, if it makes absolutely no sense for liability rules to \nbe different from State to State, why then are States allowed to move \nin one direction, to be more restrictive under section 106 and section \n108 and a whole host of other sections, but they cannot be less \nrestrictive to persons who are injured?\n  That is not uniformity. That is uniform unfairness. That is a \nconsistent unfairness. That is a one-way street. That is a one-way \npreemption.\n  Let us take a look at some other provisions of the law. Section 108 \nof the conference report contains a provision entitled, again, \n``Uniform Standards for Award of Punitive Damages.''\n  Uniform standards. It is not a uniform standard in section 108. When \nyou read it, it says, and this relates to punitive damages:\n\n       Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State law--\n\n  And then it goes on to say what those punitive damages can be. But \nState law governs if it is more restrictive. What happens if State law \nis less restrictive? What happens if State law is more generous to \ninjured parties? What happens if State law is tougher on defendants in \nterms of punitive damages? That is not allowed. That is preempted. But \nif a State law is more restrictive, that is, again, allowed.\n  That is not uniformity, and if it makes sense for product liability \nrules to be uniform from State to State or, to use the words of the \nSenator from West Virginia, if it makes no sense for product liability \nrules to be different from State to State, then it surely makes no \nsense to allow States to vary from the rule downward to be more \nrestrictive on the rights of injured parties. All they are prevented \nfrom doing is to be less restrictive in terms of the rights of \nplaintiffs and injured parties.\n  Another section, section 110. Section 110 of the bill contains a \nprovision that limits joint and several liability in product liability \nsuits. The statement of managers explains that this provision is \nintended to preempt State laws that are more favorable to plaintiffs, \nbut not to preempt State laws that are more favorable to defendants. \nHere is what the statement of managers says. It says that the House-\npassed version specified that the section, and here we are talking \nabout the section on joint and several liability, the section--\n\n       . . . does not preempt or supersede any State or Federal \n     law to the extent that such law would further limit the \n     application of the theory of joint liability to any kind of \n     damages.\n\n  So this section on joint and several liability, according to the \nHouse version, is not intended to limit or preempt or supersede any \nState or Federal law if that law further limits--further limits--the \napplication of joint and several. That is OK. That is OK in the House \nversion, and then we are told by the statement of managers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could have 30 more seconds.\n  We are told by the statement of managers that the language that I \njust quoted reflects the conference agreement's intent. It is not just \nthe House provision, it is the conference agreement's intent.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have here is not uniformity. We have a \none-way preemption in this bill that allows the State in section after \nsection after section to be more restrictive of the rights of injured \nparties. All that they are preempted and prevented from doing at the \nState level is being less restrictive on the rights of injured parties.\n  That is not fair. That is not uniform. It is one of the reasons I \nwill vote against this conference report, because even though you can \nmake out an argument for uniformity, I think there is a good \nintellectual argument that can be made for uniformity, if it is true \nuniformity, if it applies both ways, to both plaintiffs and defendants, \nif it is not just a one-way street that allows States to be more \nrestrictive but not less restrictive. That is intellectually \ndefensible.\n  Whether you agree with it or not, at least it is consistent, at least \nthere is a coherent logic to it. But to provide, as this bill does, \nthat State laws which are more restrictive are preempted but not the \nones less restrictive, it is unfair, unbalanced, and it is one of the \nreasons I will vote against this bill.\n  Let us look at one example of how this one-way preemption provision \nwould work. The bill would override State laws that provide joint and \nseveral liability for noneconomic damages. Joint and several liability \nis the doctrine under which any one defendant who contributed to the \ninjury may be held responsible for 100 percent of the damages in a \ncase, even if other wrongdoers also contributed to the injury.\n  The sponsors of this bill, and this amendment, have pointed out that \nthere are problems with joint and several liability. In some cases, a \ndefendant who has only a marginal role in causing the damage ends up \nholding the bag for all of the damages. That doesn't seem fair.\n  On the other hand, there are good reasons for the doctrine of joint \nand several liability. Case and effect often cannot be assigned on a \npercentage basis with accuracy. There may be many causes of an event, \nthe absence of any one of which would have prevented the event from \noccurring. Because the injury would not have occurred without each of \nthese so-called but-for causes, each is, in a very real sense, 100 \npercent responsible for the resulting injury.\n  This bill, however, does not recognize that in the real world, \nmultiple wrongdoers may each be a cause of the same injury. It insists \nthat responsibility be portioned out, with damages divided up into \npieces, and the liability of each defendant limited to a single piece. \nUnder this approach, the more causes the event can be attributed to, \nthe less each defendant will have to pay.\n  Unless the person who has been injured can successfully sue all \nparties who contributed to the injury, he or she will not be \ncompensated for his entire loss. The real world result is that most \nplaintiffs will not be made whole, even if they manage to overcome the \nburdens of our legal system and prevail in court. Isn't it more fair to \nsay that the wrongdoers, each of whom caused the injury, should bear \nthe risk that one of them might not be able to pay its share than it is \nfor the injured party to bear that risk and remain uncompensated for \nthe harm?\n  The bill before us completely ignores the complexity of this issue \nwith its one-way approach to Federal preemption. States which are more \nfavorable to defendants are allowed to retain their laws. But State \nlaws that try to reach a balanced approach between plaintiffs and \ndefendants would be preempted.\n  Roughly half the States choose to protect the injured party through \nthe doctrine of joint and several liability. Another half dozen States \nhave adopted creative approaches to joint and several liability, \nseeking to balance the rights of plaintiffs and defendants.\n  Let me give you a few examples.\n  Louisiana law provides joint and several liability only to the extent \nnecessary for the plaintiff to recover 50 percent of damages; there is \nno joint and several liability at all in cases where the plaintiff's \ncontributory fault was greater than the defendant's fault.\n  Mississippi law provides joint and several liability only to the \nextent necessary for the plaintiff to recover 50 percent of damages, \nand for any defendant who actively took part in the wrongdoing.\n  New Jersey law provides joint and several liability in the case of \ndefendants who are 60 percent or more responsible for the harm; joint \nand several liability for economic loss only in the case of defendants \nwho are 20 to 60 percent responsible; and no joint and several \nliability at all for defendants who are less than 20 percent \nresponsible.\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\n  New York law provides joint and several liability for defendants who \nare more than 50 percent responsible for the harm; joint and several \nliability is limited to economic loss in the case of defendants who are \nless than 50 percent responsible.\n  South Dakota law provides that a defendant that is less than 50 \npercent responsible for the harm caused to the claimant may not be \nliable for more than twice the percentage of fault assigned to it.\n  Texas law provides joint and several liability only for defendants \nwho are more than 20 percent responsible for the harm caused to the \nclaimant.\n  All of these State laws are efforts to address a complex problem in a \nbalanced manner, with full recognition of factors unique to the State. \nTo the extent that they are more favorable to the injured party than \nthe approach adopted in this bill, however, they would all be \npreempted.\n  On the other hand, other States, which take a more restrictive view \nof joint and several liability, or even prohibit it altogether, would \nbe allowed to retain their individual State approaches. That just does \nnot make sense.\n  Mr. President, there is a list of problems in our legal system that \nwe could all go through. Going to court takes too much time and it \ncosts too much money. Some plaintiffs get more than they deserve, while \nothers who suffer injuries may spend years in court but recover nothing \nat all. As Senator Gorton, one of the lead authors of the bill before \nus, explained during last year's debate on the Senate bill:\n\n       [T]he victims of this system are very often the claimants, \n     the plaintiffs themselves, who suffer by the actual \n     negligence of a product manufacturer, and frequently are \n     unable to afford to undertake the high cost of legal fees \n     over an extended period of time. Frequently, they are forced \n     into settlements that are inadequate because they lack \n     resources to pay for their immediate needs, their medical and \n     rehabilitation expenses, their actual out-of-pocket costs.\n\n  I agree with Senator Gorton that there is unfairness in our current \nlegal system. There is unfairness to defendants in some cases, and \nthere is unfairness to plaintiffs in other cases. However, the \nconference report before us does not even attempt to address the \nproblems faced by plaintiffs. There is absolutely nothing in this bill \nto assist those who have been hurt by defective products and face the \ndifficult burdens of trying to recover damages through out legal \nsystem.\n  On the contrary, the bill makes every effort to override State laws \nwhich attempt to help the victims of defective products. Only laws that \nmake it harder for the injured party to obtain compensation are \npermitted. That is not uniform, it is not fair, and I cannot support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield such time that the Senator from North Dakota may \ndesire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding time. I \nwould like to ask a series of questions about the bill and about one \nsection of the bill specifically.\n  I voted for this bill and move the bill to conference. I am inclined \nto vote for cloture today. But I have reviewed what came out of \nconference, and one area gives me some concern. I want to go through it \nwith the Senators on the floor, especially Senator Gorton.\n  There is on page 6 of the bill that the Senate passed an exclusion \nfor the term ``product.'' The bill included on the bottom of page 6 \nunder (ii), the exclusion reading: ``electricity, water delivered by a \nutility, natural gas or steam.''\n  We were clearly deciding that these utilities were not covered as \nproducts in this bill.\n  The bill came back from conference with that provision. However, a \nnew clause was added. The same words existed-- ``electricity, water \ndelivered by utility, natural gas or steam.'' This is in the part of \nthe bill which is defining what is excluded from the bill. That is what \nthe Senate passed.\n  But the conference report comes back with the same words but goes on \nto say: ``except * * *'' In other words, we are excluding utilities \n``except to the extent electricity, water delivered by a utility, \nnatural gas or steam are subject, under applicable State law, to a \nstandard of liability other than negligence.''\n  Forty-four States have such standards; 18 of them have been litigated \non the subject of electric utilities. It appears to me that what the \nconference has done in this section is added utilities as being covered \nby this bill. I have asked questions of half a dozen experts in the \nlast 24 to 48 hours, and the answers I get are not satisfying. The \nanswers I get are, ``Well, that's what the words say, but that's not \nwhat it means.'' I am assuming courts will say this means what it says, \nnot what someone says it means. So I want to go through a couple of \nquestions.\n  I ask the Senator from the State of Washington, how is the provision \nthat went into conference different from the provision that came out? \nWhen it went in, it said ``electricity, water delivered by a utility, \nnatural gas and steam'' are excluded. Period. They are not part of this \nbill. When it came out, it seems to say they are now a part of this \nbill, which is a major change.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we might have an interchange. I ask the \nSenator from Washington if he can respond to that for me.\n  Mr. GORTON. I can. I would start by referring the Senator from North \nDakota back to page 6 of the original bill, the bill that passed the \nCommerce Committee, on which both of us serve, and passed this body, \nthe Senate, unchanged and to look at the entire subsection (B), \nentitled ``Exclusion.'' The Senator from North Dakota will see in that \nexclusion.\n  The term ``product'' does not include,\n\n       (i) tissue, organs, blood, and blood products used for \n     therapeutic or medical purposes, except to the extent that \n     such tissue, organs, blood and blood products (or the \n     provision thereof) are subject, under applicable State law, \n     to a standard of liability other than negligence.\n\n  It goes on to say,\n\n       [And] (ii) electricity, water delivered by a utility, \n     natural gas, or steam . . .\n\n  The next reference that I would make to the Senator from North Dakota \nis in the Senate committee report on that bill. On page 24 of the \nSenate committee report on the bill that passed the Senate here, in \nsubsection (ii), the explanation under the term ``product'' there is, \nfor all practical purposes, word for word this exclusionary language, \nparticularly the last two sentences.\n\n       The term does not include tissue, organs, blood and blood \n     products used for therapeutic or medical purposes, except to \n     the extent that such tissue, organs, blood and blood \n     products, or the provision thereof, are subject under \n     applicable State law to a standard of liability other than \n     negligence.\n\n  In other words, the same word is in the statute.\n\n       The term also does not include electricity, water delivered \n     by a utility, natural gas or steam.\n\n  There is a footnoted comment. And the footnote reads:\n\n       Claims for harm caused by tissue, organs, blood and blood \n     products used for therapeutic and medical purposes are, in \n     the view of most courts, claims for negligently performed \n     services and are not subject to strict product liability. The \n     act, thus, respects State law by providing that in those \n     States, the law with respect to harms caused by these \n     substances will not be changed. In the past, however, a few \n     States have held that claims for these substances are subject \n     to a standard of liability other than negligence, and this \n     act does not prevent them from doing so. Such actions would \n     be governed by the act. Actions involving claims for harms \n     caused by electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural \n     gas or steam are treated in the same manner.\n\n  When this went to conference--we had the better part of a year to \nread through every detail--the proposition, the meaning of this bill, \nas it passed the Senate, showed up in the proposition that this \nexception appeared in subsection (i) on page 6. It did not appear in \nsubsection (ii). The same words have now been added to subsection (ii), \nwhich simply accords with the committee report interpretation of the \nlanguage that we passed here in the Senate.\n  So the fundamental answer at this point to the question that is \nraised by the Senator from North Dakota is that this change does not \nchange the meaning of the act as it was set out in the committee report \nto the original Senate bill. State law, in other words, in each of \nthese cases, whether it is tissue or electricity, State law will \ngovern.\n  If a State passes a law that says electricity is a product, yes, it \nwould be\n\n[[Page S2360]]\n\ngoverned. If that State consciously decides to treat electricity as a \nproduct, then it would be a product under this bill. But these strict \nliability States, you know, do not do that. It leaves it entirely up to \nNorth Dakota or California or to Washington or West Virginia to make \nthat determination. If it wishes for strict liability, it can impose \nstrict liability. If it wants to call it a product--I do not know of \nany that do--but if it wants to call it a product, it can bring it up \nto this bill. That is up to the State.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You are arguing one of two things. Either you are making \nthe case that utilities are defined as a product under the bill, as \noriginally passed by the Senate, because of a footnote on page 24 of \nthe committee report. In other words, you are saying that utilities \nwould not be excluded from the definition of the term product but, in \nfact, are covered by this bill. Therefore, what came back from the \nconference is not a change. That might be what you are arguing. I do \nnot think that is the understanding of most Members of the Senate.\n\n  I think, having read what left the Senate on its face--it says on \npage 6, ``Exclusion,'' that is, an exclusion not to be treated as a \nproduct includes:\n\n       (ii) electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural \n     gas, or steam.\n\n  You might be arguing, I think, that although we might have read that \nas an exclusion, it never really was. Utilities were really going to \ncome under this. We just did not understand the application of the \nfootnote on page 24, or you are making the case now that what has been \ndone in conference has no impact at all on what the language really \nmeans. What you are saying then is that utilities are truly excluded, \nand what you have done comports with the description under ``tissues, \norgans and blood,'' and your intention is to make sure that utilities \nare not defined as a product but, in fact, are a service and are, \ntherefore, excluded under the definition section of this bill. I am not \nsure what you are saying.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would say the second is correct, with the exception if \na State wants to define it as a product and bring it under this bill, \nthey can.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But that is not what the language says. It says it is \nexcluded unless the State defines it with a standard of strict \nliability.\n  I am saying to you that there are 18 States that already have this \nwith respect to electric utility cases alone. Are you saying, the way \nyou have written this, those 18 States have already decided this bill \nwill cover electric utilities? If that is the case, that is a \nremarkable change from what left the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me try it one more time. The Senator is saying the \nStates can make the decision whether utilities are excluded or not. The \nbill passed by the Senate was very simple. On page 6--it cannot be \nmisread, notwithstanding any other footnotes in some other committee \nreport--it says:\n\n       Exclusion.--The term [product] does not include--\n     electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural gas or \n     steam.\n\n  That is what the Senate passed. I am coming to the floor to ask the \nquestion, has that dramatically changed so that in fact utilities are \nno longer excluded? Did somebody lift up the flap on the tent and \nutilities snuck in to get a massive exclusion under this bill? If that \nis the case, then I am very concerned about this. What I am hearing \nfrom people is to say, ``no, it kind of reads that way, but that is not \nreally the effect of it.''\n  I do not have the foggiest notion of how one relates to the \ncontradiction between how something reads and how someone intended it. \nThat is why I am asking the question of, what is your intent? Is it \nyour intent that just as in the bill passed by the Senate, it is your \nintent that the exclusion means that utilities will be excluded, \nperiod?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am sorry. Repeat it again.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it the intent, just as in the bill that was originally \npassed by the Senate, that the exclusion under (B), page 6, would still \nremain, that electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural gas and \nsteam are, in fact, excluded? They are not products? Is that the intent \nof the people that wrote whatever they wrote in this conference?\n  Mr. GORTON. Well, first I need to say that no outside group came and \nasked whatsoever.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not say ``outside group.''\n  Mr. GORTON. The intent of the conference committee drafters was to \nsee to it that subsection (i) and subsection (ii) read the same way, \nbecause we had already described them as having the same meaning in the \noriginal Senate bill. There was an inconsistency. There they were \ndescribed in the Senate bill, conference report, as having exactly the \nsame meaning. So there is a change only to the extent that something \nwas already gone with respect to tissue, organs, and blood.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But you cannot describe in the conference report what the \nlanguage means. The language means what it says it means.\n  My question, first, is, when this language left the Senate, did it \nmean that utilities were excluded from the definition of products? I \nthought it meant that. Most Members of the Senate thought it meant \nthat. That is what I think it says. Do you believe that is what it \nsays?\n  Mr. GORTON. I think that is the case not only with electricity but \nwith respect to tissue, organs, and blood.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is fine. I am not interested in those, but I am \ninterested in electricity.\n  Mr. GORTON. Let me finish. I think it is exactly the same exclusion \nfor both unless a State legislature has determined that they ought to \nbe considered products. That is a privilege that the State legislature \nhas now and retains under this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is not what the law says that you are asking us to \nvote on, as written. You are not talking about whether the State wants \nto determine if it is a product. You are talking about the question of \nthe standard the State determines, appropriate.\n  There are certain kinds of things that are very dangerous and high \nrisk that the States determine it wants an elevated standard of \nliability. It's called a strict liability standard. The way this is \nwritten, you are saying that utilities are excluded as products under \nthis bill. They are excluded. They are not involved in this bill, \nexcept if a State determines that their standard is one of strict \nliability, then they are considered as products.\n  What you have done, you have swept claims against utilities under the \nbill. My point is, 18 States have already determined that in their \ncourts with respect to claims against electric utilities alone, 14 have \npermitted strict liability in claims against natural gas utilities and \n11 have allowed the same standard of strict liability on water utility \ncases. The fact is that there have been court cases and legislation on \nthis very point. Thus, it appears it is already determined that claims \nagainst utilities are going to fall under the definition of \n``products'' under this bill. I am not trying to be antagonistic. I \nvoted for cloture before, and I voted for this bill on final passage. I \nwant to understand whether somebody decided to bring a big moving van \nhere and move something into this bill that no one on the floor \nunderstands. The ``moving van'' means loading up utility interests and \nputting it in.\n  Let me frame it in as simple a way as I can. Is it the intention of \nthose who wrote this when it left the Senate, is it the intention that \nutilities shall not be considered a product? Is it the intention that \nthe language as written--it says under ``exclusion'' on page 6 that \nutilities are not part of this bill. They are not a product. They are \nexcluded, period, end of sentence, just declarative, end of sentence.\n  If that is the case--I want the answer to that--if that is the case, \none says that judgment has not changed, how do we reconcile that with \nthe changed language? That is what I am trying to understand. I am not \ntrying to take up anybody's time or cause trouble. I am trying to \nunderstand exactly what this does and means with respect to utilities. \nI may be putting whoever is listening to sleep, I am sure, but it is \nvery important.\n  Just parenthetically, while I am asking this question, I think this \nis one of those interesting issues where there is a little bit of truth \non all sides, frankly. I know both sides immediately just separate and \nsay, ``Well, you are wrong; we are right,'' and, ``We are wrong; you \nare right.'' The fact is there\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nis a little bit of truth on the product liability issue in general. \nThere are too many lawyers in America too prone to file lawsuits. I \nunderstand all that. I do not want to injure anybody's rights to \nredress for grievance in our court system if they get a defective \nproduct.\n  I have advanced this bill because it was narrow enough, to me, and \nbecause I thought it was a reasonable approach. When I see the \nconference report, first of all, nobody pulled this out for us to say \nthis was a change. However, the more I look at it, the more it occurs \nto me that something has happened here that is of concern. I am trying \nto understand what it is because you are dealing with a very large \nindustry--the electricity and the utility industry--and something has \nchanged this definition.\n  So, I know that the Senator from South Carolina wanted to ask a \nquestion, but I have the two questions I want to ask: First, is it the \nunderstanding of the folks that wrote this when we originally dealt \nwith it in the Senate that the exclusion--very straightforward on page \n6--meant that we were excluding utilities? End of the story. That was \nmy notion. I voted for it. Was that the notion that everyone else had \nwho wrote this? It is pretty hard to misread it. Even if you have page \n24 of the conference report, it is not hard to misread what it says. It \nsays:\n\n  Exclusion.--The term ``product'' does not include electricity, water \ndelivered by utility, natural gas or steam.\n\n  Is your understanding the same as mine, that under that bill \nutilities were excluded? They were not to be considered products for \nthis bill? I ask the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. My understanding was that it was the meaning as is stated \nin the conference committee report of the original bill that they were \nexcluded unless the State had defined them as a product and had \nsubjected them to strict liability. That was the meaning of the \noriginal bill and the meaning of this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But the original bill was not written that way or \nunderstood that way by this Senator.\n  Is it your understanding there are many States that have adopted a \nstandard of strict liability, which would mean that the way you \ninterpret the provision in the original bill would redefine utilities \nas a product and provide for utilities protection under this bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Do I have a specific understanding of that or can I name \nthe States? I would have to answer the question ``no.'' The committee \nreport, which I believe to be accurate, says that most of the courts in \nmost States treat these matters as matters that are subject to a \nnegligent standard, not to a strict liability standard. Certainly there \nare some States treating them as strict liability.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But those who do adopt a strict liability standard, \nbecause these are kinds of activities that have a potential for greater \ndanger and so on, is it the intention of those who have authored this \nto say for those States that adopted that standard of strict liability \nthat we will offer protection of the utility industry under this bill?\n  I think, frankly, that is a substantial departure from what most \npeople in this Senate would understand. I had thought originally some, \nincidentally, whom I have consulted with in the last 2 days or day on \nthis, they say, ``No, you do not understand this. We do not really mean \nutilities fall under this bill.'' That is comforting to me, except the \nlanguage seems at odds with that.\n  I think what Senator Gorton is saying is the way I read it, that \nthose many States who have decided on the standard of strict \nliability--and there are many of them--will be told by this piece of \nlegislation that utilities, for them, will now be a product whose \ninterests will be protected by the limitations in this bill, and I \ndaresay, I do not think there are two Senators on the floor of the \nSenate that understand that to be the case.\n  Can you respond to that? I am not trying to cause trouble for you. I \nwant to understand exactly what we are doing.\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer to the question of the Senator from North \nDakota is that in such States, such States are subject to the \nrestrictions of this bill, exactly as they were under the intention of \nthe bill as it was originally passed by the Senate Commerce Committee \nand by the Senate itself, as is evidenced by the Senate committee \nreport, and that the change in the statutory language was simply to \nconform the statutory language with the intention expressed in the \ncommittee report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are both on the Senate Commerce Committee. I ask, do \nyou think it was or is the intention of the Senate Commerce Committee \nto provide protection for utilities under product liability?\n  Mr. GORTON. Under the same circumstances that it would provide it for \nany other similarly situated organization, providing product liability \nprovides it for any manufacturer, or for that matter, distributor, no \nmatter how large or how small.\n  The direction of the bill, the direction of a product liability bill \nis to provide a degree of predictability and a protection of the \nconsumer interest for the producers of goods--not services in this \ncase--goods. If this is the description that a State uses for its \nutilities, yes, the committee did intend to provide exactly that \nprotection, and that is exactly what the committee report says.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the bill that we passed in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee that came to the Senate floor that I supported said this, and \nsaid only this; it had no caveats, no exception, no exclusions. It said \non page 6, ``Exclusion. The term `product' does not include \nelectricity, water delivered by utility, natural gas or steam.''\n  The answer I am hearing from the Senator from Washington now is that \nyou would have had to understood more than this language in order to \nunderstand the importance of it, because you are saying that this \nreally meant except those 44 States, 18 of whom already had court cases \non the issues of standard of strict liability on electric utilities. \nThose that adopt a standard of strict liability will find that \nutilities in their States have their products or their services defined \nas products in this bill.\n  There is something wrong here. There is something that does not \nconnect. I am trying to understand, because I have been a supporter, \nand I am trying to understand what does not connect here. What are we \ntrying to avoid by including the exception? I come from a school of \nnine people in my graduating class, and we did not have the highest \nmath there or advanced reading, but I understand what I read, and it \nsays, ``the term 'product' does not include electricity, water \ndelivered by utility, natural gas or steam.'' Period, end of story.\n  I voted for that. I say I agree with that. Utilities are not covered \nas products because they are in the section called ``Exclusion.'' Now I \nam hearing a description that says, ``No, you only read what was in the \nlaw. There was something else behind it.'' So I am just trying to \nunderstand where we are. If someone can enlighten me. Where are we with \nrespect to utilities?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I guess. I do not know that you will enlighten me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have never heard of this. Can I ask a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, who has the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The time is under the control \nof the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will yield on my own time just a minute. I say to \nSenator Dorgan, he is right on target. In the zeal to avoid using what \nis intended--namely, the expression of strict liability and nuisance--\nfor utilities, as put in the juxtaposed position in this language, \nwhere you have two exceptions, almost like a mathematical case of two \nnegatives making a positive. Yes, positively, utilities are covered, \nwherein they have strict liability on nuisance tests. I have here in my \nhand a majority of States that do have it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\n\n\n THE FOLLOWING CHART INDICATES WHERE A CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER STRICT LIABILITY CAN BE BROUGHT BY AN INJURED PARTY\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                State                        Natural Gas              Electricity                 Water         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama                                                                                                         \nAlaska..............................  ........................  .......................

I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue to inquire. I will not \ntake much more time. I still do not understand the answer. Is the \nanswer that the utilities essentially are providing services and are \ntherefore not covered as products under this bill?\n  If that is the case--and that is what I thought was the case--then \nfine. But there is extra language here, where there needs to be a \nrecord in the Senate, that says here is exactly what this legislation \nmeans. If we have a circumstance where we are saying in 44 districts \nthey have strict liability, the services of a utility are now put under \nthe entire provisions of this law, that is a substantial change.\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Let me summarize a response to the general concern \nexpressed by the Senator from North Dakota. Generally, at least in \ncommon law, the provision of electricity has been considered a service. \nThe provision of the service is not governed by strict liability. \nStrict liability is a concept that applies to products.\n  A number of States have determined that there should be a standard of \nstrict liability applied to electricity and, for that matter, to the \ndelivery of blood, the subjects of the first subsection of that \nsection. If a State treats as a product the delivery of electricity, or \nthe supply of blood, and subjects it to strict liability, it is subject \nto the provisions of this act. It was meant to be subject to the \nprovisions of this act by the bill as it was reported from the Commerce \nCommittee. It is included as a part of the Commerce Committee report. \nIt was noticed simply by someone on the staff that, for some reason or \nanother, subsection (2) omitted the language that was in subsection \n(1), and it was added during the course of the drafting of the \nconference committee report. That was not intended to create any \ndifference in the way in which the bill would have been interpreted, in \nany event. It was intended to bring it into conformity with the \ncommittee report, and it has done so. But if the fundamental question \nof the Senator from North Dakota is, if a State imposes strict \nliability under these circumstances and treats electricity as a \nproduct, it is subject to those provisions, and I say ought to be.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Imposing strict----\n  Mr. GORTON. If I can say one other thing, obviously, this question \ndid not come up during the long debate we had a year ago. If it had, to \nthe best of my ability, I would have answered the question of the \nSenator the same way I am answering now. That is what was meant. Had I \nmemorized this footnote at the time? No, I had not. I would have had to \nrefer to it, but I would have come up with the same answer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The State deciding to adopt strict liability with respect \nto a utility does not put it in the category of products. I do not \nunderstand the mixing of the two.\n  Let me take it one step further then. If that is the case, what would \nthe logic be in saying to a State that because it decides to impose a \nstandard of strict liability on utilities--because potentially you have \nsome very hazardous kinds of circumstances that can exist with respect \nto electricity, steam, natural gas, and so on. But because a State \ndecides to impose strict liability on that, what would be the logic of \nsaying, by the way, you decided to do that, therefore, we will put the \nutilities under the protection of this law. I do not understand the \nlogic of attaching that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Exactly the same logic that applies to the entire bill. \nIf the utility manufactured a toaster, which is clearly a product, and \ngave it as a bonus to its customers, that product would be subject to \nthis bill. The whole logic of the bill is to provide a degree of \npredictability to the law from State to State, which does not exist at \nthe present time. That logic is every bit as applicable to a utility as \nit is to General Motors or to a small business that is engaged in \nretail sales.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not take this further. But I say \nthere is a substantial difference between utilities and toasters. The \nreason I supported the bill is I think there has been too much \nlitigation in this country; some of the litigation is totally \ninappropriate. I supported it on that basis, to create a reasonable \nresponse without abridging the rights of the people who want to sue, \nyet trying to reduce the number of lawsuits in our country. I felt that \nwas appropriate.\n\n  I am surprised at the description of what the exclusion means on page \n6 of the bill, as originally passed in the Senate. The answer to the \nquestion I am asking this afternoon is that the new language in the \nconference report does not alter what the old language intends to do. \nIt was so clear on its face. It says ``exclusions.'' The term \n``product'' does not included electric and water delivered by utility, \nnatural gas, or steam--period, end of section, end of story. There is \nnobody in my hometown who could misread this. And I did not misread it, \nI do not think.\n  The answer now, I guess, is that the added language of that section \ndoes not change the intended section because the section was intended \nto mean something that did not comport with the way it was read.\n  So I guess legislation is a strange process. I am trying to \nunderstand what exactly does this bill do as we move along. There is \nplenty in the bill I am satisfied with. I commend those who have \ncreated some provisions of this bill that I think advance the interests \nmost of us want to find common interest on. But I think it is obvious \nfrom the discussion that there is a substantial amount of \nmisunderstanding about what this exclusion means with respect to \nutilities.\n  Mr. GORTON. Let me try one other approach to this subject because it \napplies equally to the two subsections of this section. The whole \nconcept of many of these damages, especially punitive damages, is a \nconcept that is based on a company doing something wrong--in our case, \nand from some of the definitions, egregiously wrong. It is based on \nnegligence or gross negligence. When a State or a given organization is \nsubject to a standard of strict liability, it is liable for all of the \ndamages that it causes to an individual--in this case, using whatever \nit is that the company produces, regardless of whether it is negligent \nor not. It may have engaged in the highest standard of safety available \nfor such an organization. Yet, a legislature or a Congress has \ndetermined that, for some reason or another, the whole cost, all of the \ndamages created by that organization, ought to be imposed on the \norganization, without regard to its having done anything wrong. That is \nwhat strict liability means.\n  You do not have to prove negligence or that there was anything wrong \nat all with what the particular organization did. You are still going \nto hold it liable. Well, that is the reason for the first subsection. \nUnder those circumstances, it seems quite logical that you are not \ngoing to be required to pay for more than the damages that were \nactually created.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I may finally say, you are absolutely correct about \nstrict liability. But the reason for the standard of strict liability \nis that there are some kinds of activities that are sufficiently \ndangerous and contain sufficient risks that a strict liability standard \nhas been determined to be in the public interest.\n  What I think you are saying is if, in the case of utilities, a State \ndetermines that a strict liability standard is appropriate, that is the \nsame as a State defining a utility as a product. There is no \nrelationship between the standard and the product. I think most of us \nbelieve----\n  Mr. GORTON. But it seems to me, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, there is a relationship between the standard and what kind of \ndamages ought to be allowed over and above the actual losses suffered \nby the victim.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is a different issue. The issue is under exclusion. \nThe term ``product'' does not exclude what? The Senate has determined a \nproduct does not exclude utilities--the Senator has been patient. I am \ntrying to understand exactly the consequences of this legislation. It \nis, while a boring subject for some, nonetheless a very important \nsubject with a lot at stake for the American people.\n\n  Last evening, I read a fair amount about this. It is not fun reading. \nIt is not a page-turner. But while I was struggling through it, I was \ntrying to understand exactly what we have done and what the \nconsequences will be. I personally think there is room for product \nliability reform, and I have voted that way and likely will continue \nto. I am very concerned about that, and I will continue visiting with \nthe Senator about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I have listened very carefully to \nthe preceding colloquy, and I must say that I read both the House and \nthe Senate version of that, and I read what came in afterward in the \nconference report. Quite frankly, I was opposed to this bill before, \nand now even more so, because I think it is clear what happened in \nconference.\n  As we have said now, 44 States, as I understand it, have strict \nliability\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nlaws. Now those utilities will come under the purview of this bill and, \ntherefore, it will cap damages to the extent that it is my \nunderstanding now that, under this bill, for example, the Seminole \npipeline and natural gas facility in Texas, exploded in 1992, killed \nthree, injured a lot, caused a lot of damage in two counties, and a \njury awarded $46 million in punitive damages. It is my understanding \nthat now, under this bill, that will not be able to happen after this.\n  So I thank the Senator from North Dakota for bringing that out. I had \nnot focused on that before.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that the debate over product liability \nhas been clouded by misinformation and anecdotal evidence, which is \nsubstituting for a careful consideration of the facts.\n  Mr. President, you know, every time a jury is impaneled, they are \ntold by a judge they should consider only the facts, not hearsay, not \nspeculation, but only the facts. Well, Mr. President, we are sort of \nsitting as a jury here. We ought to consider the facts. But what we \nhave before us in this legislation--what we are hearing is hearsay, \nspeculation, and a distortion of the truth. If, in fact, this Senate \nfinds in favor of the conference report, and we were a jury, the judge \nwould be well within his purview to dismiss the jury for not adhering \nto the instructions of the court and following the facts of the case.\n  It is wrong for a jury to decide on anything other than the facts, \nand it is wrong for us to legislate based on anecdote and \nmisinformation, but that is what we are doing. This is not commonsense \nreform. This is nonsense regression. This bill ought to be called the \ncaveat emptor bill of 1996, throwing us back to the old days when it \nwas buyer, beware. If you bought something and it hurt you, tough \nluck--buyer, beware. That is what this bill is about. It turns back the \nclock years.\n  In the midst of all the legalese, it is hard to sort out what is \nreally at stake here. It is really very simple. We are talking about \npeople's lives. We are talking about their health, and we are talking \nabout their happiness and about families.\n  This bill is about as antifamily, antihuman rights as I have ever \nseen. What the bill does is places economic worth on a higher plateau \nthan individual work. I find that totally objectionable.\n  We have heard a lot of words about the need to promote values of \ngreater responsibility and accountability. If you believe in those \nvalues, you ought to oppose this bill because it absolves wrongdoers \nfrom responsibility and does not hold them fully accountable for their \nactions.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about sending more power to the States. \nIf you are for that, you ought to oppose this because this puts power \nin Washington. We have heard a lot of talk on the floor about putting \nmore power in the hands of the people. If you believe in that, you \nought to oppose this legislation because this takes power out of the \nhands of citizens and juries and puts it in the hands of big \nGovernment. Plain and simple, this bill is big Government, big \nbusiness, and it is a big mistake.\n  Now, of course, most businesses do not set out to harm consumers with \ntheir products. Obviously not. But sometimes faulty products do make it \nto the market, and sometimes they make it to the market through \ncarelessness or through sheer disregard of the public safety by those \nmanufacturers. Sometimes people get hurt and die because of it. In the \nzeal to pass this conference report, let us not pass over the victims. \nThere is a lot of talk about the victims. Let us talk about the \nvictims--the children severely burned by highly flammable pajamas, \nwomen who die from toxic shock syndrome, women with silicone breast \nimplants who have now lupus and scleroderma.\n\n  Again, I want to make it clear that most businesses are responsible. \nMost businesses take due care and concern. But there are those who do \nnot. The current product liability system is based on a fundamental \npremise that we want to make sure that people--average citizens of this \ncountry--have the assurance that when they buy a product, when children \nconsume a product, when they travel on our highway, they can be \nreasonably certain that what they are using, consuming, or buying is \nnot going to harm them.\n  Part of that is our responsibility, and that is why we have health \nand safety and food inspection laws. That is why we have left untouched \nin our country the common law that we inherited from Great Britain that \ngoes back several hundred years, the concept of tort feasor, the \nconcept that someone must take due care or concern that his actions do \nnot harm others, and if they do, that person must be held accountable \nand responsible. Those are the core values embodied in our Nation's \nlaws. It is the essence of the common law. It goes back several hundred \nyears.\n  My friend from North Dakota said we have too many lawyers in this \ncountry. I do not know about that, but I do believe that more knowledge \nof law and a love and respect of law--and especially the common law \nthat we have inherited--makes us a more decent and a more law-abiding \ncitizenry. That is what we are forgetting here. We are forgetting the \nhistory of tort feasance. For the life of me, I do not understand how \npeople argue about we ought to be personally responsible and now saying \nwe do not have to follow that admonition.\n  With this legislation, we all know that punitive damages awarded for \ngrossly negligent behavior are capped. But in their efforts to make the \nproduct liability system uniform across the United States, supporters \nhave fashioned a one-way preemption: This legislation strikes down only \nthose aspects of State law that give citizens more protection from \ndefective products. That is a one-two punch.\n  The bill passed by the Senate last year was bad, and this conference \nreport is worse. It is far more extreme. It preserves some of the worst \nprovisions of the Senate bill, like the elimination of joint and \nseveral liability and the cap on punitive damages, and expands other \nareas resulting in a bill that is the consumers' worst nightmare.\n  Let me talk for a couple of minutes about the elimination of joint \nand several liability for noneconomic damages. Again, it violates the \ngolden rule of responsibility and accountability. You do not have to \nworry about being accountable and making sure the victim is wholly \ncompensated unless the victim has a high-paying job. The Senator from \nLouisiana talked about that earlier. Eliminating joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages eliminates the protections \nparticularly for women, children, and elderly, because noneconomic \nlosses constitute a greater proportion of their total losses.\n  So, again, this bill is antiwomen, it is antichildren, and it is \nantielderly. I do not understand that. We are supposed to be for \nindividual workers. And, yet, what this says is that if you have a \nhigh-paying job, you are worth more than a child or worth more than an \nelderly person who has been a homemaker. You are worth more than they \nare.\n\n  Under current law, joint and several liability enables an individual \nto bring one lawsuit against the companies that are responsible for the \nmanufacture of a dangerous, defective product and have the defendants \napportion fault amongst themselves if the jury finds for the plaintiff. \nUnder joint liability, victims are compensated fully for their injuries \neven if one or more of the wrongdoers is insolvent.\n  Our civil justice system is founded on the principle that the victim \ndeserves the greatest protection. This bill turns that basic value on \nits head. It says we should protect the wrongdoer. This bill says they \ndeserve protection.\n  Mr. President, consider one case, the Claassen family of Newhall, IA. \nBill, Jeanne, his wife, and their 4-year-old son, Matt, were returning \nhome from a family gathering on November 6, 1993, in their 1973 \nChevrolet pickup. Another driver failed to stop at a stop sign and \nrammed into the passenger side of their pickup at a speed of about 30 \nmiles an hour. Eyewitnesses confirmed that the Claassen's pickup \nimmediately burst into flames on impact. The flames raced up the \noutside of the passenger door and engulfed Jeanne Claassen's face in \nflames.\n  The Claassen's son, Matt, was seated between Bill and Jeanne in the \npickup. Bill struggled to get Matt out of the truck before returning to \nrescue his wife. He was unable to rescue her and was convinced that she \nhad died in the fire. Witnesses who arrived on the\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\nscene immediately after the collision heard Bill telling his son that \nhis mommy had died and gone to heaven.\n  Jeanne Claassen survived and is still recovering today. Her face and \nhead permanently disfigured, she has not been able to return to her job \nas a medical technician. They are reluctant to take her back because of \nher appearance. She continues to undergo painful surgery to regain some \nsemblance of her former self. Her young son Matt often relives that \nnightmare in his school drawings, once drawing an igloo engulfed in \nflames. He sometimes has trouble relating to the different way his \nmother now looks.\n  The Claassens are currently in litigation to recover damages from the \ntwo parties involved in this accident, the driver of the other car and \nthe General Motors Corp. that manufactured the truck.\n  The driver of the other car has no personal assets, and her insurance \nwill only cover some of Jeanne's many continual medical expenses. \nGeneral Motors has been under criticism for refusing to recall the 1973 \nand later models of the C/K pickups. These model trucks have the fuel \ntanks outside of the frame rail of the vehicle, making them more \nsusceptible to the type of accidents like Jeanne Claassen's.\n  By eliminating joint and several liability for noneconomic damages, \nthis legislation will make it potentially more difficult for Jeanne \nClaassen to be compensated for her loss if the court rules in her \nfavor. The driver of the other car is insolvent, and once the insurance \nmoney runs out, GM will not necessarily have to chip in to cover \nexpenses. But Mrs. Claassen's pain and suffering will continue.\n  This legislation says that it really does not matter about her, it \ndoes not matter about the exploding fuel tank when awarding noneconomic \ndamages. If one of them cannot pay, if one of the defendants cannot \npay, we will just stick it to Mrs. Claassen. But--and here is the rub \nin this bill--if Mrs. Claassen was a CEO making millions of dollars a \nyear for a major corporation, this bill would not hesitate to take care \nof her economic losses. She does not have a big economic loss, but she \nhas personal losses. She has pain and suffering. She has a lot of loss \nin her life. This bill says, tough luck. If she had been the CEO of a \nmajor corporation making 20 million bucks a year, this bill would have \nbeen for her. But not for this Mrs. Claassen. What kind of \ndiscrimination against human beings are we about to engage in if we \napprove this conference report?\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of things I object to in this bill, \nbut that is what I find most objectionable--economic losses are more \nimportant than human losses, pure and simple. If you have money, this \nbill is for you. But if you suffer the loss of consortium, if you \nsuffer the loss of one of your family, pain and suffering, \ndisfigurement, sorry, you are out of luck. Under this bill, Mrs. \nClaassen would be out of luck.\n  The elimination of joint liability for noneconomic damages forces our \nlegal system to make a value judgment based upon your economic worth, \nand that is why this bill is so antiwoman and antifamily.\n  Last, let me just talk about capping punitive damages. I think I \nheard earlier the Senator from Connecticut saying $250,000 is a lot of \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I have here a list of the amount of money made by \nCEO's of our major corporations. I figured out how long it would take \nto reach the cap of $250,000.\n  The CEO of Boeing makes $1.4 million a year. It would take 9 weeks of \nhis salary to reach this cap. Do you think that is going to be a \ndeterrent to Boeing? IBM, it would take 5 weeks. Sears & Roebuck, it \nwould take 1 month. That is not a deterrent.\n\n  When this bill first came to the floor, in good faith I offered an \namendment which I thought would tend to balance things out. I am \nopposed to caps, but I said if you are going to have a cap, let us put \nthe cap at twice the annual compensation of the CEO of the corporation. \nThat way it protects small businesses because, if you are a CEO of a \nsmall business, you do not have much money every year so you would have \nless exposure, but if you are a CEO making $20 million a year, well, \nthen twice that would be the limit on the cap.\n  I lost on that amendment, but to me it still makes better sense than \nwhat we have in this bill of saying $250,000 or twice the compensatory \ndamages, whichever is greater. This defeats the purpose of the \ndeterrent effect of the product liability laws. They have made a \ndifference. Ford Motor Co. redesigned the Pinto only after a $125 \nmillion lawsuit was awarded in which a 13-year-old boy was severely \nburned when the Pinto he was riding in burst into flames.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yet evidence showed Ford Motor Co. knew it was a faulty \ndesign, but they went ahead anyway because they said it would cost less \nto have to pay it out in damages than to redesign the car.\n  Mr. President, what this bill does is it lets those tort feasors off \nthe hook.\n  I know my time is up. I could go on and on. Quite frankly, we should \nnot say that simply because you make a lot of money you are going to \nget awarded more damages, more punitive damages will be assessed \nagainst someone if you make more money than if you are a homemaker or a \nchild or an elderly person. That is discrimination of the worst sort.\n  I hope and I trust we will not invoke cloture on this bill and that \nwe can continue to abide by the principles of individual work and \nresponsibility and accountability in our country.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first of all, in connection with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I point out there is an \nadditur provision in this bill dealing with punitive damages. I do not \nwant to debate that whole thing here; I only have 10 minutes, but I \nwould stress that point of which perhaps the Senator was not aware.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, I briefly outlined the history of this \nlegislation, which represents now 15 years--15 years; that is a long \ntime--we have been debating this liability reform act. It started in \n1981 when Senator Kasten, of Wisconsin, introduced the first bill.\n  Finally, here we are today with a fair and a reasonable bipartisan \nbill that not only has passed both Houses but did so with strong \nmajorities. The House approved a broader bill, not this one but a \nbroader one, which I presume those on the other side would find more \noffensive. They passed that 265 to 161, a very substantial majority. In \nthe Senate, the bill that we passed had 61 votes in support of it, 61 \nout of 100.\n  So with a track record like that, you might think product liability \nreform would soon become law. But here we are faced with two major \nobstacles, a cloture vote this afternoon to protect against further \nfilibustering on this issue, and, worse than that, a newly raised \nthreat of a Presidential veto. If this bill does not make it past the \nprocedural hurdle of cloture, or if the President does not reconsider \nhis threat of a veto, this bill will not become law.\n\n  To be prevented from succeeding at this point, I must say, is \nparticularly galling. After all, I suspect that this bill has seen more \nroadblocks in the last 15 years than any other bill we have seen here. \nIndeed, I venture to guess that product liability has been subject to \nmore cloture votes than any other subject. There were 2 cloture votes \nin 1986, 3 in 1992, 2 in 1993, 4 in 1995, for a total of 11 cloture \nvotes in all. Yet, it seemed in this new Congress we were going to win \nit; once and for all this gridlock would be ended.\n  Drafting of this bill was a bipartisan effort right from the \nbeginning. It is not a Republican bill; it is a Republican-Democratic \nbill, a bipartisan bill. The White House was well aware of what was \ngoing on. The White House watched closely as the Senate took up the \nbill and began adding amendments. It is my understanding that it was \nthe administration, during the Senate debate in May, that quite \nhelpfully suggested the addition of the so-called additur provision to \nthe final version.\n  So, as I say, it went sailing through here, 61 to 37. What happened \nto change\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\nthe White House's attitude? Did the bill change dramatically in \nconference from what went through here in the Senate? The answer is, \nhardly at all. It was clear to all that the House's broad tort-reform \nbill would not be approved by the administration. Therefore, to their \ncredit, the conferees, representatives from the House and \nrepresentatives from the Senate meeting together, decided to stick \nclosely to the Senate version that had passed so overwhelmingly and \nthat seemed to have White House support. So the bill that we will vote \non today, or the bill that we are dealing with, is virtually identical \nto the Senate-passed bill that won such strong approval.\n  I do not know why the President appears to have changed his mind. I \ncannot believe he is personally opposed to a Federal liability law for, \nas a Governor, as Governor of Arkansas, the President sat on the \nNational Governors' Association committee that drafted the first \nNational Governors' Association resolution dealing with Federal \nliability reform.\n  Here we have a copy of the letter from the President to Senator Dole \nsetting forth the reasons for the veto.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are told it is an ``unwarranted intrusion on State \nauthority.'' Yet, the National Governors' Association enthusiastically \nsupports this measure.\n  We are told the bill would ``encourage wrongful conduct because it \nabolishes joint liability.'' But joint and several liability, it has \nbeen pointed out, applies still to economic damages.\n  The letter accuses the bill of ``increas[ing] the incentive to engage \nin the egregious conduct of knowingly manufacturing and selling \ndefective products.'' I do not find this charge makes much sense. Then \nit goes on to say that the ``additur'' provision the White House itself \nput in here, the provision being that the judge himself can increase \nthe punitive damages--the White House had a hand in drafting that--now \nthey say that is not adequate.\n\n  So I do not think any of these three statements that the President \nhas in his letter represents what this conference report really would \ndo. I think that is very, very unfortunate.\n  To my judgment, this bill is sound and reasonable. Under the bill, \nthose who sell but do not make products--sell the products but not \nnecessarily having made them--are liable only if they did not exercise \nreasonable care. If they offered their own warranty and it was not met, \nor if they engaged in intentional wrongdoing, obviously they will be \nliable. But they cannot be caught up in a liability suit where they did \nnothing wrong. I do not see much trouble with that.\n  If the injured person was under the influence of drugs and alcohol \nand that condition was more than 50 percent responsible for the event \nthat led to the injury, the defendant cannot be held liable.\n  If plaintiff misused or altered the product--this is the one we see \nso often in the area I come from, people have altered machinery and \nequipment that they have purchased--in violation of the instructions or \nwarnings to the contrary, or in violation of just plain common sense, \nthen the damages are reduced accordingly. I just cannot understand why \nwe ought to blame the manufacturer for behavior that everyone knows \nwould place the product user at risk. That does not seem fair to me. \nDoes that not contradict our notion of an individual's personal \nresponsibility? The person has to have some sense of responsibility \nhere.\n  The bill allows injured persons to file an action up to 2 years after \nthe date they discovered or should have discovered the harm and its \ncause. For durable goods, the actions may be filed up to 15 years after \nthe initial delivery of the product. These also seem to me to be fair.\n  Either party may offer to proceed to voluntary, nonbinding, \nalternative dispute resolution.\n  The most controversial element of the bill, I suppose, is the \npunitive damages. I remind my colleagues that these damages are \nseparate and apart from compensatory damages. The compensatory damages \nare meant to make the injured party whole. The punitive damages are \nawarded where there is ``clear and convincing evidence'' proving \n``conscious, flagrant indifference to the right of safety of others.'' \nThe amount of punitive damages may not exceed two times the amount \nawarded for compensatory loss or $250,000, whichever is the greater.\n  Again, I must say I have had trouble with punitive damages for a long \ntime. I have great difficulty understanding the basis of that; \ncertainly that the punitive damages go to the plaintiff instead of the \nState for retraining of those who are committing the errors. It might \nbe manufacturers, it might be physicians, whatever it is. But I have \ngreat difficulty understanding why in the world punitive damages should \ngo to the plaintiff.\n  In conclusion, I pay my compliments to Senators Rockefeller, Gorton, \nPressler, and Lieberman for the work they have done on this. I \ncertainly urge the President to reconsider his position and join the \nbipartisan coalition supporting this very important legislation.\n  I urge him to sign this bill into law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I will veto H.R. 956, the Common Sense \n     Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996, if it is \n     presented to me in this current form.\n       This bill represents an unwarranted intrusion on state \n     authority, in the interest of protecting manufacturers and \n     sellers of defective products. Tort law is traditionally the \n     prerogative of the states, rather than of Congress. In this \n     bill, Congress has intruded on state power--and done so in a \n     way that peculiarly disadvantages consumers. As a rule, this \n     bill displaces state law only when that law is more \n     beneficial to consumers; it allows state law to remain in \n     effect when that law is more favorable to manufacturers and \n     sellers. In the absence of compelling reasons to do so, I \n     cannot accept such a one-way street of federalism, in which \n     Congress defers to state law when doing so helps \n     manufacturers and sellers, but not when doing so aids \n     consumers.\n       I also have particular objections to certain provisions of \n     the bill, which would encourage wrongful conduct and prevent \n     injured persons from recovering the full measure of their \n     damages. Specifically, the bill's elimination of joint-and-\n     several liability for noneconomic damages, such as pain and \n     suffering, will mean that victims of terrible harm sometimes \n     will not be fully compensated for it. Where under current law \n     a joint wrongdoer will make the victim whole, under this bill \n     an innocent victim would suffer when one wrongdoer goes \n     bankrupt and cannot pay his portion of the judgment. It is \n     important to note that companies sued for manufacturing and \n     selling defective products stand a much higher than usual \n     chance of going bankrupt; consider, for example, \n     manufacturers of asbestos or breast implants or intra-uterine \n     devices.\n       In addition, for those irresponsible companies willing to \n     put profits above all else, the bill's capping of punitive \n     damages increases the incentive to engage in the egregious \n     misconduct of knowingly manufacturing and selling defective \n     products. The provision of the bill allowing judges to exceed \n     the cap in certain circumstances does not cure this problem, \n     given Congress's clear intent, expressed in the Statement of \n     Managers, that judges should do so only in the rarest of \n     circumstances.\n       The attached Statement of Administration Policy more fully \n     explains my position on this issue--an issue of great \n     importance to American consumers, and to evenly applied \n     principles of federalism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe conference report on the Common Sense Product Liability Legal \nReform Act. Supporters of this legislation have made the claim that \nthis bill will benefit manufacturers, investors and business owners and \nworkers. They also say it will benefit consumers. Yet, to my knowledge, \nthis bill is opposed by virtually every group in the country that \nrepresents working people and consumers and children and the elderly.\n  One of the reasons for this is that the claims that have been made on \nbehalf of this bill do not really add up. The people who support this \nbill claim the bill would set uniform Federal standards for product \nliability legislation.\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n They claim uniformity is essential and that knowing the laws are going \nto be the same everywhere you go is absolutely critical for business \ninterests that might be unsure of what the marketplace and a legal \nsystem of a particular jurisdiction will hold for them. That is the \nwhole basis of this bill. That is the core concept, that you have to \nhave this uniformity across the board, or businesses really will not \nknow what to do in terms of location, business location decisions.\n  I would like to use my time to speak about two aspects of this notion \nof uniformity. First, let us remember that this legislation marks an \nunprecedented event. We are, for the first time, imposing the demands \nof the Federal Government in an area of law that has, for 200 years, \nbeen the sole domain, the sole province of the States. I thought this \nwas a Congress devoted to devolution, not to the Government at \nWashington making mandatory rules.\n  I thought that was the mantra of the new Republican majority, that \nthe States know best, that most of the time the best decisions are \nthose that are made by the folks back home and not by the \ndecisionmakers in Washington. I remember time and time again the \nmajority leader coming down to the Senate floor and telling us it was \ntime to ``dust off the 10th amendment.''\n  I remember when the Speaker of the other body went on national TV \nlast spring and in an address to the Nation said the following:\n\n       This country is too big and too diverse for Washington to \n     have the knowledge to make the right decisions on local \n     matters. We've got to return power back to you, to your \n     families, your neighborhoods, your local and State \n     governments.\n\n  Mr. President, what happened to those words? What happened to the \n10th amendment? What happened to the need to address local problems on \nthe local level? All this talk about States rights is about to go right \nout the window as we usurp over 200 years of State control over their \ntort systems.\n  We have a bill before us that has as its central premise the notion \nthat the Federal Government is a better administrator of justice than \nthe States and that the U.S. Senate is better suited to determine the \noutcome of a civil trial than are 12 average Americans sitting in a \njury box.\n  How troubling that, at a time when Americans are so distrustful of \ntheir Government, we in Government are not willing to trust Americans \nto administer civil justice. But I suppose that for the sponsors of \nthis bill, this is a reasonable price, so long as we get some \nuniformity in our laws.\n  Unfortunately--and I really want to stress this--this bill has about \nas much uniformity as a circus parade. Look at the new punitive damage \ncap contained in the bill. That provision caps punitive damages in most \ncases at the higher of $250,000, or two times compensatory damages. \nThat sounds pretty uniform, does it not? But read the small print.\n  If a State has a law that is more restrictive--more restrictive--than \nthe Federal cap, then that particular State law prevails. If a State \nhas a law that is less restrictive than this Federal cap, then, and \nonly then, the Federal cap prevails.\n  Moreover, under this bill, those States that currently simply \nprohibit punitive damages, do not allow them at all, they would be \npermitted to continue to not allow any punitive damages.\n  So what does this mean for American consumers? It means the consumers \nand children and the elderly living in different States with different \nsets of laws will have substantially different protections from \ninjuries and defective products.\n  Mr. President, so much for the uniform Federal standards and so much \nfor the idea that this bill is somehow fair and equitable and \nbeneficial to consumers.\n  But what this really is is sort of a one-way preemption of State \nlaws, and it is grounded on the premise that some States know better \nthan others and that some Americans can properly serve on juries but \nothers cannot. With this new concept of, let us call it, selective \nfederalism, perhaps we should change the words above the Supreme Court \nso they read ``Equal justice under the law, unless you live in the \nfollowing States,'' and then list the appropriate States.\n  Mr. President, I also find it absolutely ludicrous that the \nsupporters of this bill would suggest that we are providing uniformity \nwhen we are going to have completely different standards and rules \nthroughout the 50 States. If I had to pick one provision of this bill \nthat demonstrates how nonsensical this notion of uniformity is, I would \nhave to choose the provisions seeking to reestablish a new Federal \nstatute of repose.\n  This bill creates a new Federal standard for the number of years a \nmanufacturer or product seller can be held liable for harm caused by a \nparticular product. Known as a statute of repose, that period is 15 \nyears under this conference report.\n  Why 15 years? Where did that come from? It is a good question. The \nproduct liability legislation considered in the 103d Congress, written \nby the same two principal authors, contained a 25-year statute of \nrepose. Why? Well, a footnote in the committee report from that \nCongress justified the 25-year limit by pointing out that, according to \ntestimony received by the Commerce Committee, and I quote, ``30 percent \nof the lawsuits brought against machine tool manufacturers involve \nmachines that are over 25 years old.'' Therefore, Mr. President, \npresumably the authors of this bill, last time around, selected 25 \nyears as the life expectancy of all products manufactured in the United \nStates.\n\n  So last May, we considered a product liability bill that the \nsupporters tried to characterize as much more moderate and much \nnarrower than the product liability bill considered in the 103d \nCongress. But in many cases, the bill we considered last May was worse \nthan its predecessor. For example, they dropped the 25-year statute of \nrepose to only 20 years. Why? Once again, good question. The committee \nreport for the Senate-passed legislation conspicuously left out that \nfootnote from last time about the machine tool testimony and just makes \nno mention whatsoever as to why 20 years was selected for that bill. \nInstead, the committee report promotes the consistency of the 20-year \nstatute of repose with the General Aircraft Revitalization Act of 1994 \nthat was passed by this body in 1994.\n  It also justifies a Federal statute of repose on the basis that Japan \nis poised to enact a short 10-year statute of repose. So now, \napparently, the Japanese Government knows better than the State of \nWisconsin how to properly administer civil justice in cases involving \nWisconsin litigants. I wonder how the Framers of the Constitution would \nfeel about that assertion, Mr. President.\n  What is too bad is, in this conference report before us, it does not \nend there because, as I said, the conference report before us does not \nhave a 25-year statute of repose, does not have a 20-year statute of \nrepose, it even has now a significantly shorter 15-year statute of \nrepose. So we have gone from 25 to 20 to 15, and they call this a \nmoderate bill.\n  Again, what in the world is that 15 years based on? It strikes me as \nbeing completely arbitrary and it seems less concerned with what the \nlife expectancy of certain products should be and more concerned with \nmaking sure we pass as short a statute of repose as can possibly be \ndone politically.\n  Finally, Mr. President, worse, this takes us back to the issue of \nselective preemption of State authority over liability laws. Under this \nconference report, if a State legislature has decided against having a \nstatute of repose or has decided on a statute that is longer than 15 \nyears, then this new Federal law will override the judgment of that \nState legislature.\n  Again, when you really look at this bill, it is not about uniformity \nat all. It will lock in a lack of uniformity and different treatment \nthroughout the States and not provide the central purpose of the bill, \nas I understand it, which is to provide all the businesses in the \ncountry with some kind of uniformity.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of all the consumers who will be \naffected by this, as well as the concern about uniformity, I simply \nmust say that this conference report should be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will try to use less \ntime than that, because I know my colleague from Washington has several \nrequests for additional time.\n  First of all, let me commend our colleagues from West Virginia and \nfrom Washington for their tremendous work on this legislation. They \nhave spent countless months, indeed years, working on this issue. I \nwant to express my gratitude to them and the gratitude of my \nconstituents in Connecticut. They have dealt with a complicated, \nsensitive issue in a forthright manner, allowing all to have a full say \nin what ought to be included in the legislation. I strongly urge our \ncolleagues to support their effort, the Common Sense Product Liability \nand Legal Reform Act of 1996.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not new to this issue. During this debate, I have \nbeen playing a supporting role to the efforts of Senator Rockefeller \nand Senator Gorton. But I began working on this issue 10 years ago, \nwhen I joined with our former colleague, Jack Danforth, and attempted \nto fashion a product liability bill. None of our efforts ever made much \nheadway through the legislative process, but I think we helped lay a \nfoundation for the measure we are considering today.\n  Mr. President, when I ask the businesses in my State to list the \nsingle most important issue to them, they tell me that it is product \nliability reform, more so than taxes or any other issue. This is \nparticularly true of my smaller manufacturers, the tool and die makers, \nand other industries that are supported by larger companies like United \nTechnologies, Sikorsky, and Electric Boat. This is the issue they care \nmore about than anything else.\n  Across this country, manufacturers are spending seven times more to \nprepare for product liability cases than they are on research and \ndevelopment.\n  Because of these costs, innovative products never make it to the \nmarket. There is no question, for example, that there would be more \nresearch into an aids vaccine if companies were not fearful of the \ncurrent product liability system.\n  Additionally, the high costs of litigation raises the cost of many \nproducts. This so-called tort tax accounts for an estimated 20 percent \nof the cost of a ladder, 55 percent of the cost of a football helmet, \nand 95 percent of the cost of childhood vaccines.\n  The excessive costs of the product liability system also hurt the \ncompetitive position of American companies. Some American manufacturers \npay product liability insurance rates that are 20 to 50 times higher \nthan their foreign competitors.\n  Of course, if this system were working well for consumers, that would \nbe an important argument for maintaining the status quo. But that is \nnot the case.\n  As I mentioned earlier, consumers are denied innovative products and \nmust pay higher prices for products. And what about people who are \ninjured by the products that do make it to the marketplace? Do they \nbenefit from the current system? The answer is no.\n  A General Accounting Office study concluded that it takes almost 3 \nyears for a case to be resolved. That is 3 years that an injured person \nmust wait to be made whole. Regrettably, this delay leads many injured \npeople, particularly those with very severe injuries, to settle for \nless than their full losses.\n  Clearly, the present system is broken. We need to fix it and the \nconference report makes some important repairs. My colleagues have \nalready discussed some aspects of the bill, but let me highlight some \nprovisions that are particularly important.\n\n\n                             uniform system\n\n  First, by providing Federal standards in certain areas, this measure \nwill provide a more uniform system of product liability. These \nstandards will add more certainty to the system, and help reduce \ntransaction costs.\n  When you consider that 70 percent of all products move in interstate \ncommerce, Federal standards make sense. The National Governors \nAssociation supports this approach. The association has testified:\n\n       The United States needs a single, predictable set of \n     product liability rules. The adoption of a Federal uniform \n     product liability code would eliminate unnecessary cost, \n     delay, and confusion in resolving product liability cases.\n\n\n                     alternative dispute resolution\n\n  The provision in the bill that encourages the use of alternative \ndispute resolution will also help reduce the excessive costs in the \ncurrent system. Currently, too much money goes to transaction costs--\nprimarily lawyers fees--and not enough goes to victims.\n  A 1993 survey of the Association of Manufacturing Technology found \nthat every 100 claims filed against its members cost a total of $10.2 \nmillion. Out of that total, the victims received only $2.3 million, \nwith the rest of the money going to legal fees and other costs. \nClearly, we need to implement a better system in which the money goes \nto those who need it--injured people.\n\n\n                         statute of limitations\n\n  Consumers will also benefit from a statute of limitations provision \nthat preserves a claim until 2 years after the consumer should have \ndiscovered the harm and the cause. In many cases, injured people are \nnot sure what caused their injuries, and by the time they figure it \nout, they have often lost their ability to sue. This legislation will \nprovide relief for people in such situations and allow them adequate \ntime to bring a lawsuit.\n  This legislation will also improve the system for businesses--from \nlarge manufacturers to the hardware store down the street.\n\n\n                           alcohol and drugs\n\n  Under this bill, defendants would have an absolute defense if the \nplaintiff was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or illegal \ndrugs and the condition was more than 50 percent responsible for the \nplaintiff's injuries. This provision, it seems to me, is nothing more \nthan common sense. Why should a responsible company pay for the actions \nof a drunk or a drug user?\n\n\n                            product sellers\n\n  The bill also institutes reforms to help product sellers. They would \nonly be liable for their own negligence or failure to comply with an \nexpress warranty. Product sellers who are not at fault can get out of \ncases before running up huge legal bills. But as an added protection \nfor injured people, this rule would not apply if the manufacturer could \nnot be brought into court or if the claimant would be unable to enforce \na judgment against the manufacturer.\n\n\n                            punitive damages\n\n  In my view, the conference report also strikes an appropriate balance \non punitive damages. There are reasonable limitations on punitive \ndamages, but the judge could award a higher amount against large \nbusinesses if the limited punitive damage award is insufficient to \ndeter egregious conduct.\n\n\n                              biomaterials\n\n  The biomaterials provision also addresses a critical problem. It \nwould limit the liability of biomaterials suppliers to cases where they \nare at fault, and establish a procedure to ensure that suppliers, but \nnot manufacturers, could avoid unnecessary legal costs. This provision \nwill help ensure that Americans continue to have access to lifesaving \nand life-enhancing medical devices.\n  My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, authored this \nproposal and I commend him for his excellent effort.\n\n\n                          balanced legislation\n\n  The provisions I have outlined demonstrate the balance this \nlegislation strikes between consumers and businesses. In the final \nanalysis, the reforms in the bill should strengthen the product \nliability system for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I commend the conferees for staying so close to the \nSenate bill. In my view, the House bill went too far. It contained \nprovisions that would have applied in a wide range of cases, including \nmedical malpractice.\n  The stakes of legal reform, the rights and responsibilities of all \nAmericans, warrant a more cautious approach. There are some areas of \nour legal system where problems must be addressed. Securities \nlitigation and product liability are obvious examples, but we should \navoid wholesale changes.\n  The conference report we are debating today takes the right approach. \nIt is a moderate measure that makes modest reforms. It strikes a \ncareful\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nbalance between the needs of consumers and businesses, and should help \nimprove the product liability system for everyone.\n  Before closing, let me again commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nGorton for their excellent work on this legislation. As I discussed \nearlier, this conference report has very few changes from the Senate \nbill that they crafted so carefully. They have also done a superb job \nin keeping this legislation moving forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and help pass this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I may have remaining to our \ndistinguished colleague from Washington.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, before I yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article entitled ``In Defense of Big (Not Bad) Business'' \nfrom the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  In Defense of Big (Not Bad) Business\n\n                        (By Jerry J. Jasinowski)\n\n       Engaging in class warfare and anti-industrial rhetoric has \n     become the favorite blood sport in this political year.\n       We have the unlikely duo of presidential candidate Pat \n     Buchanan and Labor Secretary Robert Reich warning us about \n     anxious workers and their stagnant wages. A seven-part \n     treatise in the New York Times blames corporate callousness \n     for the ills of society, while Newsweek recently threw the \n     mugs of four leading American business executives on its \n     cover under the headline ``Corporate Killers.''\n       How quickly perceptions change. Little more than a year ago \n     I was invited to address an international gathering of \n     corporate and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, to \n     talk about an American industrial renaissance that had \n     restored the United States to the top spot among the world's \n     economies for the first time in nearly a decade. And instead \n     of warning of Japan's industrial might, a constant theme \n     throughout the 1980's, I found myself describing a quality \n     and productivity revolution that has led to record job \n     creation in the United States.\n       No one in this country seems to know it or care, but while \n     Americans have been busy berating our capitalist system with \n     unbridled enthusiasm, the U.S. economy has become the envy of \n     the industrialized world.\n       Indeed, the current anxiety over jobs and wages illustrates \n     the verity of the notion that a big enough lie, repeated \n     often enough, can take on the trappings of reality. I may be \n     fashionable--and in some cases politically expedient--to \n     argue that American workers are underpaid, underappreciated \n     and on the brink of losing their jobs. Some are--and these \n     concerns need to be addressed. But to suggest that this is \n     the prevailing phenomenon taking place in our economy is \n     wrong, or at the least, a very distorted view of reality.\n       While corporate downsizing gets the headlines, the American \n     economy has quietly grown richer--gaining more than 8 million \n     net new jobs since 1992 and putting our unemployment rate at \n     an historically low 5.5 percent. In the past 25 years, U.S. \n     employment has increased 59 percent and we have created more \n     than five times as many net jobs as all the countries of \n     Europe combined.\n       Even in areas like U.S. manufacturing, to take a favorite \n     topic of media concern, the picture is not so bleak as news \n     reports, or a cursory look at the data, might suggest. \n     According to government statistics, around 1.7 million \n     manufacturing jobs disappeared between 1988 and 1993. But \n     many of the positions shed by manufacturers were never the \n     assembly line jobs typically associated with manufacturing in \n     the first place. Rather, a sizable portion of the eliminated \n     positions were back-office jobs like payroll and accounting, \n     which are now contracted out to companies that the Labor \n     Department classifies as ``service sector'' firms. It's also \n     worth remembering that millions of jobs are created in other \n     sectors as a direct result of manufacturing. It happens when \n     a new restaurant locates near a manufacturing plant, the so-\n     called ``multiplier effect.'' And it happens when jobs that \n     were considered by the government to be manufacturing are \n     spun off--the most common example being GM's transfer of its \n     data-processing to EDS, a move that overnight classified \n     thousands of jobs from manufacturing to service.\n       The data can be equally misleading when it comes to wages. \n     It has by now been widely reported that median household \n     incomes, adjusted for inflation, have been falling for nearly \n     two decades, and by 7 percent since 1989 alone. But the wage \n     decline doesn't take into account other factors that greatly \n     mitigate its effect. First, the size of the average American \n     family has been declining meaning the typical household \n     paycheck is being spread over fewer people. And when the \n     overstatement of inflation contained in the consumer price \n     index is eliminated, income growth actually climbs by 15 \n     percent.\n       Nor do such statistics take into account the fact that \n     workplace compensation has undergone radical changes in \n     recent years. As studies by the Federal Reserve and others \n     have shown, employees nowadays receive a much greater share \n     of their compensation in the form of various benefits--health \n     care, paid vacation, pensions, incentive payments, bonuses, \n     commissions and profit sharing. Using this broader measure of \n     total compensation, workers are even better off than they \n     were in the 1970s.\n       It is also important to remember that workers with the \n     right skills and in the right fields are sharing handsomely \n     in the economy's growth. A study by Princeton University \n     economist Alan Krueger showed that employees who use \n     computers on the job earn 15 percent more than those who \n     don't. Indeed, a wage boom has been underway for some time in \n     many high-tech firms. Assembly-line positions in the \n     technology sector now typically pay anywhere from $50,000 to \n     $75,000 annually, including bonuses. And in part because of \n     automation that has raised the skill-level required to \n     perform all kinds of jobs on the factory floor, manufacturing \n     workers in any field now earn an average of $40,000 annually, \n     for companies like Cypress Semiconductor in San Jose, Calif., \n     compensation is even higher. The average worker in this \n     1,900-person company, including line workers and \n     receptionists, earns $93,000 a year including benefits.\n       Even more important than what the numbers tell us about the \n     present is what they tell us about our future. It is true \n     that, while the wage picture is not as bleak as we've been \n     led to believe, there is reason for concern. But a number of \n     powerful trends suggest that several of the factors that have \n     kept take-home pay lower than expected and job in security \n     higher than desired are self-correcting. Others are well \n     within our power to fix.\n       The baby-boom generation, combined with the influx of women \n     into the workplace and high levels of immigration, has \n     brought on the largest increase in the supply of labor in \n     American history. Since 1968, the number of Americans seeking \n     jobs has shot up by 52 million workers, a factor which has \n     had the inevitable effect of slowing wage growth since so \n     many more people were out in the market competing for jobs.\n       Currently there are still too many workers with inadequate \n     skills struggling to fit themselves into an economy that \n     increasingly demands higher levels of education. But \n     demographics will be on the side of the workers in coming \n     years. For one, four times as many Americans have college \n     degrees today compared with just 50 years back. More \n     importantly, the generation now entering the work force is \n     one-third smaller than the baby-boom generation, which will \n     inevitably push up employee compensation. A labor force that \n     is older and more experienced also commands generally higher \n     compensation, a factor that filters down through the entire \n     labor market.\n       Meanwhile, many jobs are going wanting. Some manufacturers \n     are so desperate for skilled assembly line workers that \n     they've taken to hiring professional recruiting firms to help \n     them find qualified applicants. The owner of one Northern \n     Virginia firm told me that software developers who commanded \n     $30,000 five years ago now demand, and get, $50,000 a year. \n     And a newly released study of software programmers nationwide \n     shows many veteran code writers can command salaries that \n     exceed $100,000.\n       John F. Kennedy's oft-repeated maxim that ``a rising tide \n     lifts all boats'' is as true today is it was 35 years ago. \n     Unfortunately, the tide hasn't been rising very fast lately. \n     Though much of the news about the economy is positive, it's \n     also true that economic growth during the current expansion \n     has been hovering around 2 percent, roughly half that of \n     previous post-war expansions. Yet, given improvements in \n     corporate productivity of late, both in manufacturing and \n     more recently in the service sector, there is no reason our \n     growth rate can't be lifted to at least 3 percent a year. If \n     that happened, we would inevitably see substantial new \n     economic activity and jobs gains for workers at all skill \n     levels.\n       So why isn't the economy growing faster?\n       Pat Buchanan would have us believe that it's because our \n     free-trade policies have allowed other countries to benefit \n     at the expense of Americans. But if anything, the opposite is \n     true. Exports, in fact, have been responsible for roughly \n     one-third of U.S. economic growth over the past decade. \n     According to a new report by the Manufacturing Institute and \n     the Institute for International Economics, American firms \n     that export goods or services have experienced a job growth \n     rate almost 20 percent higher than comparable non-exporting \n     firms. Exporters are 9 percent less likely to shut down, and \n     they pay their workers as much as 10 percent more than firms \n     that do not export, the study found. If anything, we should \n     be figuring out ways to open up markets across the world, not \n     stir tensions in a way that could set off a trade war.\n       It's also time we question whether the Federal Reserve is \n     keeping interest rates unduly high, and whether we should \n     continue allowing government to keep the tax burden so high. \n     The median two-wage earner family carries total tax burden--\n     federal, state and local--of 38.2 percent, up from 27.7 \n     percent in 1955. This amounts to more than $5,000 a year for \n     the typical family. Payroll taxes, which represent the \n     largest single tax on millions of middle income Americans, \n     have grown at four times the rate of incomes. While this\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n     last tax is technically paid by employers and employees \n     alike, it amounts to a direct hit on employees because most \n     companies simply pass on the burden in the firm of reduced \n     wages and benefits.\n       So does all this mean business should be let off the hook? \n     Certainly not. I would be the last to exonerate business \n     completely of the charges coming at them of late. Take the \n     issue of wages. It's true that many companies have done a lot \n     to share their success with their workers. Last month, for \n     example, while the press was busy maligning IBM for its \n     layoffs, the computer maker announced it would spend more \n     than $200 million increasing employee bonuses, not just for \n     top executives but for the rank and file. And at Coca-Cola, \n     where nearly one-third of the workers own company stock, each \n     employees' holdings shot up in value by an average of $70,000 \n     over the last 15 months.\n       The problem is that not enough companies are putting a \n     priority on performance-related compensation. People should \n     be paid based on the quality of their performance, at every \n     company, and no matter how lowly the job appears. If only the \n     top executives are sharing the largess--or if bonuses are \n     climbing when profits are shrinking--something is wrong.\n       The other area that needs more corporate attention is \n     education and training. Again, many companies are investing \n     significant sums, but too many others aren't. In a constantly \n     changing work environment, honing skills and keeping up with \n     the latest technology is an essential priority for all \n     companies that intend to remain competitive. Yet right now, \n     the average company spends roughly 1.5 percent of its payroll \n     on employee training and education. To my mind, that figure \n     needs to double.\n       The United States still offers the best employment \n     opportunities in the world. But if it is to stay that way, it \n     will require a new social compact in the workplace. That \n     doesn't mean guaranteed job security--which is impossible in \n     today's highly competitive world. But it does mean employment \n     security; ensuring that workers acquire the training and \n     skills to move up the ladder, if not at one company, then at \n     another.\n       For employees, it means that instead of thinking of \n     themselves as victims, they should be investing in their own \n     futures. And, in exchange for their hard work, they should \n     insist that corporations keep up their end by helping to fund \n     the cost of training, and by rewarding financially those who \n     help themselves.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This particular article refutes the statement by the \nSenator from Connecticut. Big business is doing fine. They are not \nworried about new products. They are competitive. They are making the \nbiggest profits. It goes right back to the official hearings we had \nwith the conference report, risk managers. Over 432 risks managers sat \nthere and said it was less than 1 percent of the cost of the product.\n  So we can hear these statements that this is the No. 1 thing they are \nworried about, and everything of that kind and holding things back, but \nunder the Cornell study, product liability cases are diminished by 44 \npercent in the last decade and, yes, industries are suing industries \nlike Pennzoil suing Texaco for a $10 billion verdict. Those things \noccur.\n  But this is not the No. 1 interest of business. The No. 1 interest of \nbusiness, that I have been trying to defend in the Commerce Department \nand ask what they are interested in, they say they are interested in \ncapital gains. ``We are not going to really spread our influence \naround. On the contrary, we are going to fight for capital gains and \nlet the Commerce Department and the President take care of that.''\n  I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to consider the faces of people \nwho will be hurt by this provision. Think of LeeAnn Gryc from my State \nof Minnesota who was 4 years old when the pajamas she was wearing \nignited, leaving her with second and third degree burns over 20 percent \nof her body. An official with the company that made the pajamas had \nwritten a memo 14 years earlier stating that because the material they \nused was so flammable the company was ``sitting on a powder keg.''\n  This bill contains a cap on the punitive damages a plaintiff could \nreceive. How would this affect LeeAnn? We are talking about people, we \nare talking about consumers. They may not be the heavy hitters, or the \nbig players, but that is who we are talking about.\n  It all depends on what kind of compensatory damages the jury awards. \nAre we really willing to sit here in Washington and dictate to LeeAnn \nand other victims of defective products how much is enough to punish \nand deter the people who hurt them?\n  The jury's role. By capping punitive damages this bill takes power \nout of the hands of the jury. This particularly confounds me. People on \njuries are fine when they are electing Members of the Senate to their \njobs. But apparently some of my colleagues do not trust them to sit in \njudgment of their peers. They sit in judgment of us, do they not? Are \nthey not usually the finders of facts? How is it that they lose their \ncompetence in the short trip from the ballot box to the jury box?\n  Elimination of joint liability. In Minnesota we struggled with this \nproblem and we have come to a middle ground. Joint liability only \napplies to wrongdoers who are over 15 percent responsible. But this \nbill would say that Minnesota's solution is not good enough. This bill \nwould preempt Minnesota's law with an extreme measure, one that my \nState at least has chosen not to embrace.\n  Again, Mr. President, real people, faces I would like my colleagues \nto see before they vote. Nancy Winkleman, a Minnesotan I met last year \nwho was in a car crash. Because a defective car underride bar failed to \noperate properly, the hood of her car went under the back of a truck \nand the passenger compartment came into direct contact with the rear \nend of the larger vehicle. Without the benefit of her car's own bumper \nto protect her, she was severely injured, losing part of her tongue and \nvirtually all of her lower jaw. Despite reconstructive surgery, her \nface and ability to speak will never be the same.\n  I cannot imagine the pain that Nancy must have undergone or the pain \nthat she undergoes every day, nor can my colleagues. If one of the \nresponsible parties in her case was unable to pay their fair share, \nshould she go uncompensated for some of that pain or should the other \nresponsible parties have to make it up? Unless you are certain, \ncolleagues, that it is more important to protect those other parties, \nwho usually have been found to be negligent, than to compensate Nancy \nfor her pain, you should not support this bill. If you do, you will be \nhurting real people, you will be hurting real people.\n\n  Statute of repose now cut down to 15 years. Jimmy Hoscheit was a boy \nat work on his family farm when he was hurt. I met Jimmy last year when \nhe was in my office telling me his story. He was using common farm \nmachinery, consisting of a tractor, a mill, and a blower, all linked \ntogether with a power transfer system, much like the drivetrain on a \ntruck. The power of the tractor was transferred to the other equipment \nby way of a spinning shaft, a shaft covered by a freely spinning metal \nsleeve. The sleeve is on bearings so if you were to grab the sleeve, it \nwould stop moving, while the shaft inside would continue to powerfully \nrotate at a very high speed.\n  Apparently when Jimmy leaned over the shaft to pick up a shovel, his \njacket touched the sleeve and got caught on it. However, instead of \nspinning free on the internal shaft, the sleeve somehow was bound to \nthe shaft, became wrapped in Jimmy's jacket and tore Jimmy's arms off. \nHis father found him flat on his back on the other side of the shaft. \nThe manufacturer could have avoided all of this if it just provided a \nsimple and inexpensive chain to anchor the shaft to the tractor.\n  I ask you, should Jimmy be able to bring suit against the \nmanufacturer? What if the product was over 15 years old? Does that make \nhis injury and his pain any less severe?\n  A similar question can be asked about 6-year-old Katie Fritz, another \nMinnesotan whose family I was privileged to meet when we began \nconsideration of the bill. This is about real people. Katie was killed \nwhen a defective garage door opener failed to reverse direction, \npinning her under the door, and crushing the breath out of her.\n  We do not know how long some of these machines can last. If that \ngarage was at a business and was over 20 years old, Katie's family \ncould not have sued the manufacturer. There would not be any question \nof capping punitive damages or having joint liability for noneconomic \ndamages. They simply would not be allowed to the courthouse door.\n  Mr. President--the big picture--on behalf of people like LeeAnn, \nJimmy, Katie, Nancy, real people, consumers, I urge my colleagues to \nreach into their\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nhearts and do the right thing, and to reject this bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter dated only yesterday from Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving in opposition to the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\n\n                                       Irving, TX, March 19, 1996.\n     Re H.R. 956 Conference Report.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 3 million members \n     and supporters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and \n     the thousands of victims of drunk drivers crashes in this \n     country, I urge you to oppose the H.R. 956 Conference Report \n     (The Common Sense Product Liability Act of 1996). While it \n     may not have been the intent of the sponsors and supporters \n     of this legislation to limit or restrict the rights of drunk \n     driving crash victims to be fully compensated for the harm \n     they have suffered, this will be one of the unintended \n     consequences of this bill in its present form.\n       It is clear that alcoholic beverages will fall within the \n     meaning of ``product'' in this bill and the term ``product \n     liability action'' in the bill means ``any civil action \n     brought on any theory of harm caused by a product or product \n     use.'' The limitations and restrictions imposed by this \n     legislation will limit recovery by victims of drunk driving \n     crashes against sellers who irresponsibly serve intoxicated \n     persons or minors who subsequently cause drunk driving \n     crashes killing or seriously injuring innocent victims. \n     Defendants in these dram shop cases will be able to use the \n     defenses and protections provided to them by this legislation \n     to prevent these innocent victims from being fully \n     compensated for the harm they have suffered.\n       The caps on punitive damages contained in this reform \n     legislation will directly benefit those who irresponsibly \n     serve alcoholic beverages to obviously intoxicated persons \n     and minors in violation of existing laws and in total \n     disregard for the safety of the citizens who drive on our \n     highways. In 1994, 16,589 people were killed and an estimated \n     950,000 were injured in drunk driving crashes in this \n     country. Punitive damages have historically been allowed \n     against defendants as a means of ``protecting the public'' \n     and ``deterring dangerous conduct.'' I know of no more \n     appropriate case for the imposition of punitive damages \n     without limitations than drunk driving and dram shop cases. \n     The limitations on recovery of non-economic damages and joint \n     and several liability are additional roadblocks this \n     legislation puts in front of drunk driving crash victims.\n       For the reasons outlined above, MADD urges you to oppose \n     the H.R. 956 Conference Report. The defects and unintended \n     consequences of this bill can be corrected and we can avoid \n     this rush to judgment which will have a devastating impact on \n     drunk driving crash victims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Katherine Prescott,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this opportunity \nto rise in opposition to the conference report to H.R. 965, the \nCommonsense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996.\n  Before I lay out my reasons for objecting to this conference report, \nI would like to express my dismay that while appointed as a conferee, I \nwas never invited to participate in the conference. I am very \ndisappointed that the legislative process has deteriorated to this \nlevel where diverse views are no longer welcome.\n  A critical analysis of the conference report to H.R. 965 reveals that \nthe balance tips in favor of product producers at the expense of \ninjured women, children, retires, and the poor.\n  This measure provides a series of limitations on the ability of \nvictims to recover from the manufacturers of defective products, while \nit expressly exempts the big businesses who support this bill from \nthose requirements.\n  For example, if company A purchases a piece of factory equipment from \ncompany B, and that piece of equipment is defective and explodes, \ncompany A can sue company B for all of its lost profits caused by the \ndisruption of company A's business. On the other hand, the family of \nthe poor worker who is operating the machine at the time it exploded \nmust face the limitations in the bill to recover. Further, if the piece \nof machinery is 15 years old or older, the worker or his family cannot \nrecover at all while the business faces no such limitation.\n  The punitive damage limitation in this bill causes me tremendous \nconcern. I find it ironic that in the punitive damage section of the \nbill, it clearly indicates that punitive damages may only be awarded in \nthe most serious cases. Yet later in that same section it provides that \nthe amount of damages that can be recovered for these most serious \ncases is limited to the greater of 2 times the economic and noneconomic \ndamages of $250,000. That same section further limits the ability to \nrecover damages by creating a special rule protecting individuals of \nlimited net worth and business or entities with a small number of \nemployees. The construction of this section is facially inconsistent \nwith its intent.\n  I would also like to debunk the myth that punitive damage awards \nthreaten the viability of many business. The evidence indicates \notherwise. Punitive damages are rarely awarded in product liability \ncases. In ``Demystifying the Functions of Punitive Damages in Products \nLiability: An Empirical Study of a Quarter Century of Verdicts'' \n(1991), author Michael Rustad concludes that consumer products are \nresponsible for an estimated 29,000 deaths and 30 million injuries each \nyear. Between 1965 and 1990, punitive damages were awarded in only 353 \nproduct liability cases--91 of which involved asbestos claims. In \naddition, he states that approximately 25 percent of these awards were \nreversed or remanded upon appeal. It is apparent that punitive damage \nawards do not threaten the viability of businesses.\n  In addition, this measure discriminates against women, children, and \nretirees. Women are most likely to be victims of such dangerous \nproducts as Dalkon shields, Copper-7 intrauterine devices, high \nestrogen birth control pills, super-absorbent tampons and silicone gel \nbreast implants. These products all were justly held liable for \npunitive damage awards and were removed from the market. Had this bill \nbeen in effect, punitive damage awards in these cases would have been \nseverely limited and the impetus for these companies to remove these \ndangerous products from the market may not have been as strong.\n  H.R. 956 also makes noneconomic damages more difficult to recover. \nAgain, women, children and the poor are disproportionately impacted. It \nfundamentally alters the traditional concept of joint and several \nliability by eliminating joint liability. H.R. 956 places the harm \ncaused by defective breast implants, or a women's loss of her ability \nto bear children, or the disabling of a child, in a secondary position \nto that of the lost salary of a corporate executive.\n  The corporate executive who misses work because of an injury caused \nby a product is unfettered in his ability to recover millions because \nhe can easily establish his economic damages. However, if a young woman \nloses her ability to ever become a mother because of a defective \ncontraceptive device, she is made to endure additional difficulties to \nrecover compensation and, under the bill, faces the risk of not being \nable to collect her damages at all since these are noneconomic. This is \ninherently unfair.\n  On a very personal note, if I may, Mr. President, thank God that \nprovisions of this law were not part of the American military laws at \nthe time I had the privilege of serving this country in uniform. On May \n30, 1947, I was retired, not as a general, not as a colonel, but as a \nsmall captain. I was awarded at that time the sum of $175 a month for \nthe loss of my arm. I would like to believe that my arm is worth much \nmore than that. But Uncle Sam did not forget us. That amounted to \n$2,100 per year. Today, Uncle Sam, understanding the rising cost of \nliving, is now awarding me $19,140 a year tax free.\n  In addition to that, Uncle Sam sees to it that if I desire, I can \nreceive medical services for the rest of my life. The same thing for my \nspouse. I have received free education as a result, receiving my law \ndegree. If this provision was in effect at that time, I would end up \nreceiving $175 a month, if I am lucky, for the rest of my life. In \nother words, Mr. President, Uncle Sam has paid me in damages, and never \nonce did they ask me, is this the most serious of cases? They did not \nask me about strict liability. It made no difference whether I fell off \na jeep or was struck by a shell. I received in excess of\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n$383,000. I think the least that can be done is to do the same for \nfellow citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Commonsense \nProduct Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996. This piece of legislation \nhas been crafted carefully. It is tempered. It is moderate. It is \nbipartisan.\n  We now live in the most litigious country on Earth, and we are paying \na huge price as a result. Year after year, companies are forced to lay \noff workers or shut down entirely because of the staggering cost of \nproduct liability insurance or because of the threat of outrageous \ndamage awards that in many cases bear no relation whatever to the \nunderlying claims. This bill will help stem that tide. It will help \npreserve jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs, and it will help create \njobs.\n  At a time in our country when there is so much focus on worker \nunrest, so much focus on the loss of good manufacturing jobs, when \nthere is so much talk about finding ways to stimulate the economy, this \nis an easy call. It is a bipartisan bill. It is supported by 90 percent \nof the American public. We all know that the only real group that \nopposes it is a small band of plaintiff's attorneys who have become \nwealthy at the expense of the public at large. It is the trial lawyers \nand a few special interest groups that are preventing this bill from \nbecoming law.\n\n  Mr. President, critics of the House-Senate compromise are concerned \nabout the violation of States rights. This is one area where a \nfederalism argument simply does not hold water. The Framers of the \nConstitution valued local decisionmaking and they wanted to avoid an \noverly centralized Federal Government. However, one important exception \nthey recognized was the need to have Federal control over interstate \ncommerce and trade.\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 11, wrote about his concerns \nthat diverse and conflicting State regulations would be an impediment \nto American merchants. Today, the abuses in our product liability \nsystem have reached the point where they are, indeed, a major \nimpediment to interstate commerce. The Commerce Department had reported \nthat over 70 percent of the goods manufactured in a particular State \nare shipped out of that State and sold. Moreover, the National \nGovernors' Association, the obvious protector of States rights, has \nadopted three resolutions calling on Congress to enact a uniform \nFederal product liability law, most recently in January of 1995.\n  Opponents of this legislation have also argued the so-called hard cap \non punitive damages. But there is no hard cap on punitive damages. The \nbill permits punitive damages to be awarded against large businesses up \nto the greater of $250,000 or two times the claimant's compensatory \ndamages. It is critical to note that it is two times compensatory \ndamages, not just economic damages. Two times compensatory damages will \nstill permit huge punitive damages awards in almost all product \nliability cases where such punitive damages are appropriate.\n  The damage awards in this country will still be astronomically higher \nthan in any other industrialized nation, but at least there will be \nsome limits that businesses can hang their hats on. If that were not \nenough, the trial judge is given the discretion to award even more if \nhe or she thinks it is appropriate. This is not a hard cap. All it does \nis inject an element of predictability into our legal system.\n  If you asked most citizens in this country whether or not they think \nit is fair to cut off lawsuits 15 years after a product was \nmanufactured, most would agree that is eminently reasonable. And even \nthis modest limit does not apply in cases involving motor vehicles, \nvessels, aircraft, passenger trains, or in any case involving toxic \nharm.\n\n  At the end of the day, when you finish sifting through the opponents' \nconcerns with this bill, it is clear that the trial lawyers are \nexercising an inordinate amount of political muscle. Their opposition \nto this bill is clearly in their own interest. But it is bad politics, \nand it is terrible policy.\n  American workers and American businesses need this bill. Industry \ntrade associations report that today 30 percent of the price of a step \nladder, 33 percent of the price of a general aviation aircraft, 95 \npercent of the price of a childhood vaccine are all due to costs of \nproduct liability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge the President \nto rethink his position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes, 22 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 7 minutes, 22 seconds to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I supported the Senate-passed product \nliability bill, and I am very proud of that. I think the findings in \nthe conference report very clearly state why there needs to be a \nproduct liability bill, not the least of which is some uniformity all \nthe way across the broad consumer market, known as the United States of \nAmerica. While I supported the Senate-passed bill, the conference \nreport, I believe, raises some new questions, points of controversy \nthat, since I am not a lawyer, I cannot resolve. I ask one party and \nthey say one thing; I ask another party and they say another. This may \nmean clarification is needed. It may mean that substantive changes need \nto be made. But surely, it means, I believe, that we should send this \nbill back to conference.\n  I want, very briefly, in the time afforded me, to make five points. \nThe first is the section, or the move of the section, on negligent \nentrustment. Negligent entrustment, as it was presented in the Senate \nbill, applied to the entire bill, and now, in this bill, it has been \nplaced in a section on ``Liability Rules Applicable to Product Sellers, \nRenters, and Lessors.'' This move, I am told, also then places a cap on \npunitive damages in negligent entrustment actions, and subjects them to \nthe limitations on joint and several liability.\n  This is a problem to me because, in the event of automobiles and \ndrunk drivers, guns sold or given to people who misuse them, this could \nhave an impact on the kinds and types of suits and the amount of \njudgments derived therefrom. Therefore, my belief is that this entire \nissue of negligent entrustment needs to be clarified so that we are \ncertain that the exception applies throughout the entire bill.\n  Second the statute of repose. California has no statute of repose. \nThe proposed statute of repose in the Senate bill was 20 years, and now \nit is down to 15 years in the conference report. The bill provides, \nhowever, that any State with a statute of repose that is under 15 years \nprevails. California, with no statute of repose, cannot have a higher \nstandard and maintain no statute of repose. But a State with a lesser \nstandard of, let us say, a 10-year statute of repose, can prevail. To \nme, this is unsatisfactory. For my vote, I would have a very difficult \ntime having a statute of repose in a bill which is less than 20 years.\n  I believe it sends a wrong signal to U.S. manufacturers. I believe it \nsends a message to manufacturers all across this great land that they \ncan, in fact, manufacture less durable and perhaps even less safe \nproducts, because their time for liability is cut dramatically, \ncertainly from no statute of repose to a 15-year statute of repose. \nThis is a dramatic change in the bill.\n  The third point is the definition of durable goods. Durable goods are \nsubject to the statute of repose. In the definition on page 4 of the \nconference report, section 101, subsection 7, one comma has been \ndeleted and one has been added. I must say that what could be just \ngrammatical has caused a maelstrom of interpretation and \nmisinterpretation. And I, frankly, do not know who to believe.\n  This may be a drafting error, or it may be an intentional change in \nmeaning. But many people point out to me that this change of a comma \ncould change the definition of durable goods.\n  The fourth point I would like to make has to do with the additur \nprovision, and this relates to punitive damages. I believe it needs \nfurther clarification. As I understand the additur provision in this \nconference bill, it provides that if a State has a cap on punitive \ndamages and does not authorize an additur, then a judge is unlikely to \nhave the authority to award punitive damages above the State cap. I \nbelieve this needs to be cleared up by the conference committee.\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n  My fifth point has to do with biomaterials. I come from a State with \nmany responsible companies who are very concerned about the possibility \nof losing their supplies of raw materials. They need this legislation \nbecause they produce lifesaving devices, whether they be pacemakers, or \nheart starters. I was visited by a very young woman who had a condition \nin which her heart periodically would just stop, and she had an \nimplanted device that would restart her heart. Her heart would \nsometimes stop when she was asleep. The people that made some of the \nmaterials that went into this device essentially would not provide it \nabsent some release from liability.\n  But, as presently drafted, biomaterials suppliers--including \nsuppliers of component parts--can be liable only if they fail to meet \ntheir contract specifications, or if they fail to properly register \ntheir materials with the FDA.\n  First, I think we need a better definition of what is a ``component \npart'' in the bill to ensure that this does not sweep too broadly, and \nto ensure that this language would not allow certain manufacturers of \ndevices to escape liability. I believe it is also very important that \nraw materials suppliers who know that their products pose a potential \nhazard and fail to disclose such harm should be held liable for knowing \nbehavior.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this should be a great day. It should be \na great day for small business. It should be a great day for employees \nof those businesses. It should be a great day for consumers. It should \nbe a great day for those unfortunate enough to be injured by defective \nproducts.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nI am extremely pleased and proud to see the Senate take up \nconsideration of the conference report to H.R. 965, the Commonsense \nProduct Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996. This is historic. Never in \nalmost two decades of work have we gotten this far. I am deeply \nsaddened, however, by the President's announced intention to veto this \nimportant legislation.\n  I am also quite puzzled. You see, as Governor of Arkansas, Bill \nClinton in August 1991, sat on the committee that drafted and \nunanimously approved the National Governors Association's [NGA] first \nresolution supporting product liability reform. Governor Clinton also \nwent on record in support of the second resolution favoring product \nliability reform passed by the NGA.\n  Mr. President, America is plagued by frivolous lawsuits. Every day, \nour economy is victimized by ridiculous damage awards, both real and \nthreatened. This conference agreement represents a substantial reform \nof the legal system that allows this abuse. It is tragic some have \nallowed this effort to formulate meaningful policy to be overtaken by \npolitical posturing. It is election year politics at its worst. The sad \nthing is the posturing is being done for the benefit of certain special \ninterests. Tragically, if the special interests win, the American \npeople lose.\n\n\n                Brief History of the Struggle for Reform\n\n  Mr. President, over the past 15 years the Commerce Committee has held \n23 days of hearings on product liability reform. In this Congress, the \ncompanion measure to H.R. 965--S. 565--was reported by the Commerce \nCommittee on April 6, 1995. The bill marked the seventh reform bill \nreported by the Commerce Committee since 1981. I have been involved \ndeeply in the product liability reform movement since that time. I was \nan original cosponsor of the Risk Retention Act that became law in \n1981. This legislation provided for liability insurance pools--so-\ncalled risk retention groups--for businesses. I chaired Small Business \nCommittee field hearings in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, SD, on this \nissue in 1985.\n  Over the years, I sponsored numerous product liability reform bills \nwith some of the great leaders in this area including Senators Kasten \nand Danforth. These gentlemen are no longer Members of this body, but \nthis legislation is their legacy. I want to commend them for their \nexcellent work. They truly pioneered much of this effort. It has \nbrought us to this point. We would not have gotten this far without \nthem.\n  Let me also take a moment to commend two of our current colleagues--\nSenators Gorton and Rockefeller--for their hard work and dedication to \nthis process. They have given years of labor to a cause in which they \nboth are committed and have done so in an extraordinarily bipartisan \nfashion. I also know Jeanne Bumpus and Trent Erickson of Senator \nGorton's staff and Tamera Stanton, Jim Gottlieb, and Ellen Doneski with \nSenator Rockefeller have given much of the past year, and in some cases \nmore time than that, to this effort. On my own staff, I want to commend \nTom Hohenthaner, deputy chief of staff for the Commerce Committee, who \nhas worked this issue for years and in this Congress managed what has \noften been a tortuous process. I also thank Lance Bultena, counsel for \nthe Consumer Subcommittee, for his dedicated efforts.\n  Let me next pay tribute to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry \nHyde who also served as chairman ofthe conference. Henry and I were in \nthe same freshman class in the House back in 1974, and I have been \nhonored to serve with him over the years. At the first meeting of the \nconference, I likened Chairman Hyde to a beacon shining brightly in a \nfield. I would say that his light never wavered in this process and \nwithout his fine leadership we would not be here today. Chairman Hyde \nwas assisted in this process by Alan Coffee, general counsel and staff \ndirector for the House Judiciary Committee and a savvy veteran of many \nlegislative battles over the years. Diana Schacht and Peter Levinson, \nboth counsels to the Judiciary Committee, and both consummate \nprofessionals, also put in a great many hours in this process. Finally, \nthe House Commerce Committee shared jurisdiction over this measure, and \nI think and commend Chairman Bliley for his leadership. Robert Gordon, \ncounsel to the House Commerce Committee, proved a dedicated and \nsignificant member of the team of staff--all of whom worked so hard on \nthis conference agreement and legislation that preceded it. Again, I \nthank them all.\n\n  I know many--including many of our colleagues in the other body--\nwould have liked to see much broader reform. Indeed, many in this body \nwanted more. So why this fairly narrow and moderate approach? The short \nanswer is: expansion was not possible. We tried. Last April 24 the \nSenate began consideration of the legislation. Over the next 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks--and some 90 hours of debate--the Senate considered and voted on \nover 30 amendments.\n  Ultimately, the Senate passed a bill very similar to the legislation \nreported by the Commerce Committee. In the following months, we \nnegotiated with our colleagues in the other body who had passed a much \nbroader bill. Again, activity centered around the possibility of \nexpanding the scope of the Senate bill. Mr. President, the bill that \nhas emerged from conference is--virtually--the Senate-passed bill. It \nis extraordinarily close to the legislation we sent out of the Commerce \nCommittee last spring. The Senate should pass it again.\n  The conference agreement is narrower than many of us would like. \nHowever, while limited in scope, it is an excellent piece of \nlegislation. This bill is fair, balanced, and well reasoned. Indeed, it \nis a moderate package of reforms. It also keeps faith with what we set \nout to accomplish--it provides substantial reform to a legal system \nthat is broken.\n\n\n                 Highlights of the Conference Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, let me highlight some of those much-needed reforms:\n  Punitive damages. The conference agreement provides that punitive \ndamages may be awarded in a product liability case if a plaintiff \nproves, by ``clear and convincing evidence,'' that his or her harm was \ncaused by the defendant's ``conscious, flagrant indifference to the \nsafety of others.'' This language is to make clear that punitive \ndamages are only to be awarded in the most serious of cases.\n  Mr. President, a fact all too often overlooked in this debate is that \npunitive damages are not intended as compensation for injured parties. \nThey are punishment. Punishment of defendants found to have injured \nothers in a conscious manner. They are used much as fines in the \ncriminal system. However, currently there are two big differences. \nFirst, unlike the criminal system, there are virtually no standards for \nwhen punitive damages may be awarded. Second, when awarded, there are \nno\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\nclear guidelines as to their amount. This agreement addresses both \nproblems. It brings uniformity to the punishment and deterrence phase \nof product liability law by providing a meaningful standard for when \npunitives are to be imposed and at what level.\n  Under the conference agreement--except in cases against small \nbusinesses--punitive damages in a product liability case may be awarded \nup to two times compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. \nAn additur provision permits the judge to award punitive damages beyond \nthis limit if certain factors are met, but the judge cannot exceed the \namount of the jury's original award.\n  When the defendant is a small business--or similar entity--with less \nthan 25 full-time employees, punitive damages may not exceed $250,000 \nor two times compensatory damages, whichever is less. The additur \nprovision does not apply to small businesses.\n  Finally, either party can request the trail be conducted in two \nphases, one dealing with compensatory damages and the other dealing \nwith punitive damages. The same jury is used in both phases.\n  Joint and several liability. Joint liability is abolished for \nnoneconomic damages--such as pain and suffering--in product liability \ncases. Joint liability is a concept allowing one defendant to be held \nliable for all damages even though others also were responsible for the \ndamage caused. What are the consequences? Too often, it means one \nperson is held responsible for the conduct of another. True wrongdoers \nare not held liable. Indeed, consumers ultimately pay these claims--\neither through higher prices, loss of service, or higher insurance \npremiums.\n\n  Therefore, as to noneconomic damages, under this bill defendants \nwould be liable only in direct proportion to their responsibility for \nthe claimant's harm--so-called several liability. This section goes a \nlong way toward correcting one of the most often abused aspects of our \ncurrent civil legal system. It would ensure defendants would be held \nliable based on their degree of fault or responsibility, not the depth \nof their pockets.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue on which I have worked for many \nyears. In 1986, I fought to strengthen proposed product liability \nlegislation, S. 2760, with an amendment regarding joint and several \nliability. My amendment--which passed the Commerce Committee--also \nabrogated joint and several liability for noneconomic damages in \nproduct liability cases. I am proud the spirit of my amendment of a \ndecade ago lives on in this legislation.\n  Alcohol and drugs defense. Under this bill, the defendant in a \nproduct liability case has an absolute defense if the plaintiff was \nunder the influence of intoxicating alcohol, illegal drugs, or misuse \nof a prescription drug and as a result of this influence was more than \n50 percent responsible for his or her own injuries.\n  The philosophy behind such a provision is simple. A society working \nhard to discourage alcohol and drug abuse must not sanction such abuse \nby allowing individuals to collect damages when their disregard of a \nvital societal norm is the primary cause of an accident.\n  Misuse and alteration defense. Under this legislation, a defendant's \nliability in a product liability case is reduced to the extent a \nclaimant's harm is due to the misuse or alternation of a product. Why \nshould the manufacturer of a machine pay for injuries I sustain because \nI remove safety guards put on in the factory?\n  Statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for product \nliability claims is established as 2 years from when the claimant \ndiscovered or reasonably should have discovered both the harm and its \ncause. A plaintiff may not file suit after this time.\n  This is an excellent example of how this legislation would benefit \nvictims. Under current law, some States establish the time of injury as \nthe point at which the time for bringing a claim begins to run. Often \nthis is not a problem. However, in cases in which the harm has a \nlatency period or manifests itself only after repeated exposure to the \nproduct, the claimant may not know immediately if he or she has been \nharmed or the cause of the harm.\n  This bill thus would reduce the number of victims who, having \notherwise meritorious claims, are denied justice solely on the basis of \nthe statute of limitations in the State in which they file their claim.\n  Statute of repose. A statute of repose of 15 years is established for \ncertain durable goods. A durable good is defined by the bill as one \nhaving either: a normal life expectancy of 3 or more years, or a normal \nlife expectancy that can be depreciated under applicable IRS \nregulations; and is: first, used in trade or business; second, held for \nthe production of income; or third, sold or donated to a governmental \nor private entity for the production of goods, training, demonstration \nor any similar purpose.\n  No product liability suit may be filed for injuries related to the \nuse of a durable good 15 years after its delivery unless the defendant \nmade an express warranty in writing as to the safety of the specified \nproduct involved, and the warranty was longer than 15 years. In such a \ncase, the statute of repose does not apply until that warranty period \nis complete. The statute of repose section does not apply in cases \ninvolving toxic harm.\n  States would be free to impose shorter statutes of repose and to \ncover more than just durable goods. For instance, the House-passed \nversion of this bill would have applied the statute of repose to all \ngoods.\n  The need for a Federal statute of repose was presented well by a \nfellow South Dakotan, Art Kroetch, chairman of Scotchman Industries, \nInc., a small manufacturer of machine tools located in Philip, SD. Last \nyear during hearings, Art told the Commerce Committee how vital product \nliability reform is to the ability of American manufacturers to compete \nin the global marketplace.\n  Art told me that under the current patchwork of liability laws, his \ncompany pays twice as much for product liability insurance as it does \nfor research and development. Mr. President, the system is broken.\n  Workers compensation subrogation standards. This provision preserves \nan employer's right to recover workers compensation benefits from a \nmanufacturer whose product harmed a worker--for instance, the \nmanufacturer of a machine used in a business which injures an \nemployee--unless the manufacturer can prove, by clear and convincing \nevidence, that the employer caused the injury--for example by \nmaintaining an unsafe work environment or taking safety guards off the \nmachine.\n  This section of the bill makes no changes to the amount of damages an \ninjured worker can recover in such cases. It merely provides the \ninsurer or employer will not be able to recover workers compensation \nbenefits it paid to an injured employee if the employer or a coemployee \nis at fault.\n  Biomaterials Access assurance. In certain actions in which a \nplaintiff alleges harm from a medical implant, title II of the \nlegislation allows biomaterial suppliers to be dismissed from the \naction without extensive discovery or other legal costs. The term \n``biomaterial'' refers to the raw materials--such as plastic tubing or \ncopper wiring--used as part of an implantable medical device.\n  The legislation does not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue \nmanufacturers or sellers of medical implants. However, it releases \nbiomaterials suppliers from lawsuits if the generic raw material used \nin the medical device met contract specifications, and if the \nbiomaterials supplier cannot be classified as either a manufacturer or \nseller of the medical implant.\n  During our hearings last year, the Commerce Committee heard \ncompelling testimony that without such changes in the law, the millions \nof Americans who depend upon a variety of implantable medical devices \nwill be at grave risk. Suppliers of biomaterials have found the risks \nand costs of responding to litigation related to medical implants far \nexceeds potential revenues from the sale of the components they \nmanufacture.\n  Indeed, several major suppliers of raw materials used in the \nmanufacture of implantable medical devices have announced they will \nlimit--or altogether cease--shipments of crucial raw materials to \ndevice manufacturers. Each of the suppliers indicated these were \nrational and necessary business decisions given the current legal \nframework.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n                  Product Liability and Small Business\n\n  Mr. President, during the last Congress it was my privilege to serve \nas ranking member of the Committee on Small Business. As a member of \nthat panel for many years, I know product liability reform is essential \nto the future health and success of America's small businesses. Indeed, \naccording to a Small Business Administration study, small firms may be \naffected more negatively than large firms by nonuniform product \nliability laws.\n  This is because small businesses do not enjoy economies of scale in \nproduction and litigation costs. In addition, they are less able to \nbargain with potential plaintiffs. Finally, their limited assets make \nadequate insurance much more difficult to obtain. The cost of product \nliability insurance in the United States is 15 times higher than that \nof similar insurance in Japan and 20 times higher than in European \ncountries. We simply cannot compete.\n  America's small businesses need rationality and uniformity in the \nproduct liability system if they are to compete effectively in the \nglobal marketplace. As I explained previously, this point was at the \nheart of the testimony given by Art Kroetch of Scotchman Industries in \nPhilip, SD, at committee hearings last year.\n  It also was the point made to me by Jim Cope of Morgen Manufacturing \nin Yankton, SD. Jim calls product liability reform a jobs issue for our \nState. Morgen has had to lay off workers and has been unable to give \nraises to other employees because of losses due to product liability \nclaims--claims that never have resulted in a verdict against his \ncompany. Nevertheless, Morgen Manufacturing is forced to spend tens of \nthousands of dollars defending itself.\n  To Jim Cope--and many small business owners just like him--tort \nreform means more jobs for South Dakota and the Nation.\n\n\n                 product liability reform and consumers\n\n  Mr. President, opponents of this legislation tell us it would hurt \nthe American consumer. Don't you believe it. Aside from the jobs issue, \nproduct liability reform would benefit consumers in numerous ways.\n  It would lower the cost of U.S. goods. The current product liability \nsystem accounts for 20 percent of the cost of a ladder, 50 percent of \nthe cost of a football helmet, and up to 95 percent of the cost of some \npharmaceuticals.\n  Reform also would foster competition and provide consumers with a \ngreater selection of products from which to choose. Studies tell us 47 \npercent of U.S. companies have withdrawn products from the market and \n39 percent have decided not to introduce products due to liability \nconcerns. As a result, Americans depend on single sources to provide \nsuch vital needs as vaccines for polio, measles, rubella, rabies, \ndiphtheria, and tetanus.\n  This bill also would encourage safety improvements. By contrast, the \ncurrent system actually discourages companies from engaging in \nresearch. Many fear research aimed at improving an existing product \nwill be used against them to demonstrate they knew the product was not \nas safe as it could be. Certainty in the legal system would reduce this \ncounterproductive effect.\n  In addition, the legislation would encourage wholesalers and \nretailers to deal with responsible and reputable manufacturers. This, \nin turn, would lead to better products for consumers. Under the \nconference agreement, product sellers would be legally responsible for \nproducts manufactured by companies that are insolvent or do not have \nassets in the United States. This should increase the quality of the \nproducts found on the shelves of U.S. businesses.\n  Mr. President, I have just outlined five ways this bill benefits \nconsumers. First, it will mean more jobs. Second, it will lower the \ncost of the goods they purchase. Third, it will mean a greater \nselection of goods from which to choose. Fourth, it will encourage \ntesting to make goods safer. Finally, it will help to maintain and, in \nsome cases, improve the quality of products available to consumers.\n  A bill that is bad for consumers? How can they say that with a \nstraight face?\n\n\n                product liability reform and the injured\n\n  Mr. President, we also have been subjected to a great deal of \nnonsense that this bill would limit the rights of victims. Opponents \npaint the picture of injured victims being harmed further when the \ncourthouse door hits them in the face.\n  Not only does this conference agreement leave intact a full range of \nvictims rights, it actually improves the current system in at least two \nvery critical ways. First, the system we have today is plagued by \ndelay. Second, compensation that eventually is received often is \ninequitable. Curtailing frivolous lawsuits--all this legislation really \nseeks to achieve--would significantly improve both problems.\n  Currently, product liability suits take a very long time to process. \nA General Accounting Office study found, on average, that product \nliability cases took 2\\1/2\\ years to move from filing to trial court \nverdict. Other studies indicate it is more like 5 years. Most product \nliability cases are settled before trial, but even these cases suffer \nfrom delay. One plaintiff's attorney explained that ``most settlement \nnegotiations get serious only a week or so before trial is scheduled to \nbegin.''\n  Delay often results in undercompensation of victims. Many victims are \nforced to settle their claims for less than their full losses so they \ncan obtain compensation more quickly. These individuals often are \nforced into this decision because of inadequate resources to cover \nmedical and rehabilitation expenses while their case drags on.\n  Another way in which the current system inequitably compensates \nvictims concerns proportionality. Numerous studies demonstrate the \ncurrent tort system grossly overpays people with small losses, while \nunderpaying people with the most serious losses.\n  A bill that limits victims rights? Try a bill that strengthens them.\n\n\n                The Truth About Product Liability Reform\n\n  There you have it, Mr. President--the truth about what it is we are \ntrying to accomplish. The truth about how this bill would help \nconsumers, small businesses and, yes, even those injured in the use of \na product.\n  The truth is, we would not change anything that is right with \nAmerica's current civil justice system. Rather, we would curb the abuse \nof frivolous lawsuits that cost each and every one of us in a wide \nvariety of ways each and every day. The courthouse doors stay open. \nConsumers retain a full complement of rights. Lawsuits would continue \nto provide a strong check on corporate behavior. Concepts such as \ncontingent fees would continue to allow citizens with limited means to \nbring suit.\n  The truth, Mr. President, is that election year politics threaten to \nkill this effort. The truth is, we all lose if that happens. The truth \nis the American people know the current system is broken and want us to \nfix it. A recent poll conducted in my home State found 83 percent of \nSouth Dakotans responding feel ``the present liability system has \nproblems and should be improved,'' while only 10 percent said ``the \npresent liability lawsuit system is working well and should not be \nchanged.''\n  The truth is, that out there in the real America, this is not viewed \nas a partisan issue. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats, 83 percent of \nindependents, and 88 percent of Republicans in South Dakota responding \nto the survey I just quoted say there are problems that need to be \nfixed. Mr. President, the message is clear. Our constituents do not \nbelieve this should be a political fight. I cannot for the life of me \nunderstand why some among us wish to make it so.\n  We should adopt this conference agreement. This body approved a \nvirtually identical bill last year. Nothing done in conference should \nchange anyone's reasoning. This is a moderate and reasoned bill. Let us \ndo what is right. Adopt the conference agreement and send it on to the \nPresident. Hopefully, he will remember the strong commitment he \ndemonstrated to product liability on two separate occasions just a few \nshort years ago. Hopefully, he will not allow special interests to \ncontinue playing politics. The stakes are simply too high.\n\n\n             the need to address liability for biomaterials\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this bill contains a very important \nprovision ensuring the availability of raw materials and component \nparts for implantable medical devices. This provision is necessary if \nAmericans are to have continued access to a wide variety\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\nof life-saving devices, such as brain shunts, heart valves, artificial \nblood vessels, and pacemakers. To address this issue, Senator Leiberman \nand I cosponsored the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1994, which \nhas been incorporated in the Product Liability Fairness Act which we \nare debating today.\n  Currently, the manufacturers and suppliers of materials used in \nimplantable medical devices are subject to substantial legal liability \nfor selling relatively small amounts of materials to medical device \nmanufacturers. These sales generate relatively small profits and are \noften used for purposes beyond their direct control. Due to their small \nprofit margins and large legal vulnerability for these sales, some of \nthe manufacturers and suppliers of these materials are now refusing to \nprovide them for use in medical devices.\n  It is absolutely essential that a continued supply of raw materials \nand component parts is available for the invention, development, \nimprovement, and maintenance of medical devices. Most of these devices \nare made with materials and parts that are not designed or manufactured \nspecifically for use in implantable devices. Their primary use is in \nnonmedical products. Medical device manufacturers use only small \nquantities of these raw materials and component parts, and this market \nconstitutes a small portion of the overall market for such raw \nmaterials.\n  While raw materials and component parts suppliers do not design, \nproduce or test the final medical implant, they have been sued in cases \nalleging inadequate design and testing of, or warnings related to use \nof, permanently implanted medical devices. The cost of defending these \nsuits often exceeds the profits generated by the sale of materials. \nThis is the reason that some manufacturers and suppliers have begun to \ncease supplying their products for use in permanently implanted medical \ndevices.\n  Unless alternative sources of supply can be found, the unavailability \nof raw materials and component parts will lead to unavailability of \nlife-saving and life-enhancing medical devices. The prospects for \ndevelopment of new sources of supply for the full range of threatened \nraw materials and component parts are remote, as other suppliers around \nthe world are refusing to sell raw materials or component parts for use \nin manufacturing permanently implantable medical devices in the United \nStates.\n  The product liability concerns that are causing the unavailability of \nraw materials and component parts for medical implants is part of a \nlarger product liability crisis in this country. Immediate action is \nnecessary to ensure the availability of raw materials and component \nparts for medical devices so that Americans have access to the devices \nthey need. Addressing this problem will solve one important aspect of \nour broken medical product liability system.\n  This issue came to my attention when I was contacted by one of my \nconstituents, Linda Flake Ransom, about daughter Tara who requires a \nsilicon brain shunt. Without a shunt, due to Tara's condition called \nhydrocephalus, excess fluid would build up in her brain, increasing \npressure, and causing permanent brain damage, blindness, paralysis, and \nultimately death. With the shunt, she is a healthy, happy, and \nproductive straight A student with enormous promise and potential.\n  Tara has already undergone the brain shunt procedure five times in \nher brief life. However, the next time that she needs to replace her \nshunt, it is not certain that a new one will be available due to the \nunavailability of shunt materials. This situation is a sad example that \nour medical liability system is out of control. It is tragic, but not \nsurprising, that manufacturers have decided not to provide materials if \nthey are subject to tens of millions of dollars of potential liability \nfor doing so.\n  It is essential that individuals such as Tara continue to have access \nto the medical devices they need to stay alive and healthy. Addressing \nthis issue by enacting the Product Liability Act would help to ensure \nthe ongoing availability of materials necessary to make these devices. \nIt would not, in any way, protect negligent manufacturers or suppliers \nof medical devices, or even manufacturers or suppliers of biomaterials \nthat make negligent claims about their products. However, it would \nprotect manufacturers and suppliers whose materials are being used in a \nmanner that is beyond their control.\n  Mr. President, we must act today to ensure the continued availability \nof biomaterials to ensure that the lives of Tara and thousands of other \nAmericans are not jeopardized. I ask unanimous consent that a column \nfrom the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Lawyers May Kill My Daughter'' \nbe printed in the Record. In this column, Tara's mother eloquently \ndescribes her daughter's condition and the need for this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                      Lawyers May Kill My Daughter\n\n                           (By Linda Ransom)\n\n       Our daughter Tara was diagnosed at birth with \n     hydrocephalus--sometimes called ``water on the brain.'' In \n     the old days, there was no treatment for hydrocephalus. Most \n     babies diagnosed with it died within months. The lucky few \n     who survived were severely handicapped. These days, the only \n     medical intervention that works is a surgically implanted \n     device called a shunt, made of silicone. The shunt is a tube \n     and a pump that diverts excess fluid from Tara's brain.\n       Kids outgrow shunts, which is why Tara has already had five \n     shunt surgeries. She will need more. There are no guarantees \n     that there won't be complications from the surgeries--she's \n     already had meningitis, hypotonia and temporary blindness. \n     But before the new flexible silicone plastics were developed, \n     shunts were not successful. We know that there are no \n     guarantees even with a silicone shunt, but at least we have \n     something that works.\n       Tara has come a long way. Eight years old, she has mastered \n     skipping, jumping rope, roller skating and all the other \n     things that kids do at her age. Until this year, she didn't \n     even need glasses. She never read the ``risk'' statistics \n     because she has been too busy reading the original 14 books \n     of the Wizard of Oz series. Tara is currently in the third \n     grade at Magnet Traditional School in Phoenix. She has been \n     the top student in her class for the past two years, with \n     most of her skills well above the fifth grade level.\n       More importantly, Tara is the perfect example of hope--hope \n     in the skill of her surgeons, in advances in medical \n     technology, and improvements in the shunt itself. She is also \n     the symbol of our faith--faith in our belief that God's \n     miracles are the hands of the surgeons and the minds of the \n     scientists who make the discoveries and create the devices.\n       Without a shunt, however, she faces increased pressure in \n     her brain leading to progressive retardation, blindness, \n     paralysis and death. In the U.S., there are approximately \n     50,000 hydrocephalics like Tara depending on shunts to stay \n     alive. That is about the same number of Americans who died in \n     Vietnam. Hydrocephalics will never get their own wall in \n     Washington, but they would leave behind just as many \n     devastated families.\n       Although scientists are working on new and better shunts, \n     no one can guarantee that a shunt will be available the next \n     time Tara needs one. Because of lawsuit abuse, the silicone \n     from which the shunt is made may no longer be available.\n       Dow Corning, the only manufacturer of raw silicone used in \n     shunts, last year filed for bankruptcy as a result of \n     thousands of lawsuits against their silicone breast implants. \n     (These implants were recently found to be safe in numerous \n     studies, including a Harvard report released in the current \n     Journal of the American Medical Association.) Despite a \n     preponderance of evidence that silicone products are safe, \n     lawyers have signaled that they will now make all silicone \n     devices a focus of their next big class action.\n       Because of liability and legal blackmail, chemical \n     companies are no longer willing to sell the raw materials \n     that go into these desperately needed products--from \n     pacemakers and heart values, to knee joints and cataract \n     lenses. For Tara's shunt, there are no alternative materials \n     or suppliers that can be used.\n       No one denies there should be just compensation for gross \n     errors, like the man in Florida who had the wrong leg \n     amputated. But how can anyone be for speculative lawsuits \n     against all silicone products when people desperately need \n     these devices to live? How can anyone put the interests of a \n     small group of trial lawyers seeking the next big class \n     action lawsuit over the lives of children?\n       This lottery system creates big winners, but it also \n     creates new losers. In Sara's case, no amount of money can \n     buy a product that may no longer be manufacured because of a \n     lack of raw materials--even if it is a life-saving device.\n       Lack of availability is creating a black market for medical \n     devices in other countries. Tara's neurosurgeon told us that \n     shunts are so scarce in Russia today, they are removed from \n     bodies during autopsies and then used in new patients. Would \n     you want a used device if you needed a pacemaker? Would you \n     want to buy a shunt on the black market? Would you want your \n     child to be on a waiting list for one?\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\n       The good news is there are reform efforts under-way in \n     Arizona and at the federal level. The Senate is planning to \n     vote, as early as today, on legislation to place reasonable \n     limits on punitive damages and eliminate unfair allocations \n     of liability in all civil cases. This would protect all \n     Americans--not just the manufacturers of medical products but \n     also small businesses, service providers, local governments \n     and nonprofit groups. Above all, it would save children like \n     Tara. Unfortunately, even if the bill passes, President \n     Clinton has said he will veto it.\n       I'm not a legal expert. I'm just a desperate mother. But I \n     know that reasonable changes must be made to protect \n     everyone. Enact civil justice reform. Don't take hope away \n     from Tara.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 956, The Commonsense Product Liability Legal Reform Act \nof 1995.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that is the result of more \nthan a decade's worth of effort. I would like to congratulate the \nmembers of the Conference Committee, led by Senators Gorton and \nRockefeller, on their diligence in coming up with a final conference \nreport.\n  This bill will help to reign in unnecessary, costly, and time-\nconsuming product liability cases. There is a lot of talk in this town \nabout cutting regulations and making American companies more \ncompetitive. But when the talk is over nothing much has changed.\n  The product liability bill originally passed the Senate more than 10 \nmonths ago after prolonged debate. The final conference report is \nsimilar to the Senate-passed bill in scope and focus rather than the \nwide-sweeping reform found in the House bill.\n  This bill is conspicuous not for what is in it, but for what is \nmissing. The House approved sweeping legal reform last year that would \nhave addressed other civil cases, besides products, including lawsuits \nagainst doctors, charities, and volunteer organizations.\n  However, it does have important provisions on punitive damages, joint \nand several liability, statute of limitations, statute of repose, \nworkers' compensation subrogation standards. It also covers product \nsellers and States rights.\n  This bill does not work against consumers; nor is it for \nmanufacturers. In fact many proponents of products liability reform who \nhad hoped and worked for broader reform are disappointed in its narrow \nscope. H.R. 956 merely attempts to block the free-for-all that has \ntaken hold of our court system.\n\n  Everybody wins under this bill. Consumers will see products ranging \nfrom football helmets to life-saving new drugs become more widely \navailable and less costly.\n  And it will not limit the legitimate rights of victims to sue or to \nreceive full compensation for their injuries.\n  This legislation is a good step in the right direction. It will not \nstop lawsuits, but it will put some restraints on the out-of-control \nlegal battles we have seen in recent years.\n  That is why it is so frustrating to hear President Clinton say that \nthe reforms included in the bill go too far. This was a bipartisan \neffort to get a bill that would be enacted into law.\n  Negotiations between the House and the Senate were tempered with \ncaution to ensure that it would get the support needed to be passed by \nthe Senate.\n  Once again efforts by reform-minded folks in Congress is threatened \nby a President that has put plaintiff lawyers interests above those of \nregular Americans. Politics once again rears its ugly head. The losers \nare consumers, manufacturers, and true victims who find themselves \nlocked in a case-clogged court system.\n  Mr. President, once again I ask my colleagues to take a close look at \nthis legislation and vote in support of cloture.\n\n\n    contingency-fee lawyers' nonsense about the commonsense product \n                 liability and legal reform act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a document being circulated by the \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers of America [ATLA] and their allied \nprofessional interest groups makes the accusation that the conference \nreport on H.R. 956, the Commonsense Product Liability and Legal Reform \nAct of 1996, is radically different than the bill passed by the Senate. \nThe contingency-fee lawyers' argument about commonsense product \nliability reform is unfounded.\n  Anyone who reads the conference report and compares it to the Senate \nbill can see for themselves that, except for change in the time period, \nnot the narrow scope, of the statute of repose and two slight \nmodifications to the additional amount provision, the conference report \nis virtually identical to the Senate bill. All familiar with the \nhistory of this bill also know House Members delayed going to \nconference, and then agreeing on a conference report, for almost a year \nuntil it became apparent that Senate allies of the trial bar would not \nsupport legal fairness legislation going beyond the Senate bill.\n  Facts are a stubborn thing for these lawyers, because as hard as they \ntry to avoid them or argue around them or simply ignore them, as is \noften the case, the facts never change. And, the fact is that the \nproduct liability conference report is a narrow and limited proposal \nthat almost mirrors the Senate's version of H.R. 956.\n\n\n                           Statute of Repose\n\n  H.R. 956, contains a narrow statute of repose, which places an outer \ntime limit on stale litigation involving a limited category of \nproducts, workplace durable goods, that is, machine tools used in the \nworkplace, that are over 15-years old. If the defendant made an express \nwarranty in writing as to the safety of the specified product involved, \nand the warranty was longer than the period of repose--15 years--then \nthe statute of repose does not apply until that warranty period is \ncomplete. The provision does not apply in any case involving a toxic \nharm, or in any case involving motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or \ntrains used primarily to transport passengers for hire.\n  The only difference between the conference report and the Senate bill \nis the conference report's 15-year period; the Senate bill contained a \n20-year limitation. Otherwise, the provision, including the limited \ncategory of products covered, is unchanged.\n\n  Approximately one-third of the States have enacted statute of repose \nlegislation; no State provides a more liberal time period or is more \nfavorable to potential plaintiffs in terms of its scope that the narrow \nprovision in H.R. 956. Support is also found by comparing the proposed \n15-year period to the laws of industrial nations which directly compete \nwith the U.S. to provide jobs. The EC Product Liability Directive, \nimplemented by 13 European nations and Australia, and Japan's new \nproduct liability law, which became effective July 1, 1995, each adopt \na 10-year statute of repose which applies to all products. H.R. 956 \nwill help level the playing field against foreign competitors abroad \nwhich put American jobs at risk.\n  The contingency-fee lawyers argue that the conference report extends \nthe statute of repose to virtually all goods. This statement is wrong. \nSection 101(7) of the conference report narrowly defines the term \nDurable good as follows:\n\n       Durable Good.--The term ``durable good'' means any product, \n     or any component part of any such product, which has a normal \n     life expectancy of 3 or more years, or is of a character \n     subject to allowance for depreciation under the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and which is--\n       (A) used in a trade or business;\n       (B) held for the production of income;\n       (C) sold or donated to a governmental or private entity for \n     the production of goods, training, demonstration, or any \n     other similar purpose. (Emphasis added).\n\n  Both the conference report and the Senate bill only apply to goods \nwhich have either a normal life expectancy of 3 or more years or are of \na character subject to allowance for depreciation under the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 and are used in a trade or business, held for the \nproduction of income, or sold or donated to a governmental or private \nentity for the production of goods, training, demonstration, or any \nother similar purpose. A machine tool is an example of product with a \nlong life expectancy, subject to depreciation, which is used in trade \nor business.\n  The contingency-fee lawyers are misleading the public to believe that \nthe workplace use limitation has disappeared from the conference \nreport. It has not.\n\n\n               the additional amount or additur provision\n\n  Recognizing that a flexible approach to punitive damages is likely to \ndeliver strong bipartisan support for legal reform, opponents have \nchallenged the constitutionality and content of the provision in H.R. \n956 which permits a judge a safety valve to go beyond the\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nproportionate limits set for punitive damages against larger businesses \nand award additional punitive damages (up to the amount of the jury \nverdict) in cases of egregious conduct in a desperate effort to shake \nsupport. The provision is constitutional and represents good public \npolicy.\n  The conference report additional amount provision, as mentioned, \ncontains two slight modifications to the Senate bill. First, a \ncontroversial provision in the Senate bill that would have allowed the \ndefendant the right to a new trial if the court used award an \nadditional amount of punitive damages has been removed from the \nlegislation and does not appear in the conference report. This change \nwas made in response to requests from the administration and several \nSenators just before the final Senate vote. The absence of the new \ntrial language does not affect the constitutionality of the provision. \nResearch by the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that the safety \nvalve provision in H.R. 956 is constitutional.\n  Second, the Senate bill language was modified in the conference \nreport to clarify that the additional amount which can be awarded may \nnot exceed the jury's initial award of punitive damages. The jury is \nnot informed of the statutory limit. This language strengthens the \nconstitutional foundation of the provision. Opponents' seventh \namendment right to jury trial arguments are without merit.\n\n\n       product liability does not extend to negligent entrustment\n\n  Once again opponents are trying to mislead and confuse product \nliability actions, which are covered by the conference report, with \nnegligent entrustment cases, which are not covered by the legislation. \nAs in the past, they use attention-getting, but irrelevant examples, \nsuch as drunk driving cases and gun violence.\n  The trial lawyers' hollow argument is based on the applicability \nsection of the conference report, which says that the act applies to \nany product liability action brought in any State or Federal court on \nany theory for harm caused by a product. The reason for this broad \ndefinition is to assure that the bill covers all theories of product \nliability, that is, negligence, implied warranty, and strict liability. \nThe argument then looks to the section dealing with product sellers, \nwhich imposes liability when a product seller fails to exercise \nreasonable care with respect to a product. The argument continues that \na product seller's failure to exercise reasonable care in selling a gun \nto a minor, convicted felon, or mentally unstable individual would not \nbe actionable, because the product seller was negligent with respect to \nthe purchaser and not the product.\n  This argument reflects an obvious misconstruction of the bill. To \nmake this clear, one only need look to the acts covered by product \nsellers in the conference report. This appears in the definition of \nproduct seller. The bill says that it is applicable to product sellers, \nbut only with respect to those aspects of a product, or component part \nof a product, which are created or affected when before placing the \nproduct in the stream of commerce. The definition then addresses those \nthings where the product seller produces, creates, makes, constructs, \ndesigns, or formulates * * * an aspect of the product * * * made by \nanother. See Sec. 101(14)(B). This is classic product liability.\n\n  To make the point crystal clear, the product seller section \nspecifically provides that the conference report does not cover \nnegligent entrustment or negligence in selling, leasing or renting to \nan inappropriate party. Section 103(d) expressly states: A civil action \nfor negligent entrustment shall not be subject to the provisions of \nthis section but shall be subject to any applicable State law.\n  For these reasons, the bill would not cover the situation described \nby the trial lawyers. It also would not cover a seller of liquor in a \nbar who sold to a person who was intoxicated or a car rental agency \nthat rents a car to a person who is obviously unfit to drive.\n  In sum, the product liability bill covers product liability, not \nnegligent entrustment or failure to exercise reasonable care with \nregard to whom products are sold, rented or leased.\n\n\n     trial lawyers' other arguments are similarly without any merit\n\n  The trial lawyers' desperate attempt to portray the conference report \nas to the right of the Senate bill includes a couple of other minor \npoints which are so hollow and petty that they deserve only brief \nattention. First, the notion that the conference report expands the \nproduct seller section beyond the Senate bill, changes burden of proof \nrules for persons who irresponsibly misuse or alter products or seek \npunitive damages is completely meritless. The falsity of these \narguments is apparent from the language of the conference report and \nthe Statement of Managers. Second, the argument that the findings in \nthe legislation are not supported is foolish. The subject of Federal \nproduct liability reform has been reviewed by Congress for 15 years and \nbeen the subject of hundreds of hours of hearings and floor debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting for cloture on the conference \nreport on product liability legislation because I believe, on balance, \nthat the issue should be decided by a majority vote of the Senate.\n  In deciding to support cloture, I am significantly influenced by the \nfact that the conference report corrects my principal concern: punitive \ndamages on egregious cases.\n  A decision on whether to support cloture depends upon a variety of \nfactors such as whether there should be more debate to fully air the \nissues or whether a constitutional issue or some other fundamental \nmatter is involved which warrants a super-majority of 60.\n  In the past, I have voted for cloture on product liability \nlegislation in circumstance where I thought the matter should reach the \nSenate floor for a majority vote.\n  On this state of the record on this bill, I think there should be a \nmajority determination, so I am voting in favor of cloture.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support \nfor this very important product liability reform legislation. This \nlegislation is a conservative, but significant attempt to begin the \nprocess of curbing a civil justice system gone awry, a system that has \nbeen overwhelmed by the logistical burdens and economic costs of \nunnecessary and unwarranted litigation.\n  Mr. President, it is very appropriate that Congress begin to address \nthis broad problem in the area of product liability reform. For it is \nthis area of law that has become, perhaps, the most unruly, and which \nis having an increasingly adverse impact on the U.S. economy. There are \nseveral important provisions contained in this bill. However, I will \nlimit my comments to the section dealing with biomaterials.\n  The purpose of this section is to provide a defense to the suppliers \nof biomaterials, or parts, which are used in the manufacture of \nimplantable medical devices. What this section will do is insure the \ncontinued availability of the raw materials that are absolutely \ncritical to the development of implantable medical devices. Under the \ncurrent legal system, claimants who sustain harm from a medical device \nare encouraged to go after the company with the deepest pockets, the \none they can get the most money from. Often times, this entity is the \ninnocent supplier of the raw, biomaterials, that are utilized in the \nmanufacturing of the device. This, in spite of the fact that the \nbiomaterials supplier did nothing to cause the injury or harm.\n  Mr. President, the result of this vicarious liability on the part of \nthe biomaterials supplier is that, economically, they cannot afford to \nsupply the materials to the manufacturer because the risk of being \ninnocently swept up into litigation is too high. You see, the volume of \nmaterial they provide to the bio-manufacturer represents such a small \npercentage of their total sales that it is simply not cost effective to \ntake the risk. They are driven out of the market by the risk of \nlitigation.\n  Located in my home State, Mr. President, in Bloomington, IN, there is \na very special company: Cook International. This company truly \nrepresents what is great about our economic system. Unfortunately, it \nalso represents how a system gone awry can harm both business and the \nconsumer.\n  Cook International manufactures medical devices. One product line is \nmedical catheters. These catheters are high precision devices used for \nvarious medical procedures.\n  A true American success story, Cook International began operating out \nof\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nthe founder's home. It has rapidly grown into an international \ncorporation manufacturing the very finest in precision medical \ncatheters. Vital to these instruments is teflon. However, under the \nthreat of potentially being swept up in a product liability law suit, \nCook's suppliers have served notice that they will soon cease to \nprovide the vital materials for the manufacture of these life saving \ncatheters.\n  Without this legislation, Mr. President, companies like Cook will be \nforced to find new suppliers of biomaterials or simply cease to \nmanufacture these products. The costs of this result can be measured in \nlost time, lost jobs, and lost lives.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simply provision. If a company meets \nall specifications of the manufacturer; if they are in no way involved \nin the actual manufacturing or sale of the biomedical device; if they \nhave acted in good faith in meeting their contractual obligation to the \nmanufacturer; they cannot be swept up in a product liability lawsuit \nsimply because they have deep pockets. This is fundamentally fair.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very responsible effort at \nreforming our product liability legal system. I urge them to do so in \norder to preserve and ensure the growth of the American manufacturing \nindustry. I urge them to do so because it is absolutely vital to our \nbiomedical industry.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I will vote against cloture on \nthe Product Liability Reform Act conference report. I believe the \nSenate should have a careful and thorough debate on the consequences of \nthis conference report.\n  We should not close the courthouse door to those with legitimate \ngrievances. Nor should we close debate on an issue as serious and far-\nreaching as product liability reform. I particularly do not want to \nclose debate when there is disagreement on the consequences on this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the Senate's version of the product \nliability bill. I absolutely believe Congress should enact a reform \nmeasure to reduce frivolous law suits and have national uniform product \nliability standards. I also believe that when it comes to public health \nand safety, those who are responsible must be held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  The Senate bill achieved a balance which addressed the valid concerns \nof the business community while protecting the rights of citizens with \nlegitimate cases. That's why I voted for it.\n  I made it clear at the time that moving beyond the Senate bill was \nunacceptable to me. I said, ``To move beyond the Senate bill would be a \nmistake. The scales on this are delicately balanced. If those scales \nare tipped, it is unlikely I will support this bill.''\n  Mr. President, over the past several days, I have carefully assessed \nthe conference report on product liability. I have weighed the \narguments made by its supporters and its opponents. Always I have asked \nwhether the conference report represents the same bill I voted for in \n1995, or whether it was changed, tilting the delicate balance I talked \nabout last spring.\n  Let me be clear. I do believe we need reform in this area. My job as \na U.S. Senator is to save jobs, to save lives, and to save communities. \nI do want to reduce frivolous lawsuits. I want to remove barriers which \nstifle innovation. I want us to be economically competitive.\n  At the same time, public health and safety are paramount with me. I \nwant consumers to have some assurance that the products they use are \nsafe. And if products are defective and cause harm, consumers should \nknow they can seek justice and redress through our courts. I do not \nwant to shut the courthouse door to people with legitimate claims.\n  That's why I have grave concerns about this conference report. This \nconference report does, indeed, tip the balance.\n  Let me tell you why:\n  First of all, under the conference agreement, consumer products not \ncovered by the Senate bill will now be covered. The caps and other \nrestrictions under the conference report apply to a wide range of \nconsumer products and appliances, not just to those used in trade or \nbusiness.\n  Second, the conference report adds another barrier to people who are \nseeking punitive damages. Under its provisions, an injured person will \nnow have to demonstrate that the wrongdoer's conduct was the proximate \ncause of harm instead of merely resulting in harm. This is a much more \ndifficult standard.\n  Third, the bill could unacceptably shift the burden of proof in cases \nwhere the alcohol and drug defense is used. Under our Senate bill, a \ndefendant was required to prove the plaintiff was under the influence \nof drugs or alcohol. This conference agreement leaves this issue \nentirely up to the States.\n  Finally, the conference report fails to specifically state that the \n2-year statute of limitations will be suspended in cases where a court \nhas issued a stay or injunction. The Senate bill was quite clear on \nthis point. I fear the conference agreement's silence on this issue \nwill result in injustice.\n  For instance, in cases similar to the Dalkon Shield case, a court \ncould issue a stay, and the statute of limitations could run out for \npeople who have legitimate claims. I fear this defect in the conference \nreport will prevent women who have suffered from defective products \nfrom seeking justice.\n  Mr. President, I know there are disagreements on each of the points I \nhave just outlined. I know that people interpret the conference \nagreement's language on these and other issues in very different ways.\n  But, I must say that these very differences of opinion have \nreinforced my conclusion that I must oppose cloture and this conference \nagreement. When there are such deep and serious differences about the \nimpact of this legislation, I must lean on the side of protecting \nconsumers. I must place my obligation to protect public health and \nsafety first.\n  Therefore, I will oppose cloture today. And I will oppose this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, before concluding my remarks, I must acknowledge the \ntremendous work done by my esteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, on \nthis legislation. He has fought diligently to uphold the Senate's \nposition on product liability reform. And, I must say that he has \nsucceeded on a number of issues. His fight has been a valiant one, and \nI regret that I am not able to stand by his side today.\n  Let me just say, this year is not over yet. Many of us want genuine \nreform we can all support. Although I cannot support the conference \nagreement before us today, I hope we can go back to the drawing board. \nI want us to produce a bill which reflects the balance that is needed \nbetween the concerns of business and those of consumers. I would be \nproud to support such a bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport to the Product Liability Fairness Act.\n  I would first like to commend and congratulate my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Gorton, Rockefeller, and Pressler for their \nlongstanding leadership on this issue and on this bill. They have \nlabored long and hard over several Congresses to come up with a bill \nthat is measured and fair, and that will accomplish meaningful and \nimportant reforms of our product liability system.\n  This bill will benefit American workers and consumers. The only \npeople who may be truly hurt by this bill are some of the Nation's \ntrial lawyers.\n  I hope this bill will not fall victim to election year politics. It \nis a good bill and one that we have needed for a long time.\n  When this bill was on the Senate floor last spring, I supported \nefforts to broaden it so that its key provisions on punitive damages \nand joint and several liability would apply to all civil lawsuits.\n  We succeeded in passing a Dole-Exon-Hatch amendment to broaden the \npunitive damages provision. Unfortunately, the bill with that provision \nin it could not survive cloture and the amendment was removed.\n  While I continue to support broader civil justice reforms--and would \nparticularly like to see this Congress at least enact a bill to protect \nreligious and nonprofit organizations and volunteers from excessive \npunitive damage awards--I offer my enthusiastic support to this product \nliability bill.\n  Even though it is a modest bill, it represents a significant step in \nthe right direction toward removing some\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nof the outrageous litigation abuses in our system.\n  Anyone who has looked at the substance of this bill will realize that \nthis is a limited, reasoned effort that is long overdue. This bill \nshould not even raise the question of a Presidential veto.\n  But unfortunately, it has.\n  The ink was barely dry on this compromise bill before the President, \ncoming to the defense of a limited and narrowly focused interest \ngroup--trial lawyers--and at the expense of American competitiveness, \nAmerican jobs, and American consumers, declared he would veto this \nbill.\n  For the sake of our constituents across the Nation, we should be \ncrystal clear about where the opposition to this sensible bill comes \nfrom. It does not come from the American people, and it does not come \nfrom American workers and consumers.\n  Product liability reform is supported by the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans. They have indicated their frustration with crazy lawsuits, \noutrageous punitive damage awards, and abusive litigation. They see a \ncomplete lack of common sense in our civil justice system.\n  They want change from a status quo that has been unfair and that has \nencouraged irresponsible litigation in this country. It is our \nresponsibility to deliver that change. And it should be the President's \nresponsibility to sign this bill.\n  Given the President's last-minute veto of the securities litigation \nreform bill, which came following appeals from a few well-placed, well-\nheeled trial lawyers, we probably should not be surprised by the \nPresident's obstructionist position on this bill.\n  Despite the sincere, tireless efforts of a leading member of his \nparty, Senator Rockefeller, to work out a bipartisan position, the \nPresident has apparently opted to defend the status quo.\n  Senator Rockefeller should take some heart in the fact that while he \nmay be no more successful in selling this bipartisan bill to the White \nHouse than his colleague Senator Dodd was in selling the securities \nlitigation bill, Senator Dodd ultimately crossed the finish line.\n  We should at least be clear that the President's opposition to this \nbill comes only from the well-heeled trial lawyers who have taken \nadvantage of our litigation system for their own benefit.\n  For too long, our citizens have been the ultimate victim of lawsuits \nand threats of lawsuits that go beyond the bounds of common sense. It \noften is not fair, and it often is very extreme.\n  By some estimates, nearly 90 percent of all companies can expect to \nbecome a defendant in a product liability case at least once. Estimates \nof the costs of product liability litigation range from $80 to $117 \nbillion per year. That is simply too high.\n  Our national resources should not be misdirected to pay for extreme \nand unproductive litigation costs. We heard many, many references to \nthese costs when this bill was on the floor last spring. We heard that \n20 percent of the price of a ladder goes to pay for litigation and \nliability insurance, that one-half of the price of a football helmet \ngoes to liability insurance, and on and on. Just who does President \nClinton think is paying these additional costs?\n  This bill seeks to reduce the litigation tax burdening our economy \nand stifling innovation and job-growth. At the same time, it aims to \nensure that those individuals who are harmed by defective products are \ncompensated by the parties who rightfully should bear responsibility \nfor wrongdoing.\n  This is an important point given the disinformation circulating about \nthis bill. This legislation does not deprive any American of his or her \nright to sue.\n  We need these reforms because it has become evident that we cannot \naddress these problems comprehensively without a uniform, nationwide \nsolution to put a ceiling on at least the most abusive litigation \ntactics.\n  Products produced in one State move in interstate commerce. \nManufacturers, product sellers, and individuals from one State may find \nthemselves being sued in another State.\n  We need to protect citizens of some States from the product liability \nlitigation costs imposed on them by other States' legal systems.\n  We need to assist those affected by laws in States where the \nlegislatures have attempted reforms only to be thwarted by some State \ncourts.\n  This bill does that by encouraging commonsense, responsible, and fair \nlitigation.\n  For one, this bill reforms joint and several liability. I have spoken \nbefore about a case against Walt Disney World in which Walt Disney \nWorld was judged to be only 1 percent at fault for injuries a woman \nsuffered when her fiance rammed into her on a grand prix ride at Disney \nWorld. Under principles of joint and several liability, Disney World \nwas forced to pay 86 percent of the damages. (Walt Disney World Co. v. \nWood, 515 So.2d 198 (Fla. S. Ct. 1987).)\n  This bill strikes a sensible balance by limiting joint and several \nliability to economic damages. This fairness approach means that \ndefendants will be chiefly responsible for the harm that they cause \nrather than the harm caused by other defendants.\n  Other provisions also promote fairness. It is 100 percent wrong to \npaint them any other way.\n  Take the 2-year statute of limitations. That gives parties a \nreasonable time in which to take legal action after they know, or \nshould have known, of an injury and its cause, at the same time that it \nprevents late-in-the-day lawsuits.\n  Who can argue with these commonsense provisions, except some of our \nNation's trial lawyers who benefit from the increased fees they receive \nfrom unfair recoveries?\n  The bill imposes liability on product sellers only under certain \ncircumstances in which the product seller is responsible for the safety \nof the product it sells. A product seller should not be held hostage to \na lawsuit if the manufacturer caused the damage and the plaintiff can \nand should be suing the manufacturer.\n  The bill similarly provides that those who rent or lease products \nshould be liable only where they themselves have actually been \nnegligent or otherwise responsible for the harm--not where they are \nsimply in the supply chain and have done nothing wrong.\n  The bill provides a defense if the plaintiff was intoxicated or under \nthe influence of drugs and if that accounted for more than 50 percent \nof the responsibility for the harm caused. What is wrong with that \nprovision?\n  The bill reduces damages payable by a manufacturer if harm is caused \nby any misuse or alteration of the product.\n  The bill includes a limit on punitive damages in product liability \ncases of two times the amount of economic and noneconomic losses. That \npermits an adequate punishment where punishment is called for, but puts \nsome restraint on runaway punitive damages.\n  We did make some accommodations in this provision, including an \nexception allowing judges to go beyond the limits of the bill. This \nprovision was tightened up in conference, and I think it was improved \nsomewhat. Although I continue to have some reservations that the \nadditur provision represents a weakening of the bill's punitive damages \nprovision, I support this bill.\n  The provision that we added on the floor to protect small businesses \nhas remained in the conference report. That provision applies to small \nbusinesses having less than 25 employees and individuals whose net \nworth does not exceed $500,000. In cases involving either of those as \ndefendants, punitive damages cannot exceed the lesser of $250,000 or \ntwo times economic and noneconomic losses.\n  This worthy provision prevents small businesses and individuals from \nfacing punitive damages in excess of $250,000.\n  The conference report adopts the House version of the statute of \nrepose, which sets a 15-year limit beyond which manufacturers could no \nlonger be sued in a product liability action. Of course, other parties \nhaving physical responsibility for the product, like product sellers or \nrenters, would continue to bear responsibility.\n  I believe it is important to stress that punitive damages are in \naddition to make whole, compensatory relief. The administration \nproduced its policy with respect to the Gorton substitute product \nliability bill on April 25, 1995, and was critical of the punitive \ndamage limitations in the bill.\n  In the President's statement this past weekend indicating that he \nwould veto this legislation, the President again criticized the \npunitive damages\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\nprovisions--even though those provisions have since been modified in an \nattempt to address his concerns.\n  On May 2, 1995, I received a letter from Prof. George Priest of the \nYale Law School responding to the administration's policy. I think he \ngets to the heart of why the administration's concerns then and now are \nmisplaced, in error, and an excuse to veto this bill.\n  Let me read from that letter.\n  Professor Priest--responding to the bill's then punitive damages \nlimit of three times economic damages or $250,000, whichever is \ngreater--writes:\n\n       The Administration opposes the cap on punitive damages on \n     the grounds that the cap ``invites a wealthy potential \n     wrongdoer to weigh the risks of a capped punitive award \n     against the potential gains of profits from the wrongdoing.\n\n  I note that the administration used that exact same phraseology in \nits statement of administration policy issued on March 16, 1996.\n  Professor Priest went on to write:\n\n       Meaning no disrespect, the administration's position \n     displays a naivete unworthy of the serious problems created \n     for consumers and low-income consumers, in particular, by the \n     current absence of limits on potential punitive damages \n     awards.\n       The administration appears to criticize and to want to \n     prevent the calculation by potential defendants of future \n     potential damages. That position cannot be sensibly \n     maintained because it ignores the only purpose of punitive \n     damages, which is to deter. There can be no deterrence \n     without a calculation of a possible future penalty. The \n     entire system of punitive damages is premised on the hope \n     that potential wrongdoers will engage in such calculations \n     and decide against engaging in harm-causing behavior. If \n     there were no such calculations, there would be no deterrent \n     effect. The issue, thus, is what the level of potential \n     punitive damages ought to be in order to obtain appropriate \n     deterrence.\n       Although the administration does not address the issue, it \n     is well established in the analysis of modern tort law (and \n     hardly controversial within the academy) that the calculation \n     of compensatory damages alone is sufficient to create the \n     appropriate deterrence of loss. Additional punitive damages \n     awards surely reinforce the deterrent effect of compensatory \n     damages, but at a cost: Where punitive damages awards are \n     excessive or unpredictable (which the administration seems to \n     want), producers are deterred from sales altogether and \n     withdraw products and services from markets. Excessive or \n     unpredictable punitive damage awards, thus, harm consumers \n     and low-income consumers most of all because low profit \n     margin products and services are the first to be withdrawn.\n       Many scholars believe (and I am among them) that the \n     current problems created by excessive punitive damages are so \n     severe that a cap of three times economic damages is still \n     too high and that consumers--again, especially the low \n     income--would benefit from a stricter cap.\n\n  I think that statement accurately and precisely sets out the reasons \nthat I and so many others have come to the conclusion that punitive \ndamages must be limited to benefit consumers. It is simplistic and \ninaccurate for opponents of this bill to claim that unlimited punitive \ndamages benefit consumers. They do not.\n  I note that the proportionality limit in the current bill was \nmoderated to two times the sum of economic and noneconomic damages.\n  Simply put, all of the provisions in this bill are commonsense \nprovisions that level the playing field and encourage fairness in our \nproduct liability system. They are changes that Americans want and \ndeserve.\n  I could go on and on about ridiculous product liability cases that \nAmericans are sick of hearing about.\n  Everyone has heard of the McDonald's coffee case, but remember the \nMcDonald's milkshake case? I spoke at length about that on the floor \nlast spring.\n  A man had purchased a milkshake at the McDonald's drive-through, put \nit between his legs, spilled it all over himself, and got into an \naccident with another driver. That driver sued McDonald's on a product \nliability theory and claimed that McDonald's should have warned the \nmilkshake drinker not to drink milkshakes and drive. (Carter v. \nMcDonald's Corp., 640 A.2d 850 (N.J. 1994).)\n  Or how about the president of the Dixie Flag Manufacturing Co. who \ntestified before the Commerce Committee last April. His company was \nsued by a man who stopped to help some employees at another company \nlower a flag. The man claimed that, while holding the flag, he was \nblown off the ground by a strong gust of wind and that the flag ripped, \ncausing him to fall and hurt himself. He sued the flag company, \nclaiming that the flag was unreasonably dangerous. That is bad enough, \nbut what is worse is that there was no evidence that Dixie Flag had \neven sold the flag at issue.\n  We have just got to restore some common sense into our legal system.\n  The examples and the abuse go on and on.\n  Our large and small businesses and our consumers and workers are \nbeing overwhelmed with litigation abuse.\n  The vice president of the Otis Elevator Corp. provided us with \ninformation indicating that his company is sued on the average of once \na day. Once a day.\n  Although Otis wins over 75 percent of its cases, on average over the \npast 3 years it has spent $20 million per year on liability costs, \nabout half of which has gone to attorneys' fees.\n  These are staggering costs that should take our breath away. They \nrepresent resources which could be going to create new jobs or \nundertake new advancements. Our national resources should be going to \nproductive uses--not to unnecessary and overblown litigation and \ninsurance costs.\n  In short, I hope the Senate will stand up for what is right and what \nthe American people want and need. We should send this bill to the \nPresident.\n  And, the President should sign it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there is a broad bipartisan consensus that \nwe must do more to curb lawsuit abuse in America--the kind of abuse \nthat has turned suing your neighbor into the newest American pastime.\n  This bipartisan compromise bill is an important first step: It will \nrestrain outrageous and costly lawsuits that inhibit economic growth, \nthreaten small businesses, and inflict a litigation tax on American \nconsumers of $152 billion a year--that's right, $152 billion a year.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Pressler, and particularly Senators \nGorton and Rockefeller for their hard work--years of hard work, \nreally--on this important legislation. I also want to thank Senator \nLott for his assistance in resolving the differences between House and \nSenate.\n  But despite all the work, all of the bipartisanship, all of the sweet \nwhispers of support out of the White House, suddenly we are voting on a \nbill that is under a threat of veto.\n  Why? Well, let us take a look at what President Clinton said last \nSaturday when he issued his veto threat. President Clinton said that he \nwas concerned about federalism and an ``unwarranted intrusion on State \nauthority.'' But this argument was long ago dismissed by such concerned \nparties as the National Governors Association. In fact, the Governors, \nincluding then-Governor Clinton, called for a uniform national \nstandard, stating that it would ``greatly enhance the effectiveness of \ninterstate commerce.''\n  In other words, this sudden attack of States rights fever is \nmisplaced.\n  President Clinton also said last Saturday that he was concerned the \nbill would ``prevent injured persons from recovering the full measure \nof their damages.'' But compensatory damages are not affected by this \nlegislation at all. And punitive damages are available for exactly \nthose situations for which they were intended--situations which involve \nwrongdoing or egregious conduct.\n  That is what the President said.\n  What the President did not say however was that he has been under \nenormous pressure to veto this measure from the wealthiest and most \npowerful special interest lobby in America: the trial lawyers.\n  Mr. Clinton has been one of the most-favored recipients of their \nlargess. The Center for Responsive Politics found that lawyers and \nlobbyists funneled a grand total of $2.6 million to Mr. Clinton's 1992 \ncampaign. That of course vastly understates the real number, since it \nis often impossible to identify the source of the real donors. In just \nthe first 9 months of 1995, lawyers and law firms have pumped another \n$2.5 million into the President's campaign coffers.\n  If money talks, this money screams. And what it screams is very \nsimple: kill each and every attempt at legal reform. Now, I'm not one \nto assume just because someone gives you money, they call the tune. But \nthis message has apparently been heard down at the White House loud and \nclear.\n  Consider the record: President Clinton instigated a filibuster to \nstop legal\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nreform that covered small business and charities and volunteer \norganizations last year.\n  President Clinton pulled a much-publicized flip-flop and vetoed the \nsecurities litigation reform late last year. Fortunately, Congress \noverrode his veto.\n  President Clinton now threatens to veto a modest and bipartisan bill \nthat he once suggested he would support.\n  This is unfortunate, but how it happened is worse.\n  Before he said he would veto this bill, President Clinton's allies \ndid something very cynical. Mr. Clinton's friends on the Hill made sure \nthat the protections from lawsuit abuses in this compromise bill would \nnot be extended to charities and nonprofits.\n  Why would they do that? Everyone professes to want such protections \npassed into law. Yet, they insisted.\n  Well, obviously, it would have been more difficult to veto a bill \nthat offered protections for charities and volunteer organizations. It \nwould have interfered with posturing as the defender of the little guy. \nSo, those protections had to go. And 2 days after those protections \nwere deleted by his allies, President Clinton issued his veto threat.\n  I don't intend to play this game. Charities and volunteer \norganizations deserve relief, not cynical politics as usual.\n  Elaine Chao, president of the United Way of America, recently wrote a \npassionate plea calling for protections for charities, so caseworkers \nin family counseling agencies, literacy tutors, and volunteer \nfundraisers won't be chased away by the threat of liability.\n  All Americans should be outraged, as Elaine Chao puts it, by ``the \nproliferation of frivolous lawsuits that treat charities and nonprofits \nas pinatas, as so many bags of goodies to be plundered.''\n\n  That's why Senator Hatch and I have introduced a bill that provides \nsuch relief. Our bill would protect charities and nonprofits like the \nLittle League and Girl Scouts. I intend to bring it to the floor for \nconsideration as soon as possible.\n  The President and his allies will then be asked to make a simple \nchoice between protecting charities or enriching trial lawyers.\n  President Clinton, please do not block this measure again. Do not let \nthe heavy hand of special interests stay the helping hand of charities.\n  Mr. President, with nearly 19 million new suits filed per year--1 for \nevery 10 adults--no one is immune from the lawsuit epidemic. The cost \nof defending yourself in an average, nonautomotive case is about \n$7,500. That is money you lose even if you win your case.\n  The lawyers, of course, never lose. It is time that this stopped.\n  I hope President Clinton will reconsider his ill-advised veto threat. \nIn the meantime, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 956, a \nbill to reform product liability law.\n  A few months ago, the 104th Congress took the first momentous step \ntoward legal reform. Over President Clinton's veto, we passed H.R. \n1056, a bill to reform securities litigation.\n  This legislation will significantly curb the epidemic of frivolous \nlawsuits that are diverting our Nation's resources away from productive \nactivity and into transaction costs.\n  In passing H.R. 956, the Senate will be taking an equally important \nsecond step on the road toward a sane legal regime of civil justice.\n  Our current legal system, under which we spend $300 billion or 4.5 \npercent of our gross domestic product each year, is not just broken, it \nis falling apart.\n  This is a system in which plaintiffs receive less than half of every \ndollar spent on litigation-related costs. It is a system that forces \nnecessary goods, such as pharmaceuticals that can treat a number of \ndebilitating diseases and conditions, off the market in this country.\n  This is a system in which neighbors are turned into litigants. I was \nparticularly struck by a recent example reported in the Washington \nPost. This case involved two 3-year-old children whose mothers could \nnot settle a sandbox dispute--literally, a preschool altercation in the \nsandbox--without going to court.\n  Something must be done about this situation and this litigious \npsychology, Mr. President, and this bill puts us on the road to real, \nsubstantive reform.\n  It institutes caps on punitive damages, thereby limiting potential \nwindfalls for plaintiffs without in any way interfering with their \nability to obtain full recovery for their injuries.\n  It provides product manufacturers with long-overdue relief from \nabusers of their products.\n  And it protects these makers, and sellers, from being made to pay for \nall or most noneconomic damages when they are responsible for only a \nsmall percentage.\n  First, as to punitive damages. No one wants to see plaintiffs denied \nfull and fair compensation for their injuries. And this bill would do \nnothing to get in the way of such recoveries.\n  Unfortunately, punitive damages have come to be seen as part of the \nnormal package of compensation to be expected by plaintiffs. George \nPriest of the Yale Law School reports that in one county, Bullock, AL, \n95.6 percent of all cases filed in 1993-94 included claims for punitive \ndamages.\n  Punitive damages are intended to punish and deter wrongdoing. When \nthey become routine--one might say when they reach epidemic \nproportions--they end up hurting us all by increasing the cost of \nimportant goods and services.\n  For example, the American Tort Reform Association reports that, of \nthe $18,000 cost of a heart pacemaker, $3,000 goes to cover lawsuits, \nas does $170 of the $1,000 cost of a motorized wheelchair and $500 of \nthe cost of a 2-day maternity hospital stay.\n  We can no longer afford to allow this trend to continue. I am glad, \ntherefore, that this bill begins to cap punitive damages--although in \nmy judgment it only makes a beginning in that area.\n  I am particularly glad that the bill imposes a hard cap of $250,000 \non punitive damages assessed against small businesses--the engine of \ngrowth and invention in our Nation.\n  Of course, punitive damage awards are not the only things increasing \nthe costs of needed products.\n  Throughout the debate over civil justice reform I have been referring \nto the case of Piper Aircraft versus Cleveland. I use that example \nbecause it shows how ridiculous legal standards can literally kill an \nindustry--as they did light aircraft manufacturing in America--and cost \nthousands of American jobs.\n\n  In Piper Aircraft, a man took the front seat out of his plane and \nintentionally attempted to fly it from the back seat. He crashed, not \nsurprisingly, and his family sued and won over $1 million in damages on \nthe grounds that he should have been able to fly safely from the back \nseat.\n  These are the kinds of decisions we must stop. Drunken plaintiffs, \nplaintiffs who abuse and misuse products--plaintiffs who blame \nmanufacturers and sellers for their own misconduct--should not be \nrewarded with large sums of money. They may deserve our concern and \nsympathy, but we, as a people, do not deserve to pay for their \nmisconduct through the loss of entire industries.\n  I am happy that this bill establishes defenses based on plaintiff \ninebriation and abuse of the product because I believe these defenses \nwill benefit all Americans.\n  Finally, it seems clear to me that no manufacturer should be held \nliable for noneconomic damages which that individual or company did not \ncause.\n  In its common form, the doctrine of joint liability allows the \nplaintiff to collect the entire amount of a judgment from any defendant \nfound partially responsible for the plaintiff's damages.\n  Thus, for example, a defendant found to be 1 percent responsible for \nthe plaintiff's damages could be forced to pay 100 percent of the \nplaintiff's judgment.\n  This is unfair. And the unfairness is aggravated when noneconomic \ndamages are awarded.\n  Noneconomic damages are intended to compensate plaintiffs for \nsubjective harm, like pain and suffering, emotional distress, and \nhumiliation.\n  Because noneconomic damages are not based on tangible losses, \nhowever, there are no objective criteria for calculating their amount. \nAs a result, the size of these awards often depends more\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\non the luck of the draw, in terms of the jury, than on the rule of law. \nDefendants can be forced to pay enormous sums for unverifiable damages \nthey did not substantially cause.\n  This bill would reform joint liability in the product liability \ncontext by allowing it to be imposed for economic damages only, so that \na defendant could be forced to pay for only his proportionate share of \nnoneconomic damages.\n  As a result, plaintiffs would be fully compensated for their out-of-\npocket losses, while defendants would be better able to predict and \nverify the amount of damages they would be forced to pay.\n  This reform thus would address the most pressing concerns of \nplaintiffs and defendants alike.\n  Mr. President, problems will remain with our civil justice system \nafter this bill is made into law--if this bill is signed by President \nClinton and made law.\n  Charities and their volunteers will remain unprotected from frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  Our municipalities will remain exposed to profit-seeking plaintiffs.\n  And the nonproducts area of private civil law in general will remain \nunreformed--3-year-olds and their mothers may still end up in court \nover a sandbox altercation.\n  In the last session I and some of my colleagues fought for more \nextensive, substantive, and programmatic reforms to our civil justice \nsystem. These were consistently turned back.\n  I believe at this point it is time for us to consider more neutral, \nprocedural reforms, such as in the area of Federal conflicts rules, to \nrationalize a system we cannot seem to tame.\n  But I am certain, Mr. President, that this bill marks an important \nstep toward a fairer, more reasonable and less expensive civil justice \nsystem.\n  This is why I am frustrated that President Clinton has threatened to \nveto this bill.\n  The President has stated repeatedly that he would support balanced, \nlimited product liability reform. He has been singularly unhelpful in \nhis opposition to more far-reaching reforms that would do more for \nAmerican workers and consumers. But he has claimed that he would \nsupport product liability reform.\n  Now the President is claiming that this legislation is somehow unfair \nto consumers.\n  Mr. President, is a system in which fifty seven cents of every dollar \nawarded in court goes to lawyers and other transaction costs fair to \nconsumers of legal services?\n  Is it really pro-consumer to have a system in which, as reported in a \nconference board survey, 47 percent of firms withdraw products from the \nmarketplace, 25 percent discontinue some form of research, and 8 \npercent lay off employees, all out of fear of lawsuits?\n  Please tell me, Mr. President, are consumers helped by a system in \nwhich, according to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five small \nbusinesses decides not to introduce a new product, or not to improve an \nexisting one, out of fear of lawsuits?\n  The clear answer, I believe, is that consumers are hurt by our out-\nof-control civil justice system, a system which makes them pay more for \nless sophisticated and updated goods.\n  I respectfully suggest that President Clinton look beyond the \ninterests of his friends among the trial lawyers to the interests of \nthe American people as a whole.\n  If he looks to that interest he will find a nation hungry for reform, \nyearning to be freed from a civil justice system that is neither civil \nnor just, seeking protection from egregious wrongs, but not willing to \nsacrifice necessary goods, important public and voluntary services, and \nthe very character of their communities to a system that no longer \nproduces fair and predictable results.\n  If we in this chamber consult the interest of the people, Mr. \nPresident, we will pass this bill. If President Clinton consults that \nprimary interest, he will sign the bill and make it law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today's vote marks the return of the \nproduct liability issue to the Senate. It was about 1 year ago, May 10, \n1995, when I voted for final passage of the Senate version of the \nproduct liability bill.\n  Yet before final passage, I voted against cloture four times. I voted \nagainst cloture because I had reservations about some of the provisions \nin the bill, including the absolute punitive damage cap and one way \npreemption clauses within the bill. However, after cloture was \nachieved, I voted in support of final passage in the hopes that the \nSenate and House conferees, working in conjunction with the White \nHouse, would reach a reasonable, balanced, and fair compromise.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report, rather than improving the bill, \nraises more questions and concerns. In the Senate bill, the language \nmade it clear that the following would be excluded from the definition \nof product, electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural gas, or \nsteam. However, the conference report adds an exception that in \napplication, swallows the exclusion. The exception provides that if \nelectricity, water delivered by a utility, natural gas, or steam is \nsubject under State law to strict liability, the provisions of the \nproduct liability conference report apply. This is an expansion of the \nSenate bill.\n  Also, in the Senate bill, the provision regarding negligent \nentrustment was found in the applicability section and it provided that \nnothing in the title, the products liability bill, would apply to \nnegligent entrustment cases. However, in the conference report, the \nnegligent entrustment language is moved to the seller liability section \nand therefore negligent entrustment actions are not excluded from the \nprovisions of the bill. Does the Senate really want to send a signal to \nthose who, for example, serve alcohol to minors that their liability is \nsubstantially reduced?\n  The conference report language changes the Senate bill's provision on \nstatute of repose by reducing the number of years and inserting \nambiguity on the scope of products covered under statute of repose. The \nstatute of repose is reduced from the Senate bill's period of 20 years \nto the conference report's period of 15 years. Changes in the \ndefinition of durable goods have raised ambiguity over whether the \nstatute of repose remains applicable to only durable goods used in the \nworkplace.\n  Finally, my concern remains about provisions which change State law \nonly when that law is unfavorable to negligent manufacturers. If the \ngoal is to create a uniform Federal law, the conference report should \nnot make exceptions for States in the areas of statute of repose and \npunitive damage cap formulas.\n  I regret that I am unable to vote for cloture on this conference \nreport. I remain supportive of reasonable and balanced product \nliability reform. My vote for final passage of the Senate bill on May \n10, 1995, is a testament to my position.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this conference \nreport.\n  Like most Americans, I believe we would all be better off with fewer \nlawsuits. But, as we vote on this legislation, we must also ask \nourselves if we are being fair to average Americans who are injured by \ndangerous products.\n  As I will discuss in more detail in just a moment, I believe my home \nState of Montana has done a fine job of discouraging unnecessary \nlitigation and excessive damage awards. We have found a balance--a fair \nbalance--that works for Montana and I believe other states should be \nallowed to the same.\n\n\n                BILL INTRUDES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n  This past December, I supported welfare reform legislation. My \nreason, in essence, was that a Federal program was broken and could be \nmanaged better by State governments.\n  The product liability bill before us now does just the opposite. It \ntakes State laws which are not broken and subordinates them to a \nFederal law. It preempts the civil law of all 50 States and expands \nFederal powers into an area which, for two centuries, has been governed \nby the States. That is a very grave decision, and it is one we should \nnot take unless there is absolutely no alternative.\n  Now, I am not an absolutist on this point. In some unusual cases--in \nparticular, when States are violating the rights of individuals--the \nFederal Government should step in. For example, the Federal Government \nwas right to intervene and eliminate segregationist Jim Crow laws \nthrough the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\n  But in this case, State governments are exercising their tort law \nresponsibilities perfectly well. There is no reason for the Feds to \ntake over.\n\n\n                            THE MONTANA CASE\n\n  Let us look at the case of Montana to see why.\n  Our Chief Justice, the Honorable Jean Turnage, summed it up in a \nletter he wrote to me in 1994 in his capacity as President of the \nConference of Chief Justices. In that letter he said:\n\n       Federal preemption of existing State product liability law \n     at this point is an unwise and unnecessary intrusion upon the \n     principles of federalism.\n\n  Justice Turnage is on very firm ground. Over time, Montana has \ndrafted and amended our State laws to make sure they reflect our needs. \nFor example, our legislature has imposed a punitive damage cap in \nmedical malpractice cases. We also let small businesses register as \nlimited liability companies to reduce their exposure to civil suits.\n  And Montana has already solved many of the other problems this \nproduct liability reform bill attempts to address.\n\n\n                 LIABILITY ALREADY REFORMED IN MONTANA\n\n  First, we strike a fair balance between plaintiffs and defendants. \nThe doctrine of joint and several liability is a good example.\n  Montana applies joint liability only when defendants are more than 50 \npercent responsible for a person's injury. Defendants who are less than \n50 percent liable are accountable only for the amount of injury \ndirectly attributable to their wrongdoing.\n  This makes sense. Defendants should not be held jointly liable when \nthey are only minimally responsible. Conversely, the injured should not \ngo uncompensated when a defendant is more than half responsible.\n  So we have found a balance on liability. And this bill would destroy \nthe balance. Because if it passes, Federal law would void Montana's \njoint and several liability statute completely.\n\n\n                MONTANA COURTS FAIR IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n  Second, look at Montana's treatment of punitive damages.\n  Again, we looked at the issue and found a solution that meets our \nneeds. Our courts award punitive damages only in limited circumstances \nwhere a corporation clearly acts in a reckless way that endangers \npublic safety.\n  We allow juries to award punitive damages only when a product \nmanufacturer or seller is guilty of actual fraud or malice. Montana \njuries awarded these punitive damages a grand total of three times \nsince 1965. And under H.R. 956, Montana juries would have great \ndifficulty awarding punitive damages even when the defendant has shown \ntotal disregard and disrespect for the health and welfare of the \nconsumer.\n\n\n              PROTECTING MONTANA WORKERS COMPENSATION LAW\n\n  Last but not least, I am deeply concerned about how this legislation \ncould seriously harm Montana small businesses.\n  I recently asked Prof. David Patterson of the University of Montana \nSchool of Law to review this conference report and advise me of its \npotential impacts on Montana business. Professor Patterson is an \nacknowledged expert in Montana workers compensation law. He is also \nchairman of the State Bar Ethics Committee.\n  Professor Patterson has advised me that this conference report could \nhave unfavorable, perhaps unintentional impacts * * * on Montana \nemployers.\n  Specifically, he points to its provisions overriding existing Montana \nworkers compensation law. As it is today, Montana workers compensation \nlaw protects employers from virtually all workplace-related products \nliability suits. But Professor Patterson believes the legislation \nbefore the Senate would eliminate or significantly errode these \nprotections for Montana employers. I find that deeply troubling.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Professor Patterson's \nletter to be printed in the record immediately following these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Now, I believe that many companies have legitimate \ngrievances with some of the State tort laws. But they should take the \ncomplaints to the States and do the job there. It is simply \nunnecessary--and really, it is wrong--to bring in Federal law \nenforcement and Federal courts to nationalize the tort laws. And its \npotential impacts on Montana workers compensation law show how \ndangerous--and costly for small businesses--this can become.\n  As Chief Justice Turnage said, it is unnecessary and unwise for \nCongress to try and take over these State responsibilities. Montana has \nmanaged its liability laws for over 100 years. We have exercised our \nrights in a responsible and balanced way. And we should be able to do \nso for the next hundred years.\n  And Congress, for its part, should get back to its real business and \nwhat the people expect--working together to balance the budget, raise \nthe minimum wage, and help our families provide themselves and their \nchildren with a secure future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         The University of Montana\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                                     Missoula, MT.\n     Re H.R. 956 counterproductive for Montana employers.\n\n     Sen. Max Baucus,\n     Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Baucus: As a Montana law professor who teaches \n     workers-compensation courses, I urge you to consider, before \n     voting on H.R. 956, the ``Common Sense Product Liability \n     Legal Reform Act of 1996,'' how surely and severely Section \n     111 of that bill would impact Montana employers and their \n     workers compensation insurers.\n       Section 111(a)(3) of H.R. 956 clearly rewards manufacturers \n     and sellers of defective workplace equipment who blame \n     employers for injuries to their employees. Consequently, even \n     employers who are otherwise immune from liability under \n     Montana's workers compensation scheme will frequently be \n     dragged into costly lawsuits between injured workers and the \n     manufacturers or sellers of defective machinery.\n       H.R. 956 will also increase workers compensation premiums \n     in Montana by forcing Montana employers and their workers \n     compensation insurers to pay for workplace injuries which are \n     currently the responsibility of manufacturers and sellers of \n     defective products. Whatever its other merits, H.R. 956 \n     undeniably shifts additional costs of workplace injuries \n     caused by defective products onto Montana employers.\n       Finally, and perhaps most dangerously, H.R. 956 seriously \n     jeopardizes the core immunities historically enjoyed by \n     Montana employers. H.R. 956 forcibly injects the issue of \n     employer fault into a previously no-fault state workers \n     compensation scheme. The bill also expressly preempts all \n     inconsistent state statutes--including those guaranteeing \n     exclusive-remedy protection to employers. If (as seems \n     likely) the Montana Supreme Court, in any of several pending \n     appeals, finds limits to such a faultbased workers \n     compensation system under Montana's Constitution, then H.R. \n     956 will automatically preempt the exclusive-remedy statutes \n     now taken for granted by Montana employers.\n       Please consider carefully the unfavorable, perhaps \n     unintentional, impacts of H.R. 956 on Montana employers. \n     Please contact me if I can provide additional information or \n     assistance. Thank you.\n           Respectfully,\n                                            Prof. David Patterson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State \nof Washington.\n  Mr. President, we are about now to vote on what I think is an \nenormously important bill in terms of human beings and in terms of the \nprospects for a better growing economy. However, I will be specific in \nmy closing remarks.\n  There has been so much confusion about what is and what is not \ncovered under product liability in the conference report, and I think \nthat is because there has been a very deliberate attempt to mislead \npeople during the course of this debate and prior to it.\n  There is one example I hope will enlighten my colleagues. Yesterday I \nreceived a letter from MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which \nincorrectly quoted the legislation and, from that, concluded that drunk \ndriving cases would be protected. That is totally wrong. Drunk driving \ncases will not be covered by this bill. Here is what MADD said. The \nbill covers ``harm caused by a product or product use''. Here is the \ncorrect quote, Mr. President. The bill covers ``harm caused by a \nproduct.'' It is product liability that we are talking about--not \nproduct use but product. There is a huge difference.\n  Mr. President, many other well-meaning workers and people have been \ntotally mislead about what this bill\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\ncovers. The issue of what is covered and what is not covered is this: \nIs it the product that causes harm? If yes, then it is covered in the \nbill. However, if the person using the product that causes harm--such \nas the driver of a car--the case is not covered by this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read the law, and it is properly \nquoted by MADD. We doublechecked because we heard some rumors. So \nchecking it out, we found that the MADD position in opposition to this \nlegislation is the same as I included in the Record, you can read the \nexact language which says ``any several action brought, or any theory \nof harm caused by a product or product use''--period, end quote. So \nthey know what they are talking about.\n  Now to the confusion. You saw that 30-minute demonstration we had out \nhere about strict liability and utilities. They wrote that in the \ndouble negative fashion because they did not want to say we are going \nto exempt strict liability. So they have done so by covering it in this \nbill.\n  Right to the point, they tell the gas company to go ahead and get \nreckless and not worry about punitive damages for the simple reason \nthat now, having been written that way, you have to have malice.\n  I could cover a plethora of things. The solution is within the \nStates. The Senator from Rhode Island was correct. We have been on it \nfor 15 years. The State of Tennessee has acted. The State of South \nCarolina has acted. When we say it is a moderate, bipartisan bill, the \nopposition is moderate and bipartisan. There is bipartisan opposition \nbecause this goes totally against the grain. When I was sent up here \nsome 29 years ago standing for States rights, here comes the crowd \nfinally saying let us have education back to the States; Medicaid, let \nus have it back to the States; crime and block grants back to the \nStates; welfare, the Governors say, come, give it to us, back to the \nStates. The States are doing the job. The majority leader runs around \nwith a tenth amendment in his pocket and pulls it out, and says we have \ngovernment going back to the States. But the business crowd downtown \nwrote this sorry measure. It is not bipartisan with respect to the \nconference. We were never asked into that conference; never considered. \nThat had not happened. That had not happened.\n  I found out about this on CBS when they talked about the silly case \nof women going into the men's room.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this debate can come down to an example \ninvolving one individual, a young girl, and one company. The young girl \nis Tara Ransom, whose story is told in today's Wall Street Journal, and \nwho with her parents has come to my office. Tara is one of 50,000 \nhydrocephalics in the United States with a condition that previously \ncould not be treated at all and was a literal terror to its victims and \nto their parents.\n  She has, nonetheless, led a normal life, almost a normal life, due to \na series of silicon shunts which have to be replaced every year or so \ndue to her growth rate.\n  It is now becoming next to impossible for Tara to get such a silicon \nshunt because the one company, Dow-Corning, that is willing to \nmanufacture it, is in bankruptcy largely due to product liability \nlitigation and is threatened with class actions.\n  Dow-Corning simply manufactures the silicone. In one of these shunts \nits net return is $1 or $2. As the Presiding Officer as a physician \nknows, not every medical device works perfectly at all times and under \nall circumstances. I think it is almost inevitable that among those \n50,000 hydrocephalics, or the numbers of thousands who use these shunts \nat some point or another, one of them is going to die, and there will \nbe a threat of a lawsuit against every one who had anything to do with \nthe shunt. The manufacturer of the material itself would be brought \nright into that lawsuit. Its liability, even if it wins, the cost of \nits attorney's fees will be far more than the gross sales price of all \nof the silicone it sold. So it will not sell the material. We now in \nsome parts of the world have a black market in these shunts for \nexactly this reason.\n\n  So to save the trial lawyers, to deal with all of the abstractions we \nheard from here today, Tara Ransom and others like her may soon not be \nable to get the very devices that have allowed them to lead reasonably \nnormal lives. If this bill passes--and I refer you to the statement of \nSenator McCain--that will no longer be the case. It is one of the \nharms, one of the outrages, in our present legal system which will be \ncontrolled by this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Cessna airplane company--in the late 1970's \ngeneral aircraft in the United States was being manufactured and \nshipped at the rate of more than 17,000 a year. By 1982, it was down to \nalmost just more than half of that. By 1986, claims hit $210 million a \nyear. By 1991, Piper went into bankruptcy. By 1993, 100,000 jobs had \nbeen lost in general aviation largely due to our present product \nliability system. By that time, fewer than 1,000 planes per year were \nbeing manufactured in the United States as against 17,000. In August \n1994, this Congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act. All \nit consisted of was a statute of repose at 18 years for aircraft. That \nis all that was in that reform. Already there has been a rebound. The \nvery next year more aircraft were manufactured than were manufactured \nbefore, and this year Cessna is building a $40 million plant to hire \n2,000 people to get back into this business.\n  That, Mr. President, is what this debate is all about--whether or not \nyoung people and older people will be able to get medical devices that \nthey need without the manufacturers being frightened out of the \nbusiness by liability costs, and whether or not industries in the \nUnited States will be able to operate successfully to hire people to \nproduce goods that people would like to buy.\n  We have a legal system now which has hurt our competitiveness, has \ndriven up prices, has reduced the choices that the American people \nhave, all to oblige a handful of trial lawyers. This bill is a modest \nbeginning to create a redress in that balance and to restore the \neconomy of the United States and to provide better products for more \npeople at a lower cost more of the time.

Mr. President, as we near the end of this century, we \nmust be prepared to deal with the changing realities of the post-cold-\nwar world and to meet the new challenges of the 21st century. My \npurpose in speaking today to the Senate is to open a debate on the \ncontinuing need to reshape our national security strategy and military \nforce structure to address those new challenges.\n  We have already made several attempts to deal with these new \nrealities. The Base Force and Bottom Up Review processes were laudable \nearly efforts. However, we have not yet made the difficult decisions to \nadapt to the challenges created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and \nthe Warsaw Pact. Our current strategy and force plans are not \nstructured to meet the challenges of the future.\n  The potential threats to our national security interests today and in \nthe future are different from those of the cold war; they are less \ndeterrable by traditional means and often less easily defeated. We no \nlonger face a superpower threat from the former Soviet Union, although \nwe must be ``prepared to prepare'' to defend against an emerging major \npower threat. We must deal with a wide range of lesser threats \nthroughout the world, including: regional and ethnic conflicts in which \nthe United States could easily become involved; the rise of extremist \nand radical movements; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand the means to deliver them; the increasing capability of individuals \nand nations to attack us through our dependence on technology, \nparticularly information and communications systems; and finally, both \ndomestic and international terrorism.\n  As has been all too common in the past, our military planning focuses \non maintaining the force structure that proved effective in winning the \nlast war, while too little attention has been given to the changing and \nuncertain nature of future conflicts.\n  We must now undertake another effort to reshape our strategy and \nforce structure, an effort which is innovative and forward-thinking \nrather than constrained by the accepted principles of the past. A key \nfocus of this effort must be ensuring that our defense strategy and \nmilitary forces are flexible and capable of quickly evolving to meet \nany new threats.\n  In this effort, we cannot ignore the fiscal realities of our debt-\nridden Federal Government. Planning for our future \nmilitary capabilities must be tempered by a realistic view of fiscal \nconstraints on future defense budgets, without allowing those \nconstraints to become the dominant factor in our decisions about future \ndefense requirements. We must be prepared to accept the cost of being a \nworld power. In short, we must focus on the most cost-effective means \nof maintaining the military capabilities necessary to ensure our future \nsecurity.\n\n  Mr. President, we now face a significant gap between our force plans \nand the resources available to implement them. By 1995, the defense \nbudget had been cut by more than 35 percent in real, inflation-adjusted \ndollars in just 10 years. Independent assessments of the cost of the \nBUR force show that it exceeds the funding levels dedicated by the \ncurrent administration in the Future Years Defense Program [FYDP] by \n$150 billion to $500 billion.\n  As a result, we have been confronted by a series of Hobson's choices. \nWe have had to choose among cutting force strength, maintaining \nreadiness, or funding force modernization within the constraints of \ncontinually declining defense budgets. The result has been reductions \nin all three areas.\n  Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our military manpower levels \nby more than half a million people. After a dangerous trend 3 or 4 \nyears ago of declining military readiness, there is now broad agreement \nthat we have restored current levels of operational activity and \nreadiness of the smaller BUR force. However, we have done so by \nforegoing the modernization programs required to ensure the \neffectiveness of that small force.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has repeatedly warned that \nprocurement accounts are seriously underfunded, and the Vice Chairman \nhas said we face a ``crisis'' in weapons procurement.\n  Because of the modernization crisis, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nhas set a procurement funding goal of $60 billion per year. However, \nthe President's fiscal year 1997 defense budget\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nincludes only $39 billion for procurement--nearly $5 billion less for \nprocurement than was projected in the previous year's budget and far \nshort of the Chairman's target. The administration now projects the $60 \nbillion procurement funding goal will not be reached until the year \n2001--3 years beyond the Chairman's target.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a dangerous long-term impact of postponing \nessential force modernization programs. America's future military \nreadiness hinges on our ability to retain technological superiority \nover any potential adversaries. We have already seen some reduction in \nUnited States capabilities to fight in a single contingency such as the \nPersian Gulf. The continuing failure to invest wisely in military \nmodernization programs has put our future readiness at risk.\n  We must reverse the alarming practice of postponing essential weapons \nmodernization programs. To do this, we need to do one of two things--\neither increase the overall defense budget, or spend our available \ndefense resources more wisely.\n  Last year, the Congress added $7 billion to the President's request \nfor national defense and projected adding $14 billion to the planned \nfiscal year 1997 defense budget. However, the President requested $9 \nbillion less for defense in fiscal year 1997 than Congress provided in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support much-needed efforts in Congress to \nslow the too-rapid decline in defense spending. However, with \ncontinuing pressure to balance the Federal budget and alleviate our \nNation's long-term fiscal crisis, there is, in my view, little \nrealistic prospect of significant, sustained increases in defense \nspending in the future.\n  Therefore, it is imperative that we--the Congress and the \nadministration--begin a debate to develop new ideas to ensure the best \npossible U.S. military force, capable of meeting the challenges of the \nfuture, within the fiscal constraints of today's defense budgets. \nToday, I want to offer my thoughts on the issues that must be \nconsidered in that debate.\n  Mr. President, our national security strategy must complement a \ncredible foreign policy. The United States can and should use diplomacy \nto guide the course of world events, rather than simply observing and \nacquiescing in them. Indecision, hesitation, and vacillation in the \nconduct of our foreign policy only encourage aggression by our \npotential adversaries, possibly leading to conflict.\n  A strong military force is essential to maintaining the credibility \nof our foreign policy. The existence of capable and ready military \nforces, combined with the credible threat of their use when necessary \nto defend our national security interests, serves to deter the outbreak \nof conflict. If deterrence fails, those forces must be prepared to \nreact early and decisively to prevail in war. Without both a credible \nforeign policy and a strong military force, the ability of the United \nStates to shape the future course of world events is severely hampered.\n  As I noted earlier, our Nation's fiscal situation makes it likely \nthat the defense budget will, at best, remain at the current level, \ndespite recent efforts in Congress to increase the defense budget. This \nlevel is widely recognized as inadequate to fund the force structure \nnecessary to support our current strategy of engagement and \nenlargement, based on a capability to fight and win two nearly \nsimultaneous major regional contingencies [MRCs].\n  Further, the two-MRC strategy is focused too narrowly on large \nconventional conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Korea. It must be \nbroadened to ensure attention to all possible conflict scenarios, not \njust the current military capabilities of Iraq and North Korea.\n  Current fiscal reality, which makes unlikely future significant \nincreases in defense spending, as well as an overly narrow focus of our \ncurrent strategy demand that we reassess both our strategy and our \nforce structure. Therefore, many U.S. planners, including senior \nplanners on the Joint Staff and the military staffs of the Armed \nServices, are already in the process of considering a single MRC \nstrategy in which the United States would only be able to fight one \nmajor conflict at a time.\n  In conducting a reassessment of our future force requirements, we \nshould focus on a flexible contingency strategy supported by an \naffordable, flexible force. Our force planning should provide, at a \nminimum, sufficient levels to decisively prevail in a single, generic \nMRC. At the same time, we must recognize the existence of many lesser \nthreats and maintain the capability to inflict unacceptable damage on \nan adversary should one or more of these threats materialize.\n  This more realistic approach to future force planning will eliminate \nthe gap between our current strategy and fiscal reality. While planning \nfor a flexible force with the ability of fighting a single MRC, \npossibly together with one or more lesser threats, may necessitate the \nacceptance of some additional risk in certain areas, it is far better \nthan to plan for forces and capabilities that will never materialize \nwithin the limits of likely future defense budgets.\n\n\n                         future force structure\n\n  The nature of foreseeable conflicts requires that we continue to \nprovide for a force structure containing air, land, and see elements \nthat are flexible enough to adapt quickly to unforeseeable situations. \nOur warfighting forces must be capable of responding quickly and \neffectively to any potential challenge and should be designed to \nsupplement the military forces of our allies in order to provide the \ngreatest military capability in the future at the lowest possible cost.\n  Very briefly, let me describe the principal warfighting capabilities \nthat must be maintained to ensure our readiness in the future.\n  Naval forces: Our naval forces are at the forefront of our forward \npresence, crisis response, and power projection capability. They are \namong the most likely to be called to respond to a crisis and the most \nlikely to be used in the early phases of any regional conflict.\n  Naval vessels should be self-sustaining and have significant \noffensive capability while providing for their own defense. Automation \nof weapon systems and support equipment aboard these vessels should be \npursued to minimize the number of personnel required to produce an \nefficient, lethal fighting platform.\n  Much of our power projection capability will continue to be provided \nby carrier-based air power, increasingly supplemented by cruise \nmissiles and other long-range strike systems. Political uncertainties, \nmaking the use of forward air bases problematic, mean that we cannot \nalways rely upon these assets in a crisis situation. One only has to \nremember the United States bombing of Libya in 1986, and the \nrestrictions on over-flights of certain countries, to realize that we \nmust maintain a sufficient force of aircraft carriers if we want to \nprovide the capability of ever-ready air power.\n  Marine expeditionary forces will continue to fill a critical role in \nany future force structure because of their flexibility and the ease \nwith which they can be dispatched to regional hot spots. These forces \nmust be supported with sufficient lift, mine warfare capability, and \nshore fire support.\n  Our submarine force will continue to play an important role. We must, \nhowever, re-examine the numbers and mix of the planned post-cost war \nrealities. Today's threats make it possible to scale back plans to \nreplace the current, very capable attack submarine force with an all-\nnew class of stealthy, high-technology submarines.\n\n  Air power: Air power that can be quickly deployed and engage the \nenemy with devastating effect is a critical element of any future force \nstructure. Our air assets must be maintained at the forefront of \ntechnology in order to pose a viable threat to our enemies.\n  Our tactical aircraft must have the capability to deliver precision \nweapons on enemy targets. Multimission platforms and maximum firepower \nper platform should be absolute requirements, as the cost of aircraft \ncontinues to climb at an enormous rate. Precision-guided stand-off \nweapons, such as cruise missiles, will increasingly become the weapon \nof choice for their ability to attack enemy targets without endangering \nair crews and expensive platforms.\n  Procurement of self-protection equipment is both necessary and cost-\neffective. Every effort should be made to build upon existing \nelectronic and\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nother countermeasures, including expendables.\n  At the same time, we should explore opportunities to increase the use \nof remotely piloted vehicles [RPVs] and unmanned aerial vehicles \n[UAVs]. Both RPVs and UAVs offer great potential to provide a cheaper, \nmore effective means of gathering information and delivering ordnance, \nwhile minimizing risk to our air crews.\n  We must act now to resolve the issue of strategic versus tactical \nbombers. We must maintain a viable offensive capability at an \naffordable cost. Therefore, we must carefully consider cost versus \ncapabilities in assessing the effectiveness of our strategic and \ntactical bombers in a conventional role. Current information supports a \ndecision to cap the B-2 bomber program at its present fleet size and \ngive higher priority to precision-guided munitions and improved \ntactical fighter/bomber forces.\n  Ground forces: As our overseas basing continues to decline, we must \nreassess our requirement for large ground-based forces. This will \nrequire greater emphasis on allied capabilities for ground combat \nmissions. U.S. ground forces must be readily deployable, requiring a \nreassessment of the balance between heavy and light forces. Greater \nemphasis and reliance on smaller, lighter, and more automated systems \nmay be appropriate.\n  We need to retailor both our active and reserve forces to concentrate \nour resources on forces we can rapidly deploy or move forward within a \nfew months. We do not need units, bases, reserves, or large stocks of \nequipment that we cannot project outside the United States without a \nyear or more of mobilization time.\n\n  Information technology will continue to revolutionize the \nbattlefield, giving ground commanders unprecedented levels of \nsituational awareness on the battlefield. We must ensure that resources \nare dedicated to providing these essential technological enhancements.\n  Our ground forces must be properly equipped to maintain superior \noffensive and defense capabilities. Increased night warfighting \ncapabilities, increased survivability of tanks and heavy artillery, and \nimprovements in antiarmor defenses are particularly important. \nIncreased capability to detect, defend, and survive in a biological or \nchemical warfare environment is absolutely essential.\n  Special Operations Forces: We must continue to maintain the \ncapability to conduct special military operations in a variety of \nmissions. Special operations forces expand the range of options \navailable to decisionmakers by confronting crises and conflicts below \nthe threshold of war. These forces must be able to respond to \nspecialized contingencies across the conflict spectrum with stealth, \nspeed, and precision.\n  Strategic Lift: We must continue to focus on improving our ability to \nmove personnel and equipment overseas. The limits we face on the \nforward deployment of our forces, in a world where our forces could be \nrequired in any region of the globe, means that strategic lift has \nbecome increasingly important. We must increase our efforts to procure \nthe necessary lift capacity to maximize the mobility of our forces.\n  National Guard and Reserves: The Reserve and Guard components of the \nArmed Forces should be tasked primarily with those mission areas which \nsupport rapid power projection and require little training prior to \ndeployment. Combat arms units in the Guard and Reserves that cannot be \nmobilized within a very short period of time cannot play a decisive \nrole in conflict resolution. By restricting the Guard and Reserves to \nthose areas where proficiency can be maintained with minimal unit \ntraining time, we can minimize the risk that essential military forces \nwill not be prepared if they are called upon in a crisis situation.\n  The missions most appropriate to the Guard and Reserves, commonly \nreferred to as combat support or combat service support, are those \ndirectly related to a civilian occupation, such as transportation \nspecialists, medical support, public affairs, and computer and \ninformation specialists.\n  There are, however, certain military missions which should not be \nassigned to the Reserves or Guard. These missions, such as heavy armor \nand infantry, require constant physical conditioning and training in \nlarge unit exercises, and are best left to the active forces which can \nbe maintained in a ready state for rapid deployment.\n  Other force capabilities: Other high-priority force capabilities \ninclude cost-effective theater and national missile defense systems, \neffective counter-proliferation and proliferation detection \ncapabilities, safe and reliable nuclear deterrent forces, and \ntechnologically superior, maintainable space-based systems.\n  These essential force capabilities will not exist in the future \nwithout sufficient investment in modernization programs. Our ability to \ncounter future threats will not depend on stealthy submarines or more \nlong-range bombers. Instead, we should emphasize the capabilities most \neffective in likely future conflicts; namely, adequate strategic sea \nand air lift, enhanced amphibious capability, next-generation tactical \naircraft, deployable light ground forces, and improved command, \ncontrol, and communications systems. Investment now in these high-\npriority programs will ensure our future readiness.\n\n\n                         tiered force readiness\n\n  Mr. President, during the 1970's, the United States allowed its \nmilitary to become hollow by failing to dedicate adequate resources to \nthe day-to-day operational readiness of our Armed Forces. Defense \nbudget increases in the 1980's restored the readiness and morale of our \nforces and provided much-needed investment funding.\n  Because of the continuous decline in defense budgets since the mid-\n1980's, however, we heard warnings from our highest-ranking military \nofficers of a similar readiness crisis in the early 1990's. We heeded \nthose warnings and managed to reverse the alarming trends toward \nanother hollow force by dedicating increasing shares of our smaller \ndefense budgets to the readiness of our forces.\n  Today, we are permitting our forces to become hollow in a different \nway. We are shortchanging military modernization, as we did in the \n1920's and 1930's. Then, our military forces were antiquated and \ninadequately equipped, requiring several years and many millions of \ndollars before they were prepared to fight our enemies in World War II. \nBecause of our failure to adequately fund the investment accounts, our \nforces today face a future armed with rapidly aging equipment which is \ndifficult and expensive to maintain and operate.\n  We must stop postponing essential modernization programs. To maintain \nthe force capabilities I have described, and to keep them modernized, \nwe must look for savings elsewhere in the defense budget.\n  There are many approaches to streamlining defense operations and \nactivities that could result in cost savings and which should be done \nto ensure the best value to the American taxpayer. We should consider \nrevisiting our infrastructure requirements, modernizing and making more \nefficient cross-service activities, and greater privatization on \nnonmilitary activities. However, the magnitude of savings from these \nefficiencies is negligible in comparison to the funding required to \nmodernize and maintain a ready military force.\n  Another approach we should consider, which would save scarce defense \nresources and make available needed funding for critical modernization \nprograms, would be to reevaluate the readiness requirements of our \nmilitary forces. Although, to a limited extent, the Military services \ncurrently maintain forces at varying readiness levels, a comprehensive, \nforce-wide review must be performed to ensure the future overall \nreadiness of our forces.\n  Criticality of forces in any future crisis should be the determining \nfactor of the degree of day-to-day readiness that each military unit \nshould maintain. An evaluation should include two key factors: First, \nthe likelihood that forces will be called upon to respond to a military \ncrisis, and second, the timeframe in which those forces would be \ndeployed. Forces could then be categorized by readiness tiers based on \nthe degree of day-to-day readiness at which they should be maintained.\n  It is important to differentiate this proposed tiering of readiness \nrequirements from the current fluctuations in unit readiness which are \ncaused by training or operational deployments. For example, our Navy \ncarrier forces\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nare maintained at the highest readiness level while on cruise, fall \nback to a very low level when they first return to homeport, and then \ngradually regain their readiness as they prepare for the next \ndeployment. The proposal outlined above for tiered force structure \nreadiness would categorize units based on their criticality to a crisis \nsituation, not on these normal training fluctuations.\n\n  The following delineation of our forces at three different levels of \nmilitary readiness is proposed as the starting point for a discussion \nof the concept of tiered readiness.\n  Tier I--Forward-Deployed and Crisis Response Forces: In peacetime, \nour forward-deployed military forces support our diplomacy and our \ncommitments to our allies. Our forward military presence takes the form \nof fixed air and ground bases that are home to U.S. forces overseas, \nand our forward-deployed carriers, surface combatants, and amphibious \nforces. Some special operations forces are also forward-deployed, both \nat sea and ashore. Reserves become part of the equation through our \nmilitary exercise programs.\n  In the event of a crisis, these forward-deployed forces are most \noften called upon to respond first to contain the crisis. In addition, \nour crisis response forces must be able to get to the region quickly \nand be able to enter the region using force, since we cannot assume \nthat ports or airfields will be available. These qualifications limit \nthe types of forces that must be ready to respond quickly in a crisis:\n  Air forces are limited to aircraft that can make a round trip from a \nsecure base.\n  Land forces include airborne units.\n  Sea forces include carriers, surface combatants, and amphibious \nforces within a range of a few days.\n  The Army afloat brigade and naval maritime prepositioning forces can \nrespond quickly and, supported by airborne and amphibious forces, can \nexpect to have a secure port and airfield in the region when they \narrive.\n  Because they must be able to respond effectively within a matter of \ndays, forward-deployed and crisis response forces must be maintained at \nthe highest state, or tier, of readiness.\n  Tier II--Force Buildup: History shows that crises can usually be \nresolved or contained by the deployment of only a small portion of our \nmilitary capability. In the past 50 years, the United States \nhas responded militarily to crises throughout the world over 300 times, \nbut we have deployed follow-on forces in anticipation of a major \nregional conflict only 5 times. These include the forward deployment of \nUnited States troops in Europe at the onset of the cold war; the \ndeployment of forces to Korea in 1950; the deployment of forces in \nresponse to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962; deployment to Vietnam in \nthe 1960's; and deployment to Southwest Asia in 1990.\n\n  Although follow-on forces have been used only rarely, we must still \nmaintain the forces necessary to halt an escalating crisis.\n  Buildup forces are those that can deploy and achieve combat-ready \nstatus within a matter of weeks rather than days. These follow-on \nforces require permissive access to the theater of operations. There \nmust be airfields available for land-based tactical aviation, ports \navailable to receive land forces and logistics support, and property \navailable for assembly and training areas and supplies and maintenance \nactivities.\n  Unlike initial response forces, these forces may be maintained at a \nlower level, or tier, of readiness since they will not be required in \nthe theater of operations until after the initial stages of the \nconflict. They must, however, maintain the ability to return to a high \nstate of readiness within a short time.\n  Tier III--Conflict Resolution: In only three of the cases mentioned \nabove--Korea, Vietnam, and Southwest Asia--were we engaged in sustained \nconflict, requiring a large-scale deployment of United States forces.\n  Forces that seldom deploy must be maintained and available to ensure \nthat we have the force superiority to prevail in any conflict. Conflict \nresolution forces include those that deploy late in the conflict \nbecause of limited airlift or sealift, and the finite capacity of the \ntheater to absorb arriving forces. Also included are the later-arriving \nheavy ground forces, naval forces that have not already deployed, and \nair forces that become supportable as airfields and support capability \nin theater expands.\n  These combat units should be maintained at a third, or lowest, tier \nof readiness. They would not be required in the theater of operations \nuntil after about the sixth month of the conflict and would, therefore, \nhave sufficient time to make ready for deployment.\n  Finally, we must reexamine the practice of maintaining combat units \nfor which there is either no identified requirement under our national \nmilitary strategy, or which cannot be deployed to a theater of \noperations until after a time certain following the outbreak of a \nconflict--perhaps 9 months to a year. We should not be spending scarce \ndefense funds on combat forces which do not significantly enhance our \nnational security.\n\n  Adjusting the readiness requirements of our military forces requires \na thorough reassessment of our warfighting strategy and tactics. We \nmust recognize that maintaining force readiness at different levels, or \ntiers, may increase the potential risk in the near term. However, the \nalternative is an antiquated force of the future which would not be \ncapable of effectively protecting our national interests. The resources \nsaved by tiering readiness could be reinvested in modernization and \nrecapitalization of most needed capabilities. The long-term result of \ntiered readiness may very well be a more capable force for the future, \nand a force which is affordable under foreseeable fiscal constraints.\n  The ideas presented in this paper are designed to spur a much-needed \ndebate about U.S. national security strategy and military force \nstructure for the 21st century. The President and the Congress share in \nthe responsibility of providing adequate military forces, properly \ntrained and equipped to deal with whatever consequences a changing \nworld holds for the United States.\n  We have an opportunity to chart a new course for national security, \nand we cannot afford inaction when offered a chance to abandon \n``business as usual.'' If we ignore the difficult issues facing us \ntoday, we will fail in our most basic responsibility--protecting the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  I thank my friend from New Mexico, my neighbor. I know how important \nthe issue is that he brings before the Senate. I appreciate his \nindulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator McCain, might I just comment that not \nonly what he spoke of is vitally important but, as I reviewed the \nPresident's budget--not for the details as it pertains to these areas \nwhere the Senator finds deficiencies but in terms of the funding--I \nfind that it is $14 billion in budget authority under what was \nrequested in our budget resolution after long negotiations between the \nHouse and the Senate. I do not believe that would help any of that. It \nwould only make it somewhat worse. But I wanted to make that comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2386-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2389-S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC RANGELANDS MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate,S. 1459, the Public Rangelands Management Act.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1459) to provide for uniform management of \n     livestock grazing on Federal land, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me try to talk to the Senate about \nwhere we are.\n  We have before us a public lands reform act that deals with grazing \nand other multiple uses, principally with grazing as one of the \nmultiple uses, and the reform in that for those who are ranching on \npublic domain.\n  There are a number of Senators on our side and certainly on the \nDemocrat side who want to speak to this issue. There are a number of \nSenators who have amendments. Let me make a few observations about \nthat.\n  First, I want to thank the Democrat leader, Senator Dole, my friend \nSenator Bingaman, and other Democrats who are working on this bill \nbecause,\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nas I gather, we are going to try to accommodate each other and in the \nnext couple of days get this matter to a final vote.\n  The Republican leader has graciously given us the rest of today, most \nof tomorrow, and tomorrow night as long as is necessary to get this \nbill finished. For that we very much appreciate his generosity of the \nSenate's time. But I would say there has also been some comment about \nour leader about not having any votes on Friday. I would suggest he has \nalso indicated to me that he would like to see this bill finished \nThursday night, if we are going to have a Friday without votes to be \nfollowed by a Monday, as I understand it, without votes.\n  So I ask that anyone who has an amendment to this bill--I only know \nof two at this point, and I have not seen one of them, but the other I \nam pretty familiar with--I hope they will accommodate us by getting to \ntheir manager and to the floor whatever amendments they might have. We \ndo not need any surprises, and there will be none because there are no \ntime agreements on the amendments.\n  So, if we need a couple of hours to look them over, we can either do \nit in advance, or we will do it while the Senate is in session here on \nthe floor.\n  I understand Senator Bumpers has an amendment that changes the \ngrazing fees. I say to all the Senators present that I have not seen it \nyet. We are asking that it be presented as soon as possible. When I sit \ndown, I will go try to find out where it is.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3555\n\n  (Purpose: An amendment in the nature of a substitute to the Public \n                   Rangelands Management Act of 1995)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have, in behalf of a number of \nSenators--myself, the chairman of the committee, Senators Murkowski, \nCraig, Thomas, Burns, Kyl, Campbell, Hatch, Bennett, Kempthorne, \nSimpson, Pressler, and Dole--a substitute for the pending measure. It \nis understood that it will be the first thing tendered to the Senate.\n  On behalf of those Senators and myself, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for himself, \n     Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Craig, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Burns, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n     Simpson, Mr. Pressler, and Mr. Dole, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3555.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the floor right now I see four \nSenators on our side who might want to speak. I would like to propose \nthe following: Senator Bingaman is here, and he would like to speak. I \nwould like to yield to my fellow colleagues on this side for some \nopening remarks and intersperse that between Republicans and Democrats. \nIs Senator Campbell prepared to make opening remarks?\n  I propose that Senator Bingaman go first. Then, if he is ready, for \nhim proceed, and then we will go over to our side in which two Senators \nwill speak.\n  I am going to leave the floor. Let us say that after Senator \nBingaman, Senator Burns will make his own agreement as to which one \nwould go first. Senator Bumpers will not be ready until at least 4:30 \nor a little later.\n  So why not handle it that way?\n  Mr. President, Senator Stevens has been waiting patiently on the \nfloor. I ask unanimous consent that he be given 2 minutes as if in \nmorning business to introduce a bill, after which we will follow the \ninformal format that we just agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I, too, have to leave the floor. I thank my colleagues \nfor permitting me to make this statement.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 1629 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two members \nof my staff, Charles Hunt and Sharon Miner, be given floor privileges \nduring the entire proceedings on S. 1459.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the Public \nRangelands Management Act, and for the courageous efforts of my \ndistinguished colleague and neighbor, Senator Domenici.\n  While I was sitting here, I was just reading a disparaging ad that \nwas taken out in the Wednesday, March 13, 1996, issue of the \nAlbuquerque Journal, the largest city in New Mexico. I have to tell \nyou, nothing could be farther from the truth than this ad. It accuses \nthe Senator from New Mexico of trashing the public lands, of drying up \nthe streams, of driving people off the land, and practically everything \nexcept raping the West.\n  I thought it was very unfortunate that the shrillness of the debate \nhas gotten to that point. But I guess that is what we all face when we \ntry to make changes around here--that we have to face some pretty angry \npeople.\n  But, from my perspective, the Senator from New Mexico has shown great \ncourage in trying to solve the problem that we have been dealing with \nfor decades here in the U.S. Congress.\n  As many of you know, the showdown in the West over cattle and grazing \nrights has been going on for a long time. In the old days, the \ndifferences were simply settled over a shot of whiskey or with a shot \nfrom the Winchester. But today, with our elevated laws and regulations, \nwe attempt to settle our differences using the power of legislative \nlanguage and administrative rulemaking. However, it is clear when you \nread ads like that, that the raw passions and emotions over the \nmanagement of livestock on public lands often persevere and drive these \nvery strong debates. Unfortunately for the family rancher whose very \nlivelihood is dependent on the fate of these laws and regulations, our \ndebates have reached such emotional heights that we have almost \nforgotten what actually happens to the family that has to make a living \non the land.\n  But this issue should not be about emotions or politics. It should \nnot be driven along partisan lines.\n  The debate today should not be about who is right and who is wrong, \non whichever version of rules and regulations we are looking at. It \nshould not be about the environmentalists versus the ranchers. The \ndebate should be about how to best nurture sustainable ecosystems on \nthe public lands in the West while still maintaining a consistent, \nhealthy, and viable environment for ranchers and farmers to make a \nliving on the public lands.\n  I believe the bill of the Senator from New Mexico does that. He has \nworked on it with a number of us from the West for many months. We have \ngone through trial and error and met with a great resistance. I think \nperhaps we finally have something that can pass.\n  I ask my colleagues for a moment to put themselves in the shoes or \nboots, as the case may be, of the western rancher today. There is a lot \nof mystique over who they actually are and what they do. Oftentimes we \nhear debates in the Senate about the so-called welfare ranchers or the \nrich CEO's or tycoons or perhaps surgeons who bought some land out \nWest, and have some grazing permits but do not actually know how to \nranch. We hear these stories of people taking advantage of the system. \nBut I am here to tell you most of us who really believe in the West and \nranching in America are not here to defend them. We are here to try to \ndefend our friends, and neighbors. These are the people we know who \nhave helped build Western America and who have a very strong belief in \ntaking care of the land.\n  Contrary to perception that these folks somehow make a mint off the \npublic lands, most independent cattle ranchers today are struggling \nwith weak and unpredictable markets and increasing instability of rules \nand regulations that govern the way they do their daily chores. The \nuncertainty of Federal legislation often puts ranchers in a precarious \nposition when they have to borrow money from their local\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\nbank. They have no idea what to tell the banker regarding the stability \nof their permit, given the inability of Congress to resolve this issue.\n  Raising livestock is a tough business, and I venture to say that \nthose who have survived the back breaking work, the tough climate, the \nmarket fluctuations and the political pressures, too, are simply in it \nbecause they love the land and animals that subsist off it. These are \npeople who care about the land not only because they have to, but \nbecause they want to.\n  I think I can tell you with certainty that any rancher who does not \ntake care of the land simply does not stay in business. I know for a \nfact that they are better stewards than they are often given credit \nfor.\n  Over the last few years, the Department of Interior, in my opinion, \nhas engaged in kind of a deceitful and arrogant attempt to override \nwesterners and our ability to make decisions for ourselves. The \nunderlying message of the Department of Interior's rangeland reform \nbasically states that we are not smart enough to figure out what is \ngood for us. Indeed, according to the regulations promulgated last \nsummer by the Secretary of Interior, we apparently need the assistance \nof beltway bureaucrats, national environmental groups, and virtually \neveryone else in the country with a peripheral interest in our business \nin order to make even the smallest decisions on our ranches, including \nwhere to put a water holding tank or a cattle guard.\n  Unlike the administration's proposal, the Public Rangelands \nManagement Act, which Senator Domenici has introduced will empower \nlocal people to make the decisions that affect them directly. This bill \ndoes nothing to prevent broader public participation in management \nplans or recreational activities on the public lands.\n  Under S. 1459, affected interests are given the opportunity to \ncomment on seven different kinds of proposed decisions affecting \ngrazing allotments. By managing the public participation process, S. \n1459 will provide much needed relief for permittees and Federal land \nmanagers from frivolous protests from out-of-State activists who oppose \nany use of the public lands whatsoever.\n  I believe that the Department of the Interior's rangeland reform is \nan undermining effort to overturn a lifestyle that has been part of the \nhistory of this Nation. In its zealous attempt to increase the \ndiversity of the biological life on the range, it is threatening that \nlifestyle and operation that is already endangered. As I mentioned \nearlier, ranching is a tough business and it has become increasingly \nmore difficult. Literally hundreds of ranchers in the West who were in \nbusiness just 5 or 6 years ago, have already gone into bankruptcy.\n\n  In my own State of Colorado, many real estate developers are taking \nadvantage of the unstable market and buying ranchers out to split up \ntheir land and subdivide the property into small units and tracts. \nIronically, by attempting to increase diversity on the range, the \nrangeland regulations as they are promulgated by the Secretary of the \nInterior will only assist the paving over of the brush, the grassland, \nand the fields, putting them all under concrete and plywood. I think \neven the most ardent environmentalists would prefer to see cattle in \nthose meadows and fields rather than pavement and condominiums.\n  In fact, if we look at the Department of the Interior's own reports, \nwe can see evidence that indicates that the rangelands are in some of \nthe best conditions they have ever been and continue to improve. For \nexample, according to the Deer and Elk Management Analysis Guide \npublished in 1993 by the Colorado Division of Wildlife, Colorado's elk \npopulation is estimated to have increased from 3,000 animals in 1900 to \n185,000 in 1990. That report also indicates that Colorado's deer \npopulation is estimated to have increased from 6,000 animals in 1900 to \n600,000 in 1990.\n  As a western Senator who has worked closely with grazing for many \nyears, I truly understand the difficulty of trying to achieve a \nconsensus on this issue. I have to say that the time has run out, and \nS. 1459 presents us with the best and I think perhaps the last chance \nto balance the concerns of the environmentalists with the concerns of \nthe ranchers in a constructive manner. If you take away all the \nrhetoric, you will find that this bill has been crafted from \ncollaboration and compromise.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I submit for the Record two resolutions. \nOne was passed by the Colorado State Joint House and Senate Memorial \nCommittee supporting the Public Rangelands Management Act. The second \nis a resolution from Club 20 which is an organization built from 20 \ncounties in western Colorado which also declares their support for \nSenator Domenici's bill. I ask unanimous consent to have those printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolutions were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                  Colorado Senate Joint Memorial 96-3\n\n       Whereas, The federal rangelands are currently in the best \n     condition that they have ever been in; and\n       Whereas, The condition of the federal rangelands has \n     improved and continues to improve through the efforts of \n     holders of federal grazing rights; and\n       Whereas, As a consequence of the efforts of holders of \n     federal grazing rights, the improvement of the federal \n     rangelands has resulted in stabilized and increasing \n     populations of big game and wildlife, and further efforts \n     will continue to provide long term benefits to big game and \n     wildlife; and\n       Whereas, The western livestock industry is a vital \n     component of the economy of Colorado and the economy of the \n     United States, providing the people of the nation and the \n     world with a reliable and healthy source of food; and\n       Whereas, Fees for grazing on federal lands must reflect a \n     fair return to the federal government; and\n       Whereas, The Public Rangelands Management Act (S. 1459) has \n     been introduced in the United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, The objectives of the Public Rangelands Management \n     Act are to promote healthy sustainable rangelands and to \n     enhance the productivity of federal lands while at the same \n     time facilitating the orderly use, improvement, and \n     development of those lands; and\n       Whereas, The Public Rangelands Management Act gives \n     consideration to the need for stabilization of the livestock \n     industry, scientific monitoring of trends, the environmental \n     health of riparian areas, and the needs of wildlife \n     populations dependent on federal lands; now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the Senate of the Sixtieth General \n     Assembly of the State of Colorado, the House of \n     Representatives concurring herein:\n       That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly, \n     strongly urge the Congress of the United States to pass the \n     Public Rangelands Management Act (S. 1459).\n       Be it further Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be \n     sent to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Interior.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         Resolutions by Voice of the Western Slope, Since 1953\n\n\n                    public rangelands management act\n\n       Whereas: 73% of the Western Colorado is owned by the \n     federal government, mostly in the form of BLM and Forest \n     Service lands, and\n       Whereas: The use of these lands for grazing is critical to \n     the economic viability of Western Colorado's livestock \n     industry and to the communities supported by that industry, \n     and\n       Whereas: The Interior Department's recently-adopted revised \n     grazing regulations provide an unfair and unacceptable \n     environment for the livestock industry to operate in, \n     specifically in terms of the makeup of local grazing advisory \n     councils, lack of incentives for investment in the range \n     resource by the permitees, lack of provisions to encourage \n     stability through the use of extended permit terms, and lack \n     of needed efficiencies in the administration of grazing \n     management on these public lands, and\n       Whereas: The formula for determining the livestock grazing \n     fee needs to be established in an equitable manner, in law, \n     in order to provide fair return to the public and a \n     reasonable rate for permitees, now therefore be it Resolved \n     by the Board of Directors at its 1995 Fall Meeting that CLUB \n     20 supports the concepts embodied in S. 852 and H.R. 1713 as \n     introduced, specifically:\n       Addition of public representatives on local grazing \n     advisory councils while still allowing majority \n     representation by those with an economic interest at stake,\n       Adoption of a new formula for establishing the public lands \n     grazing fee in order to ensure a fair return to the public \n     and a reasonable rate for permitees,\n       Provisions to ensure proper management of public lands \n     resources through NEPA-documented land use plans, range \n     monitoring and enforcement.\n       Streamlining of the NEPA documentation process to allow for \n     full public participation in the development of area land use \n     plans without unnecessarily encumbering local agency officers \n     and preventing them from carrying out sound range management.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Resolution by Voice of the Western Slope, Since 1953\n\n\n                         rangeland reform 1994\n\n       Whereas: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has proposed \n     grazing reforms which contain\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n     many administrative changes unacceptable to the West, and\n       Whereas: CLUB 20 has always supported the multiple use of \n     public lands, and food production, as a component of the \n     multiple use of public lands, contributes significantly to \n     the total food production of the United States, and\n       Whereas: As a whole, ranchers have been excellent stewards \n     of the rangelands, benefiting both livestock and wildlife, \n     and\n       Whereas: CLUB 20 believes Secretary Babbitt's proposed \n     regulatory rangeland reform will ruin the livestock industry \n     and substantially affect the total economy of Western \n     Colorado, and\n       Whereas: It is not in the best interest of Western Colorado \n     for affected ranches to be subdivided and sold in small \n     parcels, and now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the CLUB 20 Board of Directors at its Fall \n     Meeting, September 10, 1993, the CLUB 20 cannot support the \n     administrative changes suggested in the proposed ``Rangeland \n     Reform `94''.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a Denver Post editorial of March 13 of 1995. Although I will \nnot read the whole thing, which endorses S. 1459, I wish to read the \nfirst paragraph which states under the headline, The Domenici Grazing \nBill Fosters Better Stewardship:\n\n       Some Eastern-based environmental groups have been waging a \n     political holy war against the Public Rangelands Management \n     Act authored by New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici, but it \n     seems clear that both the long-term environmental and \n     economic interests of the West would be well served by this \n     legislation to provide some badly needed stability and \n     balance to the management of the public lands.\n\n  This is from one of our State's largest newspapers.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Domenici's Grazing Bill Fosters Better Stewardship\n\n       Some Eastern-based environmental groups have been waging a \n     political holy war against the Public Rangelands Management \n     Act authored by New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici. But it seems \n     clear that both the long-term environmental and economic \n     interests of the West would be well served by this \n     legislation to provide some badly needed stability and \n     balance to the management of public lands.\n       Domenici's bill is basically a response to new rangeland \n     management rules proposed in February by Secretary of the \n     Interior Bruce Babbitt after many hearings and much debate. \n     Critics of the Domenici bill are now trying to kill it in the \n     belief that it is less favorable to the environmental lobby \n     than Babbitt's rules. While they are undoubtedly right on \n     that point, the critics are overlooking a crucial fact: What \n     a liberal Democratic administration can arbitrarily impose, \n     the next conservative Republican administration can \n     arbitrarily repeal.\n       Administrative mandates without the permanence of law thus \n     raise the specter of wild oscillations in policies that lock \n     everything up after one election, then encourage short-term \n     plunder after the next. That's the opposite of what the West \n     needs--a policy that fosters long-term stewardship of the \n     land, rewarding users who manage it carefully and punishing \n     the greedy or stupid who abuse it for short-term gain. Both \n     Babbitt and Domenici are aiming at that goal, but only \n     Domenici is trying to cast it into long-term law.\n       The swinging-pendulum policies of recent years clearly have \n     been bad for all concerned. Ranchers who aren't sure they can \n     continue leasing land have no incentive to make expensive \n     investments to control erosion or other problems. Likewise, \n     past policies have been too slow to punish the small minority \n     of ranchers who have neglected the land. In contrast, \n     Domenici's bill, S. 852, encourages the Department of \n     Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with permit \n     holders for ``the construction, installation, modification, \n     maintenance, or use of a permanent range improvement or \n     development of a rangeland.''\n       Importantly, the Public Rangeland Management Act would \n     allow grazing leases to be issued for up to 15 years--\n     encouraging lessees to make long-term improvements and to \n     carefully nourish the land. And while it would increase \n     grazing fees approximately 30 percent from existing levels, \n     the PRMA would also establish future fees by a formula keyed \n     to the actual value of such leases as reflected in the price \n     of the animals that can be raised on them. Again, by assuring \n     a fair return to taxpayers and ranchers alike, the Domenici \n     bill would reduce the risk of radical ``windfall or wipeout'' \n     oscillations in fees which could themselves encourage \n     overgrazing or other misuse of the land.\n       Some of the more hysterical opponents of the bill have \n     claimed it would ban hiking, fishing or hunting from the \n     public lands. The simplest answer to that charge is that it \n     is an outright lie. The bill in fact encourages conservation, \n     control of soil erosion and ``consideration of wildlife \n     populations and habitat, consistent with land-use plans, \n     multiple-use, sustained yield, (and) environmental values.''\n       The bill does give an important role to ranchers themselves \n     in establishing grazing policies, recognizing that families \n     who, in some cases, have managed public lands for more than a \n     century are obvious sources of expertise and concern for \n     their long-term welfare. But local citizens, public officials \n     and environmental groups are also given seats at the policy \n     table.\n       The Public Rangeland Management Act isn't perfect, and we \n     welcome efforts to improve it as it wends its way through \n     Congress. But it is a good start toward the wiser stewardship \n     the public lands so clearly require.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. So with that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor and \nsimply urge my colleagues to support this well-crafted legislation. \nUnder the leadership of Senator Domenici, it has taken many of us much \ntime and effort.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to once again repeat and inquire \nas to whether or not we might see and be able to read the Bumpers \namendment with reference to increased grazing fees. If it is prepared, \nI hope somebody would let us see it. We would like to have a vote as \nsoon as possible and that would be the one we would vote on.\n  Mr. President, I am going to very quickly yield to my friend, Senator \nBingaman, and then to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Could I just take 3 minutes? I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, when I became a Senator 24 years ago, I knew nothing \nabout grazing, nothing about rangeland, nothing about public domain. I \ntraveled New Mexico and met some of the finest people in the world. It \njust so happens that more times than not they were ranchers or ranching \nfamilies. They had their house out there on a little piece of private \nproperty and some of their own property and then they had permit land. \nSome of them had been there for two generations, maybe in succession in \ntheir family. I can guarantee you that I never met finer folks, nor \nhave I ever met folks who are more dedicated to maintaining the public \ndomain and their stewardship. They just reeked in stewardship of this \nland. They always talked about it in terms of how they preserved it, \nhow it maintained their families and how so long as they could keep \nthat together and keep the rangeland in good condition, they could be \nthere and enjoy this lifestyle and this manner of living.\n  We are in danger of many things in the western public domain lands. \nSome say the West is gone and urbanization shall take over. I do not \nreally believe that. There is so much public domain and open space that \nthe Federal Government is going to have to decide now and for decades \nto come how they want the people of this country to utilize it. Many, \nmany years ago, order was made out of total chaos and the Taylor \nGrazing Act was passed for America.\n  It recognized multiple uses, and a simple proposition that you could \ngraze cattle, pay a reasonable fee to the Government, do maintenance on \nthat land to be able to tend to those cattle, and in addition have \nhunting, fishing, recreation, and the other things that go with it--\nnamely, multiple use. Nothing, in my opinion, has changed. We ought to \nhave multiple use. But we do not have to destroy the lifestyle of \nranchers in our State and across the West, in an effort to maintain \nthis multiple use.\n  If anyone would like to go to New Mexico and visit the ranchers \ntoday, he would see there are no rich ranchers. For those who worry \nabout us representing rich ranchers, if they are rich they were rich \nbefore they got on the ranch. They are not getting rich on the ranch. \nAs a matter of fact, there are more ranchers in New Mexico close to \nbankruptcy than any time in our history. After 3 years of drought and \nincessant demands made upon them by the Secretary of Interior and his \nrules and regulations, and excessive demands made upon their \nstewardship every time they turn around, we have them on the brink of \ndisappearing without us having to pass laws that will make them \ndisappear, or even without enforcing Secretary Babbitt's rules, which \nwill surely, within a decade, even without droughts, see to it that \nranching is a disappearing way of life.\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n  In addition, I suggest, just to add to all the fury, cattle prices \nhave come down half--is that correct, I say to my friend?\n  Mr. BURNS. A third.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A third. So, look out where the rancher has 500 head. \nIt is worth a third less this year than last year. With the drought \nsetting in, they are cutting back. So they do not have any great shakes \nfor those who are worried about rich ranchers and those of us in the \nWest who are representing them, representing rich ranchers. We are \ntrying to represent a way of life. In northern New Mexico, hundreds and \nhundreds of Hispanic Americans, in the third and fourth generation, \nhave small ranches with few, maybe 100, 200 head, and some far less, on \ntheir annual permit of head on the range.\n  Frankly, this bill that is before us, contrary to everything that has \nbeen said, does not take away any rights from hunters and fishermen and \nthose women who hunt and fish. We just repeated it over and over in the \nbill, that whatever their rights were, they remain.\n  There are some who want us to resolve all the issues between the \nhunting-fishing population and the ranchers. There is always some kind \nof problem with the public domain, some kind of friction. So some would \nlike it resolved in this bill to the satisfaction of one group or the \nother. I believe we leave it just where it was. It is other regulations \nthat concern us.\n\n  Before we are finished, we will elaborate to the Senators who have \ninterest, and the American people who are interested, the long litany \nof new regulations that Secretary Babbitt would impose on the \nrangeland. Frankly, the Interior Department, under his leadership, is \nplaying very, very cute. None of those things are going to bite until \nperhaps next year or the year after. But, by the time those regulations \nare imposed on the ranchers, in my State and across the West, what I \nhave just described as the condition will be far worse.\n  I cannot believe that those who want habitat for wildlife, those who \nwant hunting and fishing on the public domain, where cattle is also \npermitted to graze--I cannot believe that they truly believe they will \nbe better off if cattle are not on the public domain. For those who \nwere for cattle free--at one time the yell was ``Cattle free by '93.'' \nI do not know what it is now, but it is not too many years off, for \nmany of those who oppose this bill.\n  I wonder what we are going to do to supply water and habitat and all \nthe things that are jointly used by the cattle that graze and the \nwildlife that inhabits the land. Who is going to pay for all that? Is \nthe Federal Government going to go out and develop these water sources \nfor them? Of course not.\n  Nonetheless, there are some who would like this bill today to permit \nthose who have a public interest--just a public interest--permit them \nto get into the details of operating a ranch. We have withstood that. \nWe give them, the environmentalists and others, conservationists--we \ngive them plenty of input in this bill and plenty of opportunity to be \npart of it. But we have resisted permitting those who have just a \npublic interest to get into the day-by-day management, get into the \nday-by-day reissuing of permits. We firmly believe that is not the way \nit ought to be done. It will yield nothing but havoc on the range, \nwhich needs stability these days, as it has never needed it before.\n  So, perhaps by Thursday night we will get a few questions answered \nand finish up some votes. I am very hopeful we will add stability to \nthe West in the public domain, and will at least indicate that, while \nmany of us do not understand, many Senators do not come from our areas, \nwe are willing to say give this lifestyle, the lifestyle of being a \ncowboy, a private cowboy who owns a ranch--permit that lifestyle to \nexist for a few more decades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, many of us in this body have tried to \nresolve the controversies that surround grazing on public lands. We \nhave been working on it for several years. I also believe, as my \ncolleagues who have already spoken believe, that a healthy livestock \nindustry on the public lands is in the best interests of the country. \nFurthermore, I believe that the continued uncertainty that surrounds \nthis industry, and the continued controversy that surrounds it, \nbenefits nobody.\n  However, unlike some of my colleagues who support this bill, S. 1459, \nI contend that the uncertainty and the controversy will not be resolved \nby this bill. I believe it will not be resolved because the bill, as it \nnow reads, in the substitute form, does reduce public input into \ndecisions related to our public lands. It does elevate grazing into a \npreferred status as a use of our public lands. And, third, it does \nunduly limit the ability of the land managers who work for the public \nto carry out their responsibilities.\n  I believe that the resolution of these disagreements and these \ncontroversies can only be achieved when a balance is struck that \nrespects the needs of all public land users, not just the ranchers. For \na number of years, I and many of my colleagues have done what we could \nto ensure that any reform effort that was enacted would be fair to both \nlivestock producers and the American public. My colleague has referred \nto the drought that we have experienced in the West. Certainly we have \nin my part of the country, in New Mexico. There has been a severe \ndrought, and we are still in a very severe drought which adversely \naffects anyone who is trying to make a living in agriculture.\n  He also referred to the low prices of cattle. Again, that is a very \nreal problem for people in the ranching industry in my State. I \ncertainly do not dispute that. I think that is a very real concern and \none which we are taking into account in the position that I will \nadvocate here today.\n  But the other part was references to the efforts of the Secretary of \nthe Interior to run these people out of a way of life, and to put in \nplace extremely onerous provisions that will terminate their ability to \nuse the public lands. There I have to disagree with much of what my \ncolleague said.\n  Last summer, after many months of meetings, I think probably the most \nextensive set of public meetings that I am aware of having had \nconducted, at least in recent years, since I have been in the Senate, \nthe Secretary of Interior and the President did promulgate regulations \nthat sought to achieve a balance between the various uses of our public \nlands. If we are serious about providing stability and certainty to \npublic land livestock producers, we need to adopt a balanced solution \nthat, first of all, addresses the concerns of livestock producers; \nsecond, respects the need of all public land users--the needs that they \nhave; and, third, provides some reasonable authority to the agencies \nthat we have given responsibility to manage the public lands.\n  If we deviate from the balance in either direction, we are merely \ninviting continued strife and uncertainty as the aggrieved group, \nwhichever group it happens to be, pursues legislative or regulatory \nfixes.\n  The Babbitt regulations, which have been referred to by my colleague, \ncreate some legitimate concerns for the permittees in my State.\n  In the substitute which several Senators and I intend to offer later \nin the discussion, we try to fix those specific concerns that have been \npointed out to us and restore the balance that needs to be there in our \ngrazing policies. However, if we pass S. 1459 in its current form, as \nthe substitute was sent to the desk, we go beyond fixing those concerns \nand, in my view, we once again will throw the grazing policy of this \ncountry out of balance. This lack of balance will fester, just like the \npermittees' concerns have been festering, and lead to more instability \nand more lawsuits and more hard feelings.\n  We will likely be addressing this issue again in future years if we \nerr on the side which I fear this bill will cause us to err on. We \ncannot afford to let that happen. We owe it to the grazing permittees, \nto their families and communities that rely on the livestock industry, \nas well as to other public land users and the American public in \ngeneral, to resolve the dispute now in a balanced and sustainable \nmanner that will withstand the test of time.\n  Mr. President, I want at this point to go through some of the \nspecific concerns we have with S. 1459. In order to do that, let me put \nup a couple of charts just to keep track of where I am in the \ndiscussion.\n  A first concern which I have repeated numerous times--and let me say \nby\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nway of introduction, the bill we are now considering is not the bill \nwhich was introduced last summer by my colleague from New Mexico. It is \nan improved bill. I think the designation of the earlier bill, S. 852, \nin my view, was substantially more lopsided and onesided than this bill \nis, but significant problems still exist in the legislation. Let me go \nthrough those.\n  One of those major problems is that grazing is still given preference \nas a use of the public land over other uses in the legislation. First, \nlet me talk about conservation use.\n  It is ambiguous in S. 1459 whether conservation use of a grazing \nallotment is allowed. Conservation use is where the permittee would \nvoluntarily refrain from grazing all or a portion of the allotment in \norder to improve the health of the range. Sponsors of the bill will \nclaim that such uses would be permitted. However, I will submit for the \nRecord a letter that The Nature Conservancy has sent to me concerning \nthis matter, dated March 16, 1996.\n  That letter states, Mr. President, and I will quote a couple \nsentences:\n\n       But our qualification--\n\n  That is qualification to be a permittee.\n\n     has been challenged in a case now before the Interior Board \n     of Land Appeals. Part of the argument was that because we \n     were resting an allotment, we could not be said to be ``in \n     the livestock business'' (as required by the regulations that \n     would be reinstated by S. 1459), despite the fact that at \n     other locations we own, raise and sell domestic livestock and \n     depend on the revenues we get from the cattle business to \n     support our operations.\n       Creating a category of ``conservation use'' of Federal \n     grazing permits would make it clear that The Nature \n     Conservancy could hold a permit and rest it.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter from Russell Shay, who is the senior policy adviser to The \nNature Conservancy.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Nature Conservancy,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for asking us about our \n     use of grazing permits on public lands, and the potential \n     impacts of new grazing legislation on them. We currently hold \n     23 of the more than 26,000 federal grazing permits on Bureau \n     of Land Management (BLM) or Forest Service lands. Those 23 \n     permits are spread across 9 different states. Our review of \n     BLM and Forest Service records has not found any other \n     conservation organizations to be currently listed as owners \n     of federal grazing permits.\n       The Nature Conservancy and cooperating ranching partners \n     actively graze domestic livestock on about half of our \n     allotments. The others are being rested in non-use being \n     annually approved by the local BLM or Forest Service \n     professional land manager. Our permits were each approved by \n     local managers whose judgement was that The Nature \n     Conservancy was qualified to hold them. But our qualification \n     has been challenged in a case now before the Interior Board \n     of Land Appeals. Part of the argument was that because we \n     were resting an allotment, we could not be said to be ``in \n     the livestock business'' (as required by the regulations that \n     would be reinstated by S. 1459), despite the fact that at \n     other locations we own, raise and sell domestic livestock and \n     depend on the revenues we get from the cattle business to \n     support our operations.\n       Creating a category of ``conservation use'' of federal \n     grazing permits would make it clear that The Nature \n     Conservancy could hold a permit and rest it. It would also \n     provide a framework that would allow for local consideration \n     of such uses and their effects through public participation \n     in the land-use planning and allotment management plan \n     approval processes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Russell Shay,\n                                            Senior Policy Advisor.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think it is clear when you analyze the \nbill--and I am sure we will have more discussion on this--it is clear \nthat entities that are not engaged in the livestock business under the \nlanguage of this bill could not hold a permit in their own name, and I \nthink that is something we should correct. We will propose to do that \nin the substitute that we offer.\n  A second concern, which is on this chart--I hope that people can see \nthis; I am sure most cannot--but a second concern that I have with S. \n1459, a second way in which grazing is given a preference is that S. \n1459 will, for the first time, allow permittees to hold title to \npermanent range improvements on forest land.\n  For example, under existing law and regulations, a Forest Service \ngrazing permittee is granted a permit to construct a range improvement \nand the title to that improvement is in the name of the United States. \nThat has always been the law in our national forests.\n  S. 1459 will allow the permittee to hold title in proportion to the \nvalue of the contribution that that permittee has made for the cost of \nconstruction, and that is a major change for those who are permittees \nin the Forest Service.\n  A third way in which grazing is given a preference is that S. 1459 \nstatutorily provides for granting private property rights on BLM land \nas well as on forest land. The old BLM grazing regulations provided \nonly regulatory authority for granting title to permanent range \nimprovements on BLM land. This would take what was in the old \nregulations promulgated under the administration of Secretary Watt and \nwould put that into statute for the first time.\n  A fourth ground for concern is the wording of the objectives in the \nbill. Here my reading of the objectives is that they favor the \nstability of the livestock industry over the needs of wildlife. The \nobjectives are extremely important in this, as pointed out in the \nCongressional Research Service report, which makes the very important \npoint that under section 105(A), management standards and guidelines \nare to be consistent with the objectives and become directly effective \nupon plans by operation of law.\n  Under section 134(A), terms and conditions of a permit must be \nnecessary to achieve the objectives of title I. Therefore the \nobjectives have more significance than would be true if they provided \nonly a general guidance unrelated to particular processes.\n  A fifth concern with regard to grazing being a preferred use of the \nlands, Mr. President, is that S. 1459 provides for cooperative range \nimprovement agreements with permittees and lessees only. Currently, \nabout 17 percent of all BLM range improvements have nonpermittee \ncooperators, such as Quails Unlimited.\n  The old grazing regulations provided that the Secretary could enter \ninto a cooperative range improvement agreement with any person. This \nbill goes further in restricting the Secretary, further than the \nregulations promulgated in the Watt administration or developed in the \nWatt administration, and says that the Secretary is only able to enter \ninto these cooperative agreements with permittees and lessees.\n  Let me move to the second of the three major points I want to make at \nthis time, and that is this bill does reduce the extent of public \ninvolvement.\n  The first way in which it reduces the extent of public involvement is \nthat it denies the right of affected interests, people who are \ndetermined to be affected interests, to protest grazing decisions on \npublic land and national forests. S. 1459 allows an affected interest \nto be notified of proposed decisions and given an opportunity for \ncomment and informal consultation. However, only an applicant, or \npermittee, or lessee may protest a proposed decision. Further, in the \nabsence of a timely filed protest, the proposed decision becomes final.\n\n  Again, referring to the Congressional Research Service analysis, it \nsays:\n\n       A protest, similar to a predecisional appeal that gives the \n     public an opportunity to object to a proposal, gives the \n     agency an opportunity to change or modify its course before \n     commitment of further time or effort.\n\n  These provisions appear to mean--these provisions being S. 1459--\nappear to mean that unless an applicant or permittee protests a \nproposed decision, comments or other input from other sources will not \nbe taken into account because, absent a protest, the proposed decision \ndoes become final. If this is a correct reading, then the opportunity \nfor comment and consultation does not appear to be meaningful.\n  A second way in which public involvement is reduced is, it is \npossible that only ranchers, under our reading of the bill, would \nqualify to file an appeal of a final decision affecting the public \nlands. A person who is adversely affected--and that phrase is a term of \nart, because it is used in the legislation--a person who is adversely \naffected within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 702 is permitted to appeal. \nThis cited code refers back to the relevant statute.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  In this case, the relevant statute would be S. 1459. On that issue, \nthe analysis by the Congressional Research Service says that the \npersons included within this provision are not clear. The cited code \nsection refers back to the relevant statutes, thereby setting up a \ncircularity.\n  Since the CRS report was published, new appeals language has been \nadded that further clouds the situation. It states--I will quote this \nfrom the bill--it says:\n\n       Being an affected interest, as described in section 1043, \n     does not in and of itself confer standing to appeal a final \n     decision upon any individual or organization.\n\n  Mr. President, a third way in which public input, involvement is \nreduced is that S. 1459 exempts on-the-ground management from the \nprovisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. As the \nbill is presently presented, the National Environmental Policy Act, \ncommonly known as NEPA, is going to be the topic of a great deal of our \ndiscussion. NEPA is one of the main tools used by land managers to \nanalyze the health of the land and to analyze the potential affect on \nthe land.\n  S. 1459 exempts on-the-ground management from NEPA. In discussing the \nelimination of NEPA in site-specific situations, this Congressional \nResearch Service report states:\n\n       An activity could readily comport with a land use plan and \n     yet have many harmful aspects if carried out in a particular \n     area. Therefore, the elimination of site-specific analysis is \n     a significant change in current law and procedures, and could \n     result in significant effects on the conditions of the land.\n\n  In place of NEPA, S. 1459 proposes a review of resource conditions. \nEssentially, the bill states that upon the issuance, renewal or \ntransfer of a grazing permit or lease, at least once every 6 years the \nSecretary shall review all available monitoring data from the affected \nallotment. The central problem with this provision is that monitoring \ndata usually consists of very specific measures of vegetative \nattributes. That monitoring data, in many cases, is not available.\n  A fourth reason that I would cite why public involvement is reduced \nunder this bill is, aside from the grazing advisory councils, the \npublic is not given a say in range improvements. The old grazing \nregulations allow affected interests a say in the development of range \nimprovements. As I read the provisions of this bill, it does not.\n  Let me move to the third major concern that I have, Mr. President. \nThat is that S. 1459, as drafted, and as being considered here, unduly \nties the hands of lands managers. It does so in several respects. First \nof all, the application of terms and conditions needed to protect the \nland requires the development of a formal allotment management plan \nunder this bill.\n  Currently, less than 25 percent of BLM land and national forest \nallotments have allotment management plans prepared for them. The old \ngrazing regulations' terms and conditions were attached as needed to \nprotect resources and no allotment management plan was required.\n  A second reason that I believe the current bill, Senate bill 1459, \nties the hands of land managers is that the number of animal unit \nmonths would be established in land use plans in this bill. The land \nuse plan often covers millions of acres, contains very general \nlanguage, and S. 1459 would require costly, time-consuming land use \nplans and amendments to establish and make changes in grazing use for \neach allotment. In the old regulations, specific grazing use was \ndetermined through site-specific analysis, not through amendments to \nthe entire land use plan.\n  A third reason that the hands of land managers will be tied by this \nlegislation is that in conducting monitoring activity, S. 1459 requires \nthe manager to give prior notice, to the extent practicable, of not \nless than 48 hours. This exception to the notice creates a burden of \nproof that has never existed before.\n  I also point out this creates a burden of proof when a land manager \nis dealing with a grazing permittee which does not exist when dealing \nwith any other permittee on our public lands. Someone involved in the \noil and gas industry certainly is not entitled to any 48-hour notice \nprior to monitoring activity taking place. It is inconsistent with the \nconcept of these being public lands, Mr. President, to say that the \nmanager of those public lands has to give notice 48 hours in advance \nbefore being able to view the lands and determine the condition. In the \nold grazing regulations no such advanced notice was required.\n  A fourth way in which the hands of land managers are tied, in my \nview, in this bill is that S. 1459 would allow a sublease in cases \nwhere permittees neither own nor control the livestock. In the old \nregulations, ownership or control of the livestock was required. As I \nunderstand it, that is an appropriate requirement because clearly the \nBLM or the Forest Service cannot be expected to go around trying to \nfind who is accountable for damage to the public lands. They have a \nright to assume that the person that has the permit or the lease has \ncontrol of the livestock or ownership of that livestock and can be held \naccountable for what happens on the land.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude this set of initial comments here \nby saying that I do believe that we need to keep working to get a \nbalance. We will offer later in the debate a substitute proposal which \nwe believe does a better job of striking a middle ground and addresses \nthe specific concerns that have been raised in the current Department \nof Interior regulations but does not repeal them entirely, as this \nlegislation would. We believe that it gets us much closer to something \nthat looks out for the interests of all those who have a valid interest \nin the use of the public lands.\n  So I will stop with that, Mr. President. I know there are many others \non the floor who wish to speak. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici bill. I \nwould like to give a little background on it. I think later in the \ndebate it will be necessary for us to talk a little bit about the \ncomments of the Senator from New Mexico in that I think they are \nexactly where we are in terms of wanting more bureaucracy, wanting the \nbureaucracy to have more and more input. That is precisely what we want \nto get away from.\n  Let me just say one thing in terms of this idea that keeps rising up \nthat grazing is the preferred use. Let me read from page 6 here, on \nline 14.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall limit or preclude the use or \n     the access of Federal lands for hunting, fishing, \n     recreational, watershed management, or other appropriate \n     multiple-use activities in accordance with applicable Federal \n     and State law in the principal or multiple use.\n\n  Not only is it there in this instance, it is there in a number of \ninstances and has been the focus of our interest over the last several \nmonths. I really do not think there is any substance to that kind of an \nargument, although we continue to hear it.\n\n  Mr. President, let me be a little broader. I think one of the things \nabout this whole debate is that there is a unique aspect to western \npublic lands. Most Members of this body are not as familiar with them. \nI think you have to start with the uniqueness of the West. You have to \nstart with the uniqueness of the idea that Western States run \nanywhere--in my State from 50 percent Federal ownership, and in Nevada, \nI think, as high as 80 to 85 percent Federal ownership. I think you \nhave to talk about that a little bit. I brought a map to give you some \nidea of the kind of complexity involved in the management of public \nlands.\n  First of all, there are a number of kinds of public lands. The idea \nthat public land is public land is not the case. Many people in New \nJersey would say, ``Well, public land must mean Yellowstone Park or \nTeton Park.'' It does not. There is a substantial difference. We have \nthe parks which were reserved and withdrawn for a special purpose by \nthe Congress. We have the forest which was reserved by action of the \nCongress. You have Indian reservations. You have other kinds of lands \nthat were withdrawn--wilderness in the forest. These things were all \nset aside for a specific purpose because of the uniqueness of that \nland.\n  The remainder is basically what we are talking about here. We are \ntalking about those lands that were residual lands, lands that were \nleft in the State\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nafter the homesteaders came and took up the base lands, took up the \nlands, frankly, where the water is, where the winter feed is, took up \nthe most valuable lands, and the others were left there. That is \nbasically what we are talking about.\n  Let me tell you from a standpoint of a westerner, if we do not have a \nmultiple-use policy for the lands, we have very little economic future \nto look forward to. By ``multiple use,'' we are talking about hunting \nand fishing, talking about outfitting and mining, talking about oil, \ntalking about grazing. These things have for a very long time been \ncompatible with one another.\n  Some of this map is hard to see. The colored part belongs to the \nFederal Government. The green color is the Forest Service, the purple \nis the park, and all of this yellow are BLM lands. We can see how \ninterspersed they are. This is particularly unique. These are called \nthe checkerboard lands. When the West was developed and the railroads \nwere encouraged to be out West, they were granted 20 miles on either \nside of the railroad, and every other section belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. In between are private sections. For the most part, there \nare no fences there. You do not manage these separately. These are very \nunproductive lands. This land probably takes 100 acres for one cow unit \nto last for a year. This is not the kind of land that people think \nabout when they think about a pasture in Indiana.\n  When we were in the House, we went through this thing about the fees. \nThe chairman of the committee was from Indiana. He had this pasture \nwhere the grass grew this big, and he could not figure out why the fee \nshould not be the same for this land as it is for his land. It is quite \ndifferent.\n  What we have in terms of landownership patterns you have to take into \naccount. Here is a blowup of the checkerboard land. Every other section \nhere belongs to the Federal Government; the others are private. These \nare interspersed. The blue ones happen to be State lands. You can see, \nin order to manage this stuff, you have to have some of these local \nfolks do it.\n\n  Now, talking very briefly about the condition of the range, this is \nthe figure put together by the Bureau of Land Management in Wyoming. It \ntalks about the percentage of acreage in a condition class. This green \nis called excellent and good; the red dotted line is poor. This starts \nin 1974 and goes up to 1993. This is the good and excellent here. This \nis the condition of the range. This is the poor down here. It has \nimproved substantially.\n  Let me give you another reason why that is the case. This is the big \ngame population on public lands in Wyoming. We talk about the multiple \nuses being able to work together. Here is antelope. In 1962, we had \n97,000 of those rascals running around; now we have 226,721. I got one \nlast year. Now, deer, 87,000; go up to 250,000. Elk, 12,000 in 1962; \nnow 35,000. You can see the percentage increase over a 28-year period.\n  My point is that the range is in good shape. The range is carefully \nhusbanded by these ranchers. Why? Not just because they are entirely \ngratuitous, but because their future depends on year after year usage \nof this resource.\n  I must tell you, having grown up there, that this wildlife would not \ndo well if there was not somebody out there using this land for \nsomething else and preparing water, often digging out a spring and \ndamming it up so there is water available, not only for cattle or \nsheep, but also for wildlife as well.\n  It is a very unique thing, Mr. President. I think we need to start \nwith understanding that. Western cattlemen, western livestock people, \nof course, a very important part of our society, not only because of \nthese families that live and work there but because these are the \nsustaining families for the small towns that are there. This is the \neconomy for much of the West. This is a historic time now of low prices \nfor cattle, as everybody knows. The considerable loss to predators has \nalso been a problem and makes it much more difficult to make a living.\n  Now we face, I think, excessive regulations put on by the Bureau of \nLand Management. The Senator from New Mexico mentioned the number of \ntrips of the Secretary out there. He is right. I was involved in very \nmany of those. For 2 years we had meetings, meetings, and meetings. \nWhen the regulations were put out, they were put out almost precisely \nas they were initially. You can have meetings until you are green in \nthe face; that does not mean there will be any difference. That is a \nfact.\n  That is where we are. We are seeking to make some changes here from \nthis movement by the Secretary for more and more bureaucracy in \nWashington, to some movement where there is more impact of the people, \nmore decisionmaking by the people who live there. I do not think there \nis any question that rangeland reform will drive families off the \nrange, create some economic problems in our areas. We worry about that, \nnaturally. Maybe the broader, more generic concern, however, is the \nmaximum, ultimate best use of multiple resources. Grass is a renewable \nresource, one that you manage.\n  This Public Rangelands Management Act is a great step forward. It is \nsomething we have worked on for over a year. We have taken it to our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle; we have talked about it; they \nhave come back; they have agreed to some things; we have put in much \nmore than we have changed for ourselves. However, there are some \nchanges in which we do not basically agree. One of them is the degree \nof bureaucratic involvement in this bill.\n\n  We have established and very carefully established a relationship and \na balance between grazing and hunting and those activities. Personally, \nI come from a place where hunting and fishing is a very major function \nbetween Cody, WY, and Yellowstone Park. There is grazing, but hunting \nand fishing is equally important from the economic standpoint. I \nunderstand that. We balance that. That is what this bill does.\n  I think for too long over the last several years the grazing question \nhas zeroed in on the fee. The Secretary does not even have a change in \nthe fee. We have a fee. We have a simplified fee based on the value of \nthe product, based on the average value of the livestock, and it raises \nthe fee even in spite of the economic condition that livestock people \nare in. This is not a question, this time, about fee. It is a fee that \nis based on the product.\n  Too often there are comparisons made between this land and this land, \nthese services and these services. I am sure we will hear, ``Well, the \nState charges more, gets paid more, private gets paid more.'' Yes; they \ndo. They also provide a great many more services. You can have \nexclusive use of State land, but you cannot do that with public land.\n  There are differences. Someone said it is a little like the \ndifference between a furnished apartment and an unfurnished apartment. \nThat is exactly right.\n  Mr. President, I think we have a great opportunity to move forward to \ndo something that has needed to be resolved for a very long time, and I \nthink this moves toward that resolution. And I think the bill, as it \nstands, is one that has been considered and approved by many people. It \nis time, certainly, for us to come to closure on it. I have been \ndisappointed that each time we have tried to do something, we get a lot \nof disinformation from BLM. I do not think that is an appropriate role. \nWe have been involved in that over a good period of time.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure we will be back to talk some more about \nthe specifics of the issue that have been brought up. I do not believe \nthat this limits public input. I do not think that is true at all. On \nthe contrary, we are seeking to deal with issues like NEPA and to try \nand say the NEPA law requires that activity in relation to a major \nFederal action.\n  Last year, we had a proposal in the Forest Service that every renewed \ngrazing permit have a NEPA process. Ridiculous. If you ever heard of \nexcessive bureaucracy, that is it. Indeed, the NEPA process takes place \non the land use plan which takes up a number of allotments. That is the \nreasonable thing to do. I do not think there is anybody who would argue \nyou should have a NEPA process for every renewable grazing lease. That \nwas already seen to be not workable.\n  Mr. President, I am glad we are talking about it here. As I said, \nthis is kind of an opening statement for me. I want to come back, as we \ngo forward, to talk\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nabout some of the specific things that were talked about here.\n  Let me say, finally, that I have no doubt that this is a question \nabout the livelihood of families in the West. This is a question of \nsmall ranchers who depend on this public land to go with their deeded \nland, to be able to sublease. They were able to do that in the past, \nand they can do it now only if the BLM agrees to that. That is what it \nsays in the bill. That is the way it ought to be.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can move through these issues, and \nI hope that we can end up with a reasonable way to provide multiple use \nin the West, protect the environment, which all of us who live there \nwant to do, and, at the same time, be able to use those resources so \nthat those families in the West can make a living as they do over the \nrest of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be brief today. We are here on the \nfloor of the Senate talking about a grazing bill. I have spent a \nsubstantial amount of time on this issue this year. I cannot tell you \nthe number of meetings I have had in North Dakota with ranchers, \nenvironmentalists, hunters, and others, talking about the various \nproposals that exist in the grazing legislation that has been offered \nby Senator Domenici, the substitute that was previously offered by \nSenator Bingaman and myself in the Energy Committee, and other \niterations of each.\n\n  This is another one of those cases where in debate on the floor of \nthe Senate, it seems to me, there is a little bit of truth on both \nsides. Each side takes their side of this issue and tends to take it \nout here and make a caricature out of it. The fact is that we have a \ncircumstance with respect to publicly owned lands in many of our States \nthat are used for a lot of purposes, where ranchers in my State--not \nbig ranchers, but family ranchers--are trying to make a living grazing \ntheir cattle on public lands, as has been provided for many years with \nrespect to the multiple use of these lands. They work hard and they do \nnot ask for much from anybody.\n  Most of these folks are not big. They are family-size ranches. They \nare subject to the whims of the weather and subject to the ups and \ndowns of cattle prices, and sometimes they have an awful time.\n  I notice that the Senator from Connecticut has something he wants to \ndo. I will be happy to yield for a moment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have been informed that Senator Dodd \nwill introduce a distinguished guest. He will then ask that we be in \nrecess for a period of time.\n  I yield to Senator Dodd for that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2389-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE PRESIDENT OF HAITI\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I was saying, this piece of legislation \nis a piece of legislation that deals with grazing issues that are \nimportant issues to people who ranch and who graze cattle on public \nlands. I indicated previously that there is some truth on every side \nhere on this issue, and that each side seems to stretch some here and \nthere to make their point.\n  I think there is a legitimate question with respect to some of the \nmanagement practices, especially on the grasslands in North Dakota. I \nthink there is a legitimate question about the management practices \nthat create circumstances where a rancher who is grazing on public \nlands wants to move a water tank and months and months and months pass, \nand they do not get an answer. Some of these little issues that they \nought to get resolved ought to be resolved. They ought not to wait \nforever for some answer. So ranchers get upset on that kind of \nmanagement of public lands, and they have a right to be upset about \nthat. We ought to resolve some of those problems and address some of \nthose problems.\n  Senator Domenici has offered a piece of legislation that has gone \nthrough a couple of different drafts. Senator Bingaman and I offered a \nsubstitute in the Senate Energy Committee on two occasions I believe; \nmaybe one. But we offered a substitute. We said that there are some \nthings that we think have merit in Senator Domenici's approach, and \nthere are some things that we think need to be improved upon and \nchanged.\n  So we wrote a substitute that we think addresses the real problems \nthat exist without causing some other problems. We are here wanting to \nsolve problems--not create problems.\n  I say this to those who argue, as some have in the recent editorials \nin the last day or two in the largest newspaper in our State, that this \nis a ``land grab'' by ranchers; that they want to seize control of \npublic lands, period, end of story. That is not an accurate assessment \nof what is going on.\n  I am prepared to support some legislation to address these issues, as \nI think the Senator New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, does and as others do \non the floor who have spoken. We may want to address it in a slightly \ndifferent way. But, nonetheless, all of us come here saying there are \nsome legitimate problems that ranchers have, and we ought to address \nsome of those problems.\n  Those who make the charge--as was made a couple of days ago in an \neditorial in our largest newspaper that this is a ``land grab''--that \nit simply would turn the keys to the Federal lands over to the ranchers \nwith no input from anybody else is wrong. I will not support that. That \nis not what our substitute says. Frankly, that is not what the Domenici \nbill says. We come at this sometimes from different ways, and we, \nbecause we offer a substitute, think the bill moves too far in some \nareas. But all of us believe these are multiple-use lands--public lands \navailable for multiple use--and that they ought to remain that way.\n  I really believe that hunters have a right to these lands. Hikers \nhave a right to these lands. Environmentalists own these lands as well. \nThese are multiple-use lands, and will remain multiple-use lands. And I \nwould not support anything--not a substitute, anything--if someone \nbrought a proposition to the floor that says this is not your land, and \nthat this land belongs to ranchers. It is not my view. I will not \nsupport anything that supports that view. That is not what we are \nsaying.\n  The substitute offered in the Energy Committee by Senator Bingaman \nand I says there are some problems and let us address those problems. \nLet us not address those problems by creating more problems for \nranchers. Let us not address them restricting any access for anybody \nelse. Let us simply address them the way they ought to be addressed.\n  I hope, as we talk through this set of issues in the next day or so--\nand hopefully we will have a vote tomorrow on this, and we will have a \nvote I think on a substitute that Senator Bingaman and I will offer \nalong with some others--I understand that there will be a vote on an \namendment by Senator Bumpers on grazing fees. There may or may not be \nother Senators who come to offer amendments on the issue. But I hope \nwhen we get to the final stages of this process that most of us will \nunderstand that we are aiming for the same thing--we want to solve some \nproblems. We do not want to create others.\n  I would say to those in my State, North Dakotans, who are interested \nin this issue that these are multiple-use lands and will remain \nmultiple-use\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\nlands. I feel very strongly that hunters and others have an interest in \nthese lands, and I will not do anything to restrict that interest. By \nthe same token, I come to the Senate wanting to solve some problems \nthat ranchers have. They graze cattle and have some problems with \nrespect to the management structure. And I am interested in solving \nthose problems.\n  As we debate and discuss this, let us really deal with the facts on \neach side, and let us--each of us--represent what we want the answers \nto be to these problems. At the end of the day we count votes in the \nSenate. We do not weigh them. So whoever has the votes to advance their \nproposal, that is what public policy will be. And I hope, at the end of \nthis, public policy will be one that says these are lands that belong \nto our country--all of the people of our country--and should be \navailable for all of the people in our country to use. But some of the \nsalt-of-the-Earth people in our country also are people who ranch, who \nwork hard, who try to beat the odds, the weather, the prices, and they \nhave some management problems, and we ought to address some of them. \nThat is my interest in this legislation.\n  I will return to the floor with my colleague, Senator Bingaman, \noffering a substitute, and we will have a discussion about that. I will \nalso, when I return to the floor, join in some discussion I am sure \nwith Senator Domenici, Senator Craig, Senator Burns, and others. While \nwe might disagree on some parts of this bill we agree on others.\n  I commend all of those who are involved in this discussion because I \nthink that this is an interesting discussion about the use of public \nlands, and I hope that we will shed more light rather than cause more \nfog in the next day or so.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and I will return to the \nfloor with Senator Bingaman and offer a substitute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Burns has been \nwaiting a long time and wants to speak on our side. I am pleased that \nSenator Bumpers is here. If all goes well, as soon as he is finished, \nthe Senator may get the floor and offer his amendment, debate it, and \ntry to vote this evening.\n  Is that all right?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, it is immaterial to me when we vote. We \ncan vote this evening or possibly tomorrow. I am not prepared to enter \ninto a time agreement at this moment. If the Senator from Montana would \nlike to proceed, my chief cosponsor, Senator Jeffords, will be here in \nabout 2 or 3 minutes. If the Senator wants to proceed, that is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He will proceed now, and then Senator Bumpers will \nfollow.\n  Let me just talk to Senator Bumpers for a minute on the timing. I \nunderstand his amendment is an amendment to increase grazing fees. That \nis the one which he has given us. He may have others. I just wanted to \ntell him what I told the Senate when I did not think he could be here. \nThe leader wants us to finish tomorrow because he has a commitment to \nSenators that there will be no votes on Friday. We will be in tonight, \nif need be rather late, and then come back on this, I think, at noon \ntomorrow.\n  So we will give the Senator all of the time in the world because he \nis entitled to it. But I hope on his amendment that sometime later he \nmight give us an idea when he might vote this evening so we could get \none vote on this bill accomplished this evening.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, let me say to Senator Dorgan that I \nthank him for the way he has handled himself here on the floor this \nafternoon. I think his comments were very well taken. I think there is \na lot of excess language on both sides of this. I mean ranchers \nfrequently say, if this happens, they are out of business; they are \ngone. Environmentalists say, ``If you do not do this, the public land \nis all going to be owned and confiscated by ranchers, and we will lose \nall of our rights.'' Frequently neither of those views are accurate.\n  We are going to try our best to have a multiple-use bill when we \nleave the Senate, get one from the House, and send it to the President. \nWe have no intention of taking away any rights--we do, however, want to \nprotect grazing, and try to put it in a secured position. But we are \nnot trying to take away any of the other rights. We are doing our very \nbest to try to see that they are there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. DORGAN. With respect to the schedule, of course, that is up to \nthe leaders. I would suggest I do not think there is a circumstance \nwhere you are going to see a filibuster that succeeds on this \nlegislation. I think there is a general understanding that this \nlegislation will be resolved by the end of tomorrow, and I hope that if \nwe get to a circumstance where someone wants to offer an amendment, and \nit is going to take us until 8 or 9 tonight, and we are not going to \ncall people back for tonight, we could roll that vote first thing in \nthe morning.\n  So I would urge the leaders and the managers of the bill to consider \nthat because I do not think this is a case where if we do not vote by 9 \no'clock tonight, we are not going to have the bill out of here \ntomorrow. I do not know of anyone who is going to stall the bill \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just make sure that the Senate understands that \nI do not intend, if we have some kind of understanding about how many \namendments and we will finish tomorrow, to keep the Senate in until 9, \nif we have consent to debate it tonight and vote tomorrow. I thought we \nwould get through the first amendment sooner than that, by 6 or 7. If \nnot, I will talk to the leader about the Senator's idea.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friends from New Mexico for the \nleadership they have shown on this issue.\n  It is a wonderful day to start the debate on this particular issue, \nthe first day of spring. Even though the weatherman has not chosen to \ncooperate properly in greeting this day for the most part across the \ncountry, a little bit colder than usual, the Earth is starting to shed \nits winter chill and the frost is giving way to the warmth that lives \nwithin this great Earth. It is also the time of renewal, when those \nseeds that have laid in the Earth and those grasses that were dormant, \nare starting to show some signs of growth. It starts to give the Earth \na different hue.\n  It is also a pretty exciting time in livestock agriculture, too, a \ntime for newborn calves and lambs, a special time of the year for those \nwho are attached to the land in a very, very special way.\n  It is a season that also gives us renewal. This transformation that \nwe have, this promise of renewal every spring, every year, this \nrenewable resource that renews itself, happens right before our eyes \nand it assures us that the future is now and will ever be.\n  I realize it is hard to see the significance of the season by those \nwho have never really experienced that special attachment to the land.\n  In saying that, it is time for the Senate and this Congress to bring \nsome common sense, some predictability, and stability to the folks who \nreally deserve it, the people who are charged with the business of \ncaretaker of our lands and our resources that come from those lands. \nThey are good caretakers because it behooves them to be good \ncaretakers. I just do not know of any good or successful rancher who \nloves and cares for his livestock and his land, who lives for the day \nthat he will finally turn over the reins and the ownership of that \nranch to the next generation, whether it be a son or son-in-law or \ndaughter or daughter-in-law, who does not live for that. They teach \ntheir next generations how important this caretaking is. If we in this \ncountry are to hand to our children and to our grandchildren a better \nranch and therefore a better world, where they can work, where they can \nsustain life, where they can recreate in an environment of clean air \nand clean water, then we must dedicate ourselves to the idea that \nWashington must, in a different way, make regulations and work with the \nlocal people to make sure it happens.\n\n  After hour after hour of discussion both here in Washington and on \nthe ground on this particular subject, it is time now to move forward \nwith a rangeland bill that we can be proud of and that we know will \nwork and has the support of everybody involved.\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n  If one could have written a rangeland bill that has all the \nprinciples of multiple use, maybe this is not quite perfection. If we \nwere to write one that reflects the dedication to pursue sensible \nenvironmental policy, that preserved the gains that we have made in the \nlast 50 years on our rangeland, then I would say this one probably is \nnot perfection either, for, you see, those folks who are charged with \nthe caring of this land, they became concerned about our range \nconditions a long time ago. They just did not start in 1980 or 1986 or \n1984 or 1990, and for sure not 1996.\n  Range management was put together after World War II and after the \nGreat Depression and great droughts of the dirty thirties.\n  In this bill, as presented by Senator Domenici of New Mexico, we have \ntaken a giant step to the resolution of a very, very contentious and \nemotionally charged issue, and at times it has defied common sense and \ngood judgment because there are groups that probably have had to raise \nsome money and this is probably a pretty good issue on which to do it.\n  As we look at the future of these lands, we must be careful as to \nwhat the people who are actually the caretakers of these lands provide \nfor the rest of America to enjoy, for it is in the best interests of \nthese people to care for these lands. Without the continual \nregeneration of the grass and the land they care for, they have nothing \nto graze. They are out in the cold. They are out of business.\n  We have heard that there are those who are concerned about wildlife. \nPlease read all the journals of Lewis and Clark. Please read of the \npeople who entered these lands long before there was a rancher there. \nRead in the journals how there was no wildlife at all, that they ate \ntheir horses in the dead of winter, and the only wildlife--and it was \nsparse--was along the rivers, the Missouri and the Yellowstone and the \nrest of them. That was in the north country. Those lands were not \nclaimed during the homestead days. It was for one reason: There was no \nwater. Very harsh land. But with people who cared and people with new \nand innovative ways to bring water into grasslands, there came the \nwildlife. I can give you all kinds of figures on the increase in \nantelope, deer, whitetail deer, muleys, elk, whatever you want to \ncount. There are more of them now than at any time since the Great \nDepression.\n\n  I am not going to do anything that is going to harm the habitat of \nwildlife or harm my way of life. I like to hunt. I am chairman of the \nSportsmen's Caucus in this body. I am not going to do anything to harm \nthat. I would ask these people, where are some of our supporters \nwhenever hunters' rights come up? Where are they then? Are we playing \nwith a double-bitted ax here?\n  Section 102, paragraph (c) says:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall limit or preclude the use of \n     and access to Federal land for hunting, fishing, \n     recreational, watershed management or other appropriate \n     multiple-use activities in accordance with applicable Federal \n     and State laws and the principles of multiple use.\n\n  How much clearer must it be? It is even written in plain, everyday \nEnglish.\n  So, as we talk about this issue, we will all have a lot more to say \nabout it. I agree with my friend from North Dakota, we have run into \nsome problems. We have not been able to move a water tank when we \nwanted to. The decisions from BLM did not come fast enough, or \ndecisions from the U.S. Forest Service did not come fast enough. But do \nwe create two or three layers more of bureaucracy to make that \ndecision? The best decisions are made at the local level. Do we have to \ncall Washington to change a gate? I would say no, not and be good \ncaretakers of the land, because if they delay the decision of moving \nthe water tank, maybe they will delay the decision about moving some \nstock that should be moved. Maybe there is some real environmental \ndamage that could be done because of the inability to make a decision \n2,100 miles away from where the grazing activity is taking place.\n  The challenge that awaits this and every Congress from here on out \nwill be the effect of how we manage public lands or the policy we set \nfor those resources found on public lands. This bill seeks to provide \nan effective, reasonable management of our natural resources. Effective \nmanagement means it will allow those close to the land, who have not \nonly economic but also social involvement with a community, allow them \nto manage those resources, not as they see fit but as nature sees fit.\n  The terms of this bill, to make grazing an acceptable practice in the \nmanagement of our Federal public lands, is that asking too much? Do we \njust let the grass grow up every year? Some years you are going to have \ndrought, and it is not going to grow up. But let us say we got a lot of \ngrowth last year, this year there is a lot of dead grass around, and it \nburns. It will burn. In its path you put at jeopardy life, property, \neven residences. I do not know how many people on this floor have ever \nfaced one of those fires. They are not a fun thing. They are pretty \nscary. But the people who are caretakers of this land face that every \nday.\n  Do you want to talk about prices of cattle? I can talk about that. I \nhave a hard time relating $58 and $62 steers and heifers ready to be \nbrought to market, and little T-bone steaks at Giant at $4.50 to $6 a \npound. There is not too much relationship here. Packers say they are \nnot making any money. You know how packers are.\n  Cattlemen will be hurt, but we will not feel it here in this town \nbecause, in this town, April 15, the shrimp boat comes home and we will \nget our check. They will get theirs this fall. But it will be 35 \npercent less than it was last year, and we think we are doing them a \nfavor. Those who pay the bills in that community, who provide the \nservices to local government--schools, roads, public safety--all of \nthis comes out of that check when he sells the product this fall.\n\n  So, as we talk about this, and we will bring up more points as we go \nalong, I just want to remind folks what we are dealing with here and \nhow delicate the balance is between good management on range and bad \nmanagement.\n  In 1979, I started a little activity in Montana called Montana Range \nDays. It started off with about 200, 250 people who would attend every \nyear. We had super starters, 8-year-old, 9-year-old kids, identify \nplants, weeds, grasses; identify carrying capacity on range, capacity \nconservation, watershed--3 days sleeping on the ground out on the \nrange. I kind of helped that get started. It is bigger now than it was \nin 1979, under the leadership of Taylor Brown, who took over the \nNorthern Ag Network when I left that organization. So we are pretty \nfamiliar with rangeland and what they teach in the colleges, and how \nthey teach management and things that can happen on a range.\n  By the way, a range is not used for just about any other purpose. The \nonly way we got to harvest that resource out there is through animal \nagriculture.\n  So, we will talk about the merits of amendments and the merits of \nthis bill. But I ask my colleagues to think and look, and really look \nat it objectively, without any outside influence, to see exactly who \ncontributes what to a neighborhood, to a community, to a county, and to \na State, and look at the practices and look how far we have come in the \ndevelopment of better range for everybody. There is a lot more to be \nhunted, there are a lot more fish in the rivers, because there has been \ngood stewardship on our range, because it is profitable for a rancher \nto do so.\n  The future of our public lands rests in our hands. We had an \nopportunity to make the future meaningful for all people, and I hope my \nfellow Members will work with us and vote with us to provide a \nsustainable and stable future for the land, for the livestock producer, \nand the people who enjoy those public lands.\n  Let us look at the real merits of what we are doing here and the \neffect it has on people. I am just talking about people. I have heard \nit from the other side, ``We are the compassionate folks. We care.'' We \nwill find out how much they care and the compassion they have for \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is kind of bringing back memories \nto me here today. I remember fondly my first year in the U.S. Senate. \nAfter 14 years as a Member of the House of Representatives, I came to \nthe Senate in 1991, excited to represent my State. Respecting the \ncustoms of this honorable institution, I worked to learn the rules and \nprocedures of the Senate. It was not until September of my first year \nthat I actually made a speech longer than 5 minutes on the Senate \nfloor.\n  During this first long speech--it was long, as many may remember, or \nmaybe somebody remembers--I discussed the issue we are here debating \ntoday, that is grazing fees. At the time, in September 1991, I authored \na grazing fee amendment that would have increased the fee from $1.97 \nper AUM, or animal unit month, to $5.13 per AUM, in 5 years. We did \nthis in response to a similar amendment which passed the House \noverwhelmingly during that summer, which would have raised the fee to \n$8.70 per AUM.\n  The amendment I offered in 1991 failed, and the House proposal was \nremoved in conference. The primary argument against this first grazing \namendment was that such a fee would have bankrupt many small ranchers. \nWe revisited the grazing fee issue 1 year later, in August 1992. Again, \nwe offered a proposal which would have required those ranchers grazing \non Federal land to pay their fair share of its use.\n  This time, however, we exempted the small farmers, about which so \nmuch concern was expressed, those having fewer than 500 head. \nTherefore, the increase would only have affected the largest of the \nranchers. This amendment also failed, but by a smaller margin.\n  The opponents of the second grazing fee amendment argued that a \ngrazing fee increase should not be included on an appropriations \nmeasure, but considered only during debate on grazing reform \nlegislation.\n  Today is the day when that opportunity has arisen again. I want to \ntake this time to do what I have been told, and that is to bring it up \non an appropriate piece of legislation and leave the small farmers \nalone. That is what my amendment does.\n  I believe today it is time to finally change this longstanding \ninequity; an inequity because when you compare this to what private \npeople have to pay or pay on State grazing lands, this is a real \ngiveaway. I do not mind it for small farmers, but I do mind that the \nlarge corporate owners own 9 percent of the permits, but have 60 \npercent of the AUM.\n  Senator Bumpers' amendment requires that all ranchers operating on \nFederal land pay a fee equal to the State grazing fee. His amendment \nsays they ought to pay at least what they have to pay to the State, \nforget about private lands, but at least they ought to pay what is paid \nfor using State land.\n  The second-degree amendment I just offered exempts all small ranchers \nand allows them to continue to pay the lower Federal fee that is \npresently at dispute here.\n  Mr. President, my second-degree amendment will protect small family \nranchers who currently rely on Federal lands to support their business. \nA few years ago, I had the opportunity to tour several western ranches \nand visit with small family ranchers. I empathize with them and \nrecognize that out in the West, so much land is owned by the Federal \nGovernment and if you do not have an opportunity to utilize that land, \nyou have no opportunity. During this visit, I gained great appreciation \nand respect for the lifestyle of these small farmers. I made many \nfriends in Wyoming. These ranchers embody not only a piece of our \nNation's history, but also a piece of our Nation's future.\n  I realize that these farmers are facing a daily struggle to keep \ntheir ranches operating, a fact I have taken into consideration in \ndrafting this amendment. Keeping with the theme of Senator Domenici's \nbill, my amendment protects these farmers. In fact, my amendment places \na lower fee on these farmers than the fee contained in the pending \nbill.\n  So if you want to look out for the small farmers, this is the \nopportunity to do it, better than even the underlying Domenici bill.\n\n  On my amendment, the fee for small ranchers will be $1.50 per AUM, \nanimal\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nunit month, in 1997. This is 20 percent less than the fee in the \nunderlying bill--20 percent less.\n  Instead, my amendment addresses the large ranchers who for years have \nbeen making millions off the public lands and costing taxpayers up to \n$200 million annually. Not only are these ranchers paying a grazing fee \nthat is 60 percent less than what it was 10 years ago, but they are \nalso the beneficiary of Federal programs for range improvements, \npredator control, and emergency feed programs.\n  Mr. President, it is time to take a closer look at these large \nranchers and start charging them an honest and equitable price for the \nland from which they are profiting. An interesting phenomenon has \noccurred in the Federal grazing program. Although the large ranchers \nhold only 9 percent of the Bureau of Land Management grazing permits, \nthey comprise over 60 percent of the active use of animal unit months \non public lands. Nine percent of the permit holders are big \ncorporations owning 60 percent of the AUM's.\n  Who are these ranchers? Let me give you some examples. One is Willard \nGarvey of Willard Garvey Industries, which recorded $80 million in \nsales in 1991. Wow, boy, do they need help from the Federal Government.\n  One is J.R. Simplot, who has an estimated fortune of $500 million. \nGreat one to give subsidies to. He was on the cover of Fortune magazine \nas one of the great entrepreneurs of our society, and we give him that \nkind of a break.\n  Another is the Rock Springs Grazing Association that has over $1.6 \nmillion in assets. I have a list of large ranchers, including Texaco, \nGetty Oil, Hilton--wow, boy, do they need help. I ask you, why is it \nthat these large companies are receiving Federal subsidies when, in \nmany cases, small family ranches operating on private lands at many \ntimes the cost receive nothing?\n  My amendment is a first step in remedying this obvious disparity. My \namendment will raise the grazing fee for large ranchers who have \npermits holding more than 2,000 animal unit months. It will raise it to \na level equal to the grazing fee charged by the State. This is all we \nare doing. This is for the big guys, the large ones, the huge guys who \ndo not need help. We say, at least you ought to pay what other farmers \nare paying to the State. Not only will this bring the Federal fee to \nfair market value--that is what is charged by private owners--but will \nalso give the States more control over grazing in their own State. By \ncreating a two-tier program, my amendment protects the lifestyle of the \nsmall ranchers in the West who are more than worthy of Federal \nassistance. By creating a two-tier program, we will help do what should \nbe done, and that is to get equity over the expenditure of Federal \nfunds.\n\n  The amendment will retain a low grazing fee for over 90 percent of \nthe ranchers leasing public lands. Over 90 percent of the ranchers will \nbe getting this assistance. It will raise the fee for the remaining 9 \npercent of the ranchers who operate the large and highly profitable \nranches, and, in doing so, my amendment will raise approximately $13 \nmillion annually in revenue; that is, we are really converting and just \ngiving the money that was going to those huge ranchers out there, with \nthe exception of $13 million which will go to help defer the cost of \nthe program, to the small ranchers. That, I believe, is a fair deal for \nthe taxpayers and a real benefit to those small family ranchers out in \nthe West who need the assistance, whereas the large corporate ones \ncertainly need no assistance.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize. My second-degree amendment exempts \nsmall ranchers. Only large corporate interests who hold Federal grazing \npermits will be affected by the underlying Bumpers amendment.\n  Again, remember that 9 percent of the permit holders are large \ncorporate entities, or wealthy individuals, and they control over 60 \npercent of the AUM's. And 91 percent of the ranchers holding permits to \ngraze on Federal lands will pay less with my amendment than the pending \nlegislation, and only those 9 percent, the very wealthy corporations \nand individuals, will have to contribute a fair cost of what they are \ngetting at the State level, not at the private-lands level, which would \neven be higher.\n  So let us vote for the small ranchers. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor my second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to say a few words in support of \nthe basic bill we are debating, the Domenici bill. I appreciate the \nparliamentary position we are in; that is, the Bumpers amendment on \nfees pending with the Jeffords second-degree amendment pending. I want \nto direct my comments not to those specific amendments--the first- and \nsecond-degree amendments--but rather to the substance of the bill.\n  I want to begin by reminding my colleagues what this debate is really \nall about, and also what it is not about.\n  I want to begin by pointing out that, frankly, this bill \nfundamentally is about providing ranchers with grazing rules that are \nfair, grazing rules that are predictable, and grazing rules that are \ncertain.\n  The Domenici bill is also about assuring that where grazing does \noccur on Federal lands, it does not occur at the sacrifice of wildlife, \nit does not occur at the sacrifice of quality or public access. Namely, \nwe honor the principle of multiple use. The goal, simply put, is to see \nthat ranchers stay in business while assuring outstanding hunting and \nfishing. It is that simple. I might say, in my State of Montana this \nbalance exists, and it exists today, and I want to see that balance \ncontinue.\n  Let me add a word about what this debate is not about. This debate is \nnot about protecting those few ranchers who abuse the land. As far as I \nam concerned, the holder of any grazing permit has the right to graze \nlivestock on his public land. That is the right of that permittee. But \nthat right comes with a responsibility, a responsibility to be a good \nsteward of the land, good steward of water and wildlife and allotment. \nIf that responsibility is not met, if the land is abused, then that \npermit should be ended, it should be terminated. Basically, that is \nwhat should be done, that is what should happen.\n  In my State of Montana, there is a famous painting painted by the \ngreat cowboy artist Charlie Russell, who had the unique gift for \ncapturing the life of the Old West on canvas. There is one Russell \npainting that comes to mind called ``Waiting for a Chinook,'' also \nknown as ``The Last of 5,000.'' It was painted by Charlie Russell as he \nwas sending a card and letter back to the owner of the ranch. The owner \nhappened to be in New York City. This is a ranch he was associated with \nin Montana.\n  It is a painting of a lone cow. It is a lone cow standing in the \nmiddle of a blizzard. Coyotes are circling and waiting for that cow to \nfall. It was a year when most of the herds in Montana were decimated. \nThis pretty much sums up the challenges that we have faced as ranchers \nin Montana.\n  Ranchers have to face the severity of Montana winters. They have to \ndeal with predators, not only coyotes, but wolves. They have to deal \nwith very wide swings in the cattle market cycles. While the Russell \npainting does not reflect it, today's ranchers have to deal with the \nchallenge and frustration of Canadians pumping beef into the U.S. \nmarket and meatpackers manipulating market prices. So, taken as a \nwhole, it all makes for a mighty uncertain livelihood.\n  That is what S. 1459 is about. It is about giving ranchers a Federal \ngrazing policy that is stable and fair, that will encourage ranchers to \nremain good stewards of both their private lands and the public lands \nwhere they graze. The bill provides the tools to set Federal policy in \nthat direction. It gives ranchers the stability of 12-year permits. It \nis very important. It recognizes the investments that ranchers make in \nrange improvements, also important, and protects individual water \nrights, equally important in the West.\n\n  As I was listening to the Senator from Vermont talk about these big \nranches of the West, there is one point the Senator from Vermont seems \nto forget--that it does not rain in the West. In Vermont, it rains a \nlot. Here you get about 40, 50 inches of rain. In my part of the \ncountry, west of the 100th meridian, the average rainfall is about 14, \n15, 16 inches a year. That is all year around, including snow and rain. \nThat is why there are big ranches in the West. You have to have a lot\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nmore space to graze your livestock because there is not a lot of rain \nfor the grass to grow.\n  The bill also, I might say, Mr. President, protects not only water \nrights, but it makes the Forest Service and BLM grazing rules much more \nuniform, also important, because ranches have one set of regulations on \nBLM land and a different set on Forest Service lands. It helps to \nassure that Federal grazing policy is basically the same whether it is \nBLM or Forest Service land.\n  The predictability of this bill benefits not only ranchers, but all \nusers of our public lands; that is, hunters, rock hounds, birdwatchers, \nhikers, you name it.\n  There is a popular bumper sticker I frequently see on cars passing by \nas I am walking across my State of Montana. Let me tell you what that \nbumper sticker says. It says, ``Cattle, Not Condos.'' That is what \nwould happen if our family ranches simply became too unprofitable to \nstay in business. The land would be subdivided. Wildlife habitat would \nbe fragmented. Access to many of our favorite fishing holes would be \ncut off, as stream and riverfront lots are sold for cabin sites. We \nwould lose the great sense of openness, wide open spaces that help make \nMontana the ``Big Sky State.''\n  John Schultz of the Gran Prairie Ranch, near Grass Range, in Fergus \nCounty, summed it up when he wrote me, ``The recreationists and hunters \nuse this land extensively * * *,'' that is the land that this rancher \nowns, private land as well as public land, ``* * * however, there is \nonly one man who maintains the water and manages the grass so the plant \npopulation is diverse and in good condition. Not only do the livestock \nbenefit, but the wildlife do as well.''\n  The simple fact is that a strong, viable ranching industry is of \nbenefit to all Montanans. It benefits the small communities that rely \non the ranchers' business, and it benefits sportsmen who enjoy the \noutstanding hunting opportunities created by large tracks of \nundeveloped wildlife habitat. It helps provide the tax base for many of \nour rural communities, our schools, and our hospitals. That is what \nthis bill is about.\n  It is about establishing a Federal policy that helps us be good \nstewards of the land and remain economically viable. It is a policy \nthat makes the Federal Government a partner rather than a pest.\n  Let me go back to what this bill is not about. It is not about \nexcluding the public from having a full say in how we manage our public \nlands. It is not about compromising on environmental protection.\n  Critics of this bill maintain that the bill bars meaningful public \nparticipation when it comes to range improvement. That is not accurate. \nUnder the bill, a simple postcard guarantees an interested citizen a \nseat at the table for virtually every decision affecting range \nmanagement on our public lands. They will be given notice of all \nproposed permit actions and provided with an opportunity to comment and \ninformally consult with BLM or Forest Service land managers before a \ndecision is made. Following that decision, they have the right to lodge \nan administrative appeal. If they are still unhappy, they can take \ntheir grievance to Federal court. So under this bill the door is open \nto the public at virtually every stage of the process.\n  This legislation also recognizes the progress that the current \nresource advisory councils have made in developing standards and \nguidelines for responsible grazing on our Federal lands. The work of \nthese councils will continue to serve as the basis for setting grazing \nstandards.\n  Most importantly, these standards will be developed by Montanans, not \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  The legislation also maintains high environmental standards for \nranchers. Just listen to this. Today, over 70 percent of lands managed \nby the BLM in Montana are rated good to excellent --70 percent. That \nis, 70 percent of the BLM lands in the State of Montana are rated good \nto excellent. Less than 5 percent of the BLM land is in poor condition; \nthat is, not great, could be a lot better, but it is not bad. So, 70 \npercent good to excellent; 5 percent in poor condition.\n  The legislation provides the tools, however, to assure that the \nconditions in the poor allotments are improved.\n  On-the-ground decisions reflect sound science. The bill requires a \npermit-level review of monitoring data every 6 years to ensure that \ngood stewardship is not only the goal, but is actually being practiced.\n  In closing, I want to go back to what this bill is about. It is about \nputting into effect fair, balanced grazing rules that will allow our \nranchers to make a living.\n  It is also about recognizing that sportsmen and recreationists use \nthe public lands. It is their right, too. That Federal policy must be \none of mutual respect and accommodation for all legitimate uses of the \nresources. We have to work together, come together.\n  That is what this bill does. It helps reduce the division, the \nacrimony, the dissension of all the groups that have been trying to \ndeal with this policy. It helps bring people together. That is what \nthis does. It goes a long way to strike a balance, which I think is \nvery helpful to better and more sound Federal land policy. I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Baucus for his \ncooperation. He has worked with us on trying to make the bill better, \nand clearly from the first bill we introduced, into the second draft \nand the final one we put in today, I think we improved it from \neverybody's standpoint. I want to say he has been consistent with us. I \nam very appreciative. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3556 to Amendment No. 3555\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to open my remarks by simply \nsaying that this amendment is not vindictive, it is not designed to put \nsmall ranchers out of business, and indeed it would not. I consider it \nto be an eminently fair amendment.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of people who do not deal with this \nissue and really do not understand what this debate is about, let me \nstart off by saying there are 270 million acres of land that literally \nbelong to the taxpayers of America. Most of it, admittedly, is in the \nwestern States. However, some of it is in my State and your State. Mr. \nPresident, there are currently 270 million acres of land that are \nsubject to grazing permits.\n  How many permits? Twenty-two thousand. How much money do we get? Mr. \nPresident, we receive $25 million and change. Therefore, we are not \nhere debating money. That is really not the issue here. There is not \nmuch difference in the amount of money between the bill of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and the Bumpers amendment. I will tell you, however, \nwhere the difference is. The difference is in fairness. The difference \nis in who pays the fee and what happens to the money.\n  Now, the principal thrust of my amendment and the second-degree \namendment of the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], is to protect--\nlet me repeat, to protect--small ranchers. That is who the Senator from \nNew Mexico says he wants to protect. He has a lot of small ranchers in \nNew Mexico that are totally dependent for their livelihood on grazing. \nI want them protected.\n  I do not want my intelligence insulted by continually talking about \nsmall ranchers when 9 percent of the permittees, bear this in mind, \nthere are 22,000 permittees and 9 percent of those permittees control \n60 percent of the AUM's. What is an AUM? It is an animal unit month. It \nis the amount of forage needed to graze one horse, one cow, five sheep, \nor five goats for 1 month. An AUM is the basis on which farmers or \nranchers are charged for grazing their cattle. They may start off with \n200 head and they may keep 200 head for 6 months and they will pay, \ntoday, in 1996, $1.35 for each month for each of those 200 head that \ngraze on Federal land. If the rancher sells off 100 head on the first \nof July, his rent is cut in half.\n  I was a drugstore cowboy, among other things before I came to the \nSenate. I had 125 cows and maybe 80 calves.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator graze those on the public domain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. They were raised on private land. However, other people \nin Arkansas currently graze on Forest Service lands. Moreover, fees \npaid on eastern Forest Service lands, including Arkansas, are currently \ncalculated using a formula that is different than the western Forest \nService lands. The formula for eastern Forest Service lands is based on \nfair market value and is currently $2.50 per AUM. Additionally, any new \nor vacant permits on eastern Forest Service lands are competitively \nbid.\n  When I was elected Governor of my State, I charged five times as much \nper AUM for my farm lands as the Federal Government receives now.\n  I did not just fall off a turnip truck when it comes to cattle. I \nraised cattle for several years and I know something about it. I \nenjoyed some good times and some bad times. I will never forget back in \nthe late 1960's, the story about two farmers meeting. My area of \nArkansas is cattle and poultry farming. Two farmers met in the \nrestaurant. One said, ``I lost $100 already this morning.'' The other \nsaid, ``How on Earth did you do that?'' He said, ``My cow had a calf.'' \nThat is how bad prices were for cattle.\n  Back to the point, not only do 9 percent of all BLM permittees \ncontrol 60 percent of the AUM's, according to GAO, 2 percent of the \n22,000 permittees control 50 percent of all the land. Who are they? I \nwill come back to that in just a moment.\n  When I begin providing you with a list of the kind of people, and \nthey are not exactly small ranchers, who control hundreds of thousands \nof acres of land and run thousands of acres of cattle, you will see \nthat we are not talking about that small rancher that everybody in the \nSenate wants to protect. We are talking about billionaires, \nmillionaires, and big corporations.\n  What do they receive? At this very moment, they may be in a State \nthat charges up to $10 per AUM for grazing cattle on State lands. They \nmay have to pay $10 for per AUM on State lands. But if they get a \npermit from ``Uncle Sucker'' they pay $1.35 per AUM. Here are some of \nthe fees that the States charge. I have been through this so many times \non mining, and it is the same old story. Here is what the U.S. \nGovernment receives, $1.35 per AUM; Arizona, $2.16; Colorado, $6.50; \nIdaho, $4.88; Montana, $4.05; Nebraska, $15.50; New Mexico, $3.54; \nOklahoma, $10; Oregon, $2.72; South Dakota, $7; Utah, $2.50; \nWashington, $4.55; and Wyoming, $3.50.\n  Why in the name of God does the Federal Government charge $1.35 per \nAUM? What do the States know that we do not know? I tell you what the \nStates know. They know what the value of their land is.\n  The argument will be made, ``Senator Bumpers, you do not seem to \nunderstand the way BLM and the Forest Service hassle our people. It is \njust terrible how put upon they are.'' I know there is some truth to \nthat. I know that some of these bureaucrats of the BLM and the Forest \nService can be overbearing. I also know that most of those ranchers do \nnot want them around, period.\n  Now, the reason I am standing here is twofold: No. 1, I want a \ngrazing bill that is fair, that protects small ranchers and no. 2, I \nwant a grazing bill that restores the rangelands of this country.\n  Madam President, I want you to look at this very carefully on why the \nStates are so much smarter than we are when it comes to leasing their \nlands for cattle grazing.\n  Even this Senator had enough sense not to charge $1.35 when folks \nwere standing in line to pay me $10. Why do we continue to do this? I \nwant you to look at this chart. Since 1981--incidentally, Madam \nPresident, in 1981, the U.S. Government was getting $2.31 for an animal \nunit month. The current PRIA formula takes cattle prices into \nconsideration. The cattle prices are very low right now. That is one of \nthe reasons that I want to make sure that we protect the small \nranchers. They are having a terrible time surviving right now.\n  It is interesting to look at the trend of the Federal fee level--we \nreceived $2.31 in 1980. In 1996, 15 years later, we are receiving \n$1.35. That is $1 less per AUM than we received in 1980.\n  What is the trend with regard to fees charged on State lands? The \nStates are not dummies. They did what any prudent landowner would do. \nThey have raised their rates from an average of $3.22 per AUM in 1980 \nto $5.58 per AUM in 1995. That translates into approximately a 50-\npercent increase. What is the trend of the private sector? They are \nsmarter than the States or the Federal Government, either one. In 1981, \nthey were receiving an average of $7.83 per animal unit month on \nprivate lands. Today they are receiving an average of $11.20 per AUM. \nLook at poor old Uncle Sucker. Not much money involved, I repeat, but a \nbig principle.\n  Why would some of these billionaires not be clamoring for Federal \nlands? They did not get rich by being stupid. They are mining the \nFederal Treasury, too. Who are they? One of my favorites, Newmont \nMining. Talk about somebody mining the Federal Treasury. Newmont Mining \nis one of the biggest gold producers in the country, mining on lands \nthat they bought from the Federal Government for $2.50 an acre. They \nare mining billions of dollars' worth of gold on it and not paying the \nU.S. Government one red cent. They are not just satisfied with owning \ngold lands. They want some of these grazing permits. So what do they \nhave? They control 12,000 AUM's. What are we doing? We are charging \n$1.35 per AUM to Newmont Mining Co., one of the wealthiest companies in \nthe world.\n  Who else? Incidentally, here is a good one. Mr. Hewlett and Mr. \nPackard. They started a good company. I noticed a while ago that their \nstock went down today. They are a big computer manufacturer. Everybody \nknows Hewlett-Packard. Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard graze cattle on \nnearly 100,000 acres in Idaho. Why? Because it adjoins a ranch they \nown. Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard pay $1.35 per AUM on that Federal \nland. Why can Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard not pay a fee that is at \nleast a little closer to fair market value than $1.35 per AUM.\n  There is a company called Nevada First Corp. How many AUM's do you \nthink Nevada First has? They have 56,000. They are a subsidiary of the \nGarvey Industries Corp., with a net worth of $80 million. Then there is \nAnheuser-Busch. Everybody knows who Anheuser-Busch is. Sunday \nafternoon, I was coming back on an airplane, and my staff had given me \na memo on this debate and a newspaper article about how much public \nland Anheuser-Busch controlled with grazing permits. I asked the \ngentleman sitting on my left, ``Do you work for Anheuser-Busch?'' He \nsaid, ``No.'' I said, ``In that case, I will let you read this.'' He \nhanded it back to me and said, ``Surely, you are not surprised by \nthat.'' I said, ``No, I am not surprised.'' We went on our separate \nways.\n  Anheuser-Busch, which ranks 80th in the top 500 corporations in \nAmerica, holds four permits that total 8,000 AUM's. I have nothing \nagainst Anheuser-Busch. I have been a Cardinal fan all my life. That \nwas all we could get on the radio when I was a kid. They are a good \ncorporation, as far as I know.\n  Then there is an organization named Bogle Farms. Bogle Farms has \n40,000 AUM's on two permits in New Mexico. In 1991, their net worth was \n$15 million.\n  Dan Russell--I do not know these people--currently holds 10 permits \ncovering 200,000 AUM's. The issue is not whether or not he is a \nrancher. The issue is whether, if he controls 200,000 AUMs, we should \nsubsidize his cattle at the same rate that small ranchers pay.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. For what purpose?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to agree on a procedure.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield for that purpose.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe two rollcall votes scheduled to begin at 12 noon on Thursday, the \nSenate resume the grazing fee bill and the pending Bumpers amendment \nNo. 3556, that debate on that issue be equally divided in the usual \nform, and at 2:00 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to \nthe Bumpers amendment, without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask that there be a minimum of 75 minutes, equally divided, \nprior to the vote in relation to the Bumpers amendment.\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nBumpers amendment, Senator Bingaman be recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, reserving the right to object --and I \nknow the Senator from New Mexico did not prepare this--but the first \nvote which is to occur at 2:00 p.m. is supposed to be after the two \nvotes. But it anticipates an hour and 15 minutes. So I ask that it be \nchanged to an hour and 15 minutes following the close of the second \nvote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did that. I said: Further, that a minimum of 75 \nminutes, equally divided, prior to the vote in relation to the Bumpers \namendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Second, there is one correction there. The first vote \nshould be on the Jeffords amendment to the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. We did this on purpose. We want the first amendment \nto be on the Bumpers underlying amendment. If our desires prevail, then \nJeffords goes with it. If not, you are here and you can do whatever you \nwant.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, obviously, I cannot object to that. You have a \nperfect right to move to table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think it is fair that we take both amendments down \nwith a vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The reason I have strong objection to that--and I am \ngoing to talk a great deal about that--is that the Jeffords amendment \nis an amendment with which I agree. I like it. I like it in some \nrespects better than I do my own. I want for the people of this body to \nunderstand that if they vote to table the Bumpers amendment, they will \nnot get a chance to vote on the Jeffords amendment, which I think most \nof them would like to do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You may prevail on that, which means we will have a \nvote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would not want to preclude the possibility of making a \ntabling motion prior to the Jeffords amendment prior to that time.\n  I would like to add that to the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Madam President, to ensure the Record is clear, I would like to make \nthis statement as a part of the unanimous consent agreement; that is, \nthat at any time prior to the expiration of the hour and 15 minutes, or \nimmediately thereafter--Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, today the Senate will have the \nopportunity to return a bit of market discipline to the Federal grazing \nprogram. At a time when the Congress is cutting assistance to the poor, \nto education, and to a wide variety of other vital services, we cannot \nignore any potential sources of additional Federal income. The Federal \ngrazing program must also begin to pay its own way.\n  The fee contained in S. 1459 covers only a small part of the actual \ncost of the grazing program. The Bumpers amendment seeks to increase \nthis fee to a level at least a bit closer to what would be the fair \nmarket value of grazing services by adopting State grazing prices. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the 12 States they \nstudied charge from about 1\\1/2\\ to 10 times as much as what is charged \nfor grazing land under this Federal bill. While there may be small \ndifferences in the condition of some State and Federal grazing lands, \nany differences do not justify a fee disparity of 10 times grazing. \nMany of my colleagues are fond of saying that the States know best \nregarding most programs. Just return programs to the States, they say \nand programs will magically improve. Well, why cannot we look to the \nStates when it comes to revenue, too? State programs are managed to \nbring in money to support their schools. They cannot afford to \nsubsidize grazers at the expense of their children's education. As a \nresult, no State studied charges anything like the Federal fee. By \nadopting the State level, we also insure that fees are appropriate for \nlocal conditions.\n  Madam President, this amendment is simple. The rest of the bill is \nnot. According to the statement of administration policy submitted on \nS. 1459, the bill severely limits the ability of public land managers \nto protect the land and its resources and manage lands for multiple \nuse. The bill curtails most public participation in grazing management \ndecisions and activities, and severely weakens the requirements for \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  The bill also contains troubling water rights language which, \naccording to the Department of the Interior, may bar transfer of water \nuses from Federal to private land and language which would prevent \nranchers from taking land out of production for conservation uses. In \nother words, they have to keep it in grazing.\n  Worst of all, the bill violates the spirit under which Federal lands \nare supposed to be managed--for multiple uses which benefit all of the \npeople and not just a few, organized groups. Our public lands belong to \nall Americans, whether they hike, bird watch, or graze livestock. \nWhether they live in Wyoming or New Jersey. They should never become \nthe exclusive province of any one use.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this Bumpers \namendment, a fiscally conservative amendment, and later for the \nDemocratic substitute that will be offered by Senator Bingaman which \nmakes needed changes in the underlying bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3556, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I send a modification of my amendment \nto desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3556), as modified, is as follows:\n       Strike section 135 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 135. GRAZING FEES.\n\n       (a) Grazing Fee.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law and subject to subsections (b) and (c), the Secretary of \n     the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a \n     fee for domestic livestock grazing public rangelands as \n     provided for in section 6(a) of the Public Rangelands \n     Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1905(a)) and Executive \n     Order 12548 (51 F.R. 5985):\n       Provided, That the grazing fee shall not be less than: \n     $1.50 per animal unit month for the 1997 grazing year; $1.75 \n     per animal unit month for the 1998 grazing year; and $2.00 \n     per animal unit month for the 1999 grazing year and \n     thereafter.\n       (b) Determination of Fee.--(1) Permittees or lessees who \n     own or control livestock comprising less than 2,000 animal \n     unit months on the public rangelands during a grazing year \n     pursuant to one or more grazing permits or leases shall pay \n     the fee as set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) Permittees or lessees who own or control livestock \n     comprising more than 2,000 animal unit months on the public \n     rangelands during a grazing year pursuant to one or more \n     grazing permits or leases shall pay the fee equal to the \n     higher of either--\n       (A) the average grazing fee (weighted by animal unit \n     months) charged by the State during the previous grazing year \n     for grazing on State lands in which the lands covered by the \n     permit or lease are located; or\n       (B) the Federal grazing fee set forth in subsection (a), \n     plus 25 percent.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section--\n       (1) State lands shall include school, education department, \n     and State land board lands; and\n       (2) individual members of a grazing association shall be \n     considered as individual permittees or lessees in determining \n     the appropriate grazing fee.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we make the unanimous-consent request now?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me just say that if we can get \nthis, our leader has authorized me to say there will be no more votes \ntonight. But we have to get this first.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that the following--let me do this.\n  I stated the unanimous-consent previously. I ask that that unanimous-\nconsent which I stated, and which I send to the desk in writing to \nreaffirm, be granted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, there will be an hour and \n15 minutes following the close of the second vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We set 75 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. OK. Fine. I accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now we can say in behalf of the majority leader that \nthere will be no more votes tonight.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I just wanted to know. There will be no more votes. But \nwill the discussion continue on this particular amendment tonight, or \nis it going to be continued also tomorrow?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No. The amendment will be the subject of an hour and 15 \nminutes of debate tomorrow.\n  Does that answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. In other words, you are winding up the debate pretty \nsoon here.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We will debate tonight as long as anybody wants to say \nanything on this, and then we will shut the Senate down as soon as we \nrun out of debate.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3557 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJeffords amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3556, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I do not want to belabor these rich \nfolks too long. The last one that I want to point out to for the \nedification of my colleagues is the gentleman by the name of J. R. \nSimplot from the great State of Idaho. He is 86 years old and has \nobviously been a great entrepreneur. I do not know a thing in the world \nabout him. I assume he is a very fine man. In 1991, Forbes magazine \nidentified him as one of the wealthiest individuals in the United \nStates. Furthermore, he is on the cover of Fortune magazine in November \n1995. Here is the magazine, if anybody would care to look at it.\n  His sales that year were $3 billion. And Mr. Simplot, to his credit \nand to his ingenuity, controls 50,000 AUM's in Idaho, Oregon, and \nNevada.\n  Finally, a Japanese named Kaiku controls 6,000 AUM's on 40,000 acres \nof Federal land in Montana.\n  What does our amendment do? I will not belabor the point because it \nis very simple. We make a distinction between that group of people that \nI showed you a moment ago. Look at this chart, colleagues. We make a \ndistinction in what people in this category pay, and what people in \nthis category pay.\n  Ninety-one percent of the permittees under our amendment will pay \njust a little bit more than they would pay under the Domenici proposal, \nand in some years less than the Domenici proposal. Ninety-one percent \nof them will pay just a few cents more than Senator Domenici's bill \nrequires.\n  This other 9 percent, which control 60 percent of all the AUM's, will \npay either the same amount as the small ranchers, plus 25 percent, or a \nweighted average of the State fees charged in the State in which the \npermit is located, whichever is higher.\n  That is as fair as a proposition could be. You can accept this \namendment and agree that these people have taken advantage of a \ngenerous Congress who passed this law and gave these permits to people \nthinking they were helping poor ranchers make a living. And now we find \n60 percent of this land and AUM's are controlled by the richest people \nof America. Even under our proposal, to require these rich people to \npay the weighted average of what the State charges, will still be in \nmost instances around 100 percent less than what the private sector \ncharges for grazing.\n\n  Madam President, why are we defending a system that promotes the use \nof the public lands for the wealthiest when it was intended for the \npoorest? Because it is an old law and we just simply have not been able \nto turn it loose and make it work the way it was supposed to.\n  When I came here in 1975, I found out that the Federal Government was \nleasing Federal lands for oil and gas leasing by lottery, like a bingo \ngame. If you won the lottery, you got the land for $1 an acre. When I \nbegan to raise questions about it, they said, ``We are trying to make \nsure those little mom and pop operations get some of this Federal \nland.''\n  We started checking the little mom and pop operations, and guess what \nwas happening? They were retirees in Florida. They were elderly people \nwho were snapping up these lottery chances because they were advertised \nall over America by a bunch of snake oil salesmen. And if they did \nhappen to win the lottery, what do you think they did with it? They \ntook it to Exxon, and if Exxon thought it had potential, they paid them \na fortune for it.\n  That is what we did for mom and pop operators. We made people, who \ndid not know what a drilling rig looked like, wealthy because we \nrefused to change that old law. I just made my mining speech yesterday \nso I am not going to make that again, but how many times have I heard \nthat old story about those poor little old mom and pop mining companies \nout there?\n  It turns out, as I began to examine it, that we are helping the \nbiggest corporations in the world--not the United States, in the world. \nNow, here is deja vu. If someone argues that the State's rates are too \nhigh, I will answer that they have people standing in line wanting \nthese permits. And when then they say, ``But that mean old BLM hassles \nus. They make us sort of take care of the land.'' But you know \nsomething else that the BLM and the Forest Service do? They take 50 \npercent of the rent and put it back into the land. How many landlords \ndo you know that take 50 percent of the rent they receive and put it \nback into improvements of your apartment or your house? Fifty percent \ngoes back to improve the very land where these cattlemen are running \ntheir cattle.\n  Madam President, the Public Rangelands Management Act was passed in \n1978. As I stated earlier, the fee under that formula has declined. In \n1980, the fee was $2.36 and in 1996, the fee is $1.35. Our amendment \nwould use the same formula and simply raise the minimum.\n  My amendment requires 91 percent of the deserving ranchers to pay \nvery little more than they are paying right now. In 1999, our rate \nwould go to $2 and under Senator Domenici's amendment the fee would be \n$1.85--15 cents difference. Who is going to quibble about that? \nHowever, under our amendment these people, the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, would have to pay more.\n  Madam President, two quick points, and I will conclude and let others \nspeak who wish to. Karl Hess, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, \nwhich is not exactly a citadel of liberalism, no bleeding heart \nliberals over at Cato, simply believes that the Government ought to get \nfair value for its assets. Here is a statement by Mr. Hess:\n\n       Domenici's bill is bad for ranchers, bad for public lands, \n     bad for the American taxpayer. It will not improve management \n     of public lands and it will not be a fix for the hard \n     economic times now faced by ranchers. What it will do, \n     however, is deepen the fiscal crisis of the public land \n     grazing program by plunging it into an ever-deepening \n     deficit. If western ranchers insist on supporting this bill \n     and the additional costs associated with it, they should be \n     prepared to pay the price. Tagging the majority of Federal \n     grazing fees to state grazing rates is one essential step in \n     that direction.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1459, the \nPublic Rangelands Management Act of 1995. Rangeland reform is important \nboth for the health of our public lands and the ranching industry in \nthe Western States. I commend my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, for his work in bringing this bill to the Senate floor.\n  Let me make clear up front, S. 1459 is not an attempt to weaken \nexisting environmental laws applicable to grazing. All major \nenvironmental laws continue to apply as written. This bill provides for \nbetter rangeland management by establishing standards and guidelines at \nthe State or regional level, so that rangeland policy can take regional \ndifferences into account. Nothing is more important to me than the \npreservation of these multiple-use lands for present and future \ngenerations. I would not, and could not support anything to the \ncontrary.\n  There continues to be debate about what is an appropriate fee for \ngrazing on public land. It is important that the Government realize a \nfair return for the use of Federal lands. This legislation prescribes a \nnew formula for calculating grazing fees. Under this formula, fees \nwould rise approximately 30 percent over the present level.\n  For those who make their living from the land, and who put food on \nthe table for all of us, we want to offer some certainty for the \nfuture. We must protect rancher's private property rights, provide \nstability on grazing allotments,\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\nand offer sufficient incentives for sound long-term resource management \npractices.\n  Critics have suggested that S. 1459 provides for grazing and \nlivestock activities as the dominant use on the allotments. That is \nsimply not true. The bill explicitly provides that the public lands \nwill continue to be accessible to all multiple-use activities.\n  It has also been suggested that this legislation will curtail public \nparticipation in the decisionmaking process. The public's opportunity \nto participate in the NEPA and FLPMA processes is not affected by this \nlegislation. It does, however, address the problem of who can appeal \nallotment management decisions by limiting appeals to persons who have \naffected interests. This will enable Federal land managers to review \nappeals more expeditiously and will shorten the delays in achieving a \nfinal implementation plan. This process will allow permittees and \nlessees to carry out their business without the heavy financial losses \nusually associated with lengthy delays.\n  Most importantly, this legislation provides for periodic monitoring \nof rangeland resource conditions. The Secretaries of Agriculture and \nthe Interior have the ability to amend allotment plans where resource \nconditions dictate. I believe that the bill therefore reflects a wide \nvariety of environmental and user concerns; and I urge its favorable \nconsideration.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the \nissue grazing fees on public lands. As I mentioned before in my opening \nstatement, I believe there is a grave misperception about ranchers who \nutilize public lands. For those of you unfamiliar with ranchers or the \nranching business, let me tell you that it is not a lucrative business. \nI believe it is this misperception that drives the efforts to try to \nhike up the grazing fees to unacceptable heights. Opponents of the new \nfee structure proposed in S. 1459, argue that ranchers don't pay fair \nmarket value. Well, I would like my colleagues to explain to the rest \nof us, how one can determine what fair market value is.\n  For example, when doing a fair market value appraisal, appraisers \ncompare the value of similarly situated pieces of property--they \ncompare apples with apples. When opponents of the proposed grazing fee \ncompare the prices charged to lease private or State lands with the \ngrazing fees ranchers pay for BLM or Forest Service lands, however they \nare comparing apples with oranges. They simply are not the same thing.\n  My friends from Arkansas and Vermont, are attempting to draw \ncomparisons between apples--State lands, and oranges--Federal lands, to \nlegitimize their logic. States fees are structured under an entirely \ndifferent scenario than Federal fees. State lands are administered for \ncompletely different purposes and goals compared to Federal lands. To \ncompare the fee dollars and cents on a chart is simply not fair.\n  With their amendments, my colleagues are attempting to utilize the \nState fee structure to create a more fair return to the Government and \ntaxpayer. However, as I have stated before, this logic is flawed.\n\n  If we follow this rationale utilized in this amendment, by \nimplementing the State rate fees, we might as well streamline the \nprocess and manage the public lands according to State management \nsystems. Heck, if we charge a grazing fee according to State rates, \nmanage the Federal lands like State lands, we might as well turn the \nwhole operation and ownership over to the States. I suspect there are \nmany Members in this body that would not agree with this type of logic.\n  Furthermore, the grazing fee structure in the Bumpers amendment is \nfundamentally unfair to ranchers. This proposal does not fully consider \nthe investment that ranchers already have made in building their lots \nand stock ponds. In addition, the profit margins for many ranchers is \nsmall, and thousands of ranchers have already fallen into bankruptcy. \nRaising the fees as this amendment proposes to do will drive even more \nranchers into economic insolvency.\n  Mr. President, the fee structure proposed by S. 1459 would establish \na fair system. It is a very simple and straightforward method for \ncalculating the grazing fee that would apply to western BLM and Forest \nService lands.\n  Quite simply, you would take the 3-year average of the total gross \nvalue of production of beef cattle for the 3 years preceding the \ngrazing fee year--based on data supplied by the Economic Research \nService of the USDA--and multiply that number by the 10-year rolling \naverage of 6-month Treasury bills. That number would be divided by 12, \nthe number of months in a year. The dividend would be the grazing fee, \nexpressed in dollars per animal unit month. S. 1459 would increase the \nfee by an average of about 50 cents per AUM.\n  Anyone who truly understands the grazing fees, will understand that \nthere is only one agency that really attempts to compile data about \nprivate leased lands--it is the USDA's Economic Research Service--and \nthat is why they are the source of the critical data used in this fee \nformula.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about this misperception of \ngrazing fees that has become a symbol representing unfair subsidies and \nenvironmental degradation. Fee increases are imminent, and most people \nhere understand that. However, these increases must be carefully \nstructured with appropriate data. S. 1459 achieves this, by \nestablishing a grazing fee formula that protects the rancher while \nallowing for equitable returns to the Federal Government.\n  I would like to abbreviate my comments because I know my colleagues \nwant to get out of here at a decent hour this evening. I was over in \nthe office listening to the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from \nVermont, and I have to tell you I think they are just simply missing \nthe target. I would ask my colleagues to oppose both their amendments.\n  As I understand the Jeffords amendment in the second degree, is \nattempting to put corporate interests in the same category as the \nfamily rancher, who has spent years and years of hard work to make his \nranch grow. I think that is a mistake. It seems to me that we are \nconfusing the issue of large and small ranchers and real ranchers with \ncorporate operations.\n  I know in our State of Colorado we give special 100-year awards to \nranchers and farmers. If the family has stayed with the land for 100 \nyears, we give them an award at our State fair every year to try to \nencourage them to stay on the land. Many of those ranchers have \nsacrificed a great deal and their families have sacrificed too in order \nto make the ranch grow.\n  Some have done well over the years and invested in other things, but \ntheir primary income still comes from the ranch. This reality is a \nlittle different than the reality I have heard described by the two \nSenators and their amendments. I understand that the amendments that \nare being offered now are an attempt to try to get the corporate people \nout of ranching, and both Senator Bumpers and Senator Jeffords \nmentioned Anheuser-Busch and Hewlett-Packard and a number of others, \nSimplot and Texaco, and so on.\n  I think most of us recognize that there are corporations in America \nthat have bought ranches or bought permits to use as some kind of a tax \nshelter. I understand that. Most of us understand that. That is not who \nwe are trying to protect. I know the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] \nand I have a lot of friends who fall into the first category that I was \ntrying to describe. Those people who have worked the land, stuck to the \nland and sacrificed to keep the land are the ones we are concerned \nabout. We are not in any way trying to protect the big corporations \nfrom using ranching legislation as a tax writeoff.\n  It would seem to me what they should introduce perhaps is an \namendment to prevent nonranchers from buying permits, or to specify the \ncriteria for permittees. It seems to me that is who they are trying to \nidentify are those people who are abusing or misusing, if I can use \ntheir words, the system of ranching and the system of using permits.\n  Now, I wanted to also respond to the Senator from Arkansas question \nof quote, ``Where does the money go?'' I will tell you where the little \nmoney ranchers gain in profit goes. It goes\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nonto Main Street. It goes into hardware stores, and it goes into the \ngrocery stores, and it goes into the used car lot and everyplace else--\nthe banks, too, if there is some left over. Maybe it even goes for \nrecreation or vacations. For the most part, however, usually the little \nthat is left over goes back into the ranch to improve the ranch. I \ndon't think people understand that ranching is the economic backbone \nfor many rural communities in the West. When one rancher goes down, the \nwhole community is affected. People up in the administration like to \ntalk about the interconnectedness of ecosystems. Well, the rural \nranching communities are a great example of an interconnected \ncommunity. One element goes down, and the whole system crashes.\n  It seems to me, knowing what I do, as a western Senator, about \nranching, when you kill the ranching industry--you also kill Main \nStreet. I believe a disproportionate increase in a fee could do just \nthat, and there are many studies that have indicated that a fee \nincrease would indeed have devastating repercussions for the rancher \nand the community. This is obviously a serious issue to many small \ntowns in the West, in probably eight or nine States at the very least. \nA blind and politically driven fee increase would result in putting \nreal hard-working people on the welfare lines, and destroying property \ntax bases in our region. I do not think that is what our goal ought to \nbe.\n  The Senator from Arkansas also mentioned one person in particular \nwhich he used to convince folks, in his catch-all kind of shotgun \nattack, that large ranchers are the same as corporate ranchers. That \nman was a man by the name of Dan Russell. I happen to personally know \nDan Russell, although I do not know him well. I met him years ago, \nclear back in the 1960's. I disagree strongly with the Senator from \nArkansas' characterization of his operation as some type of heartless, \nprofit-driven corporate industry.\n  Dan Russell's family has ranched for almost 100 years on both sides \nof the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California and Nevada, too. He \nprobably made 98 percent of his money or more from ranching, although \nhe has probably invested in other things, too. Yes, he did make money, \nbut I do not think that is against the law and it should not be against \nthe law.\n  Dan Russell may have made money, but one factor that the Senator from \nArkansas failed to mention is that Dan is known as one of the most \ncommunity-minded people in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada \nMountains. Dan's profit has been a profit for his community. If you go \nto Folsom, CA, a small town northeast of Sacramento, you find the Dan \nRussell Arena, which Dan donated. A lot of events are held there for \nthe community. He is known as a civic leader and community-minded \ncitizen who has made his money through real ranching, not because he \nhad an interest in Texaco or something else. Dan's contributions to his \nlocal community should be commended, not condemned.\n  I would now like to address the issue of fair market value. This \nissue comes up in this debate time after time. There is a great \nmisperception about the fees for public lands, as if, somehow, ranchers \nin the West are ripping off the taxpayer because they do not pay the \nsame amount for their AUM as a rancher in some other State that has to \nrent private land. I have private land. My wife's family used to have \npermits. I can tell you there is a big difference between private land \nand permits on public lands. The public land permits do not have the \nsame sorts of benefits you could get on private land. Developments, \nimprovements, anything you would not have to pay or provide on private \nlands, you have to pay for out of your own pocket on public lands. You \nget a lot more for your money with private rentals than you do with the \npermits. I think it is simply a bad comparison.\n  I would like to illustrate the ludicrous nature of this comparison \nwith a couple of examples. I live out West where, if you want to go get \nyour own Christmas tree at Christmas, you can do it on public lands. \nYou can get a $5 permit from the Forest Service and go cut a tree. \nVirtually any tree of any size that you can carry out of there, is only \n$5. Yet, if you go downtown to any city in America and you buy a tree \non the lot, it will probably cost you $5 a foot. So how do you go about \ncomparing the two? If you use the same rationale in the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas, we should start charging folks $5 \na foot for the trees on Forest Service land. I have a hunch though, \nthat if you told everybody who wanted to go out in the forest and cut \nhis or her own Christmas tree, many of whom have built traditions off \nof this practice year after year, that we were going to charge them $5 \na foot for any tree they pack out of the forest, they would probably \nget pretty darned angry about it. Is it fair? How about this example: \nIn Denver, CO, if you go to the zoo to see eagles, hawks, coyotes, \nsnakes, alligators, elk, and deer or whatever kind of animal, you pay \n$6. If you drive about 30 minutes from the zoo to the foothills of the \nRocky Mountains, you could easily see a lot of these animals, and you \nwouldn't be charged a cent. Under the Senator from Arkansas' logic with \nfair market value, maybe we ought to charge anybody who wants to see a \ndeer, who goes out in the forest, $6 to go out and look at deer. There \nwould be a national uprising if we even suggested something like that.\n\n  This business about fair market value is simply a classic case of \napples and oranges. It does not fit and it is not fair.\n  Finally, I would like to address another example that demonstrates \nthe difficulties in ranching on public lands. Currently, under the \nrangeland reform regulations and the Bingaman substitute amendment, the \npermittees on public lands who have put money into improvements are not \nallowed to have any ownership over the investments they make. The \nranchers simply have to put in that money themselves--there are no \nFederal grants to assist them--and they get very little in return in \nthe end. Under the Domenici bill, there are real incentives for \npermittees to improve their allotments. Unless you provide real \nincentives for the rancher, the condition of the range will continue to \nbe substandard. This is not the fault or responsibility of the rancher. \nIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government. It just makes \nsense--people have to feel empowered, they have to feel like they have \na stake in what they work on, in order for them to be proactive in \nimproving the conditions.\n  In any event, I did want to come down just for a moment and voice my \nopposition to both the Jeffords amendment and the Bumpers amendment. I \nthink they are both just shots in the dark, and by trying to go after \nthe big corporations they will create casualties amongst the hard-\nworking family ranchers of the West.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, just for a moment, I, too, cannot resist \nthe opportunity to make some comment on what we have heard over the \nlast few minutes. I guess it is because I have heard it a half a dozen \ntimes since I came here to the Congress in 1989. Every year this same \nthing goes on, we go through this same business.\n  Basically, the first decision you have to make is the question of, as \nthe previous speaker said, ``highly subsidized grazing.'' Let me quote \nfor you a study that was made by Pepperdine University. It was a \ncomparative analysis of economic and financial conditions. It happened \nto be in Montana, between ranchers who have Federal lands and those who \ndo not. These are just a few of the findings.\n\n       Montana ranchers who rely upon access to Federal lands and \n     grazing do not have a competitive advantage over other \n     ranchers in the State. Livestock operators with direct access \n     to Federal forage do not enjoy significant economic or \n     financial advantages over ranchers who do not utilize Federal \n     forage.\n\n  It goes on and on. This is not my study; it is an academic study from \nPepperdine University.\n  The point of the matter is, there is a great deal of difference \nbetween what you buy in State lands and what you buy in private lands \nand what you get in public lands. The Senator was talking about \ncomparing it to Arkansas. What do they get, 35, 40 inches of moisture a \nyear? In Wyoming, we get 6 or 8. There is a substantial difference \nthere. Out in the Red Desert, where much of this land is, it takes 100 \nacres for one animal unit year. That is what it takes. It is different.\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\n  State lands you can fence. State lands you can--they are better \nquality lands. Generally they are small, isolated tracts that are \nenclosed. It is not comparable.\n  The Senator was talking about $1.35. Our bill does not talk about \n$1.35, it talks about $1.85. It talks about going up from where we \nwere. It has a formula based on the price and the value of cattle. It \ndoes not treat different people differently.\n  The Senator keeps mentioning the Rock Springs Grazing Association, \nthat it is a great corporation. It is not a great corporation. It is a \ncombination of relatively small ranches.\n  I keep hearing about it every year, the same thing. I just do not \nunderstand it. It is interesting, of course, that all those who talk \nabout this come from nonpublic-land States. I guess that might have \nsomething to do with it.\n  In any event, I oppose these propositions. I think the formula has \nnothing to do with the price of cattle. It has nothing to do with the \nidea of what it is you are buying. Anyone who thinks there is a \ncomparative value between private leasing and public lands just has not \ntaken a look at it. They just have not taken a look at it.\n  Madam President, I am sure we will talk about this some more \ntomorrow, and should. But I want to tell you that this whole idea of \ntrying to establish two classes of users is not even supported by the \nSecretary of the Interior over time. It has never been used before. The \nidea that the whole thing is subsidized simply is not the case. It is a \nmatter of utilizing the resources on a multiple-use basis.\n  Tell me how many private land leases are also shared with hunters and \nfishermen and leased to oil? They are not that way. That is not the way \nit is. So, it is interesting to me that we continue to have this same \ndiscussion every time this comes up. Fortunately, that position does \nnot generally prevail.\n  Madam President, we will pursue it some more tomorrow. For tonight, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Just for a minute I want to speak on the bill before \nus, and then I want to ask permission to speak as in morning business \nfor about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Before I speak in morning business, most of the time I only speak on \nagricultural issues as they relate to the Midwest--the cattle, the \npork, the production of corn, production of soybeans, and some wheat. \nBut I think a lot of things that could be said on that issue can be \nsaid on this bill as well.\n  Part of the problem that the Senators from the West are having comes \nfrom a lot of constituents who are legitimately expressing concern \nabout the environment, legitimately expressing concern about the good \nmanagement and a good economic return for the Federal Government on \nland that the taxpayers own, who do all this legitimately. But they \nforget, in the process, they are not appreciating what the consumer of \nAmerica has in the way of production of food in America.\n  I think too often the 98 percent of the people in this country who \nare not producing food--remember, that is 2 percent of the people in \nthis country producing the food that the other 98 percent eat, or \nanother way to put it, one farmer in America will produce enough food \nnot only for Americans but for people outside of America to feed \nanother 124 people--the 98 percent do not really appreciate the fact \nthat food grows on farms, it does not grow in supermarkets.\n  They are so used to going to the supermarket, getting anything they \nwant anytime they want it and just pay for it. Every time you pay for \nit, you think you are paying for a very expensive item. But, in fact, \nfood in the United States, not only being of the highest quality, is \nalso a cheaper product in America than any other country in the world.\n  The consumers of America spend about 9 or 10 percent of their \ndisposable income on food. Look at any other country, and the \npercentage is in the high teens and low twenties, and in some of the \ncountries of Eastern Europe, it could be 40 percent of income spent \njust on food.\n  I know none of you is going to buy the argument when I say we are \ntalking about subsidies for farmers. Just think of the subsidy that the \nconsumers of America get from the efficient production of food in \nAmerica that consumers in other places in the world do not get from \nproduction of food by their farmers.\n  I do not expect anybody to buy the argument that the farmers of \nAmerica are subsidizing the food bill of consumers of America by 40 \npercent, but that is a fact, because we produce so efficiently, we \nproduce such a high-quality product that it is just a little irksome \nfor those of us who are involved in agriculture to sit around here and \nlisten to this lack of appreciation of what the farmers do for the \nconsumers of America, what 2 percent of the people do for the other 98 \npercent, what we not only do in the way of production of food and \nfiber, but what we do to create jobs in America, because whatever \nstarts out at the natural resources of America, whether it be on the \nrow-crop farms of the Midwest or the grazing lands of the West, the \nstart of that product there, when you trace that product from the farm \nthrough the consumer of America, you are talking about a food and fiber \nchain that is 20 percent of the gross national product of America.\n  That is jobs for a lot of people other than the 2 percent of the \npeople who are farmers. Quite frankly, a lot of income returned on \nlabor is much greater than the return that the farmer gets for labor.\n  So you can go ahead in this debate over the next day or two and have \nall the fun you want to about doing what you think is right for the \nenvironment or what you think is right for a return on investment for \nthe taxpayers who have money invested in public land and give the \nfarmers of America a bad time. We probably have to take it because we \nare such a small segment of the population, but I would like to see, \nonce in a while, an appreciation from the people in the Congress of the \nUnited States, not only this body but the other body as well, for the 2 \npercent of the people who provide a good product and a cheap product \nfor the consumers of America.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday, I spoke about the void in \nmoral leadership in the White House.\n  I felt obliged, as Teddy Roosevelt said, to speak the truth about the \nPresident.\n  Let me quote him once more.\n  Some of my colleagues may not have heard me yesterday.\n  He said it is absolutely necessary that we have full liberty to tell \nthe truth about the President and his acts.\n\n       Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and \n     servile.\n       To announce that there must be no criticism of the \n     President . . . is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is \n     morally treasonable to the American public . . .\n       It is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or \n     unpleasant, about him than about anyone else.\n\n  I quoted yesterday from another great President, also named \nRoosevelt. Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said,\n\n       The Presidency is not merely an administrative office . . .\n       It is more than an engineering job . . .\n       It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.\n\n  That is why it is important to reflect on this issue.\n  I speak about the moral leadership issue because I believe it is \ncritical.\n  Because it is lacking.\n  I make a distinction between leadership and moral leadership.\n  Leadership means the capacity for exercising responsible authority.\n  There are many in this body who are outstanding leaders.\n  This is reflected in the many important laws we write for the Nation.\n  Moral leadership is different.\n  Moral leadership means we do not just pass laws for the rest of the \nNation, and exempt ourselves.\n  It means we pass laws and we apply them to ourselves, as well.\n  We set the example.\n  We say one thing, and we do it, too.\n  That is what I mean by moral leadership.\n  This Congress, for example, in one of its very first deeds, passed \nthe Congressional Accountability Act.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\n  In doing so, for the very first time we applied the laws to ourselves \nthat we passed for the rest of the country.\n  That is moral leadership, Madam President.\n  That is setting an example.\n  It says, ``Watch what we do, not just what we say.''\n  It is not often that Congress is able to exhibit moral leadership.\n  We do things more by consensus and compromise.\n  The reality of Congress is, we usually do things ugly.\n  Foreigners always have the best observations about our form of \ngovernment. de Tocqueville, of course, is the most famous example.\n  But a Russian visitor, Boris Marshalov, once observed, ``Congress is \nso strange. A man gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens--\nand then everybody disagrees.\n  Madam President, that's precisely why leadership from the White House \nis so important.\n  The individuality of the President is required to provide the moral \nleadership for the Nation that Congress, as a body, cannot.\n  The country desperately needs it.\n  That is what Franklin Roosevelt was talking about.\n  Yesterday, I talked about why the White House has covered up all its \nnon-legal activities, on both Whitewater and Travelgate.\n  It is because the activity of those in the White House conflicts with \ntheir projected image.\n  In the words of syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, it is \n``political duplicity * * * The offense is hypocrisy of a high order. \nHaving posed as our moral betters, they had to cover up. At stake is \ntheir image.''\n  Yesterday, I referred to and quoted from the new book by James B. \nStewart, ``Blood Sport.''\n  The book reveals much about the Clintons to which Mr. Krauthammer \nalluded. Mr. Stewart raises several questions about the Clintons.\n  One is about their willingness to abide by the same standards that \neveryone else has to meet. A second is about whether they abide by \nfinancial requirements in obtaining mortgage loans. A third is whether \nthey should have accepted favors from people who were regulated by the \nState of Arkansas.\n  Last week, Mr. Stewart was interviewed by Ted Koppel on \n``Nightline.'' In that interview, Mr. Stewart calls this a story about: \n``the Arrogance of Power, what people think they can do/and get away \nwith/as an elected official, then how candid and honest they are when \nquestioned about it.''\n  He offers an illustration. It is a quote from the First Lady. She was \nadvised by White House staff to disclose everything rather than \nstonewall. Let the Sun shine in, they said. But the First Lady rejected \nthat advice. She said, according to Mr. Stewart, ``Well, you know, I'm \nnot going to have people poring over our documents. After all, we're \nthe President.''\n  Madam President, I will put the entire interview of Mr. Stewart by \nMr. Koppel into the Record.\n  That way, the Record will reflect the full context of Mr. Stewart's \nwords, so that I am not accused of misleading the American people.\n  But Mr. Stewart's observations, as well as those of Mr. Krauthammer, \nheighten the public's awareness of a moral leadership void in the White \nHouse.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \ninterview of Mr. Stewart by Mr. Koppel.\n  There being no objection, the interview was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From ``Nightline'' Mar. 11, 1996]\n\n       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. The Whitewater controversy, \n     accusations made and denied.\n       James Stewart [Author, ``Blood Sport'']. Mrs. Clinton, \n     essentially, took singlehandedly the control of this \n     investment.\n       Hillary Clinton. We saw no records, we saw no documents.\n       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. New questions about the Clintons' \n     credibility.\n       James Stewart. I think the death of Vincent Foster is the \n     pivotal event in this story.\n       Hillary Clinton. There were no documents taken out of Vince \n     Foster's office on the night he died.\n       President Bill Clinton. An allegation comes up, and we \n     answer it, and then people say, ``Well, here's another \n     allegation. Answer this.''\n       James Stewart. The President practically screamed over the \n     phone. He said, ``I can't take this anymore. I'm here in \n     Europe and they're asking me about Whitewater.''\n       Ted Koppel [voice-over]. Now, the picture may become a \n     little clearer. Tonight, new details about Whitewater, Vince \n     Foster and damage control.\n       Announcer. This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from \n     Washington, Ted Koppel.\n       Ted Koppel. This program may be the first you've heard \n     about ``Blood Sport,'' a new book which becomes available \n     later this week, but it will not be the last. To begin with, \n     you need to know how and why the book came about. The idea \n     appears to have originated with Hillary Clinton. In any \n     event, it was her close friend, Susan Thomases, herself a \n     lawyer, who approached the author, Jim Stewart, and suggested \n     that those closest to the First Family and, indeed, the \n     President and the First Lady themselves, would be willing to \n     cooperate with an objective, outside-the-Beltway writer on a \n     detailed, no-holds-barred Whitewater book.\n       Stewart, a lawyer and former page one editor of the Wall \n     Street Journal, had impeccable credentials. He had shared in \n     a 1988 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on insider trading. \n     In 1991, he published the book ``Den of Thieves,'' about \n     financial fraud in the 1980's. Stewart took up the offer and \n     even had one lengthy meeting with Mrs. Clinton at the White \n     House, but the promised cooperation never materialized, \n     although a number of people close to the Clintons did \n     ultimately talk. Stewart went ahead and wrote the book \n     anyway. Jim Stewart is a meticulous writer, which is another \n     way of saying that there are few blaring headlines, but \n     dozens of troubling revelations.\n       To understand what Jim Stewart has done, you need to \n     refresh your memory on what the Clintons have variously \n     claimed and insisted. The Clintons have insisted, for \n     example, that they were only passive investors in Whitewater, \n     and had virtually nothing to do with it themselves.\n       Hillary Clinton. We gave whatever money we were requested \n     to give by Jim McDougal. I mean, he was the one who would \n     say, ``Here's what you owe on interest, here's what your \n     contributions should be.'' We did whatever he asked us. We \n     saw no records, we saw no documents.\n       Ted Koppel. The Clintons insist that they have fully \n     cooperated with the investigation of Whitewater, but that \n     they have been dogged by one unproved allegation after \n     another.\n       President Bill Clinton. That's really the story of this for \n     the last four years. An allegation comes up and we answer it, \n     and the people say, ``Well, here's another allegation. Answer \n     this.'' And then, ``Here's another allegation. Answer this.'' \n     That is the way we are--we're living here in Washington \n     today.\n       Ted Koppel. And only a couple of weeks ago, after the FDIC \n     released a report prepared by Jay Stevens, a former \n     Republican U.S. attorney not known to be friendly toward the \n     Clintons, there was this.\n       Mark Fabiani [Associate White House Counsel]. This report \n     blows out of the water the allegations that have been made \n     about the First Lady and the Rose Law Firm, and it undermines \n     the contention of those who would extend these Whitewater \n     hearings endlessly on into the future.\n       Ted Koppel. That may be as good a place as any to introduce \n     Jim Stewart, the author of ``Blood Sport,'' in his first \n     television interview on the book, and let me have you respond \n     right away, because the White House is obviously very proud \n     of the fact that Jay Stevens, Republican, no friend of the \n     Clintons, supervised a report by the FDIC which, in effect, \n     according to the White House, found the Clintons blameless in \n     the--in the Whitewater affair. Is that an overstatement?\n       James Stewart [Author, ``Blood Sport'']. Well, I think the \n     White House reaction is misplaced optimism. The report is \n     good news, as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. It \n     explicitly says that it's not the definitive report on many \n     of the questions that have arisen here, and there is still an \n     independent counsel investigating all of these and even more \n     allegations. As long as the independent counsel investigation \n     continues, a real threat hovers over this President.\n       Ted Koppel. Why or how do you explain the fact that Jay \n     Stevens, who, as I say, has no particular love for the \n     Clintons, why would he end an investigation if, as you say, \n     it's incomplete?\n       James Stewart. He was retained to investigate the narrow \n     question of whether the government should sue the Clintons or \n     others to regain losses from Madison Guaranty, and he \n     concluded there was no evidence to warrant a suit against the \n     Clintons or the Rose Law Firm to do that, and I think that's \n     the right conclusion. I do not conclude that Madison Guaranty \n     losses flowed to the Clintons.\n       Ted Koppel. What then, do you conclude, that--I mean, try \n     and give it to me in a broad sense. What is it that you would \n     say if you were obliged, in 15 or 30 seconds, to summarize \n     what is troublesome about Whitewater and what will still come \n     back to haunt the Clintons?\n       James Stewart. Well, I think the Whitewater investment and \n     the story of that is important because it shows many things \n     about the Clintons. It shows their willingness to hold \n     themselves to the standards that everyone else has to meet. \n     It shows their willingness to abide by financial requirements \n     in obtaining mortgage loans. But I think, most of all, it \n     shows their willingness, while in Arkansas, to accept the \n     favors of people who were regulated by the state.\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\n       Their attitude to this, which bordered on the negligent in \n     the beginning, clearly indicated a mindset which said, \n     ``Somebody else will take care of us because of our power as \n     highly elected officials in the state of Arkansas.''\n       Ted Koppel. In a sense, Jim, that's a negative way of \n     saying the same thing we heard Mrs. Clinton say at the \n     beginning of this broadcast. In other words, let somebody \n     else take care of this. She put, in a more positive sense, \n     i.e., ``We had nothing to do with this. If Jim McDougal came \n     and said, `You owe so-and-so-much in interest,' we paid it, \n     but we never saw documents, we never had an active role in \n     this Whitewater affair.'' To which you would say what?\n       James Stewart. Well, that simply isn't true. I think it may \n     have been true in the very beginning of the investment, when \n     there were still high hopes that this would make money and \n     the McDougals could handle everything, but by 1986, when the \n     McDougal empire was crumbling, it was not true. At that \n     point, Mrs. Clinton essentially took, singlehandedly, the \n     control of this investment. She was the one who negotiated \n     the loan renewals with the bank that held the mortgage. She \n     was the one who handled all the correspondence. She was the \n     one who went over all the numbers. She had possession of all \n     the records.\n       Ted Koppel. It is your contention that she vastly inflated \n     the value of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater.\n       James Stewart. That's correct.\n       Ted Koppel. Correct?\n       James Stewart. As I'm sure anybody who has ever applied for \n     a mortgage knows, you have to disclose your assets in such a \n     financial disclosure statement, and there are warnings on \n     these forms to be honest about this, to be accurate, to be \n     careful, not to use uncertain judgments, because to inflate \n     that can be a federal crime. And yet Mrs. Clinton valued \n     Whitewater at $100,000 on a 1987 financial disclosure \n     document, right after the bank itself had visited the \n     property and concluded the most generous estimate for their \n     half-interest would be $52,000.\n       Ted Koppel. So when you're talking about a $100,000 \n     evaluation, you're not talking about the value of the whole \n     property, but the Clinton's half-interest?\n       James Stewart. They valued their half-interest at $100,000.\n       Ted Koppel. I ask you this question advisedly, reminding \n     our viewers that you have some experience as a lawyer. Is \n     that a crime?\n       James Stewart. It is a crime to submit a false financial \n     document. In fact, their partners, the McDougals, are on \n     trial in Little Rock this week for having submitted false \n     financial documents to financial institutions. But to prove a \n     case like that, a prosecutor would have to prove that it was \n     knowingly a false submission. We haven't heard an explanation \n     from either Mrs. Clinton or the President about that \n     document, and that ultimately would be a question for a \n     prosecutor and a jury to decide.\n       Ted Koppel. I bring you back, Jim, to what we heard the \n     President say just a few moments ago, again, at the top of \n     this broadcast, sort of this--this cry of ``What in heaven's \n     name are we supposed to do? Somebody makes an allegation, we \n     respond to the allegation. Somebody makes a new allegation, \n     we respond to that allegation.'' This sounds like another one \n     of those allegations. How do you respond to--to what the \n     President is saying?\n       James Stewart. Well, I don't think these allegations would \n     be coming out, or the revelations, in this kind of slow, \n     drip-by-drip process, if the White House and the Clintons had \n     been forthright from the beginning, when this first surfaced \n     in the campaign. Get the story out. They came to me, or they \n     sent someone to me, allegedly because they wanted to get the \n     whole story out, and they had been advised at the time--and I \n     told them the same thing--that to stop these inquiries, get \n     in front of the story. Tell us what happened, and don't leave \n     holes in the story. Be complete. Err on the side of \n     completeness, and if people are bored, they can ignore it. \n     But that has never been the strategy they have employed.\n       Ted Koppel. Let's take a short break, Jim. When--we come \n     back, we will talk about what Vince Foster knew about \n     Whitewater and a number of other subjects.\n       [Commercial break.]\n       Ted Koppel. And back once again with Jim Stewart.\n       You begin with the suicide of Vince Foster, and clearly \n     believe that his suicide is pivotal to understanding \n     everything that's happened to the Clintons in--in subsequent \n     months and years. Have you reached any conclusion as to why \n     he committed suicide?\n       James Stewart. Well, first of all, there was the things \n     [sic] he enumerated in--in the note that he wrote, and I \n     think foremost among those was probably his concern about the \n     handling of the firing of employees in the travel office, but \n     what I think I can contribute that's new is that there were \n     things bothering him that were so serious he didn't dare \n     write them in his note, he didn't confide them to his wife. \n     He was worried about his marriage. He was very much enmeshed \n     in what we now know as Whitewater, and he knew of things that \n     hadn't come to light that could prove embarrassing. He was \n     concerned about the deterioration of his relationship with \n     the First Lady, and I think there's a good chance he knew of \n     the problems that Webster Hubbell was about to face, given \n     his handling of clients in the Rose firm.\n       Ted Koppel. When you talk about Web Hubbell, I should point \n     out, first of all, Vince Foster, Hillary Clinton, Web Hubbell \n     had all been partners at the--at the Rose Law Firm together. \n     Web Hubbell then came with the Clintons to Washington, was \n     briefly the assistant attorney general of the United States, \n     and you write that in the months before Vince Foster \n     committed suicide, that he went over to Web Hubbell's house \n     and went down in the basement to look at what?\n       James Steward. Well, there were files in Web Hubbell's \n     basement that had been removed from the Rose Law Firm during \n     the campaign by Web Hubbell and Vince Foster. Web and Vince, \n     during the campaign, went through the Rose Firm and removed \n     anything that they thought might be controversial or create \n     problems for the campaign, and this including many of the \n     billing records relating to Hillary Clinton's work for \n     Madison Guaranty and other matters. And one day Vince Foster \n     went over and he and Web Hubbell got into the basement, they \n     went to the boxes, and they went through those materials \n     looking for these particular files, which they did get and \n     turn over to the First Lady. But also in those files were \n     all of this other material, including a lot of the \n     Whitewater material, bank records from Whitewater, and the \n     billing records, as I mentioned before.\n       Ted Koppel. Is it--is it your impression that Vince Foster \n     then took those billing records to the White House, to his \n     office?\n       James Stewart. It's certainly a possibility. I don't know \n     for sure, and nobody's said they recalled him taking \n     documents out of the basement. But those documents in the \n     basement were later all turned over to the Williams and \n     Connolly firm after they learned that Web Hubbell had all \n     these documents, and they supposedly turned all those \n     documents over to Congress. So these records did not surface \n     there. So that suggests to me that somehow, between their \n     first being removed from the Rose firm to their being \n     discovered, they were in Vince Foster's office.\n       Ted Koppel. Talk to me for a moment about--about \n     Travelgate, but first of all, let's take a look at something \n     the First Lady said, I believe in her interview with Barbara \n     Walters, about the whole Travelgate affair.\n       Hillary Clinton [``20/20'']. I think that everyone who knew \n     about it was quite concerned, and wanted it to be taken care \n     of, but I did not make the decisions, I did not direct anyone \n     to make the decisions, but I have absolutely no doubt that I \n     did express concern, because I was concerned about any kind \n     of financial mismanagement.\n       Ted Koppel. Mrs. Clinton presents herself in that interview \n     as exercising a sort of passive role. ``Yes, I may have \n     expressed some concern about but I certainly didn't initiate \n     it.'' There is a memorandum by David Watkins, I believe. Tell \n     the story of that memorandum, because it, of course, suggests \n     something totally different, but the White House itself \n     ultimately produced that memorandum and made it available. \n     Why is that significant?\n       James Stewart. Well, the facts, as I discovered, on the \n     travel office affair, are as follows. I learned, before the \n     production of this memo, that in fact, whatever her own \n     personal belief about this is, Mrs. Clinton was the first \n     person to suggest to David Watkins that these people be \n     replaced.\n       Ted Koppel. David Watkins being?\n       James Stewart. He was the head of management in the White \n     House and was the person in charge of personnel in the White \n     House, including the travel office.\n       Ted Koppel. Right.\n       James Stewart. She was the first one to say to him, ``We \n     need our people in this office.'' Did she literally say \n     ``Fire them''? No. But the implication seemed very clear to \n     him and to everyone else who spoke with her, and that's what \n     set in motion the chain of events that led to their being \n     fired.\n       Ted Koppel. But the--the memorandum that David Watkins \n     wrote to his own file about all of this, and about falling on \n     his sword for the First Lady, is a memorandum that the White \n     House itself, after all, made available. Now, that certainly \n     puts them in a good light, doesn't it?\n       James Stewart. Well, I don't think so. First of all, that \n     memorandum had been under subpoena for a considerable period \n     of time. The independent counsel, the predecessor to Kenneth \n     Starr, had subpoenaed that particular document. Meanwhile, I \n     think the White House was aware that all this information was \n     soon going to be made public. I have no idea how they found \n     it, when they did, or why they decided to--to make it public \n     when they did, but I do know that the week before that, I and \n     my fact checker were checking the details about the First \n     Lady's involvement in the travel office affair with the White \n     House press office, with people in the White House, and had \n     even faxed them material that dealt with this very subject, \n     and almost immediately after that the memo itself appeared.\n       Ted Koppel. What you're suggesting, Jim, is that because \n     you indicated that something about this was going to be in \n     your book that they then decided to--to make it public before \n     it became public in your book?\n       James Stewart. Well, as I said, I don't know why they did \n     it. All I can say is, I had all this information in the book, \n     we were fact-checking this information with the White House, \n     so the White House knew this information was going to be in \n     the book and shortly after that the memo appeared. But I'm \n     sure the White House will say that no, that had nothing to do \n     with it.\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\n       Ted Koppel. Let's take another short break. An inside peek \n     at the White House damage control operation when we come \n     back.\n       [Commercial break.]\n       Ted Koppel. There was, Jim Stewart, considerable debate \n     going on within the White House, you discovered, about how \n     much to reveal, when to reveal it, how cooperative to be, and \n     at one point there is a--a line that I suspect is going to be \n     a rather devastating line that the First Lady uttered in \n     reference to all of this.\n       James Stewart. Well, you're--you're right. The--there was \n     internal advice, especially from David Gergen, to turn \n     everything over, and this was seriously considered until the \n     First Lady interrupted at one point and said, ``Well, you \n     know, I'm not going to have people poring over our documents. \n     After all, we're the President,'' suggesting that, by virtue \n     of grandeur and power of the office, that they somehow should \n     not have to endure such an experience.\n       Ted Koppel. The key questions, I think, ultimately may \n     become not so much what happened during Whitewater, but what \n     happened in more recent months, in terms of either covering \n     things up or not being as forthcoming with information. There \n     is one story that--that you uncover having to do with the \n     Paula Jones story, this is the young lady who charged sexual \n     harassment against then-Governor Clinton, and the--and the \n     Arkansas state troopers who were then guarding Mr. Clinton. \n     What is that all about?\n       James Stewart. Well, I think it's well-known at this point \n     that the troopers surfaced with some accounts of their \n     experiences while in the security detail of the governor. \n     What I think hasn't gotten much attention is that before \n     these reports were published, and before the troopers \n     actually made the final decision to reveal what they claim to \n     know, there was pressure applied to them to try to get them \n     not to speak out, and I think the most significant example of \n     this came when the President of the United States himself \n     called one of these troopers and offered him a federal job. \n     That trooper subsequently decided not to participate. He was \n     not one of the troopers who subsequently did tell stories to \n     anyone, so if the goal of that job offer was to get this \n     trooper to remain silent, it worked.\n       Ted Koppel. Is there not one trooper who, in fact, ended up \n     with a federal job?\n       James Stewart. The head of the governor's security detail \n     did end up with a federal job, but the trooper who heard \n     directly from the president and decided not to participate \n     did not accept it. He said he didn't--didn't want one of \n     these jobs, he wanted to stay in Little Rock.\n       Ted Koppel. Now, again, let me draw on some of your \n     experience as a lawyer. If, indeed, that could be--that could \n     be proved true, the charge that you--that you make in your \n     book, that would be a federal crime, would it not?\n       James Stewart. Well, that, again, could be a federal crime. \n     I think the--the issue here is was a job offered explicitly \n     in exchange for something else?\n       Ted Koppel. Let me ask you--and I realize this--this may be \n     the most difficult question I ask you of all--after having \n     written a book that is 400 pages-plus, how do you--how do you \n     reduce it to a conclusion as to culpability, lack of \n     culpability, whether this is a story that has just been \n     blown way out of proportion, whether it is simply being \n     kept alive for partisan reasons now and is--is doomed to \n     do so for the rest of this year because there is a \n     presidential election and because, you know, for the \n     Clintons, the unfortunate timing that your book is coming \n     out right now--how do you summarize everything you've \n     learned?\n       James Stewart. Well, my interest is not partisan, and my \n     interest is not narrowly was a law broken. I think to sum up \n     the whole book is a study in the acquisition and wielding of \n     power, and in the end, it's a study of the arrogance of \n     power, what people think they can do and get away with as an \n     elected official, and then how candid and honest they are \n     when questioned about it. I think that is what it reveals, I \n     think, most significantly about the Clintons.\n       Ted Koppel. And--and to those who say, has all of this \n     investigation, the congressional investigations, the \n     independent prosecutors, the time that you have spent in \n     putting this book together, you know, was the--was it all \n     worth all the money and the time and the effort and the pain?\n       James Stewart. I think, in the end, we'll find that it was, \n     that the truth is important in our society, that justice is \n     important in our society. I don't think you can put a price \n     tag on those things. Yes, it's terribly expensive, and at \n     times it seems very wasteful, and at times it's nasty and \n     it's partisan. It often is a blood sport, as Vince Foster \n     said. But why is that? It's 'cause the truth was never \n     honored in the first place, and I hope if there's any lesson \n     that comes out of that, that people in the future will \n     recognize that.\n       Ted Koppel. Jim Stewart, thank you.\n       I'll be back in a moment.\n       [Commercial break.]\n       Ted Koppel. The controversy over ``Blood Sport'', this \n     book, will be the subject of a segment on ``Good Morning \n     America'' tomorrow.\n       That's our report for tonight. I'm Ted Koppel in \n     Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2408-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2411-S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC RANGELANDS MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, today we debate a bill of tremendous \nimportance to my State and to many Americans who draw their livelihood \nfrom the land. I am speaking specifically about ranchers, that often \nmaligned group of individuals who have played such an enduring role of \nthe development and prosperity of our Western States over the years--\nand individuals they are.\n  It is difficult to conceive of a greater distortion than the \ncontinuing ugly portrayal of those in my State being described as big-\ntime cattle barons, Cadillac cowboys, few in number and great in wealth \nand rapacity and greed. The reality is far, far different. There are \nmore than 25,000 ranchers whose livestock grazes on these western lands \nall over our Western States.\n  In Western and Midwestern States, more than 50 percent of all beef \ncattle graze these lands at one time or another during the year. If \ncattle were driven from these lands--and this administration seems to \nadvocate that; that has been the pressure from them--large numbers of \nranchers would surely go out of business. That is the stark reality. It \nis also a very cynical and deceptive canard that alleges that if this \nbill were to pass, public access to these Federal lands would be simply \ncut off. Instead, this bill reaffirms that use of these public lands \nfor nongrazing purposes, shall continue in accordance with State and \nFederal law, already in effect.\n  I am very pleased to support this bill. So many have worked so hard. \nI commend the occupant of the chair, Senator Domenici, and so many \npeople who have worked so hard. My colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nCraig Thomas, has done a yeoman's task, and does it well.\n  I support Americans who make their living off the land. I support a \nhealthy environment. Who does not? I get tired of that argument. Good \nLord, I have lifted more lumber on the environmental laws when I was a \nState legislator than half the people who bark and howl at the moon in \nthis place. I support public access to our public lands. I support the \nprinciple of multiple use, an unknown description to several people in \nthis body. It is indeed impossible to believe that we cannot pursue all \nof these objectives simultaneously, which this bill does.\n  What I do not support is this one-size-fits-all solution for local \nproblems. These are issues which very much require a rich participation \nin the form of the expertise and concerns of the local people, those \nwho are closest to the problems and those who, I might say, care the \nmost and are affected the most. It makes little sense for the beltway \nenvironmentalists to have veto power over the common sense and \nexperience of those who have lived and worked and grubbed that land \nfrom nothing for generations.\n  Mr. President, this bill is moderate and balanced and inclusive and \nfair, and yet it is being described by certain special interests as a \nsinister, venal, even Republican conspiracy--we have had some good \nbipartisan support on this issue through the months--to turn back the \nclock on environmental protection. That shows up, I guess, in focus \ngroups. That is not what this is. This charge is preposterous and made \nby people who do not want to stop with simply regulating the proper \nrole of livestock on the public lands. It is made by people who would \nabandon all concept and principle of multiple use altogether.\n  Let there be no mistake here--the groups opposing this bill hold as \ntheir ultimate goal the outright abolition of livestock from public \nlands. Let us be very clear. I believe that is very evident in slogans \nsuch as ``cattle free in '93,'' which was gleefully chanted into the \nvapors with such fierce conviction, less than one Presidential term \nago, as the type of genuine extremism which has played too great a role \nin this debate.\n  From a purely scientific perspective, there is not a scintilla of \nevidence demonstrating that responsible grazing has been detrimental to \nthe rangelands--not one--rather, an ever-growing body of scientific \ndata suggesting it has been\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\na critical component--critical component--of good range health. It is \nalso irrefutable that the range is in far better condition today than \nit was 40 years ago. That is not my opinion. That is according to the \nForest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n  The condition of the public lands is the best it has been in this \ncentury. Yes, we have more cattle grazing on these lands, but we also \nhave more elk, deer, antelope, and even coyotes. We take good care of \nthem, too. How can this be so? The good stewardship of our ranchers, \nthat is how.\n  Mr. President, I want to just briefly show some photographs. They are \nrather remarkable. The first, I think, if you can discern--these are \nunique in their own historical context because the top ones on each of \nthese panels were taken in 1870 by the renowned William Henry Jackson \nduring his photographic survey of the Wyoming Territory. He was working \nfor the USGGST, the U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the \nTerritories at the time. This same expedition eventually reached the \nYellowstone area. When he got to Yellowstone, he took some \nextraordinary photos that were so influential in gaining national park \nstatus for Yellowstone National Park in that spectacular region.\n  He, along with Thomas Moran, the artist, upon returning with the \nmaterial and presenting it to the Congress in 1872, formed Yellowstone \nPark as a pleasuring ground for the enjoyment of the American people. \nYou would never know that, as people forget the organic act. That is \nwhat it was set up for.\n  When these photographs were taken, all of the pictured lands were \nFederal. They were all owned by the Federal Government.\n  But here we are, and over 100 years later, then Prof. Kendall \nJohnson, of the Range Science Department at Utah State University, \nattempted to exactly re-create the location and the exact point from \nwhich Jackson set up his extraordinarily cumbersome equipment. And with \nthe great plates and the weight of them and hauling them through the \nWest--which was a feat in itself--he re-created Mr. Jackson's photos as \na means of studying the condition of rangelands in Wyoming. I am \nindebted to him for the use of these photographs that were published in \nhis book called ``Rangeland Through Time.''\n  Some of the lands pictured in the lower panels are Federal and some \nare private, but all of them are livestock grazed. Every single photo \nin the lower area is being livestock grazed, all of them.\n  So the top photograph here shows land about 50 miles north of \nRawlins, WY.\n  This photo was taken in 1870, August 28, about the same time that the \nSun family started ranching there. It looks as if the original ranchers \ntook some pretty tough-looking country to decide to work on, but they \nhave been right there ranching ever since that picture was taken.\n  If you look at the bottom photo just taken a few years ago, the exact \nsame location, you will see the fruits of their stewardship. Do not \ntell me about environmental devastation wrought by selfish and greedy \nranchers. We see trees, cottonwoods. We see extraordinary vegetation, \nhay lands. That is it, right there. This was the way that God had it. \nGod has had some helpers.\n  These two photos then were taken on the Laramie River about 5 miles \nnorth of Wheatland on August 10, 1870. The top photo was taken in 1870 \nand the bottom was taken over 100 years later. You will notice that the \nriparian habitat has been so lush that you cannot even see the river. \nHere it is in the original form, and here it is 20 years ago. Here is \nthe riparian habitat, and this is all grazing country. As I say, you \ncannot even tell where the river is because of the lushness of the \ngrowth. Again, do not tell me our ranchers do not understand good \necomanagement.\n  The next pair of photos were taken about 40 miles south of Douglas, \npretty rugged country, the same respective time as the previous pair of \nphotos, August 12, 1870. Now, this is a real one--notice the pine and \nthe growth, and here is one taken almost 100 years later. Look at the \ntrees, look at the pine. All of this is grazing land. Look at the \ngrass. This is just rock. Here is grassland, and here is all of this \nbeing grazed for decades. Do not tell me, again, about ranchers \ndevastating the land.\n  Another pair of pictures, the fourth, showing this widespread \nphenomenon, same timeframe, 1870, August 20, northwest of Douglas, WY. \nThe scene shows a treeless and barren landscape. There it is and there \nis the camp. People were camping there, probably the first white people \nto go through--not the first humans. This entire area is near the old \nBozeman Trail, Ft. Laramie, up past Ft. Phil Kearny, into Montana. Of \ncourse, it was just 5 years after this, on June 25, 1876, that Custer \nhad his rather unfortunate occasion at Little Bighorn. At the bottom we \nsee, again, 100 years later, the grasses are lush and thick, trees are \nabundant by prairie standards--cottonwoods, water, grasslands, all of \nit grazed.\n  It was not a Ph.D. in ecomanagement that resulted in this recovery. \nRather, it was the common sense of ranchers who depend for their \nsurvival upon the health of these lands. When your family depends on \nyour stewardship, you pay awful close attention, very, very close \nattention.\n  Finally, two photos taken on the North Platte River. This was the \narea of several great Indian struggles in the history of my State, \nsouthwest of Casper, WY. A young man named Caspar Collins was killed in \nan Indian skirmish there. In 1870, these lands were totally overgrazed \nand treeless; August 25, 1870. By 1986, they had recovered to become \nwell grassed, with riparian habitat abounding. Here is the same photo. \nHere is water. Here are trees, cottonwoods, native grasses, hayfields, \nirrigation. So do not tell me about ranchers being poor stewards of the \nland.\n  I always like to ask environmentalists what it is they find so \nappealing about my beautiful State of Wyoming where I am a fifth \ngeneration. My grandfather came to this rugged country in 1862 through \nFt. Laramie. He was with the Conner expedition, and he ended up going \nup that trail to Ft. Phil Kearny and was there during what was called \nthe Fetterman massacre. He was a sutler. That is a chap who sells \ntobacco, boots, and booze to the soldiers. He was good at that. \nFincelius G. Burnett. He was there when this great historical battle \ntook place. Then he lived in what was called Fremont County, and he \nbecame the boss farmer of Chief Washakie. One of the great Shoshonie \nleaders of all time had my great grandfather as his boss farmer. That \nis what he called him. He even gave him land on the reservation. He \nsaid, ``I will not take it because it will cause you a lot of pain in \nthe years to come,'' and my grandfather deeded it back. It was a good \nthing to do because the lands that are there now that did go into \nprivate hands have caused some pain.\n\n  I ask these environmentalists about Wyoming and what they find so \nappealing about our great State. The answers I always get reference \nsuch things as rugged, natural beauty, the wildlife, the clean streams, \nthe clean air, and great fishing. I say, well, how in Heaven's name do \nyou think it has managed to stay that way all these years? Somebody \nmust have been taking care of it. I tell them that we have been engaged \nin land use activities for over 100 years. How do you think Wyoming has \nmanaged to remain the natural jewel that it is? It is because those of \nus that live there refuse to let it become ripped and ruined and torn \nto bits. It is because those citizens who depend upon these lands for \ntheir livelihoods have taken such good care of them over time. That is \nhow.\n  When you are a Republican from Wyoming, you get accused of some very \ninteresting things on the issue of the environment. But I was in the \nState legislature for 13 years. In the State legislature we put on the \nbooks the toughest mine land reclamation law in the United States, in \nthe largest coal-producing State in the United States, Wyoming; the \ntoughest Clean Air Act, which was six times more stringent than the \nFederal Clean Air Act; a Clean Water Act; a Plant Sighting Act which \nsaid, if you are going to come and set up a great type of structure \nhere, an infrastructure, you will see to it that you address the \naccompanying social and domestic problems. We made them cough up the \nfront end money. That is what I did when I was in the legislature.\n  I do tire of the paternalistic approach of people who come up to me \nand ask\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nabout saving the State that we already saved. We get a little tired of \nthem hanging around. In this kind of debate, they all use the same fax \nmachine, and all the organizations that chop you to shreds all having \ninterlocking boards of directorate. They really are something. They all \nlive pretty well, a lot of them on inherited wealth. If they do go to \nwork, they find out what the rest of us find out: Work is healing, \ntherapeutic and keeps your mind off cows messing around on the riparian \nbank and streams. It clears the air. I want that to happen. I get tired \nof that paternalistic business.\n  Mr. President, it is no accident that our public grazing lands, each \nparcel of which is the responsibility of the lessee, are in such good \nshape today. We have other areas of our planet which are not in good \nshape, where people have ripped, ruined and torn it up, whether in the \noceans, the mountains, or the plains. And this bill puts the powerful \ntool of self interest to work in favor of the environment instead of \nagainst it. It recognizes the basic law that its opponents seem not to \nunderstand--that the worst thing in the world for the environment is \nnot mining, logging, ranching, or multiple use; the worst thing in the \nworld for the environment is poverty.\n\n  Look at every past civilization of the Earth; before disappearing \ninto the vapors of history when they have finally used up every \nresource, cut the last tree, shot the last deer, caught the last fish, \noverpopulated the entire system, their last contribution is a \ndevastated environment. That is what happens. Travel anywhere in the \nworld to any impoverished developing country and you will see the truth \nof that. You may even come to understand that one of the most important \nhuman rights is the right to a job. I know that sounds evil. But that \nis a great human right--the right to work, the right to make a living.\n  So I can tell you what will happen. Here is one for the greenies to \nmull as they are sitting there having a little chardonnay by the \ncampfire with their pals singing songs, of course, in the evening. Here \nis one for the greenies to mull: What do you think is going to happen \nwhen these old cowboys lose their grazing permit, lose the ability to \nuse that land which they have been using for 60, 70 years? I will tell \nyou. Do not miss this scenario. You lose the permit, you gather the \nkids around--some of them are downtown, or maybe they are working at \nthe courthouse, or wherever they are--and make the decision to sell the \nplace. Then start talking to your pals on the county commission, those \ncounty commissioners that you helped elect, and they will direct you to \nthe zoning and planning commission; go to the zoning and planning \ncommission, and they will say, Yes, we have a subdivision regulation \nthere, you bet; go to the old local civil engineer and draw up the \nplans for the subdivision; and then sell the property for a subdivision \nin the midst of this magnificent kind of country, just so you can do a \nsilly thing--eat. And then instead of cows for those same greenies to \nworry about--as they slosh the chardonnay on their shoes--they can \nworry about people messing up the area--a few hoof prints beside the \ncreek will then start to look pretty good compared to septic tanks and \nleach fields. That is exactly where this one is going. So get involved \nin the great emotion of it, and watch these wily, canny people, who do \nnot like to starve to death, pedal off their land and remove even the \nSun family--Kathleen, Bernard, Dennis and the rest--perhaps, after 5 \ngenerations--remove themselves from ranching and decide to sell it and \nspend the winters in Arizona and the summers on that magnificent part \nof the ranch they kept for themselves. If anybody cannot understand \nthis is what will happen, the drinks are on me.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Wyoming for \ntelling how it really is. I thought his graphic pictures portrayed an \nawful lot of America that, unfortunately, few Americans see. The \nSenator's reference to those that would like to see something different \ndone to that part of the American west, while explicit in its reference \nto the comfort around the fire and the chardonnay, I think reflect an \nunrealistic reference, if you will, to the responsibility that we have \nin this body to recognize the significance of grazing, as we know it \ntoday.\n  As chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, Energy and Natural \nResources, I rise to support the substitute, S. 1459, which has been \noffered by Senator Domenici, the Public Rangelands Management Act.\n  While the livestock grazing issue is not significant in my State, \nthere is reindeer grazing on Bureau of Land Management lands under \nregulations specific to Alaska and some cattle grazing on Fish and \nWildlife Service lands on Kodiak Island. In the lower 48 States, \nhowever, livestock grazing is a part of western society. It is part of \nthe history, and the heritage, of the American West. And it's a part of \nthe social fabric of the West and a cornerstone of the western economy.\n  Because I understand the importance of livestock grazing to the rural \nwestern economy, to the ranching community and to the family structure, \nI want to lend my support to this important legislation and encourage \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support S. 1459.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, and as one of the three elected representatives of the State \nof Alaska in Washington, I have a strong interest in our Nation's \nnatural resource and public land management policies. I believe the \npublic lands in my State and in the lower 48 States contain abundant \nnatural resources--timber, coal, oil and gas, minerals, and other \nrenewable assets--that can be used to sustain the economic engine of \nthis great country of ours. Our public lands are also a valuable \nrecreational resource--they are used for hunting, fishing, camping, \nriver running, bird watching, back-packing, skiing, off-road vehicle \nuse, and other recreational uses. The fact is, our public lands are \ntaking a great deal of pressure off our national parks for Americans \nwho want to enjoy an outdoor experience.\n  And just as Alaskans are willing to allow their resources to be used \nprudently to better the future for Alaska's children and grandchildren, \nI believe American are wiling to use America's resources for the \nbenefit of future generations. I do not believe a majority of Americans \nsupport locking up our public lands for preservation purposes. As \nchairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I am \nobligated to speak out for responsible use of our public lands and \nnatural resources in a way that I believe makes the most productive use \nof those lands and resources for all Americans.\n  One of the reasons I support S. 1459 is because of my concern about \nthe Clinton administration's general attitude regarding public land use \nand, more specifically, about Secretary Babbitt's regulations and \npolices regarding activities on the public lands to conduct timber \nharvesting, livestock grazing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment. There is an alarming trend toward driving traditional \npublic land users--timber harvesters, ranchers, oil and gas drillers, \nand miners--off the public lands.\n  At least in the case of the oil and gas and mining industries, good, \nhigh-paying, long-lasting jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in \ninvestment capital are being forced overseas because of a hostile \nattitude toward resource development on public lands. Also lost with \nthose jobs and investment capital are untold millions of dollars in \npotential tax revenues and mineral receipts to the Federal Government \nand the States. Thousands of good, high-paying jobs in the timber \nindustry have been lost, and are not likely to be recovered again. That \nis happening in the southeastern portion of my own State.\n  For the livestock industry, however, the story is different. Ranchers \nhave been using the public lands for generations to make a living for \nthemselves and their families. We are not talking about high-\ntechnology, high-paying jobs. We are talking in some cases about folks \nwho are just able to eke out a living and pay their bills. The job is \ntough, the hours are long, and the pay is poor, but because many of \nthem are fourth or fifth generation ranchers, they want to keep up the \ntradition, run their cattle or sheep, and live the simple lifestyle out \nin the open space of the West.\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\n  The ranches are not being forces overseas like the oil and gas and \nmining industries. They are simply being run out of business \naltogether--driven off the public lands like the cattle or sheep they \nherd--by an administration and an Interior Secretary hostile to their \nway of living. They're being run off the public range and ridiculed as \nrelics of the past. They're criticized for receiving what some claim is \na subsidy.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about subsidizing and preserving \nthe way of life for ``cute little German farms in Bavaria'' as one of \nmy colleagues recently observed, we're talking about members of western \nsociety who are making a substantial contribution to their local and \nState economies, to the Federal Treasury, and to the feeding of tens of \nmillions of people who consume their products every day.\n  What Secretary Babbitt set in motion with his Rangeland Reform 1994 \nregulations is symptomatic of a broader attitude toward public lands \nuse and natural resource development from his Department. Secretary \nBabbitt's attitude seems to be ``lock up the public lands, keep them \npreserved for posterity's sake, and do not worry about all the lost \njobs and economic benefits--we can get all those people retrained so \nthey can be productive members of society again.''\n\n  What is troubling about that kind of attitude, Mr. President, is that \nit is elitist. It is elitist because it tells Americans that their \npublic lands should be used only for the enjoyment of the \npreservationists and no one else. It says, ``the heck with the \nranchers, the miners, the oil and gas drillers, the timber cutters and \nthe others who want to use the public lands to make a better life for \nthemselves, their families, or their country.'' It also says, ``the \nheck with the people who want to recreate, and hunt and fish on the \npublic lands.''\n  In the case of livestock grazing, that approach takes away the \nlifestyle so many people have freely chosen, despite the hard work and \nlow pay. It takes away a portion of the western culture. it takes away \na pillar of the West's economy. It takes away revenues to the Federal \nTreasury and to the States whose education systems and public services \nrely so heavily on the public lands.\n  There is one aspect of the grazing debate that I appreciate more than \nsome of the others because of my experience as a former banker. And \nthat is how difficult it is now for ranchers to secure lending to \nsupport their operations or to make improvements. More and more banks \nare asking tougher and tougher questions before they loan money to \nranchers because of the seeming instability of the livestock industry--\ninstability that is brought about by the regulatory malaise caused by \nSecretary Babbitt's rangeland reform regulations. More and more banks \nare denying loans because they believe livestock operations cannot be \nconducted profitably given the current regulatory climate. That is why \nwe need to act now to bring the stability ranchers and their lenders \nneed.\n  As for the substance of this legislation, Mr. President, S. 1459 \nstarts with the premise that public lands should continue to be used \nfor multiple use purposes. The No. 1 finding on page 3 of the bill \nsays, and I quote: ``multiple use, as set forth in current law, has \nbeen and continues to be a guiding principle in the management of \npublic lands and national forests.'' Multiple use is a guiding \nprinciple for public lands management now, and the bill says right up \nfront that multiple use will continue to be the guiding principle. It \nsays so throughout the bill. So any claim, Mr. President, that this \nbill establishes grazing as the dominant use of the public lands is \nfalse. That is one of the false claims we will hear over and again \nabout this bill, Mr. President, but such a claim has no basis in fact.\n  The multiple use foundation of this bill is further exemplified by \nthe explicit declaration that nothing precludes use of and access to \nFederal land for hunting, fishing, recreation, or other appropriate \nmultiple use activities in accordance with Federal and State law.\n  Environmental protection of public rangelands is ensured by S. 1459 \nin several ways. The bill states as its first objective the promotion \nof ``healthy, sustained rangeland.'' Another objective is to ``maintain \nand improve the condition of riparian areas which are critical to \nwildlife habitat and water quality.'' S. 1459 also calls for: the \nestablishment of State or regional standards and guidelines for \naddressing rangeland condition; consideration of the environmental \neffects of grazing in accordance with NEPA, the National Environmental \nPolicy Act; approval of cooperative agreements and coordinated resource \nmanagement practices for conservation purposes or resource enhancement; \nand penalties for failure to comply with permit terms and conditions or \nenvironmental laws and regulations. All of these provisions add up to a \nserious effort to protect the condition of the rangeland and to improve \nits condition where such improvement is needed.\n  A lot criticism has been directed at the public participation aspects \nof this legislation, Mr. President, and I want to explain what S. 1459 \ndoes in that regard. The bill makes absolutely clear that affected \ninterests will be notified of proposed decisions, and does nothing \nwhatsoever to prevent those interests from having dialogue with Federal \nland managers concerning management decisions on grazing allotments. \nThat is the case now and that has always been the case. The bill also \nmakes clear that those citizens whose interests are adversely affected \ncan appeal decisions of the land managers. Further, the bill gives the \ninterested public the opportunity to participate in Resource Advisory \nCouncils, the Grazing Advisory Councils, and the NEPA process.\n  What the bill does not do, Mr. President--much to the disappointment \nof Secretary Babbitt and the other opponents of this legislation--is \nallow anti-public lands or anti-grazing activists from Boston and \nelsewhere to micromanage and second-guess every single decision \nregarding grazing and what happens on each individual grazing allotment \nfor the price of a 32-cent stamp. Appropriate public participation in \npublic lands management decisions is healthy and constructive. We do \nnot have a problem with that, Mr. President. We welcome appropriate \npublic participation.\n  What we do have a problem with, however, is elevating in statute the \nlegal status of an individual who lives hundreds of miles away \nwho wants to dictate what happens on a grazing allotment out West, and \nwhose form of public participation consists of mailing a protest \npostcard to the land management agency. We do not need more lawsuits \nspawned by armchair quarterbacks who have never seen a grazing \nallotment. Nor do we need to have every single decision of the public \nlands manager second-guessed by self-proclaimed experts.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many other positive aspects of S. 1459 that \ndeserve mentioning. But my colleagues who have labored long and hard \ntrying to put together a grazing reform bill that can enjoy bipartisan \nsupport are anxious to speak to the many positive features of the bill.\n  I want to tell my colleagues about the process we have been through \nthis year on grazing reform, Mr. President, because I believe it is \nimportant that they know about the intense interest in this issue, and \neven more intense interest in passing legislation that will provide \nstability, certainty, and predictability for the foreseeable future. \nThis is such a contentious issue that we do not need to be revisiting \ngrazing every session of Congress.\n  Earlier last year, May 25, another grazing bill, S. 852, was \nintroduced by Senators Domenici, Craig, Brown, Campbell, Hatch, \nBennett, Burns, Simpson, Thomas, Kyl, Pressler, Kempthorne, Conrad, \nDorgan, Dole, and Gramm. Senators Baucus, Nickles, and Inhofe \nsubsequently joined as cosponsors.\n  A companion bill to that measure, H.R. 1713, was introduced in the \nHouse. The House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public \nLands of the House Resources Committee held a hearing in July.\n  A hearing on the Senate bill was held in June by Senator Craig's \nSubcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, and the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources reported the bill on July 19, 1995.\n  S. 852 was placed on Senate Calendar but went nowhere as a result of \napparent lack of sufficient support.\n  Following the August recess, a bipartisan effort was mounted to craft \na bill\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\nthat would address the deficiencies of S. 852 was initiated by several \nMembers on our side, Senators Domenici, Thomas, Kyl, Craig, and Burns, \nand included several of our Democrat colleagues, Senators Reid, Bryan, \nConrad, Baucus, Bingaman, and Dorgan.\n  After several weeks of staff discussions and Member involvement, a \nrevised bill was drafted that addressed some 16 areas where there \nseemed to be general bipartisan agreement. Shortly thereafter, the \nSenate began consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Grazing \nprovisions were not included the in Senate version of the Balanced \nBudget Act, but the House version did contain a handful of provisions, \nonly one of which would have produced revenues--the grazing fee \nprovision. In the end, the House receded to the Senate approach and no \nprovisions on grazing were included in the Balanced Budget Act.\n  On November 16, 1995, Senators Domenici, Kyl, Craig, Thomas, and \nBaucus wrote me to request that the Energy Committee consider the new \ndraft proposal, which was reported as S. 1459 on November 30.\n  In December and January, Mr. President, our side met with Democrat \nMembers and staff several times in an attempt to incorporate changes \ndesired by the Democrat Members in order to address concerns raised by \ntheir constituents and support this measure. We went what we believed \nwas the extra mile to address their concerns.\n  At the end of January, Mr. President, we had only five unresolved \nissues. We made clear to our colleagues that we could accommodate their \nconcerns on some of these issues. On a few others, we probably could \nnot agree because of fundamental differences in approach. However, we \nbelieved that the unresolved issues could be decided on the floor \nthrough the amendment process, Mr. President, which would allow our \ncolleagues to offer proposals to address the remaining issues on which \nwe seemed divided.\n  That brings us to where we are now, Mr. President. At a crossroad. We \nare at a crossroad with this grazing bill because we have gone about as \nfar as we can without harming what we believe are the legitimate \nconcerns of the livestock industry. We believe we have ample \nenvironmental safeguards in the bill, Mr. President, and more than \nadequate opportunity for public participation.\n  If our Democrat colleagues whose interests we have tried so hard to \naddress cannot support this bill now, Mr. President, it is not for a \nlack of effort on our part to accommodate their concerns. It is not \nbecause of sincere effort on our part to include them in the process of \ndrafting this legislation. And it is not because we did not seek their \ninput and ideas as to how we could make S. 1459 better legislation.\n  I would suggest Mr. President, that those who cannot support this \nlegislation--even though we have bent over backwards to accommodate the \ninterests of our western Democrat colleagues--are making their decision \nnot on the merits of the bill but rather on the basis of a desire to \nmake nonuse of the public lands the dominant use.\n  We're at a crossroad not only with this grazing bill, but also with \nthe administration's public lands and natural resources policies. We \ncan either choose between Secretary Babbitt's Rangeland Reform 1994 \nregulations, which will hasten the end of livestock grazing on the \npublic lands, or we can choose an approach that makes significant \nimprovements in the way livestock grazing is managed while allowing \nranchers to continue to graze cattle and sheep on the public range. The \nsame choice is true for other public lands use issues: We can either \nship our jobs, our capital, our mineral receipts, and our tax revenues \noverseas or we can keep them here and allow responsible use of our \npublic lands for resource development activities and other multiple-use \npurposes.\n  The choice for me is clear, Mr. President. On this one, I am going to \nside with the ranchers over the elitists. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, I support the Domenici substitute for three specific \nreasons. First, it is pro-environment. It is pro-family, and it is pro-\neconomy. The substitute contains, I think, significant provisions to \nprotect the great landscape of the American West that will lead to more \nmoney being spent to improve those rangelands specifically.\n  Furthermore, I think it keeps the families together, the families of \nrural America, the families out west, because it will allow them to \ncontinue what they have been doing for five and six generations--that \nis, producing livestock on the public lands for the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  Further, the Domenici substitute is pro-economy because it will \ngenerate more fees to the Federal Government and provide a stable \nregulatory climate for livestock production on the public lands, and \npreserve livestock production as an economic pillar, which it has been \non the rural communities of the West.\n  Now, Mr. President, you might wonder why a Senator from Alaska is \nspeaking on grazing issues. Well, it is not significant in my Western \nState of Alaska, although we do graze a significant herd of ``Santa \nClause's reindeer'' on public land. But it is really part of the \nhistory and heritage of the American West, a part of the social fabric \nof the West, and it is really a cornerstone of the western economy.\n  So I want to lend my support to this issue and this legislation. I \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nDomenici substitute because I understand and really appreciate the \nimportance of this issue to the West. I want to assure you that those \nwho have risen to speak on behalf of this amendment do as well, because \nthey are the ones ultimately accountable for their stewardship to their \nconstituents.\n  I have a strong interest in our Nation's natural resources, public \nlands, and management policies. I believe the public lands in my State \nand in the other lower 48, as we refer to them, contain tremendous \nnatural resources--our timber, coal, oil, gas, minerals, and other \nrenewable assets that can be used to sustain the economic engine of \nwhat made this country great.\n  I firmly believe that through science and technology, we can do it \nright, we can do a better job than we have done. I feel, in many cases, \nthe old rules relative to environmental oversight and various other \naspects of regulatory mandates are really out of date. We have had new \ntechnology come along. We are operating under the same rules, same \nregulations, and a very narrow focus, Mr. President, and a very narrow \ninterpretation. As we look at resource development, we are looking at \nworld markets.\n  We have the experience and expertise in the United States to do a \nbetter job, particularly with our renewable resources, and grazing is a \nrenewable resource. We could do a better job in the renewability of our \ntimber. But as we look at what is happening, we are depending on \nimports, such as imported beef and timber products, coming from \ncountries that do not have the same sensitivity and responsibility in \ndeveloping and maintaining the renewability of the resources that we \ndo.\n  So are we not being a little irresponsible to shed that \nresponsibility on other countries and simply look to importation? Well, \nI think we are. Just as we in Alaska are willing to allow our resources \nto prudently contribute to the future of those in our State and the \ngrandchildren that are coming along, I believe Americans are willing to \nuse America's resources and resource development to benefit future \ngenerations.\n  So I support Senate bill 1459 because of my concern about the current \nadministration's general attitude regarding public land use. More \nspecifically, it would be the regulations and policies of the Secretary \nof the Interior regarding activities on public lands to conduct timber \nharvesting, livestock, grazing, mining, oil and gas exploration, and \ndevelopment as well. I think, Mr. President, as we look a little \nfurther, we see an alarming trend toward driving traditional public \nland users--timber harvesters, ranchers, oil and gas drillers, and \nminers--off public lands. Where are they going?\n  We are driving those jobs out of the United States, we are sending \nour dollars overseas, and we are importing those products. As our \nPresident communicates concern over the loss of high-paying jobs and \noffsets that by more low-paying jobs, the realism is that many of these \nblue-collar jobs are high paying. But if we do not develop\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nour resources, we are not going to have them.\n  The Interior Secretary's approach seems to be to drive these good, \nhigh-paying, long-lasting jobs--hundreds of millions of dollars of \ncapital investment--overseas, all with no worry, so to speak, because \nwe will make up for those lost jobs somehow. Well, I think that is an \nattitude problem. As we look at oil imports alone, now we are currently \nimporting over 54 percent of the total crude oil that we consume. We \nare simply becoming more dependent on the Mideast. We are only perhaps \na terrorist act away from another oil crisis.\n  So, Mr. President, as we come back to the issue at hand, it is just \nnot about grazing; it is about utilization of the public land in a \nresponsible manner.\n  I think it is difficult for ranchers without this relief. As a former \nbanker, I think I can comment with some degree of accuracy on the \ncircumstances. It is difficult for ranchers to secure lending to \nsupport their operations and to make improvements that are needed. And \nmore and more banks are going to be tougher and tougher before they \nloan money to ranchers because of the seeming instability of this \nindustry and where it is going. That is brought about by the regulatory \nmalaise caused by the current administration's rangeland reform \nregulations. I have been told by some of my banker friends that they \nare denying loans because they believe livestock operations cannot be \nconducted properly given the economic uncertainty in the industry. I \nthink that is why we need to act now to bring stability that the \nranchers need and that certainly the lenders require.\n  That is another reason I support the Domenici amendment. As for the \nsubstance of the so-called substitute, the bill starts with the premise \nthat public lands should continue to be used for multiple use.\n  The No. 1 one finding on page 3 of the bill says: ``Multiple use, as \nset forth in current law, has been and continues to be a guiding \nprinciple in the management of public lands and national forests.'' \nMultiple use is a guiding principle for public lands management now, \nand the bill says right up front that multiple use will continue to be \nthe guiding principle. It says that throughout the entire bill.\n  So any claim, Mr. President, that this bill establishes grazing as a \ndominant use--that has been used time and time again in this debate--of \npublic lands is simply false, and it is inaccurate. This is one of the \nmany claims that we will probably hear over and over again in this \ndebate. But such claims simply have no basis in fact.\n  Next, I want to say how astounded I am that the Democratic substitute \nto be offered on the other side of the aisle says absolutely nothing in \ntitle I about protecting use, of and access to, Federal land for the \nexperience of hunting, fishing, recreation, watershed management, or \nany other appropriate multiple-use activity. The question is, why? I \nwonder if we are to conclude from our friends on the other side of the \naisle that they care only about these activities on national grasslands \nand not about such activities on the BLM or Forest Service rangelands. \nI hope that some of my colleagues will address that because I think it \nis a legitimate criticism.\n  Next, Mr. President, I want to emphasize again how compatible the \nDomenici bill will be with the environment. The bill states as its \nfirst objective the promotion of healthy, sustained rangeland. Another \nobjective is to ``maintain and improve conditions of repairing areas \nwhich are critical to wildlife habitat and water quality.''\n  The Domenici substitute also calls for the establishment of State or \nregional standards and guidelines for addressing rangeland conditions; \nconsideration of the environmental effects of grazing in accordance \nwith NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act; and approval of \ncooperative agreements and coordinated resource management practices \nfor conservation purposes.\n\n  Mr. President, all of these provisions add up to a very, very serious \neffort to protect the public rangelands and to improve their conditions \nwhere such improvements are needed.\n  So, Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot of criticism in this \ndebate about public participation in the grazing management process. \nBut, in my view, there are far more opportunities for public \nparticipation and a broader role for the so-called affected interests \nin the Domenici substitute than in the substitute which we will see \nfrom the other side.\n  Under the Domenici substitute, for example, for the first time the \npublic will be given the opportunity to comment on reports by the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture summarizing \nrange-monitoring data. This is a positive improvement and one that will \nnot be provided in the substitute from our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  What the Domenici substitute does not do, Mr. President, is allow \nout-of-State antipublic lands, antigrazing activists to simply \nmicromanage and second-guess every single decision regarding grazing \nand what happens on each individual grazing allotment for the price of \na 32-cent stamp, which, as you and I know, is possible now.\n  Appropriate public participation in public land management decisions \nis healthy. It is constructive. We do not have a problem with that. We \nwelcome appropriate public participation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is our hope that the Domenici substitute \nends the bureaucratic nightmare that livestock producers have been \nliving because of widely differing rules and regulations of not one, \nbut two Federal agencies--the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. \nForest Service. The Domenici bill would require coordination of \nlivestock administration between these two agencies. It would require \nthem to issue regulations simultaneously to address grazing on public \nlands.\n  Livestock producers need some degree of certainty. They need \nregulatory stability. We believe, Mr. President, that the Domenici \nsubstitute will provide that certainty and that stability.\n  I believe Senate bill 1459, as proposed to be amended by the Domenici \nsubstitute, will allow family ranchers to continue enjoying the \nlifestyle they have enjoyed for generations. It is hard work. It is low \npay and long hours. If you ask any one of the small family livestock \noperators, he or she will tell you that they would not want to do \nanything else or anything any differently. Are we going to take that \naway from them? I hope not.\n  We need to provide the proper regulatory climate to allow the family \nranchers to continue to earn their living on public rangelands. We need \nto continue to allow the livestock industry to make its vital \ncontribution to the rural economy of the West. We need to provide \nincentives for the livestock operator to keep caring about the land \nthat he or she lives on. Yes; ranchers are environmentalists, too. They \nhunt, they fish, and they recreate. They enjoy the outdoors on the \nlands in their areas just like others. The only difference is they know \nbetter how to take care of the land and how to preserve it. They have a \nvested interest in continuing to care about those rangelands because \ntheir rangelands are also their hunting grounds and their fishing \nstreams.\n  Mr. President, the Domenici substitute is good for the environment. \nIt is good for the family. It is good for the rural western economy. \nAnd it is basically good public policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Domenici substitute, Senate bill \n1459.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of that \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would suggest that those who cannot \nsupport this legislation for whatever reason, even though we have, in \nmy opinion, bent over backward to accommodate the interests of our \nwestern colleagues on the other side of the aisle, are making their \ndecisions, unfortunately, not on the merits of the bill but rather on \nthe basis of a desire to make nonuse of the public lands the dominant \nuse. Think about that, Mr. President. We are at a crossroads not only \nwith this grazing bill but also with the administration's public lands \nand natural resource policy. We can either choose between Secretary \nBabbitt's rangeland reform, the 1994 regulations, which will hasten the \nend of livestock grazing on public land, or we can choose an approach \nthat makes significant improvements in the way livestock grazing is \nmanaged while allowing ranchers to continue to graze cattle and sheep \non public land.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n  The same choice is true for other public land use issues. We can \neither ship our jobs, ship our capital, our mineral receipts, and our \ntax revenues overseas, or we can keep them here and allow responsible \nuse of our public lands for resource development activities and other \nmultiple-use purposes and to benefit, obviously, Americans who are \nlooking for and need those jobs.\n  The choice is clear on this one. I am going to side with the ranchers \nover the elitists. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2411-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

JENNINGS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to \ncommemorate the long and distinguished life of Peter A. Jennings, an \noutstanding American who passed away last November.\n  Peter Jennings was born June 9, 1911, in the small town of \nBridgewater, SD, and passed away on November 3, 1995, in Fort Meade, \nSD. Throughout his life he was very dedicated to his family, his \ncommunity, and his work.\n  As a father and husband, Peter epitomized the term ``family values.'' \nHe spent his life taking care of his family by always putting their \nneeds and concerns first. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Anita \nSessions Jennings, his son Thomas Jennings, and his sisters Bernadette \nStoltz and Irene Rotert. As an active member of his community, Peter \nwas constantly working to improve the quality of people's lives. He \nbelonged to the DAV, VFW, American Legion, Catholic Order of \nForresters, the Retired Officers Association, and the Knights of \nColumbus.\n  Peter served in the U.S. Army for much of his life, including 26 \nyears of service at four VA medical centers in Fort Meade, SD; \nKerrville, TX; Indianapolis, IN; and Hines, IL.\n  During my travels as a U.S. Senator, I am constantly humbled by the \npeople of my State and the basic principles by which they live their \nlives: a love of family, an obligation to community service, and a \nstrong commitment to an honest day's work. Peter A. Jennings lived by \nthose principles, and we remember him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2417-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATION OF LTG MICHAEL RYAN, U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Air Force Times (March 25, 1996 edition) \ncontains a story entitled ``Senate Delays Ryan Nomination.'' The story \nstates that Lieutenant General Ryan's promotion to a fourth star ``is \nbeing delayed in the Senate according to congressional and military \nsources.'' The story adds that the ``reasons for the delay were unclear \nas of March 15, but sources said Ryan's involvement in the Buster \nGlosson affair in 1994 may be tied to the delay.'' With no foundation \nwhatsoever, the story then links me to this action by stating: ``The \naftertaste of the Glosson struggle has remained bitter, especially for \none of his ardent congressional supporters, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.''\n  That is absolutely inaccurate.\n  In the first place, I strongly support the nomination of Lieutenant \nGeneral Ryan for his fourth star and have not been involved in any \nhold. Lieutenant General Ryan was nominated on February 26, 1996 and \nfavorably reported by the Committee on March 12, 1996. I am confident \nthat he will be confirmed by the Senate and I urge the Senate to act \nimmediately to confirm this fine officer.\n  Second, when I was chairman of the Armed Services Committee in 1994, \nduring Lieutenant General Ryan's previous nomination, I took the lead \nin ensuring that Lieutenant General Ryan was confirmed. That was at the \nsame time we were considering the issues regarding Lieutenant General \nGlosson's retirement. Lieutenant General Ryan was nominated on July 12, \n1994, approved by the Committee on July 27, 1994, and confirmed on \nAugust 25, 1994.\n  Third, when our committee issued its report on the Glosson matter, I \nensured that the following material was placed in the committee report, \nciting the special panel we had established:\n\n       The Panel Report specifically states: ``We wish to be \n     absolutely clear that in our view Generals Nowak, Ryan, and \n     Myers were truthful in their testimony to the IG \n     investigators and to us.'' The Panel notes that ``the \n     reputation of these men for veracity and integrity is \n     unimpeachable.''\n       The Panel Report also observes: ``Generals Nowak, Ryan, and \n     Myers acted with the utmost integrity in reporting what they \n     considered to be inappropriate attempts to influence a \n     promotions board and in asking to be excused from service on \n     that board. Their actions in this regard were proper and \n     helped maintain the integrity of the Air Force promotions \n     system.''\n       The committee concurs with these views. The committee notes \n     that its favorable recommendation on the nomination of \n     Lieutenant General Glosson is based upon his overall record \n     of service and does not imply any reservation about the \n     Panel's findings with respect to Lieutenant General Nowak, \n     Lieutenant General Ryan, and Major General Myers.\n\n  It is simply wrong to suggest ``the aftertaste of the Glosson \nstruggle has remained bitter'' for me. On the contrary, I have worked \nhard to ensure that those, like Lieutenant General Ryan, who did their \nduty in the Glosson matter have not been adversely affected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2417-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2417-S2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPEAL OF MANDATORY DISCHARGE OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WITH HIV\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am especially gratified that the Senate \nvoted yesterday for fairness and against bigotry by repealing the \nprovision in the recent Department of Defense Authorization Act \nrequiring the mandatory discharge of members of the Armed Forces who \nare HIV-positive.\n  Yesterday's Senate action clearly demonstrates that this misguided \npolicy's days on the statute books are numbered. The Senate looked at \nthe facts and listened to the Nation's military and medical leaders, \nand not a single Senator was willing to defend the mandatory discharge \nprovision.\n  The reality is that military personnel with HIV are serving their \ncountry effectively and should be allowed to continue to serve. They \nmay not be fighting on the frontlines, but they are still dedicating \nthemselves to serving our country.\n  A few examples prove the point. One of the persons affected is a \nsenior enlisted man in the Navy. He is a gulf war veteran who has \nserved over 17 years. During that time, he has earned numerous \ndecorations, including two Navy Achievement Medals and four Good \nConduct Medals. Yet under current law, this sailor will be discharged \nbefore receiving the retirement he worked so hard and honorably to \nearn.\n  Another affected service member is an Army sergeant. This soldier has \nserved for over 15 years, receiving outstanding evaluations and a \nchest-full of medals. He fears for the fate of his wife and newborn \nchild if he is dismissed from the service before his retirement.\n  Another member of the Armed Forces, a Navy woman, has served for 7 \nyears, consistently receiving top evaluations.\n  It is fundamentally unfair that these and hundreds of other \nproductive service members will all have their careers cut short for no \nvalid reason.\n  Magic Johnson has not served in the military. But he is living with \nHIV. He has shown America that people with HIV do not have to sit on \nthe bench. They can participate, and even be stars. In a recent article \nin the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Johnson appealed to us to give the same \nopportunity to service members with HIV that his fellow athletes gave \nhim. He wrote:\n\n       Service members with HIV are in the Army, Navy, Air Force, \n     and Marines. They are shipbuilders, military police, \n     trainers, recruiters, sonar technicians, communications \n     specialists, engineers, researchers, administrators, and \n     more. They are American men and women who want to work hard \n     and be part of the toughest military in the world. They live \n     to serve--and they shouldn't be a casualty of prejudice.

Mr. President, last week, the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee completed a long and, unfortunately, contentious \nmarkup of S. 1423, the Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act \nthat amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.\n  While I am very aware of the importance of not overburdening \nbusinesses with mountains of paperwork and regulation, I am also \ncognizant, as a cosponsor--along with my old friend Senator Jacob \nJavits--of the legislation that created OSHA, of the important need to \nprotect the health, safety, and lives of employees.\n  Much of the debate and discussion that took place during Labor \nCommittee hearings and markups was really over the balance between \nprotections for employees and burdens on employers. During one \ncommittee hearing on the topic, a businessman testified in support of a \nproposal that would prohibit fines on a business if it were to be found \nin substantial compliance with OSHA regulations. The witness went on \nsay that substantial compliance ``does not mean perfection or even near \nperfection. It does mean better than average.''\n  Mr. President, I would not expect perfectly safe conditions or \nperfect health protections for myself and we probably should not \nattempt perfection under OSHA rules. We should not, however, settle for \nbetter than average safety. I am sure that none of my colleagues would \nfeel comfortable flying on an airline that advertised as having better \nthan average safety. Would any of us feel comfortable using a piece of \nmachinery or operating an electrical device knowing that there was an \naverage chance of being electrocuted or being injured? I do not believe \n``better than average'' is good enough for America's workers.\n  Another concern of mine centers on the ability of workers to request \non-site inspections by OSHA. I recently received some interesting \nmaterial from the Rhode Island Committee on Occupational Safety and \nHealth [RICOSH]. One of these cases is a good example of the value of \nOSHA inspections.\n  Without an onsite inspection, problems that occurred at a \nNarragansett, RI jobsite may well have taken a different turn. During \nconstruction, workers noticed that the temporary support structure for \na poured concrete floor had become dangerously overloaded. The workers \nplaced a call to OSHA. At first, the owner and his engineer and \narchitect all insisted that the 2 x 4's would support a concrete slab. \nInstead, they suggested to OSHA that the deflection was the result of \nmoist sea breezes causing the support timers to swell combined with \nexpansion caused when the Sun warmed one side of the timbers. At first \nglance, these all sound like credible explanations. Upon inspection, \nMr. President, it was learned that structural calculations were based \non a 2\\1/2\\ inch concrete slab. In reality, the slab was 3 inches \nthick. Obviously, the inspection was the key to discovering the actual \ncause of the deflection in the concrete slab. Just imagine the number \nof injuries and even deaths that may have taken place if because of a \nphone or fax interview, instead of an inspection, OSHA had determined \nthat the culprit was sunny days and humid nights.\n  Mr. President, I feel that I also must comment on the commotion \nduring the last markup session. After approving three very good \namendments--two Democratic and one Republican--by voice vote on the \nfirst day of the markup, the committee was asked to vote again on the \namendments at the beginning of the last markup. Unfortunately, all \nthree of the votes were along party lines and two of the previously \napproved amendments failed. I regret very much that this commotion took \nplace and hope that in the future, cooler heads prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2418-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2418-S2419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION METRICATION: A YEAR END REPORT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the Metric in Construction 1995 Year End Report by the \nConstruction Metrication Council of the National Institute of Building \nSciences located here in Washington, DC.\n  I found the information outlined in the ``Status of Federal \nConstruction Metrication'' chart to me most interesting. In many \nportions of the Federal Government, projects have been constructed in \nmetric for 2 years or more and, contrary to the beliefs of many, the \nsky has not fallen in.\n  I also recommend the rest of the council's report to my colleagues. \nAs the report says, 93 percent of the world's population uses the \nmetric system. I continue to believe that the United States will remain \nat a competitive disadvantage with our global trading partners until we \njoin that 93 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Metric in \nConstruction 1995 Year End Report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Metric in Construction 1995 Year End Report\n\n       Almost all federal construction programs are now converted \n     to the metric system and most agencies are designing and \n     constructing projects in metric units.\n       So reported over 20 federal agency representatives at the \n     November 1995 meeting of the Construction Metrication Council \n     (see the agency-by-agency status report on pages 3 and 4). \n     Building on years of work by the nation's voluntary codes, \n     standards, trade and professional construction \n     organizations--and with their support and participation--\n     federal construction is providing the catalyst for the long-\n     awaited metrication of the nation's construction industry.\n\n\n                              the numbers\n\n       Government is a major player in the construction industry \n     by virtue of its role as provider of highways, bridges, dams, \n     water and sewer systems, parks, prisons, military bases, \n     space centers, laboratories, embassies, courthouses, schools, \n     and numerous other public facilities. Federal appropriations \n     for construction, including grants to state and local \n     governments, total about $50 billion annually. In 1996, over \n     $20 billion in construction will be designed in metric units \n     and up to $10 billion more put out for bid. By the year 2000, \n     metric construction will approach the $50 billion federal \n     total, not including billions more in state and local \n     matching funds.\n       Annual U.S. construction expenditures are about $500 \n     billion yearly with roughly one-half allocated to commercial, \n     institutional, industrial and civil works and the other half \n     to homebuiding. Thus, within a few years federally funded \n     metric construction will amount to about 20 percent of all \n     nonresidential construction, with state and local metric \n     construction adding substantially to that percentage.\n\n\n                               the impact\n\n       American architectural, engineering, and construction firms \n     already use metric measures in their overseas work, and \n     government's buying power rapidly will expose the remainder \n     of nonresidential construction to the metric system. Given \n     this as well as the rapid globalization of the construction \n     industry (just look at the multilingual packaging with metric \n     measurements on the shelves of your local hardware store), \n     nonresidential construction is likely to convert to the \n     metric system within a decade or so. Homebuilders, who are \n     involved in virtually no foreign or governmental work but are \n     nonetheless closely intertwined with the rest of the \n     construction industry, probably will adopt metric measures a \n     few years later.\n       Of course, the metric transition could take place faster, \n     as it has in other countries, or, given America's ambivalence \n     toward the metric system, slower. But 93 percent of the \n     world's population uses metric measures and it is only a \n     matter of time before the U.S. construction industry, which \n     accounts for 6 million jobs and 8 percent of the gross \n     national product, joins the nation's automobile, health care, \n     and electronics industries (among others) in completely \n     converting to the metric system.\n       When it does, metrication will bring more than efficiency \n     and better quality control to construction: it will benefit \n     every American by helping our nation compete more effectively \n     in the global marketplace.\n\n\n                              the results\n\n       Hundreds of millions of dollars in federally funded metric \n     projects have been placed under construction in the past \n     three years and the results speak for themselves. As noted in \n     the last Metric in Construction newsletter:\n       Conversion has proven to be much less difficult than \n     anticipated.\n       There has been no appreciable increase in design or \n     construction costs.\n       Architects and engineers like working in metric units.\n       Tradesmen adapt readily to metric measures on the job site.\n       Construction and product problems have been minimal.\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\n       However, three product-related issues have surfaced to \n     date:\n       Reinforcing steel (``rebar''). The rebar industry first \n     promoted and then withdrew a metric standard but not before \n     most state highway departments had adopted it in their \n     standard design drawings, at significant time and expense. \n     The rebar industry currently is balloting, through ASTM, a \n     new metric standard and hopes to unify everyone behind it \n     over the next year or so.\n       Recessed lighting fixtures. Several lighting manufacturers \n     opposed the introduction of modular metric recessed fixtures \n     for use in modular metric suspended ceiling systems. Such \n     fixtures proved to be readily available from other \n     manufacturers, however, and now the opposing manufacturers \n     are supplying them too. All other suspending ceiling \n     components, including T-bars, lay-in tiles and air diffusers, \n     are available from a variety of manufacturers in modular \n     metric sizes.\n       Concrete masonry block. Block is also a modular material, \n     but modular metric (so-called ``hard metric'') block is \n     slightly smaller than current inch-pound block. The block \n     industry, as represented by the National Concrete Masonry \n     Association, argues that producing and keeping an inventory \n     of two sizes of otherwise identical block is costly and, in \n     many cases, too costly for the smaller producers that \n     constitute the bulk of the block industry. The industry \n     further argues that inch-pound block can be economically cut \n     to fit any dimension, inch-pound or metric, and that the \n     specification of metric block is therefore both unnecessary \n     and economically damaging to block producers.\n       In response to these concerns, the General Services \n     Administration, in its July 1993 Metric Design Guide, \n     encouraged the allowance of either inch-pound or metric block \n     in metric projects. The Construction Metrication Council \n     endorsed GSA's position in the September-October 1993 Metric \n     in Construction newsletter. Since then, contractors have had \n     difficulty obtaining bids on metric block in a number of \n     instances. The Council therefore strongly encourages \n     designers to allow the use of either inch-pound or metric \n     block or to specify nominal wall thicknesses only, thereby \n     leaving the decision to the contractor, with cost the \n     deciding factor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                    construction metrication council\n\n   (English is the international language of business.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 40th \nanniversary of the independence of the Republic of Tunisia. Since \ngaining independence from France on March 20, 1956, Tunisians have been \ndedicated to pursuing a path of progress.\n  Although this small North African country has limited natural \nresources, it has shown great initiative by successfully devoting a \nmajority of its assets to promoting its people and developing its \neconomy, stressing education as the key to its future. The private \nsector has contributed greatly to the economy and, as a result, \nTunisians have created a diversified, market-oriented economy. While \nthe United States has assisted the Tunisian economy through focused \ndevelopment programs, Tunisia has been able to advance beyond our \nassistance and is quickly approaching an era of economic partnership \nwith us.\n  The friendship between the United States and Tunisia dates back \nalmost 200 years when our two countries signed a friendship treaty. \nSince that time, we have had an outstanding relationship marked by \nrespect, cooperation, and a mutual commitment to freedom and democracy. \nWe have a strong military alliance, routinely engaging in regular joint \nexercises and program exchanges. Strictly defensive in nature, the \nTunisian military force is among the best trained and most professional \nin the Arab world. Like the United States, Tunisia is dedicated to the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts and has participated in many \npeacekeeping operations around the world.\n  Despite the volatile situation in North Africa, Tunisia has played a \nkey role in preserving stability and peace. Further, they have been at \nthe forefront of the struggle against terrorism, intolerance, and blind \nviolence. They have appealed to the world community through various \norganizations, including the United Nations, to adopt strict measures \nin order to combat terrorism and extremism.\n  In addition, Tunisia has played a significant role and is a key \nsupporter in securing peace in the Middle East. They were the first \nArab State to host a multilateral meeting of the peace\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\nprocess and to welcome an official Israeli delegation in Tunis, thus \npromoting a dialog between Arabs and Israelis. Since that initial \nmeeting, they have hosted two other events and are scheduled to host \nothers. As a result of their efforts, in January of this year, Tunisia \nand Israel agreed to establish formal diplomatic relations.\n  Earlier this week, Tunis served as the host city for the Joint \nMilitary Commission meeting, further demonstrating their dedication to \npeace in the Middle East and reinforcing the cooperation between the \nUnited States and Tunisia.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate our friends in Tunisia on \nsuccessfully achieving this milestone and commend them for their \npeacekeeping efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2419-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2420-S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FORTY YEARS OF TUNISIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, legend has it that more than 200 years ago, \nthe bey of Tunis, as token of esteem and friendship, sent one of his \nfinest stallions to U.S. President George Washington. Unfortunately, \ncustoms officials in the nascent republic denied entry to the horse, \nwhich spent its remainder of its days in the port of Baltimore. After \nthis somewhat rocky start, I am happy to report that U.S.-Tunisian \nrelations have improved considerably. Today, in fact, marks the 40th \nanniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Tunisia as an \nindependent country, a time during which Tunisia has enjoyed a strong \nand healthy relationship with the United States. Today I wish to \ncongratulate Tunisia for its many accomplishments, and to highlight \nsome of the instances of cooperation between our two countries.\n  In recent years, Tunisia has taken positive steps towards the \nestablishment of a more democratic system of government. Although the \nruling party continues to dominate the political scene, Tunisia has \nmade an effort to broaden political debate, including recent passage of \nan electoral law that reserved 19 seats of the National Assembly for \nmembers of opposition political parties. Because the government has \nplaced a high priority on funding social programs, today Tunisia has \nliteracy and life expectancy rates that are among the highest in the \nregion. I hope that the United States will continue to work with \nTunisia on efforts such as these to open up the political process and \nto improve the living standards of the population. This should help \nTunisia to overcome some of the difficulties it continues to encounter \nin balancing secular and Muslim interests in the country.\n  Tunisia also has a very impressive economic record. In the last 10 \nyears, the government has turned to economic programs designed to \nprivatize state-owned companies and to reform the banking and financial \nsectors. As a result, Tunisia's economy has grown at an average rate of \n4.5 percent over the last 3 years, and its economic success has had a \nbeneficial impact on Tunisia's international standing. Tunisia joined \nGATT in 1990, and in 1995, the government signed a free-trade accord \nwith the European Union.\n  In contrast to some of its Arab neighbors, Tunisia has achieved \nparticular success in the promotion of women's rights. Under the \ndirection of President Ben Ali, the number of Tunisian women and girls \nreceiving an education--up through the university level--has risen \ndramatically. Women are protected under the law from forced early \nmarriages and domestic violence. I applaud these steps and urge the \nTunisian government to continue its efforts to expand personal freedoms \nfor all of its citizens.\n  Tunisia and the United States have also explored ways to cooperate on \ninternational security issues. In fact, the 14th Annual Joint Military \nCommission of Tunisia and the United States met in Tunis over the last \n2 days. Tunisia also has played an active role in U.N. peacekeeping \nmissions, contributing military contingents to operations in Cambodia, \nSomalia, the Western Sahara, and Rwanda.\n  Finally, Tunisia has been a welcome force for moderation I the Middle \nEast peace process. The government has taken an active role within the \nArab community in promoting better ties with Israel. In April of this \nyear, Israel and Tunisia will establish official interests sections to \nfacilitate political consultations, travel, and trade. Tunisia has \ncondemned the recent suicide bomb attacks in Israel and has called for \ngreater international efforts to fight terrorism.\n  As I alluded to earlier, the relationship between the United States \nand Tunisia goes back nearly 200 years, to the very beginnings of \nAmerican independence. Tunisia was among the first to recognize the \nUnited States as a sovereign country. As Tunisia celebrates the 40th \nanniversary of its own independence, I ask my colleagues to join me in \noffering a sincere expression of congratulations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today Tunisia celebrates its 40th \nanniversary of independence from French colonialism. I want to join in \ncongratulating Tunisia on its social and economic accomplishments of \nthe last 40 years, and to thank the Tunisians for their historic \nfriendship with America.\n  Two years ago I visited Tunisia with Senator Simon and Senator Reid. \nInitially, our visit was planned to meet with President Ben Ali, who at \nthat time was President of the Organization of African Unity. However, \nwe quickly learned that Tunisia itself is a story of many other \nachievements as well.\n  As a small, secular Muslim country, nestled between two major, \nunstable powers, Libya and Algeria, Tunisia is playing an important and \npositive role in international politics. Because of its geography, it \nis a member of both the Middle East and Africa, and I am impressed how \nit has taken an active position in both regions.\n  In 1982, after Yasir Arafat was driven from Beirut, Tunisia opened \nits doors and hosted the Palestinian Liberation Organization for 14 \nyears. I believe that Tunisia's secular and developed society had a \nmoderating influence on Arafat, which was a critical factor in \nlaunching the Middle East peace process. Likewise, it is no surprise to \nme that Tunisia was the first Arab country to host a U.N. multilateral \nmeeting in connection with the Middle East peace process, or that it \nwill be among the first Arab countries to establish formal diplomatic \nrelations with Israel next month.\n  Tunisia has also tried to help mediate some of the conflicts between \nits neighbors in sub-Saharan Africa. President Ben Ali served as \nPresident of the Organization of African Unity at a time when the OAU \nwas being re-vitalized as a regional organization, and he helped begin \npreparations for a conflict resolution center at the OAU. Just this \nweek, Tunisia hosted a regional conference on the Great Lakes which \naddressed the heated conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi, and the effects \nof refugees in Central Africa.\n  Tunisia has also, by necessity, been at the forefront of the \ninternational struggle against terrorism. Out of geographic necessity, \nit has worked diligently and consistently in international efforts \nagainst violence and extremism. Indeed, despite the terrorist threats \nit faces from Algeria and Libya on all its borders, Tunisia still \nattended the recent international conference on terrorism in Sharm-el-\nShekh, and re-affirmed its commitment to moderation.\n  I believe Tunisia needs to be supported for these important steps. It \nis an invaluable partner as we form alliances for the 21st century. But \nTunisia should also be congratulated for its economic and social \nachievements. In many areas--particularly family planning, \nopportunities for women, education, and economic reform--Tunisia can \nprovide a model of development in the Mediterranean.\n  When I was in Tunisia, I was greatly impressed by the government's \ncommitment to family planning and the development of opportunities for \nwomen. Tunisia is one of the world's success stories in family \nplanning: birth control is widely available for those who desire it, \nand government clinics are focussed on promoting women's health. This \nwas a very far-sighted and constructive decision by the government. As \na result, the country has been able to harness the potential of most of \nits population, and, not coincidentally, has made significant economic \ngains.\n  Because of these effective programs, Tunisia was graduated from \nUnited States assistance, and is now entering\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nan era of partnership with the United States. Indeed, in many ways, \nTunisia is a fine example of a foreign aid success.\n  Tunisia has great potential for leadership in the 21st century. But \nit is a country facing severe security risks. As we appreciate its \naccomplishments of the last 40 years, we must commit to do what we can \nto ensure Tunisia will continue to develop politically and \neconomically, and enable it to continue to support United States goals \nof stability and democracy in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2420-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to \nannounce the realization of another component of our initiative to \nprevent violence against women--the National Domestic Violence Hotline. \nAt that time, I indicated that I would come to the floor every day for \n2 weeks, whenever my colleagues would be kind enough to give me about \n30 seconds of time, to read off the 800 number to the hotline.\n  The toll free number, 1-800-799-SAFE, will provide immediate crisis \nassistance, counseling, and local shelter referrals to women across the \ncountry, 24 hours a day. There is also a TDD number for the hearing \nimpaired, 1-800-787-3224.\n  Mr. President, roughly 1 million women are victims of domestic \nviolence each year and battering may be the single most common cause of \ninjury to women--more common than auto accidents, muggings, or rapes by \na stranger. According to the FBI, one out of every two women in America \nwill be beaten at least once in the course of an intimate relationship. \nThe FBI also speculates that battering is the most underreported crime \nin the country. It is estimated that the new hotline will receive close \nto 10,000 calls a day.\n  I hope that the new National Domestic Violence Hotline will help \nwomen and families find the support, assistance, and services they need \nto get out of homes where there is violence and abuse.\n  Mr. President, once again, the toll free number is 1-800-799-SAFE, \nand 1-800-787-3224, for the hearing impaired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2421-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is with much pride that I rise \ntoday to recognize the 160 members of the Coronado High School \nThunderbird Band who will be representing North America in the Russian \nRepublic's Freedom Day Parade this May. These gifted student musicians \nfrom El Paso will travel to Moscow this spring to celebrate the rise of \ndemocracy there and to share their extraordinary musical talents with \nthe people of Russia.\n  It was last September when Richard Lambrecht, the students' band \nconductor, received the phone call from the Russian Ministry of \nCulture, inviting the Coronado students to perform in the Freedom Day \ncelebration held annually in Red Square. Since that moment, the \nstudents, their parents, and their avid supporters have been working \ntirelessly, day and night, to raise the necessary funds for this once-\nin-a-lifetime trip and to maintain their exceptional grade point \naverages.\n  This recognition is a fitting testament to the dedication, character, \nand talent of these Texas teenagers. But it is not the first honor the \nThunderbird Band has received. In fact, the band has received the \nSudler Flag and the Sudler Shield for both concert and marching \nperformance by the John Phillip Sousa Foundation. These awards are \ngiven to only two bands annually, representing the best in the United \nStates for that year. Coronado is one of only three bands to have ever \nreceived both designations.\n  In addition to honoring the Thunderbird Band for this achievement, I \nwould also like to welcome both Alexander Demchenko, the Russian \nMinister of Culture, and General Victor Afanasiev, the Russian General \nConductor, to the United States. These two officials will be visiting \nthe Coronado students on March 27 in El Paso. The Republic of Russia \nhas generously offered to finance a portion of the band's traveling \ncosts, and I would like to thank them for their country's cooperative \nefforts in making this trip a reality for the Coronado students.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the Coronado High School \nThunderbird Band will represent the people of Texas, the United States, \nand North America with both honor and distinction. I congratulate them \non this remarkable accomplishment, and I wish them the best of luck in \ntheir future endeavors.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2421-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2421-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.J.

For some 20 of those years I have been blessed with the able \nassistance of Laura Hudson, who completed her Senate service last \nAugust, as my legislative director and indispensable right hand.\n  In so many ways, Laura personifies the best tradition of Senate \nservice--beginning in one capacity and growing into so many more. The \nyoung history postgraduate, who took a legislative-\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\ncorrespondent position in my office in 1975, quickly grew beyond that \nand has been my invaluable counsel on a variety of legislative \nchallenges over the years.\n  There are parks and preservation projects, in Louisiana and beyond \nwhich exist solely because of the personal commitment and legislative \nskill of Laura Hudson, whole regions of the globe, such as Micronesia, \nroutinely neglected by many in the Congress, receive a respect and \nrecognition in Washington due heavily to Laura's devotion. That \ncomponent closeup program, which brings hundreds of students and \nteachers each year from the former trust territories of Micronesia, is \nbut one example of Laura's passion.\n  Moreover, I am convinced that the relationship between our country \nand many of the developing and emerging economies, such as China, \nVietnam, and Indonesia, profit in immeasurable ways from the \nunderstanding and leadership of staff persons such as Laura.\n  This is a woman, Mr. President, who has forsaken many opportunities \nin the private sector because of a deep belief in the merits of public \nservice, and a belief in the simple tenet that she could make a \ndifference. More often than we acknowledge, it is the Laura Hudsons who \nmade a qualitative difference in our daily work product. In honor of \nher unparalleled contributions, I am introducing this legislation \ntoday.\n  I know that Laura will continue to contribute, as only she can, to \npublic policy. But I will miss her in a way immediate and direct, as \nwill so many of her longtime colleagues in the Senate. But I know they \njoin me in expressing appreciation and best wishes as Laura enters an \nexciting new chapter of her life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LAURA C. HUDSON VISITOR CENTER.\n\n       The visitor center at Jean Lafitte National Historical \n     Park, located at 419 Rue Decatur in New Orleans, Louisiana, \n     is hereby designated as the ``Laura C. Hudson Visitor \n     Center.''\n\n     SEC. 2. LEGAL REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in any law, regulation, paper, record, map, \n     or any other document of the United States to the visitor \n     center referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Laura C. Hudson Visitor Center''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Thurmond, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1628. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, relating to \nthe copyright interests of certain musical performances, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      MUSIC LICENSING LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would \nlift a burden off of small businesses who currently pay fees to music \nlicensing organizations under a complicated and cumbersome copyright \nlaw.\n  Introduction of this legislation reflects what I consider a fair \nposition. This bill acknowledges the different sides, and aims to reach \na compromise position. This legislation comes after hours and hours of \nnegotiations with different interests over the course of several \nmonths.\n  Under current law, music licensing organizations are permitted to \ncollect fees from those who play a radio or television in their \ncommercial establishment. The music may be background music, or it may \nbe music played at half-time during a football game. The music license \nfee applies to shoe stores, to diners, to shopping centers or any other \nbusiness establishment.\n  The artists who create this music certainly deserve compensation for \ntheir intellectual property. In fact, those artists are compensated for \ntheir labors. When a song is played over a radio or TV, the broadcaster \npays for the rights to play that song. When we are at home, and we turn \non the radio, we are not expected to pay a second fee. Yet, if a radio \nis played at a commercial establishment for no commercial gain, a \nsecond fee is charged for the music. This double-dipping smacks of \nunfairness.\n  In addition, there is tremendous inequity in the way licensing \ncompanies assess these fees. The businesses are unable to see a list of \nthe songs that are available for licensing. The businesses are unable, \nbecause of the market inequity, to bargain for a fair price. Instead, \nwe have an anticompetitive environment where two or three licensing \ncompanies control almost all of the music available. Small businesses \nhave two options: pay the preordained fee or turn off the radio or TV.\n  The approach I have taken to address this problem aims at leveling \nthis playing field. The legislation I am introducing would require the \nlicensing companies to make a list of their repertory available so \nbusinesses can know what products they are paying for.\n  The legislation would exempt small businesses from paying the fee for \nmusic played over radio and TV if a fee has already been paid. Where \nmusic has already been paid for by the broadcaster, the copyright owner \nhas in fact been compensated.\n  In addition, the legislation would establish arbitration to resolve \ndisputes over fees. As it stands, if a retail store wishes to contest \nthe fees paid to one of the licensing companies, they have to go to a \ncourt in New York. Moreover, full blown litigation in any case is often \nprohibitively expensive.\n  The legislation would require the music licensing companies to offer \nper period programming licenses--in other words allow radio stations to \npurchase licenses for shorter time periods instead of 24 hours a day if \nthey are only playing music in short spots between religious, news, or \ntalk shows. I hope my colleagues will join me in leveling the playing \nfield and will support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this bill from the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Religious \nBroadcasters, the National Restaurant Association, and the National \nRetail Federation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I would like to express our support for your \n     compromise music licensing legislation. NFIB believes this \n     proposal will resolve many of the serious problems that exist \n     between the small business community and the music licensing \n     societies--ASCAP, BMI and SESAC.\n       In a recent NFIB survey, more than 92 percent of small-\n     business owners called for music licensing reform. The time \n     has come for fairness in music licensing.\n       While your bill is different from S. 1137, it addresses \n     many of the issues that are of great importance to small \n     business owners. It allows small businesses to play \n     incidental music on radios and TV's without violating federal \n     copyright law. In addition, the measure gives small business \n     owners the right to arbitrate fee disputes in local forums \n     rather than forced to file a lawsuit in New York City. Many \n     small businesses across the country cannot afford the added \n     expense of traveling to New York City to dispute fees levied \n     by BMI or ASCAP. The legislation does protect the nine state \n     music licensing laws that have been enacted and the other 15 \n     states with legislation pending.\n       NFIB commends your efforts to fashion a workable compromise \n     and we look forward to working with you to enact music \n     licensing reform legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Donald A. Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              National Religious Broadcasters,\n\n                                     Manassas, VA, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: On behalf of National Religious \n     Broadcasters, I want to commend you and Senators Thurmond, \n     Faircloth, Helms and Thomas for introducing legislation to \n     address the inequities and abuses in the current system for \n     licensing copyrighted music. Our organization, which \n     represents over 800 religious broadcast stations and program \n     providers, is grateful for your leadership and is prepared to \n     support you in any way possible to pass this bill in the \n     104th Congress.\n       Legislation is badly needed to rectify the injustices \n     forced upon Christian radio by the entertainment licensing \n     monopolies, ASCAP and BMI. For years, our members who use \n     limited amounts of music in their programming have tried to \n     negotiate a fair license that would allow them to pay simply \n     for the music they play and not be charged as if they played \n     copyrighted works all day long.\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\n     In the face of monopoly powers granted to ASCAP and BMI by \n     the federal government, and in the absence of clear \n     Congressional policy to guide competition in the licensing \n     arena, we find we have no leverage with which to negotiate a \n     fair ``per program license''. Your bill goes a long way \n     toward solving that problem.\n       We also understand your bill will require the music \n     licensing monopolies to disclose in a practical and user-\n     friendly way the songs for which they have the rights to \n     collect royalties, and it will not allow ASCAP, BMI or any \n     other licensing organization to bring infringement actions \n     against music users for songs that are not listed in their \n     publicly available data bases. These provisions, together \n     with an effective per program license, are critical to \n     establishing music licensing rules that bear some resemblance \n     to a free market system.\n       In addition to our strong support for your bill, I also \n     urge you and your cosponsors to block any copyright-related \n     legislation in the Senate that does not incorporate music \n     licensing reforms. It would be unconscionable for Congress to \n     enact any measures that enhance the economic clout of the \n     music licensing monopolies without first correcting their \n     abusive business practices. In the view of religious \n     broadcasters, the current system essentially forces Christian \n     radio stations to indirectly subsidize immoral, violent and \n     sexually explicit entertainers--entertainers who reap \n     millions in royalties from the unfair blanket licenses small \n     religious broadcasters are forced to buy. Please see the \n     attached resolution passed by the NRB Board of Directors in \n     February in this regard.\n       Thank you again for taking a stand for fairness in music \n     licensing. In doing so, you're also making a stand for the \n     positive, life-changing power of religious radio. The \n     millions of Americans whose lives are enriched every day by \n     religious broadcasts are watching this issue very carefully.\n           Sincerely,\n     E. Brandt Gustavson, L.L.D., President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: On behalf of the National Retail \n     Federation and the 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments, I \n     am writing to support your compromise legislation to amend \n     federal copyright law to provide the nation's retailers with \n     protection against the arbitrary pricing, discriminatory \n     enforcement and abusive collection practices of music \n     licensing organizations.\n       Retailers of all sizes, particularly smaller establishments \n     in your state, are confronted daily by costly and \n     unreasonable demands from music licensing organizations. \n     These organizations have monopoly power to set rates and \n     therefore, retailers are frequently asked to pay outrageous \n     and unfair licensing fees to play music which is only \n     incidental to the purpose of their business.\n       Under your legislation, business establishments that use \n     radio or TV music with less than 5,000 square feet of public \n     space would be exempt from licensing fees as long as the \n     music was purely background or incidental to the purpose of \n     the business, and customers were not charged a fee to listen \n     to the music. While not all retailers are covered under this \n     compromise, we believe it represents significant progress. \n     Your bill also gives businesses the right to arbitrate fee \n     disputes in local forums rather than being forced to file \n     lawsuits in New York and requires music licensors to provide \n     consumers with full information about the music they are \n     purchasing.\n       Thank you for your leadership on behalf of America's Main \n     Street. Your efforts and those of your staff to provide \n     relief are greatly appreciated. We look forward to working \n     with you to enact this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 739,000 foodservice establishments \n     nationwide, we would like to express our support for your \n     compromise music licensing legislation. We believe this \n     proposal will resolve many of the serious problems that exist \n     between the business community and the music licensing \n     societies--ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.\n       As you know, your legislation represents major concessions \n     by the business community and is different from S. 1137, the \n     Fairness in Musical Licensing Act of 1995. More importantly, \n     however, you measure addresses many of the issues that are of \n     great significance to restaurateurs throughout the country. \n     These include:\n       Allowing for a logical expansion of current law to allow \n     small businesses to play incidental music on radios and TVs \n     without violating federal copyright law.\n       Giving businesses the right to arbitrate fee disputes in \n     local forums rather than being forced to file a lawsuit in \n     New York City.\n       Requiring music licensors to provide consumers with full \n     information on the product--the music--they are buying.\n       All of this is done while protecting the nine state laws \n     that have been enacted and the other 15 states with \n     legislation pending. As you know, S. 1619, introduced by \n     Senator Hatch would preempt all state music licensing laws. \n     It also, in our opinion, fails to address the number of the \n     problems that exist with the societies including arbitration \n     and access to repertoire.\n       Senator, as you know, restaurateurs from around the country \n     have faced harassment, frivolous lawsuits, and arbitrary and \n     onerous licensing fees. On behalf of the entire industry, we \n     want to thank you and your staff for the countless hours you \n     have devoted to reach a reasonable compromise. We fully \n     support your efforts and will work towards enactment of your \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Elaine Graham,\n                              Senior Director, Government Affairs.\n\n                                                    Katy McGregor,\n                               Legislative Representative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Brown, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Grams, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Smith, and \n        Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 1629. A bill to protect the rights of the States and the people \nfrom abuse by the Federal Government; to strengthen the partnership and \nthe intergovernmental relationship between State and Federal \ngovernments; to restrain Federal agencies from exceeding their \nauthority; to enforce the 10th amendment to the Constitution; and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               the 10th amendment enforcement act of 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today, on behalf of 23 of my colleagues, \nas well as Governors, attorneys general, State legislators, and mayors \nacross the Nation, I rise to introduce the 10th Amendment Enforcement \nAct of 1996.\n  The 10th amendment was a promise to the States and to the American \npeople that the Federal Government would be limited, and that the \npeople of the States could, for the most part, govern themselves as \nthey saw fit.\n  Unfortunately, in the last half century, that promise has been \nbroken. The American people have asked us to start honoring that \npromise again: to return power to State and local governments which are \nclose to and more sensitive to the needs of the people.\n  The 104th Congress and in particular, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, started to shift power out of Washington by returning it to our \nStates and to the American people. Today we continue that process.\n  The 10th Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 will return power to the \nStates and to the people by placing safeguards in the legislative \nprocess, by restricting the power of Federal agencies and by \ninstructing the Federal courts to enforce the 10th amendment.\n  The act enforces the 10th amendment in five ways:\n  First, the act includes a specific congressional finding that the \n10th amendment means what it says: The Federal Government has no powers \nnot delegated by the Constitution, and the States may exercise all \npowers not withheld by the Constitution;\n  Second, the act states that Federal laws may not interfere with State \nor local powers unless Congress declares its intent to do so and \nCongress cites its specific constitutional authority;\n  Third, the act gives Members of the House and Senate the ability to \nraise a point of order challenging a bill that lacks such a declaration \nor that cites insufficient constitutional authority. Such a point of \norder would require a three-fifths majority to be defeated;\n  Fourth, the act requires that Federal agency rules and regulations \nnot interfere with State or local powers without constitutional \nauthority cited by Congress. Agencies must allow States notice and an \nopportunity to be heard in the rulemaking process;\n  Fifth, the act directs courts to strictly construe Federal laws and \nregulations that interfere with State powers, with a presumption in \nfavor of State authority and against Federal preemption.\n  Before the bill was even introduced, I received letters of support \nfrom many Governors and attorneys general--men and women from across \nthe Nation and from both parties who support our efforts to return \npower to the States and to the people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters from Governors Allen, Bush,\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\nEngler, Leavitt, Merrill, Racicot, Cayetano, and Thompson, and from \nAttorneys General Bronster, Condon, and Norton be included in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Supreme Court has stated,\n\n     just as the separation and independence of the coordinate \n     branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the \n     accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy \n     balance of power between the States and the Federal \n     Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from \n     either front.\n\n  The 10th Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 will prevent overstepping \nby all three branches of the Federal Government, and will focus \nattention on what State and local officials have been advocating for so \nlong: the need to return power to the States and to the people.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                S. 1629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be referred to as the ``Tenth Amendment \n     Enforcement Act of 1996.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) in most areas of governmental concern, State \n     governments possess both the Constitutional authority and the \n     competence to discern the needs and the desires of the People \n     and to govern accordingly;\n       (b) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have \n     interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, \n     should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal \n     Government by the Constitution;\n       (c) the framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon \n     the Federal Government only limited authority over the States \n     and the People;\n       (d) under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the \n     powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people;\n       (e) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth \n     Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to \n     act in areas of State jurisdiction, should be directed to \n     strictly construe Federal laws and regulations which \n     interfere with State powers with a presumption in favor of \n     State authority and against Federal preemption.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n       (a) On or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by \n     Congress shall include a declaration--\n       (1) that authority to govern in the area addressed by the \n     statute is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, \n     including a citation to the specific Constitutional authority \n     relied upon;\n       (2) that Congress specifically finds that it has a greater \n     degree of competence than the State to govern in the area \n     addressed by the statute; and\n       (3) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n     any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n     that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State \n     powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, \n     or ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary.\n       (b) Congress must make specific factual findings in support \n     of the declarations described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Information required.--It shall not be in order in \n     either the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any \n     bill, joint resolution, or amendment that does not include a \n     declaration of Congressional intent as required under section \n     3.\n       (2) Supermajority required.--The requirements of this \n     subsection may be waived or suspended in the Senate or House \n     of Representatives only by the affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members of that House duly chosen and sworn.

Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Government Affairs Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your recent correspondence \n     sharing with me your proposal to strengthen the 10th \n     Amendment by requiring the federal government to restrict its \n     legislative and regulatory activities to those powers \n     delegated to it under the Constitution.\n       As you know, I have spent a great deal of time over the \n     past few years working on 10th Amendment issues, and I am \n     very supportive of your proposed legislation. As I have \n     studied the history of the 10th Amendment, it has become \n     clear to me that we must act overtly to strengthen this \n     important precept of the Constitution, or it will continue to \n     erode away.\n       Let me provide some background on why I believe this is so \n     important. The founders of our country attempted to carefully \n     balance power between the competing interests of the states \n     and the national government. They worried that the national \n     government might gain too much power, so they gave\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\n     states tools, or rules, that if followed would maintain the \n     healthly tension necessary to protect self-governance by the \n     people and prevent any level of government from overstepping \n     its bounds.\n       Among those rules or tools given to states were these:\n       The 10th Amendment, which reserved any power not \n     specifically delegated to the national government to the \n     states and the people. Clearly, the founders intended the \n     national government to stay within the bounds of duties \n     enumerated in the Constitution.\n       The election of U.S. senators by state legislatures. Having \n     senators directly accountable to state legislatures would \n     keep the national government in check. If the national \n     government centralized authority or passed bills disliked by \n     the states, legislatures could call their senators in for an \n     accounting. It would not be likely for the Congress to usurp \n     state authority if senators owed their political lives to \n     state legislatures. The power was carefully balanced and the \n     tension was healthy.\n       The ability of state legislatures to initiate \n     constitutional amendments. This also would keep the national \n     government in check because if it got out of line the states \n     could take action to rein it in. It is clear that the \n     founders intended state leaders to have the ability to \n     initiate constitutional amendments.\n       The sense that state leaders would rise in indignation and \n     band together to oppose congressional centralization of \n     authority and usurpation of power. In Federalist 46, James \n     Madison predicted that ``ambitious encroachments of the \n     federal government on the authority of the state governments \n     . . . would be signals of general alarm. Every government \n     would espouse the common cause . . . plans of resistance \n     would be concerted.'' States would react as though in danger \n     from a ``foreign yoke,'' he suggested.\n       Those were some of the tools the founders put in place to \n     safeguard the roles of both levels of government and to \n     prevent either from becoming too dominant.\n       It would likely be a matter of some bitterness and \n     disappointment to the founders if they were to return today \n     to see what happened to the finely-crafted balance, the \n     healthy tension that they built into the Constitution. As \n     they see a national government that dictates to states on \n     nearly every issue and that is involved in every aspect of \n     citizens' lives, they might wonder what happened to those \n     tools and rules they established to maintain balance.\n       The sad fact is that each one of those tools has either \n     been eroded away, given away, or rendered impossible to use. \n     Thus, today there does not exist any restraint to prevent the \n     national government from taking advantage of the states. To \n     their credit, leaders of the Republican Congress have gone \n     out of their way to involve governors in important decisions. \n     But there is nothing permanent in that relationship. With a \n     change in leadership, state leaders could easily be relegated \n     to their past status as lobbyists and special interest \n     groups. Over the past several decades, they have had to \n     approach Washington hat in hand, hoping and wishing that \n     Congress will listen to them. There has been no balance of \n     power, no full partnership in a federal-state system. States \n     must accept whatever the Congress gives them. States have no \n     tools, no rules, ensuring them an equal voice.\n       Let's look at what happened to those tools and rules the \n     founders so carefully provided to ensure balance.\n       The 10th Amendment has been eroded to the point that in the \n     minds of most Washington insiders it barely exists. The \n     preponderance of congressional action and federal court \n     decisions over the past 60 years have rendered the 10th \n     Amendment nearly meaningless. It would barely be recognizable \n     by the founders. States did not defend or guard it properly \n     and it no longer protects states.\n       States gave away the power to have their U.S. senators \n     directly accountable to state legislatures. There was good \n     reason for this, as graft and corruption sometimes occurred \n     in the appointment of senators by legislatures. States \n     ratified the 17th Amendment making senators popularly \n     elected, and citizens should not be asked to give up the \n     right to elect their senators. But while it does not make \n     sense to try to restore that tool, it should be replaced \n     with something else more workable.\n       The ability of states to initiate constitutional amendments \n     has never been used and is essentially unworkable. Clearly, \n     the founders intended for state leaders to be able to \n     initiate amendments as a check on federal power, but it has \n     never happened and likely never will. The Congress sits as a \n     constitutional convention every day it is in session, and can \n     propose constitutional amendments any time it desires. But \n     many citizens have an enormous fear of state leaders coming \n     together to do the same thing, even though any amendment \n     proposed would require ratification by three-fourths of \n     states. Thus, this tool provided by the founders has become \n     impractical and does not protect states from federal \n     encroachment.\n       The fourth tool was the founders' belief that state leaders \n     would jealously guard their role in the system and rise up in \n     opposition to federal intrusions. That has not happened, \n     especially as state governments have become dependent on \n     federal dollars and have been willing to give up freedom for \n     money. States have proven themselves to be politically \n     anemic. Instead of mobilizing against federal encroachments, \n     state leaders have spent their time lobbying for money and \n     hoping for flexibility.\n       Thus, it is no wonder that states have little true clout as \n     budget cuts are made and as the pie is being divided in \n     Washington D.C. There is no healthy tension. States have no \n     tools or rules to protect themselves. What is passing for \n     federalism in Washington today is not a true sharing of \n     power, but a subcontracting of federal programs to states. \n     The federal government is merely delegating, not devolving \n     true authority.\n       Because the tools protecting states have been rendered \n     ineffective, it is important that Congress replace them with \n     new versions that accomplish what the Founders intended. That \n     is why I am so supportive of your Tenth Amendment Enforcement \n     Act. It would help prevent all three branches of the federal \n     government from overstepping their constitutional authority \n     and would help restore the careful balance put in place by \n     the Founders.\n       I thank you for your efforts to return power to the states \n     and to the people. Please count me among the supporters of \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Governor, State of Utah.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                   March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Member, U.S. Senate, Chairman, Committee on Governmental \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: Thank your for your letter regarding the Tenth \n     Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996.\n       Two centuries ago, the challenge to individual liberty came \n     from an arrogant, overbearing monarchy across the sea. Today, \n     that challenge comes all too often from our own federal \n     government, which has ignored virtually every constitutional \n     limit fashioned by the framers to confine its reach and thus \n     to guard the freedoms of the people.\n       In our day, the threat to self-determination posed by the \n     centralization of power in the nation's capital has been \n     dramatically demonstrated. Under my administration, Virginia \n     has challenged the constitutionality of federal mandates in \n     court, and I have testified before the Congress in support of \n     restoring powers to the States and the people.\n       The legislation you are proposing will help the States and \n     the people regain prerogatives usurped by an overbearing \n     federal government. I wholeheartedly support your efforts and \n     would be pleased to work with you to highlight the impact of \n     federal intrusion in Virginia.\n       With kind personal regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n     George Allen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Lansing, MI, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing in support of the Tenth \n     Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996, which I understand you \n     intend to introduce this week. Congressional action of this \n     type is necessary to restore vigor to this often-neglected \n     provision of our constitution and I wholeheartedly support \n     your effort to do so.\n       Congress has over the years run roughshod over state \n     concerns and prerogatives and has generally lost sight of the \n     fact that ours is a federal system of government. In that \n     system, the federal government has only those powers \n     specifically delegated to it and enumerated in the \n     constitution, with the balance remaining with the states or \n     the people. Too often in our recent history the federal \n     government has ignored the meaning of the Tenth Amendment in \n     a mad rush to impose a one-size-fits-all approach in areas of \n     traditional state and local concern. This approach stifles \n     innovation and takes the policy debate further from the \n     people by centralizing decision-making in Washington, D.C.\n       A recent example of federal intrusion into a matter best \n     left to the states is the Motor Voter law, which imposes an \n     unfunded mandate on the states to offer voter registration \n     services at state social services offices. Michigan must \n     comply with this requirement even though nearly 90 percent of \n     its eligible population is already registered to vote. In \n     fact, Michigan demonstrated the states' superior ability to \n     craft innovative solutions in areas such as this when it \n     initiated the motor voter concept some 21 years ago by \n     offering voter registration services at Secretary of State \n     branch offices. The imposition of a federal ``solution'' in \n     this area ignores the fact that states are better positioned \n     to address the needs of their citizens and can do so without \n     prodding from the federal government.\n       The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 will help \n     restore the balance to our federal system that the framers of \n     the constitution intended. It will do so by requiring \n     congress to identify specific constitutional authority for \n     the exercise of federal power. This will have the salutary \n     effect of reminding the congress that it can legislate only \n     pursuant to an enumerated power in the constitution. \n     Requiring congress to state its intention to preempt existing \n     state or federal law or interfere with state power should \n     assist in limiting the intrusion the federal Motor Voter law \n     exemplifies.\n       I recently offered amendments to the National Governors' \n     Association's policy on\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n     state-federal relations that the governors adopted at our \n     1996 winter meeting. That policy calls upon Congress to \n     ``limit the scope of its legislative activity to those areas \n     that are enumerated and delegated to the federal government \n     by the constitution.'' The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of \n     1996 will help reinvigorate this fundamental constitutional \n     principle and for that reason enjoys my full support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Engler,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                        Helena, MT, March 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: I am writing in support of your \n     proposed legislation entitled the Tenth Amendment Enforcement \n     Act of 1996. I applaud your efforts to protect states from \n     federal legislation that, while perhaps unintentionally, has \n     had a strangling effect on the states' ability to act \n     effectively on behalf of their citizens.\n       The failure to respect states' rights takes a variety of \n     forms, from unfunded mandates to complex requirements that \n     prohibit states from adopting innovative programs to solve \n     problems that may be unique to the state or region. I am sure \n     it is difficult to determine which functions the federal \n     government should properly manage and which should be left to \n     state or local governments. I think most would agree, \n     however, with the intent of the Tenth Amendment--that a \n     better balance must be struck between the federal government \n     and each of the states.\n       The revitalization of government is essential in these \n     times of declining trust and diminishing respect of its \n     cities. The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 would \n     make government more responsive to our citizens and help \n     restore the public's faith in the policy process.\n       I hope your proposal is received well in Congress. I know \n     it would be received well in the states.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Wisconsin,\n\n\n                            Office of Federal/State Relations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Rules & Administration Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: I am writing you in support of \n     legislation that you intend to introduce in your committee \n     regarding the Tenth Amendment. Your vision in regard to this \n     delegation of powers should be commended. Our founding \n     fathers would applaud your courageous efforts.\n       As you know, the Tenth Amendment restricts the federal \n     government's legislative and regulatory activities to those \n     powers delegated to the federal government under the U.S. \n     Constitution.\n       Since I have held elective office I have always been a \n     staunch supporter of States Rights' and a firm believer that \n     decisions are best made at the local level. Your bill \n     identifies the problems associated with the lack of \n     enforcement of the Tenth Amendment at present and aims to \n     amend some of these inconsistencies.\n       Under the Tenth Amendment, federal laws may not interfere \n     with state or local powers unless Congress declares its \n     intent to do so, and Congress cites its specific \n     constitutional authority. Allowing Members of Congress to \n     challenge future legislation that attempts to supersede the \n     Tenth Amendment in my opinion would be beneficial.\n       As Governor of the State of Wisconsin, I have always been a \n     firm believer that legislation is a far better course of \n     action than litigation. Your bill would do away with needless \n     regulation, infringement of states' abilities to provide \n     quality services to its residents', and encourage local \n     decision making opportunities.\n       The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 would prevent \n     confusion between the three branches of government and would \n     keep the pressure on Washington to address the concerns \n     Governors have been advocating for years; the need to return \n     power to the states and to the people.\n       Again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you \n     for your support on this important legislative matter. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact me in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G.

Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: Thank you for your letter outlining \n     your introduction of the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of \n     1996. I am pleased to offer my strong endorsement of this \n     piece of legislation.\n       The individual states have seen a continual degradation of \n     their power and sovereignty during the past 60 years. \n     Beginning with the creation of the welfare state through \n     President Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930's, the federal \n     government has inappropriately usurped power traditionally \n     left to the states. Issues such as education, crime, commerce \n     and the environment have been co-opted at the federal level. \n     The result is an erosion of local control and the creation of \n     a system of twisted rules and regulations. This \n     overregulation has stifled State initiatives and innovations. \n     The time has come to say enough is enough.\n       In the State of New Hampshire, many examples exist of \n     federal overreaching. The most telling of these is our \n     continuing attempts at reforming welfare. Our ambitious \n     program would end welfare as we know it, putting people into \n     the workforce. It is based upon the simple notion that those \n     who are able to work for a living should do so. Instead of \n     collecting a welfare check, individuals would receive \n     unemployment benefits and job training. The result would be a \n     motivated workforce, properly trained and prepared to sustain \n     themselves instead of accepting government largesse. \n     Unfortunately, the federal government has gone out of its way \n     to hinder our efforts. New Hampshire is not alone in this \n     fight. Each state has a similar story to tell.\n       Liberty is defined by American Heritage as the ``condition \n     of being free of restriction or control.'' It is clear that \n     this definition does not relate to our current set of \n     circumstances. The individual states are the engines of \n     democracy, pushing new and exciting concepts which enrich the \n     country as a whole. The states have been thwarted in their \n     efforts to accomplish this. The time has come to reassert the \n     authority of the Tenth Amendment and to return power back to \n     the states and to the individual where it belongs. I believe \n     that the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 will do this \n     and strongly support its passage.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Stephen Merrill,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                February 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I strongly support your legislation, \n     the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996.\n       I applaud your efforts and hope to see this bill's passage \n     this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                     Columbia, SC, March 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: Please accept this letter as a pledge \n     of support for the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996, \n     which you are introducing in the Senate. This is clearly one \n     of the most important pieces of legislation to come before \n     Congress this year.\n       As attorney general of South Carolina, I see first-hand the \n     trouble that arises every time the federal government \n     oversteps its boundaries and intrudes on states' rights. In \n     fact, South Carolina can claim one of the most egregious \n     examples of the federal government meddling in states' \n     affairs with disastrous results.\n       Several years ago, when I was a solicitor in Charleston, \n     S.C., a local hospital approached me with a plea: Help us do \n     something about crack babies. In increasing numbers, pregnant \n     women were abusing crack cocaine and giving birth to addicted \n     newborns, who cry and shake uncontrollably, refuse to take \n     food and, too often, ultimately die in intensive care.\n       Working with the hospital, I developed a program to \n     aggressively confront pregnant women with the consequences of \n     their drug use. Over five years, we presented all pregnant \n     women who tested positive for cocaine with a choice: seek \n     drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.\n       The program was undeniably successful--until the federal \n     government intervened. Without offering any reasonable \n     alternative solutions for saving these crack babies, federal \n     officials came to Charleston and yowled about discrimination \n     and privacy rights. When we refused to back down, they \n     resorted to blackmail. They continued with the program.\n       So, now, once again, these crack babies cry unconsolably in \n     Charleston--thanks to the federal government's intrusion \n     where is has no business.\n       There are myriad other examples of ways the federal \n     government ignores the 10th amendment--with effects that \n     would be laughable if they didn't do so much harm. A \n     sampling:\n       The Hunley. The federal government claims it owns the H.L. \n     Hunley because it won the Civil War. However, the first \n     submarine to sink another vessel lies on soil that belonged \n     to the state of South Carolina even before the United States \n     came into existence. Although common and maritime law, as \n     well as state and federal statutes, point to South Carolina's \n     ownership of the sunken submarine, the federal government's \n     insistence on interfering in South Carolina affairs will cost \n     all of the nation's taxpayers. Worse, its meddling in this \n     matter has caused this war treasure to sit at the bottom of \n     the Atlantic Ocean, rusting away, until the issue can be \n     resolved with the federal government.\n       The Citadel. Traditionally, education has been a province \n     of the states. And polls show\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\n     that the majority of South Carolinians--both male and \n     female--want the option of single-gender education offered by \n     The Citadel. But the federal government thinks it knows \n     what's best for South Carolinians and is trying to destroy an \n     outstanding educational environment that South Carolinians \n     overwhelmingly support.\n       Tobacco regulation. The Food and Drug Administration is \n     trampling on states' turf with its new proposals for \n     regulating cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Perhaps its \n     silliest demand is that all advertising label cigarettes as \n     ``a nicotine-delivery device.'' The fact is, Congress has not \n     given the FDA power to regulate tobacco except in limited \n     instances. Everything else is up to the states--at least, \n     it's supposed to be. We know the laws in South Carolina, and \n     we can enforce them without Washington's ``help.''\n       Garnishment of wages. The federal government is threatening \n     to sue South Carolina for not complying with a federal law \n     that authorizes the garnishment of wages of people who get \n     behind on student loans. The problem is, the law contains no \n     express provision applying its terms to state government. In \n     fact, its language attempts to override state laws \n     altogether. It provides no clear direction to state \n     governments, but now we're faced with the possibility of \n     defending South Carolina in a suit.\n       Motor Voter. South Carolina is one of seven states to \n     challenge the ``Motor Voter'' law that allows people to \n     register to vote when they obtain a driver's license. The \n     issue is not easy and accessible registration; we already \n     have that in place. The issues are the rights of sovereign \n     states and unfunded federal mandates. The federal government \n     demanded that South Carolina spend a million dollars to \n     expand its voter registration program--without giving the \n     state a dime. Then, when we began to implement the program, \n     the Justice Department demanded that the state contact all \n     the people who theoretically could have registered while we \n     were in litigation. And it ordered a monthly report on our \n     progress. This micro-management of state business by the \n     federal government should be an outrage to all U.S. citizens.\n       In closing, the legislation you are proposing promises a \n     meaningful solution to the federal government's continued \n     disregard of the 10th Amendment. Count me in as an \n     enthusiastic supporter of the bill, and let me know of \n     anything I can do to promote its passage.\n           With kindest personal regards,\n                                            Charles Molony Condon,\n     Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  State of Hawaii,\n\n\n                           Department of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      Honolulu, HI, March 4, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senator, Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: As the Attorney General for the State \n     of Hawaii, I am writing to express my strong support for the \n     Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 (``TAEA'').\n       There have been far too many instances in which federal \n     laws impede, interfere with, or nullify state legislative or \n     administrative actions to the detriment of the interests of \n     the people of Hawaii. This has occurred in large part because \n     the federal courts have given much congressional legislation \n     very broad preemptive scope, in many cases far beyond what it \n     appears Congress itself intended. These preemption rulings \n     have prevented the states from enforcing and implementing \n     needed state policies in areas of traditional state concern, \n     while at the same time failing to serve any significant \n     federal interests.\n       In my fourteen month tenure as Attorney General of Hawaii, \n     examples of important state policies which were frustrated by \n     preemption rulings made by the federal courts include the \n     striking down of Hawaii's employment disability \n     discrimination laws as applied to airline pilots, see Aloha \n     Islandair v. Tseu, Civ. No. 94-00937 (D. Haw. 1995), appeal \n     filed, C.A. No. 95-16656 (9th Cir.), the overturning of state \n     labor department discretion to bar preexisting condition \n     limitations in state-wide employee health care plans, \n     Foodland Super Market v. Hamada, Civ. No. 95-00537 (D. Haw. \n     1996), appeal filed (9th Cir.), and the nullification of a \n     state law merely asking the State's two major newspapers, \n     granted the privilege of doing business under a joint \n     operating agreement with antitrust immunity, to turn over \n     their tax returns to the state Attorney General, for \n     subsequent disclosure to the United States Justice \n     Department, in order to assess the economic consequences of, \n     and the newspapers' continued need for, the antitrust \n     immunity, see Hawaii Newspaper Agency v. Bronster, Civ. No. \n     95-00635 (D. Haw. 1996), appeal filed, C.A. No. 96-15142 (9th \n     Cir.).\n       Enactment of the TAEA would be a significant step in \n     reversing this disturbing trend, and would help restore state \n     direction over areas of predominant, if not exclusive, state \n     concern. Under the TAEA (Section 6), preemption would only \n     occur when Congress has explicitly stated that a given area \n     is preempted. This would curtail the potentially unlimited \n     sweep of the ``implied preemption'' doctrine, and ideally \n     result in a more narrowly construed ``express preemption.''\n       Although certain provisions of the TAEA may pose procedural \n     difficulties, or raise some questions of interpretation, I \n     support the overall effect of, and goals behind, the TAEA, \n     and specifically endorse Section 6, which would do much to \n     minimize unwarranted preemption of state actions. I would, \n     however, broaden the language of Section 6(a) to clarify that \n     federal law shall not preempt ``State or local government \n     law, ordinance, regulation, or action,'' unless the statute \n     explicitly declares an intent to preempt. This should ensure \n     that all types of state action, including, for example, state \n     discretionary administrative actions not commanded by any \n     rule or statute, are not preempted without express \n     congressional statement of intent to do so.\n       Thank you for your support of these critical state \n     interests.\n           Very truly yours.\n                                              Margery S. Bronster,\n     Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         State of Colorado, Department of Law, Office of the \n           Attorney General,\n                                       Denver, CO, March 15, 1996.\n     Re Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the proposed Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of \n     1996. The proposal is an important part of the continuing \n     effort to return to the States matters which properly belong \n     within their control.\n       Every state has a vast number of examples of federal laws \n     and regulatory actions which have interfered with state \n     powers and objectives. I will mention just a few examples \n     from Colorado.\n       The federal government has been especially intrusive into \n     state affairs in the area of the environment. The country \n     faces many environmental problems, from our quality problems \n     to hazardous waste cleanups. The states are diligently \n     working to solve these problems, while taking into account \n     local needs and concerns. Federal interference with state \n     efforts often results in less protection to the environment \n     and less experimentation by the states.\n       For example, in 1994, Colorado passed legislation which was \n     intended to encourage businesses to perform voluntary audits \n     of their environmental compliance and to promptly correct any \n     violations found. In exchange for these voluntary efforts, \n     state regulators will not impose penalties for the \n     violations. This program, which will be of great benefit to \n     the environment, is severely hampered by the federal \n     Environmental Protection Agency's refusal to give the same \n     assurances, that is, to refrain from prosecuting companies \n     that voluntarily report and correct violations.\n       Another example of EPA hindering state efforts at \n     experimentation concerns Colorado's attempts to put in place \n     a unique water quality testing program. Colorado was one of \n     the first states to attempt to employ a different \n     biomonitoring test. Rather than encouraging these efforts, \n     EPA continuously rejected Colorado's regulation implementing \n     the program until the state rule was drafted to be word-for-\n     word like a comparable federal regulation.\n       Another example in the area of the environment concerns air \n     quality. Our state has been developing strategies to deal \n     with air quality issues for years. But our problems and \n     solutions are unique since Colorado is a high elevation \n     state. A federal ``one size fits all'' approach does not work \n     here. The Environmental Protection Agency's answer--a \n     centralized emissions testing program--has created large \n     implementation costs and reduced state flexibility in \n     addressing pollution problems. Even though Colorado drivers \n     will expend hundreds of millions of dollars in testing costs \n     over the next few years, State officials have no practical \n     alternatives if the program does not work or if better \n     solutions are discovered.\n       Another example of federal intrusion into matters of state \n     concern arose recently in Colorado with regard to the \n     Medicaid program. As you know, Congress' 1993 change to the \n     Hyde Amendment made federal funds available for abortions \n     terminating pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, but \n     did not require that States pay for any abortions. However, \n     an official at the federal Health Care Financing \n     Administration wrote a letter concluding that states must pay \n     for the disputed abortions. Based solely upon this letter, \n     and without any change in federal statutes or regulations, \n     several federal appellate courts have required States to pay \n     for these procedures, notwithstanding state laws to the \n     contrary.\n       Colorado state officials are in an impossible dilemma \n     because our state constitution forbids the use of public \n     funds to pay for these procedures. To avoid violating the \n     state constitution but still be consistent with federal \n     mandates, state officials must either (1) withdraw from the \n     Medicaid program and forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in federal funds, thereby denying thousands of low income \n     Colorado residents access to needed medical care or (2) face \n     contempt citations from federal judges. This problem could \n     have been avoided if federal officials clearly understood \n     their own responsibility to protect state prerogatives.\n       The federal ``motor voter'' law presents a different type \n     of intrusion. This law doesn't treat States just like the \n     private sector, it actually imposes special burdens simply \n     because they are States. As the Supreme Court recognized in \n     Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\n     (1970), it is peculiarly the right of States to establish the \n     qualifications of voters in state elections. In the absence \n     of a constitutional violation such as an outright denial of \n     the right to vote, the States should have control over voter \n     registration. This sort of unfunded mandate is simply not \n     justified, particularly since even though this law \n     unquestionably interferes with the States' internal \n     affairs, it has not appreciably increased turnout at the \n     polls.\n       The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act helps turn the tide in \n     favor of State prerogatives. Particularly noteworthy is the \n     proposal's focus upon agency rulemaking. This is important in \n     two respects. First, many of the most intrusive instances of \n     federal preemption come not by virtue of congressionally-\n     enacted legislation, but through extensive regulations \n     promulgated by administrative agencies and expanding upon the \n     congressional authorization.\n       Second, statutes seeking to limit subsequent congressional \n     enactments are of limited efficacy, since each subsequent \n     Congress is not bound by the acts of its predecessors. \n     However, focusing upon the regulatory process does not \n     present this problem. My only suggestion would be to include \n     a review or sunset provision requiring every agency to ensure \n     that all of its current rules comply with this new \n     requirement by some date certain, or risk having them \n     invalidated. This would ensure that agencies review the \n     numerous existing federal regulations currently impinging \n     upon Tenth Amendment values--which is, after all, what led to \n     this proposal.\n       I appreciate your willingness to carry this proposal \n     forward, and encourage you to continue your efforts to \n     restore a proper balance in our federal system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gale A. Norton,\n                                        Colorado Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1630. A bill to prevent discrimination against victims of abuse in \nall lines of insurance; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the victims of abuse insurance protection act\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined \nby Senator Ron Wyden today in introducing the Victims of Abuse \nInsurance Protection Act, legislation that will outlaw discrimination \nby insurance companies against the victims of domestic violence in all \nlines of insurance.\n  With this legislation, we are trying to correct an abhorrent practice \nby many insurance companies--the denial of coverage to battered women. \nIt is plain, old fashioned discrimination. It is profoundly unjust and \nwrong. And, it is the worst of blaming the victim. Denying women access \nto the insurance they require to foster their mobility out of an \nabusive situation must be stopped.\n  There are many stories of women who have been physically abused and \nhave sought proper medical care only to be turned away by insurance \ncompanies who said they were too high risk to insure.\n  In Minnesota, three insurance companies denied an entire women's \nshelter insurance because, ``as a battered women's shelter, we were \nhigh risk.'' The Women's Shelter in Rochester, MN, was told that it was \nconsidered uninsurable because its employees are almost all battered \nwomen.\n  Another shelter in rural Minnesota purchased a car so that women and \nchildren in danger who were trying to leave an abusive situation could \nuse this anonymous vehicle and thus the abuser could not track their \nautomobile to find them. The shelter could not find a company to \nprovide them with automobile insurance once the companies knew of the \nrisks surrounding battered women.\n  A woman in Iowa named Sandra was denied life insurance after the \ncompany found out that she had been beaten up twice. In one incident, \nshe had been so badly beaten by an ex-boyfriend that her cheekbones \nwere splintered, and one of her eyes had to be put back in its socket. \nHer mother, Mary, was the one who originally applied for the life \ninsurance policy, explaining\n\n       I didn't ask for a lot of coverage. I just wanted to apply \n     for thousand dollar coverage, just enough that if something \n     happened, God forbid, that we could at least bury her.\n\n  Mary was angry about the denial, so she wrote to State officials and \nthe Iowa Insurance Commissioners Office tried to intervene on their \nbehalf. In four separate letters, the insurance company officials \nstated they denied the coverage because of a history of assaults. In \none letter they defended their decision by citing numerous documents \nwhich showed that people involved in domestic violence incidents are at \na higher risk of death and injury than others, and, therefore, not a \ngood risk.\n  There are so many stories about victims of domestic abuse being \ndenied fire insurance, homeowners insurance, life insurance, and health \ninsurance--denied because they were victims of a crime. Domestic \nviolence is the leading cause of injury to women, more common than auto \naccidents, muggings, and rapes by a stranger combined. It is the No. 1 \nreason that women go to emergency rooms.\n  This bill goes a long way toward treating domestic violence as the \ncrime that it is--not a voluntary risky behavior that can be easily \nchanged and not as a preexisting condition. Insurance company policies \nthat deny coverage to victims only serve to perpetuate the myth that \nvictims are responsible for their abuse.\n  In order to address the practice of insurers using domestic violence \nas a basis for determining whom to cover and how much to charge with \nrespect to health, life, disability, homeowners and auto insurance, \nthis legislation prohibits insurance companies from discriminating \nagainst victims in any of the following ways: Denying or terminating \ninsurance; limiting coverage or denying claims; charging higher \npremiums; or terminating health coverage for victims of abuse in \nsituations where coverage was originally issued in the abuser's name, \nand acts of the abuser would cause the victim to lose coverage.\n  This legislation also keeps victims' information confidential by \nprohibiting insurers from improperly using, disclosing, or transferring \nabuse-related information for any purpose unrelated to the direct \nprovision of health care services.\n  Mr. President, insurance companies should not be allowed to \ndiscriminate against anyone for being a victim of domestic violence.

Nothing in this paragraph \n     prohibits the insurer from requiring the subject of abuse to \n     pay the full premium for the subject's coverage under the \n     health plan. The insurer may terminate group coverage after \n     the continuation coverage required by this paragraph has been \n     in force for 18 months if it offers conversion to an \n     equivalent individual plan. The continuation of health \n     coverage required by this paragraph shall be satisfied by any \n     extension of coverage under part 6 of subtitle B of title I \n     or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 provided to a subject of abuse and is not intended to be \n     in addition to any extension of coverage provided under part \n     6 of subtitle B of title I or the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (b) Use of Information.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurer may use, disclose, or transfer \n     information relating to an applicant's or insured's abuse \n     status or abuse-related medical condition or the applicant's \n     or insured's status as a family member, employer or \n     associate, person in a relationship with a subject of abuse \n     for any purpose unrelated to the direct provision of health \n     care services unless such use, disclosure, or transfer is \n     required by an order of an entity with authority to regulate \n     insurance or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or \n     by abuse reporting laws. Nothing in this paragraph shall be \n     construed as limiting or precluding a subject of abuse from \n     obtaining the subject's own medical records from an insurer.\n       (2) Authority of subject of abuse.--A subject of abuse, at \n     the absolute discretion of the subject of abuse, may provide \n     evidence of abuse to an insurer for the limited purpose of \n     facilitating treatment of an abuse-related condition or \n     demonstrating that a condition is abuse-related. Nothing in \n     this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing an insurer \n     or health carrier to disregard such provided evidence.\n\n     SEC. 4. REASONS FOR ADVERSE ACTIONS.\n\n       An insurer that takes any adverse action relating to any \n     plan or policy of a subject of abuse, shall advise the \n     subject of abuse applicant or insured of the specific reasons \n     for the action in writing. Reference to general underwriting \n     practices or guidelines does not constitute a specific \n     reason.\n\n     SEC. 5. LIFE INSURANCE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a life \n     insurer from declining to issue a life insurance policy if \n     the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is or would \n     be designated as a beneficiary of the policy, and if--\n       (1) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks \n     an insurable interest in the insured; or\n       (2) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is \n     known, on the basis of police or court records, to have \n     committed an act of abuse.\n\n     SEC. 6. SUBROGATION WITHOUT CONSENT PROHIBITED.\n\n       Except where the subject of abuse has already recovered \n     damages, subrogation of claims resulting from abuse is \n     prohibited with the informed consent of the subject of abuse.\n\n     SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade Commission \n     shall have the power to examine and investigate any insurer \n     to determine whether such insurer has been or is engaged in \n     any act or practice prohibited by this Act. If the Federal \n     Trade Commission determines an insurer has been or is engaged \n     in any act or practice prohibited by this Act, the Commission \n     may take action against such insurer by the issuance of a \n     cease and desist order as if the insurer was in violation of \n     section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Such cease and \n     desist order may include any individual relief warranted \n     under the circumstances, including temporary, preliminary, \n     and permanent injunctive and compensatory relief.\n       (b) Private Cause of Action.--An applicant or insured \n     claiming to be adversely affected by an act or practice of an \n     insurer in violation of this Act may maintain an action \n     against the insurer in a Federal or State court of original \n     jurisdiction. Upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance \n     of the evidence, the court may award appropriate relief, \n     including temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive \n     relief and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as the \n     costs of suit and reasonable fees for the aggrieved \n     individual's attorneys and expert witnesses. With respect to \n     compensatory damages, the aggrieved individual may elect, at \n     any time prior to the rendering of final judgment, to recover \n     in lieu of actual damages, an award of statutory damages in \n     the amount of $5,000 for each violation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PELL:\n  S. 1631. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Extreme, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                coastwise trading privileges legislation\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct that \nthe vessel Extreme, official No. 1022278, be accorded coastwise trading \nprivileges and be issued a coastwise endorsement under 46 U.S.C. 12106 \nthrough 12108.\n  The Extreme is 70.9 feet in length, 18 feet in breadth, has a depth \nof 10.8 feet, and is self-propelled.\n  The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the \nExtreme to engage in coastwise trade and fisheries of the United \nStates. When the owners purchased the boat, they were unaware of the \ncoastwise trade and fisheries restrictions of the Jones Act. They \nassumed that there would be no restrictions on engaging the vessel in \nsuch limited operation. Although the vessel was constructed in North \nCarolina, it was built for a foreign customer; thus it did not meet the \ncoastwise license endorsement in the United States. Such documentation \nis mandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel for its intended \npurpose.\n  The owners of the Extreme are therefore seeking a waiver of the \nexisting law because they wish to engage the vessel in limited \ncommercial use. Their desired intentions for the vessel's use will not \nadversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If they are \ngranted this waiver, it is their intention to comply fully with U.S. \ndocumentation and safety requirements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nmy statement be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTIFICATE OF DOCUMENTATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \n     (46 U.S.C. App. 883),\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n     section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1886 (24 Stat. 81, chapter \n     421; 46 U.S.C. App. 289), and sections 12106 through 12108 of \n     title 46, United States Code, the Secretary of Transportation \n     may issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsement for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel EXTREME, United States official number 1022278.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

MANAGEMENT OF GRAZING ON FEDERAL LAND\n\n                     Subtitle A--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) multiple use, as set forth in current law, has been and \n     continues to be a guiding principle in the management of \n     public lands and national forests;\n       (2) through the cooperative and concerted efforts of the \n     Federal rangeland livestock industry, Federal and State land \n     management agencies, and the general public, the Federal \n     rangelands are in the best condition they have been in during \n     this century, and their conditions continues to improve;\n       (3) as a further consequence of those efforts, populations \n     of wildlife are increasing and stabilizing across vast areas \n     of the West;\n       (4) grazing preferences must continue to be adequately \n     safeguarded in order to promote the economic stability of the \n     western livestock industry;\n       (5) it is in the public interest to charge a fee for \n     livestock grazing permits and leases on Federal land that is \n     based on a formula that--\n       (A) reflects a fair return to the Federal Government and \n     the true costs to the permittee or lessee; and\n       (B) promotes continuing cooperative stewardship efforts;\n       (6) opportunities exist for improving efficiency in the \n     administration of the range programs on Federal land by--\n       (A) reducing planning and analysis costs and their \n     associated paperwork, procedural, and clerical burdens; and\n       (B) refocusing efforts to the direct management of the \n     resources themselves;\n       (7) in order to provide meaningful review and oversight of \n     the management of the public rangelands and the grazing \n     allotment on those rangelands, refinement of the reporting of \n     costs of various components of the land management program is \n     needed;\n       (8) greater local input into the management of the public \n     rangelands is in the best interests of the United States;\n       (9) the western livestock industry that relies on Federal \n     land plays an important role in preserving the social, \n     economic, and cultural base of rural communities in the \n     western States and further plays an integral role in \n     the economies of the 16 contiguous western States with \n     Federal rangelands;\n       (10) maintaining the economic viability of the western \n     livestock industry is in the best interest of the United \n     States in order to maintain open space and fish and wildlife \n     habitat;\n       (11) since the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the \n     amendment of section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) by the \n     National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a et \n     seq.), the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture have been charged with coordinating land use \n     inventory, planning and management programs on Bureau of Land \n     Management and National Forest System lands with each other, \n     other Federal departments and agencies, Indian tribes, and \n     State and local governments within which the lands are \n     located, but to date such coordination has not existed to the \n     extent allowed by law; and\n       (12) it shall not be the policy of the United States to \n     increase or reduce total livestock numbers on Federal land \n     except as is necessary to provide for proper management of \n     resources, based on local conditions, and as provided by \n     existing law related to the management of Federal land and \n     this title.\n       (b) Repeal of Earlier Finding.--Section 2(a) of the Public \n     Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1901(a)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4);\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as paragraphs \n     (1) and (2), respectively;\n       (3) in paragraph (1) (as so redesignated), by adding \n     ``and'' at the end; and\n       (4) in paragraph (2) (as so redesignated)\n       (A) by striking ``harrassment'' and inserting \n     ``harassment''; and\n       (B) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a \n     period.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the inclusion of the National Grasslands within the \n     National Forest System has prevented the Secretary of \n     Agriculture from effectively administering and promoting \n     grassland agriculture on National Grasslands as originally \n     intended under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act;\n       (2) the National Grasslands can be more effectively managed \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture if administered as a separate \n     entity outside of the National Forest System; and\n       (3) a grazing program on National Grasslands can be \n     responsibly carried out while protecting and preserving \n     recreational, environmental, and other multiple uses of the \n     National Grasslands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     improved management and more efficient administration of \n     grazing activities on National Grasslands while preserving \n     and protecting multiple uses of such lands, including but not \n     limited to preserving hunting, fishing, and recreational \n     activities, and protecting wildlife habitat in accordance \n     with applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I ask that a copy of a letter from \nElliot Laws, EPA Assistant Administrator, on the subject of the Tulalip \nSuperfund site be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  The letter from EPA clarifies that the Agency fully intends to comply \nwith the report language included in the fiscal year 1996 Senate VA-HUD \nand independent agencies report on the Tulalip Superfund site. In \naddition, the letter promises to provide further information on the \nliability of the Tulalip Tribe for the cleanup of the Superfund site.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: Thank you for inviting us to meet with \n     you on Monday, March 11, 1996, concerning the Tulalip \n     Landfill Superfund Project. This is to summarize the meeting \n     with Timothy Fields, Jr., Deputy Assistant Administrator, \n     Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, and Kathryn \n     Schmoll, Comptroller, and to reiterate the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) commitment to work closely with you \n     and to carefully and thoroughly consider issues you have \n     raised regarding this matter.\n       The meeting focused on three key issues you raised: \n     conducting alternative dispute resolution (ADR) with the \n     interested parties, performing a baseline risk assessment, \n     and incorporating the results of these activities into a new \n     review of remedial alternatives for the site. We also \n     discussed EPA's recent decision to issue an Interim Record of \n     Decision (ROD) for the source areas of the site, and other \n     issues relating to allocation of remedial costs.\n       EPA has already taken a number of steps consistent with the \n     goals you have laid out. For example, we have engaged the \n     potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and others in an \n     extensive dialogue on Tulalip. The Region extended the public \n     comment period on the proposed remedial action plan from 30 \n     days to 80 days, held two public meetings, reviewed and \n     responded to voluminous comments, and thoroughly documented \n     the remedy selection process before publishing the interim \n     ROD. The Agency also generated an extensive record of written \n     communications with the PRPs addressing the cleanup \n     alternatives and the differences between the reviews which \n     the PRPs and EPA have performed. Senior EPA Headquarters \n     management also met with representatives of the PRPs in order \n     to hear and respond to their concerns with the remedy \n     selection process.\n       Publishing the interim ROD is part of a comprehensive \n     effort to identify and address all actual and potential risks \n     associated with this site. It is designed to control \n     migration of contaminants from the source areas of the site \n     and follows the Agency's guidance of presumptive remedies for \n     landfills. This allows for a prompt remedy selection process \n     based on a brief site characterization and risk assessment \n     effort.\n       Nevertheless, the Agency is currently conducting a full \n     baseline risk assessment to evaluate the off-source portions \n     of the site. Thus, concurrent with this interim action to \n     prevent further environmental degradation, EPA is evaluating \n     the impacts of the site on the surrounding area and the risks \n     associated with those impacts. This baseline risk assessment \n     is scheduled for completion in the Summer of 1996. It will \n     form the basis for the final ROD, which will address all \n     remaining aspects of the site. EPA expects to issue this \n     final ROD in Summer 1997, after receiving and responding to \n     public comment on the risk evaluation. Again, the issuance of \n     the interim ROD was in no way intended to interfere with our \n     ability to address the interests and concerns raised by \n     yourself and by other parties.\n       Since, the interim remedy will address the source \n     contamination at the Tulalip site in the most timely and \n     cost-effective manner, EPA designed the baseline risk \n     assessment assuming the interim action would be taken for the \n     on-source areas while continuing investigation of off-source \n     areas. The findings of the baseline risk assessment will be \n     used as the basis for review of the interim ROD, to the \n     extent practicable, and the selection of the final remedy.\n       EPA has furthermore initiated an ADR settlement project for \n     Tulalip. In cooperation with many of the principal \n     respondents for the site, the Agency has employed a neutral, \n     third-party facilitator to assist in allocating remediation \n     costs. The PRPs are currently working to establish the \n     criteria which the facilitator will use to assign liability \n     for the costs of the cleanup. We understand that the \n     facilitator will most likely consider a combination of \n     factors in assigning liability which will probably include \n     both tonnage (contribution) and the degree of involvement/\n     responsibility for the activities which led to the current \n     site conditions.\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\n     However, the exact terms of this agreement are the subject of \n     ongoing discussions among the PRPs and their representatives.\n       In the meeting, you asked a hypothetical question regarding \n     the Tulalip tribe's liability for a portion of the cleanup \n     costs. With respect to estimates of liability, EPA notes that \n     it has published costs estimates only for de minimis settlers \n     as part of an early settlement offer. If other PRPs have \n     estimates of their potential liability, these may represent \n     their own estimates, made for business and planning \n     purposes. However, they are not EPA estimates, and we have \n     not reviewed or concurred with the assumptions on which \n     they may have been based. Again, these issues relating to \n     liability for cleanup costs are to be resolved through the \n     ADR process. We will provide a further update on this \n     issue to you in the future.\n       As a final note, EPA also seriously evaluated the lower-\n     cost options which several of the PRPs have supported. These \n     alternatives do not provide a cap for the site and would \n     therefore not comply with the minimum applicable State \n     landfill closure requirements. I have enclosed letters from \n     the State of Washington and tribal representatives that \n     present their views in support of EPA's remedy selection \n     decisions.\n       I believe this letter is responsve to the concerns you \n     raised at the March 11 meeting, and I appreciate your \n     continued interest in the Superfund program and the Tulalip \n     Landfill Superfund cleanup.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Elliott P.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncountry of Tunisia which will celebrate its 40th anniversary of \nindependence on March 20, 1996. I would like to congratulate this \ncountry, which has made tremendous strides in socio-economic \ndevelopment and in furthering the Middle East peace process.\n  In the last four decades, Tunisia has played a key role in preserving \nstability and peace in North Africa. Tunisia is also playing a key role \nin the Middle East peace process. It was the first Arab country to host \na United Nations multilateral meeting in the peace process. Tunisia \nalso hosted an official Israeli delegation in Tunis to encourage the \ndialog between Arabs and Israelis. Most recently, in January 1996, \nTunisia and Israel agreed to establish formal diplomatic relations, and \ninterest sections will be opened in Tunis and Tel Aviv by mid-April \n1996.\n  Tunisia has been a leader in the struggle against terrorism, \nintolerance, and blind violence. Tunisia appealed to the world \ncommunity, within the framework of the United Nations, the Organization \nof African Unity, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic \nCountries, to adopt strict measures in order to combat terrorism and \nextremism.\n  I would also like to commend Tunisia on its social and economic \nachievements. Tunisia has devoted the bulk of its resources to \nimproving the quality of life of its people and to the development of \nits economy. Education is a key issue in Tunisia. The Government \nappropriates approximately 30 percent of the annual budget to \neducation, social services, housing, and health care. This results in a \nhighly skilled labor force. Today, 23 percent of Tunisian job seekers \nare university graduates and 42 percent are vocational training school \ngraduates.\n  The private sector is playing a key role in the economic development \nof Tunisia, and as a result, Tunisians have created a diversified, \nmarket-oriented economy. Manufacturing accounts for 21 percent of \ndomestic production, agriculture for 15 percent, and tourism for 7 \npercent. Domestic growth rates have averaged more than 4 percent per \nyear, and the budget deficit has been halved in the last 4 years.\n  Tunisia welcomes and encourages foreign investment and has \npreferential access to a number of important regional markets. Tunisia \nis a member of the World Trade Organization. It enjoys duty free access \nfor Tunisian products in European Union countries and most Arab \ncountries. The United States assisted Tunisian economic growth through \nfocused development programs such as the Generalized System of \nPreferences.

Mr. President, this year Willamette University's \nAtkinson Graduate School of Management celebrates its 20th anniversary \nwith an extremely prestigious award. Already considered a pioneering \nspirit in management education, the Atkinson School can profess a \nsingularly unique achievement: accreditation from both the National \nAssociation of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration [NASPAA] \nand the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business [AACSB]. It \nis the first school in the country to receive both accreditations--it \nis my alma mater, located in Salem, OR.\n  Representatives from both the AACSB and the NASPAA visited the school \nin February 1995 and initiated an intense review process. After the \nreview, the two organizations awarded the Atkinson school unanimous \nrecommendations for accreditation. The two review boards commended the \nschool for the program's focus on teamwork and practical application, \nthe teaching staff's commitment to quality instruction and growth of \ntheir students, the uniqueness of the school's mission, and the \noutstanding facilities. The admissions and placement services received \nhigh praise as well.\n  These two distinguished national and international accreditations \ntestify to the impressive and ground-breaking work being done at the \nAtkinson School. Long recognized as a leading institute of management \neducation, the accreditations provide the school with recognition world \nwide, recognition that is duly deserved and places the school among the \nelite institutions of the Pacific region. Out of the more than 700 \nbusiness schools in the Nation, the AACSB accredits 292. Among the \nNation's 220 programs offering master's degrees in public management, \nthe NASPAA accredits about half.\n  The Atkinson School offers a curriculum that features quality \ninstruction in both business and public management that will prepare \nstudents for the future in our global business community. It is telling \nthat in a school that recognizes the importance of global management \nand multinational influence, international students comprise 25 percent \nof the total student body. The Atkinson School has distinguished itself \nas a model for the expanded role of an American institution, a role \nthat embraces the cultures and perspectives of other nations.\n  The Willamette University, nestled in the fertile Willamette Valley \nof Oregon, has long cultivated and developed inquisitive minds. The \nAtkinson School continues this storied tradition as its devotion to \nquality business management education aims for the 21st century. I wish \nto congratulate all the staff, supporters, and students who have \nparticipated in the unequaled success of the Atkinson School. I would \nalso like to mention the outstanding leadership of the Atkinson School \ndean, G. Dave Weight, and the agenda of former Willamette University \npresident, George Herbert Smith, whose vision led to the creation of \nthe Atkinson School. A promising future faces the Atkinson School as it \nprepares its students to compete successfully in the demanding global \nbusiness environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Atkinson School's formal mission \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                           Mission Statement\n\n       The Mission of the Atkinson Graduate School of Management \n     is to identify and convey principles of management shared by \n     successful enterprises in the business, government and not-\n     for-profit sectors. Consistent with these principles, the \n     School educates managers to cooperate as well as compete, to \n     create as well as to operate, and to learn as well as to \n     know. Atkinson extends to management education the teaching \n     and learning traditions of Willamette University, a small, \n     liberal arts institution. Pursuing Willamette's mission to \n     serve its community\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n     with distinctive graduate, professional education, the \n     Atkinson School aims to be the preeminent small, independent \n     management program in the Pacific region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2440-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MICHAEL SHEA\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Michael Shea, age 8, of Dillon MT, \nwas tragically killed in an accident on June 30, 1995.\n  Although Michael's life was taken, he helped save the lives of four \nother people. All are in good health, leading normal lives today \nbecause Michael was an organ donor.\n  On the day of his death his heart was flown from Montana to Seattle \nto be transplanted in a 4-year-old girl, Paige Roberts. Paige, who was \nborn with a complex heart defect, had been waiting for a donor for 3 \nmonths. This 4-year-old little girl is alive today thanks to Michael.\n  Michael also donated his liver to a Baltimore woman. One of his \nkidneys was given to a girl in Seattle and the other to a woman in \nsouthwest Washington. All are now in good health.\n  The tragedy of Michael's death has given other people the hope of \nlife. We so easily forget how fragile life is. We take for granted the \nadvancement of medicine in this country. Michael's heart was used for \nthe second pediatric heart transplant in Children's history. It is so \neasy to forget that medicine is about saving people's lives. We get \ncaught up in debates about health care and forget the real importance \nof it--it is about saving people's lives.\n  I would also like to mention Michael's mother, Eileen, for her \nstrength. The void left by the absence of Michael can not be easily \nfilled for Eileen or any of the Shea family. It is certainly not easy \nto lose a child that should--in theory--outlive you. Eileen is a model \nmother. She took the time to explain death to Michael when his \ngrandfather died, to explain the significance of being a donor for \nherself and let him come to his own decision on the subject. And \nMichael told her he wanted to be an organ donor. I admire her courage \nwhen faced with the death of a son, she understood the importance of \ngiving life to others.\n  While the sound of Michael's footsteps racing up and down the stairs \nmay have been silenced in Eileen's house, the echo of his generosity \nreminds us all of the fragility of life and the importance of medicine. \nAlthough modern medicine could not save Michael, it did help save four \nother people's lives.\n  We can all learn from Michael's generosity and remember the \nimportance of being a donor. This 8-year-old boy from Dillon, MT, is a \nheroic example for children and adults alike. We should all take the \ntime to fill out a donor card. It is as easy as writing to Living Bank, \nP.O. Box 6725, Houston, TX 77265.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2441-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to \nadopt H.R. 3019, a bill to make continuing appropriations for the \nremainder of fiscal year 1996. During consideration of this \nlegislation, the Senate debated and then voted upon two amendments \nwhich I would like to discuss at this time. The first was an amendment \nby Senators Bond and Mikulski and the second was an amendment by \nSenator Gramm.\n  The Bond-Mikulski amendment included provisions to boost funding for \nenvironment and housing programs. These increases include funding \ndirected to the States to clean up our Nation's water and funding to \nstreamline the programs at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I believe the EPA funding level approved in last year's \nappropriations bill represented a reasonable, responsible allocation \nfor environmental programs and oversight. At the same time, I \nunderstand how important the Superfund program and the EPA's State \nrevolving loan fund for waste and drinking water infrastructure are to \nthe State of Michigan and States across the country. Therefore, largely \nbecause the additional funding was fully offset, I supported this \nmeasure.\n  On the other hand, my support of this en bloc amendment should not be \ninterpreted as support for several of the programs listed, including \nadditional funding for the National Corporation of National Community \nService. Paying Americans tens of thousands of dollars per year to \nvolunteer for community service may be President Clinton's idea of a \ngood program, but it's not mine, and I would prefer to see this funding \neliminated.\n  The Gramm amendment would have struck that spending which remained in \ntitle IV of the bill following the adoption of the Bond/Mikulski and \nSpecter amendments. This funding included $235 million for the Advanced \nTechnology Program and several hundred million in international \naccounts. The President has indicated that without additional funding \nfor programs like the ATP--which provides direct subsidies to some of \nAmerica's wealthiest corporations--he would veto the overall bill and \nshut down the Federal Government once again. I think it is \nunconscionable that the President is willing to threaten all the \nprograms of the Federal Government in order to provide McDonalds, AT, \nand Eastman Kodak with millions in direct subsidies, and for that \nreason I supported Senator Gramm. Earlier amendments by Senators \nSpecter and Bond had gone a long way toward meeting the demands of the \nPresident with regard to education, the environment, and housing. While \nsome programs remaining in title IV are worthy of support, an \noverwhelming amount of the funding would have gone to corporate \nsubsidies and other unnecessary spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/20/senate-section/article/S2441-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2441-S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The text of the bill (H.R. 3019) making appropriations for fiscal \nyear 1996 to make a further downpayment toward a balanced budget, and \nfor other purposes, as passed by the Senate on March 19, 1996, is as \nfollows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 3019) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for \n     fiscal year 1996 to make a further downpayment toward a \n     balanced budget, and for other purposes.'', do pass with the \n     following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: That \n     the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable \n     corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, for the \n     several departments, agencies, corporations, and other \n     organizational units of the Government for the fiscal year \n     1996, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                    TITLE I--OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n       Sec. 101.

PRIMARY PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The primary purpose of the Consensus \n     Commission is to assist in developing a long-term reform plan \n     that has the support of the District of Columbia community \n     through the participation of representatives of various \n     critical segments of such community in helping to develop and \n     approve the plan.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) experience has shown that the failure of the District \n     of Columbia educational system has been due more to the \n     failure to implement a plan than the failure to develop a \n     plan;\n       (2) national studies indicate that 50 percent of secondary \n     school graduates lack basic literacy skills, and over 30 \n     percent of the 7th grade students in the District of Columbia \n     public schools drop out of school before graduating;\n       (3) standard student assessments indicate only average \n     performance for grade level and fail to identify individual \n     students who lack basic skills, allowing too many students to \n     graduate lacking these basic skills and diminishing the worth \n     of a diploma;\n       (4) experience has shown that successful schools have good \n     community, parent, and business involvement;\n       (5) experience has shown that reducing dropout rates in the \n     critical middle and secondary school years requires \n     individual student involvement and attention through such \n     activities as arts or athletics; and\n       (6) experience has shown that close coordination between \n     educators and business persons is required to provide \n     noncollege-bound students the skills necessary for \n     employment, and that personal attention is vitally important \n     to assist each student in developing an appropriate career \n     path.\n\n     SEC. 2853.

In carrying out \n     this demonstration, the Secretary may use arrangements with \n     third parties, under which the Secretary may provide for the \n     assumption by the third parties (by delegation, contract, or \n     otherwise) of some or all of the functions, obligations, and \n     benefits of the Secretary.\n       (1) Goals.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall carry out the demonstration programs under this section \n     in a manner that--\n       (A) will protect the financial interests of the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) will result in significant discretionary cost savings \n     through debt restructuring and subsidy reduction; and\n       (C) will, in the least costly fashion, address the goals \n     of--\n       (i) maintaining existing housing stock in a decent, safe, \n     and sanitary condition;\n       (ii) minimizing the involuntary displacement of tenants;\n       (iii) restructuring the mortgages of such projects in a \n     manner that is consistent with local housing market \n     conditions;\n       (iv) supporting fair housing strategies;\n       (v) minimizing any adverse income tax impact on property \n     owners; and\n       (vi) minimizing any adverse impact on residential \n     neighborhoods.\n\n     In determining the manner in which a mortgage is to be \n     restructured or the subsidy reduced, the Secretary may \n     balance competing goals relating to individual projects in a \n     manner that will further the purposes of this section.\n       (2) Demonstration approaches.--In carrying out the \n     demonstration programs, subject to the appropriation in \n     subsection (f), the Secretary may use one or more of the \n     following approaches:\n       (A) Joint venture arrangements with third parties, under \n     which the Secretary may provide for the assumption by the \n     third parties (by delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some \n     or all of the functions, obligations, and benefits of the \n     Secretary.\n       (B) Subsidization of the debt service of the project to a \n     level that can be paid by an owner receiving an unsubsidized \n     market rent.\n       (C) Renewal of existing project-based assistance contracts \n     where the Secretary shall approve proposed initial rent \n     levels that do not exceed the greater of 120 percent of fair \n     market rents or comparable market rents for the relevant \n     metropolitan market area or at rent levels under a budget-\n     based approach.\n       (D) Nonrenewal of expiring existing project-based \n     assistance contracts and providing tenant-based assistance to \n     previously assisted households.\n       (b) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a)--\n       (1) the Secretary may manage and dispose of multifamily \n     properties owned by the Secretary as of October 1, 1995 and \n     multifamily mortgages held by the Secretary as of October 1, \n     1995 for properties assisted under section 8 with rents above \n     110 percent of fair market rents without regard to any other \n     provision of law; and\n       (2) the Secretary may delegate to one or more entities the \n     authority to carry out some or all of the functions and \n     responsibilities of the Secretary in connection with the \n     foreclosure of mortgages held by the Secretary under the \n     National Housing Act.\n       (c) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a), subject to\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n     such third party consents (if any) as are necessary including \n     but not limited to (i) consent by the Government National \n     Mortgage Association where it owns a mortgage insured by the \n     Secretary; (ii) consent by an issuer under the mortgage-\n     backed securities program of the Association, subject to the \n     responsibilities of the issuer to its security holders and \n     the Association under such program; and (iii) parties to any \n     contractual agreement which the Secretary proposes to modify \n     or discontinue, and subject to the appropriation in \n     subsection (c), the Secretary or one or more third parties \n     designated by the Secretary may take the following actions:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject \n     to the agreement of the project owner, the Secretary or third \n     party may remove, relinquish, extinguish, modify, or agree to \n     the removal of any mortgage, regulatory agreement, project-\n     based assistance contract, use agreement, or restriction that \n     had been imposed or required by the Secretary, including \n     restrictions on distributions of income which the Secretary \n     or third party determines would interfere with the ability of \n     the project to operate without above market rents.

(a) In General.--The Federal Government, and \n     any State or local government that receives Federal financial \n     assistance, may not subject any health care entity to \n     discrimination on the basis that--\n       ``(1) the entity refuses to undergo training in the \n     performance of induced abortions, to require or provide such \n     training, to perform such abortions, or to provide referrals \n     for such training or such abortions;\n       ``(2) the entity refuses to make arrangements for any of \n     the activities specified in paragraph (1); or\n       ``(3) the entity attends (or attended) a postgraduate \n     physician training program, or any other program of training \n     in the health professions, that does not (or did not) perform \n     induced abortions or require, provide or refer for training \n     in the performance of induced abortions, or make arrangements \n     for the provision of such training.\n       ``(b) Accreditation of Postgraduate Physician Training \n     Programs.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In determining whether to grant a legal \n     status to a health care entity (including a license or \n     certificate), or to provide such entity with financial \n     assistance, services or other benefits, the Federal \n     Government, or any State or local government that receives \n     Federal financial assistance, shall deem accredited any \n     postgraduate physician training program that would be \n     accredited but for the accrediting agency's reliance upon an \n     accreditation standards that requires an entity to perform an \n     induced abortion or require, provide, or refer for training \n     in the performance of induced abortions, or make arrangements \n     for such training, regardless of whether such standard \n     provides exceptions or exemptions. The government involved \n     shall formulate such regulations or other mechanisms, or \n     enter into such agreements with accrediting agencies, as are \n     necessary to comply with this subsection.\n       ``(2) Rules of construction.--\n       ``(A) In general.--With respect to subclauses (I) and (II) \n     of section 705(a)(2)(B)(i) (relating to a program of insured \n     loans for training in the health professions), the \n     requirements in such subclauses regarding accredited \n     internship or residency programs are subject to paragraph (1) \n     of this subsection.\n       ``(B) Exceptions.--This section shall not--\n       ``(i) prevent any health care entity from voluntarily \n     electing to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training \n     in the performance of, to perform, or to make referrals for \n     induced abortions; or\n       ``(ii) prevent an accrediting agency or a Federal, State or \n     local government from establishing standards of medical \n     competency applicable only to those individuals who have \n     voluntarily elected to perform abortions.\n       ``(c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       ``(1) The term `financial assistance', with respect to a \n     government program, includes governmental payments provided \n     as reimbursement for carrying out health-related activities.\n       ``(2) The term `health care entity' includes an individual \n     physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a \n     participant in a program of training in the health \n     professions.\n       ``(3) The term `postgraduate physician training program' \n     includes a residency training program.''.\n       Sec. 3014. (a) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Record low temperatures across the country this winter, \n     coupled with record snowfalls in many areas, have generated \n     substantial and sustained demand among eligible low-income \n     Americans for home heating assistance, and put many who face \n     heating-related crises at risk.\n       (2) Home heating assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such help is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas.\n       (3) The President has released approximately $900,000,000 \n     in regular Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) \n     funding for this year, compared to a funding level of \n     $1,319,000,000 last year, and a large LIHEAP funding \n     shortfall remains which has adversely affected eligible \n     recipients in many cold-weather States.\n       (4) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     approximately 6 million low-income Americans to pay their \n     energy bills. More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible \n     households have annual incomes of less than $8,000; more than \n     one-half have annual incomes below $6,000.\n       (5) LIHEAP program funding has been substantially reduced \n     in recent years, and cannot sustain any further spending cuts \n     if the program is to remain a viable means of meeting the \n     home heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     people in cold-weather States.\n       (6) Traditionally, LIHEAP has received advance \n     appropriations for the next fiscal year. This allows States \n     to properly plan for the upcoming winter and best serve the \n     energy needs of low-income families.\n       (7) Congress was not able to pass an appropriations bill \n     for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education by the beginning of this fiscal year and it was \n     only because LIHEAP received advance appropriations last \n     fiscal year that the President was able to release the \n     $578,000,000 he did in December--the bulk of the funds made \n     available to the States this winter.\n       (8) There is currently available to the President up to \n     $300,000,000 in emergency LIHEAP funding, which could be made \n     available immediately, on a targeted basis, to meet the \n     urgent home heating needs of eligible persons who otherwise \n     could be faced with heating-related emergencies, including \n     shut-offs, in the coming weeks.\n       (b) Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should release immediately a substantial \n     portion of available emergency funding for the Low Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Program for fiscal year 1996, to help \n     meet continuing urgent needs for home heating assistance \n     during this unusually cold winter; and\n       (2) not less than the $1,000,000,000 in regular advance-\n     appropriated LIHEAP funding for next winter provided for in \n     this bill should be retained in a House-Senate conference on \n     this measure.\n\n     SEC. 3015.
