Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately \nbegin consideration of the conference report to accompany the energy \nand water appropriations bill. Following the debate, at 11 o'clock the \nSenate will then resume consideration of the Interior appropriations \nbill, with the Bumpers amendment regarding grazing fees pending. The \nSenate will recess for the party conference lunches between the hour of \n12:30 and 2:15 p.m. At 2:15, there will be an additional 20 minutes for \ndebate on the Bumpers amendment and, following that debate, the Senate \nwill proceed to two consecutive votes, first on or in relation to the \nBumpers amendment to be followed immediately by a vote on adoption of \nthe energy and water appropriations conference report.\n  Following those votes, the Senate will resume consideration of the \nInterior appropriations bill and additional votes can be expected on \namendments to that bill this afternoon. It is hoped, with the \ncooperation of our colleagues, the Senate can complete action on the \nInterior appropriations bill this evening, hopefully.\n  Again, Senators can expect busy sessions this week and should plan \naccordingly. It will be almost impossible to complete our Senate \nbusiness in the time we have allocated if Members expect no rollcall \nvotes in the evenings because of prior commitments. Last week I had \nrequests: That we not have votes during the day on Monday or on Monday \nnight; please do not have one on Tuesday morning; could we not have one \non Wednesday night; how about on Thursday? I was thinking maybe we \ncould just stack all the votes at 10 o'clock on Wednesday.\n  I would like to accommodate all Senators, and many of these requests \nare very legitimate. Sometimes they are based on very important \ncommitments or illness or all kinds of things. But I think, during the \nnext few days, as we try to come to the conclusion of this session, \nSenators need to be very hesitant to request such delays in votes.\n  I remind all Senators that, if they insist on offering nongermane \namendments to these appropriations measures, it will only delay \ndisposition of the important spending bills as we approach the end of \nthe fiscal year.\n  Also, we are going to work very hard this afternoon and tomorrow and \nThursday to see if we cannot take up some other issues. Always we try \nto work on conference reports when they are available, particularly if \nthey are appropriations conference reports. We are working to see if we \ncan get some clear understanding on time and very tight limit on \namendments, if any, on the Federal Aviation Administration \nauthorization. We need to get that done before we leave. I would like \nto see if we cannot get that done tonight, with the debate occurring \nafter we complete debate or action on the Interior appropriations. We \nmight take up the FAA authorization, say at 6 or 7, and let all the \ndebate time go on tonight with vote or votes on that occurring first \nthing in the morning.\n  Tomorrow I would like to see if maybe we can do the Magnuson \nfisheries bill. We have a lot of work done on that. We need to get it \ndone before we leave. Again, maybe we could work on the debate during \ntomorrow night, with votes occurring on Thursday morning.\n  We are also going to see what sort of time would be desired if we \ntook up the maritime bill.\n  So, my thinking is during the day, for the most part we will stay on \nthe appropriations bills, either Interior appropriations or the energy \nand water conference report, as we are doing this morning, and then at \nnight we will try to take up some of these authorizations that have \nbeen agreed to or we\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\nare trying to get agreement on. That way we can make good progress \nduring the week.\n  I want to emphasize something I said about nongermane amendments. We \nhave good managers of this bill. This is an important bill. Yes, it has \nsome controversial features in many and various areas, but you have the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Slade Gorton, who has been doing \nvery good work, and the ranking member from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, who are certainly two of the best managers we have. I urge my \ncolleagues do not come in with a lot of nongermane amendments. Last \nweek we saw over 10 amendments offered, most of them nongermane.\n  I have been playing it straight. I am trying to see that we get our \nwork done. But, if we wind up seeing this is just a political game, \nthen we will not be able to get this legislation done. And we will not \ntolerate it. Then we will get into a total political mode. We should do \nthe business of the people and then we can go out and campaign for \nreelection based on political issues that we think need to be debated. \nWe should not do it here on the floor of the Senate with nongermane \namendments. I hope that will not happen this week as it did last week, \nwhich caused us to have to take down the Treasury-Post Office \nappropriations bill. Apparently we will not be able to get it back up. \nSo we will just have to put that bill in the continuing resolution, \nwhich I hope we can get an agreement on sometime by the end of the week \nand vote on in some form next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10617-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10618-S10624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Under the previous order, the \nreport on H.R. 3816 will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3816) making appropriations for energy and water development \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 12, 1996.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 11 a.m. will be divided: 15 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici]; 15 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston]; \n15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]; \nthe remaining 15 minutes under control of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon].\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the floor the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 3816, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  This conference report passed the House last Thursday by a vote of \n383 to 29. I thank again the former chairman of the subcommittee, and \nnow ranking member, for his assistance in developing this bill.\n  I also thank the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, \nformer chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, Senator Hatfield, for his help in bringing this bill \nbefore the Senate. His guidance and assistance with regard to \nallocations has been of tremendous importance, and the subcommittee is \nindebted to his leadership.\n  This conference report is consistent with the allocations set forth \nin the Senate Report 104-320. Specifically, the conference provides \n$11.352 billion in budget authority and $11.39 million in outlays for \ndefense activities.\n  For nondefense activities, the conference report provides \n$8,620,000,837 in budget authority and $8.884 billion in outlays.\n  These levels are significantly above the levels of the House-passed \nbill but below the levels provided by the Senate and passed as its \nenergy and water development bill.\n  Of the $700 million difference between the House and Senate on the \nproposed level of defense spending in this act, the conferees retain \n$500 million--a long way toward the Senate position but still $200 \nmillion less than the Senate-passed bill.\n  In other words, we funded $200 million more of defense programs in \nthis bill when it passed the Senate than this bill has in it as it \nreturns from conference.\n\n  For nondefense spending, the conferees were provided an allocation of \n$100 million above the original House allocation--better than a split \nof the $187 million difference between the two bills. Nonetheless, it \nis $87 million less for the nondefense portion than it was when it \npassed the Senate.\n  Why do I make these points on the $200 million and the $87 million? \nBecause some projects and activities that were in the bill as it passed \nthe Senate are not in the bill as it returns from the House. That is \nbecause there was less money allocated and arrived at as an agreement \nbetween the two bodies on what could be spent from the overall budget. \nBut, clearly, we are within the caps established for defense. We have \nnot used any more than the allocation. In fact, we returned some of the \ndefense allocation to the full committee for them to use either in \ndefense or otherwise. That will, obviously, be reallocated if it is not \nvery soon so that we can get on with trying to solve some of the \nproblems in other bills and other needs.\n  To the best of our abilities, the conferees have sought to protect \nscience and technology programs from significant reductions while \nproviding for the water projects of importance to so many Members.\n  In essence, this is a very interesting bill. Clearly, a majority of \nthe funding goes to the Department of Defense activities within the \nDOE. Nonetheless, there is a large portion that is not defense \nactivities, and that is domestic activities which essentially are made \nup predominantly of water projects, reclamation projects, and the like, \nof both the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Everyone \nknows with reference to both of those entities and the projects that as \nthey run, operate, start, and complete, the funding is going down, not \nup.\n  Again, we were not able to give every State the projects in flood \ncontrol and the like that Senators had requested, but we think we have \ndone as good a job as the money would permit.\n  Mr. President, on page 37 of the report before us there is a \ntypographical error. I would like to just read the paragraph at the \nbottom of page 37.\n\n       The conferees have, however, included language in the bill \n     which directs the Secretary of the Army to begin implementing \n     a plan to reduce the number of division offices to no more \n     than eight and no less than six on April 1, 1997, which \n     provides authority for the Corps of Engineers to transfer up \n     to $1.5 million into this account from other accounts in this \n     title to--\n\n  ``Mitigate'' should be the word, and not ``investigate.''\n\n       Mitigate impacts in the delay in the implementation of the \n     division closure plan.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes and talk about the \nranking member, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, from the State of \nLouisiana, who has for many years been chairman of this subcommittee \nand has served in various capacities, including chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee of the Senate. He has decided that he \nis not going to seek reelection, and thus will leave the Senate.\n  In 1972, when I came to the U.S. Senate, I was met by a lot of new \nfaces, people I had never known, or people I had perhaps read a little \nbit about. One of those new Senators was J. Bennett Johnston.\n  I would like to state the relationship for the last 24 years. While \nwe have to some extent gone our own ways in work around here, Senator \nJohnston and the Senator from New Mexico have had a rare opportunity to \nwork together in many, many areas that I believe have been very \nimportant to our country. He has become an expert in the area of \nnuclear energy. He is courageous in that area second to none. He \nunderstands it. He is not frightened by it. He gets good science and \ngood engineering. He takes the initiative to try to get the facts where \nmany would seek not to have facts, but rather to predicate their \narguments on sentiments\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\nand on ideologies. He seeks to get the facts in the field of energy.\n  So I conclude that he is also one of the best experts on the research \ncapabilities of our Nation in that he has worked diligently to \nunderstand the national laboratories, a number of which are under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Energy. In fact, I believe there is \nno better friend of basic science research than J. Bennett Johnston in \nthe U.S. Congress. He has not only spoken to it and has become expert \nat it, he has acted accordingly. He has become an ally of the United \nStates maintaining the highest level of science in the Department of \nEnergy through its nuclear defense laboratories.\n  Today, I want to thank him for his efforts, congratulate him for his \nwisdom, his vision and, most of all, his courage. And I believe I would \nbe remiss if I did not say that J. Bennett Johnston is without peer in \nthe U.S. Senate when it comes to legislators. When it comes to sitting \naround working with Senators, trying to get a bill passed, he is a \nmaster. He is going to be missed. This committee is going to miss him. \nThe Energy and Water Committee is going to miss him. The U.S. Senate \nwill miss him, and the Congress will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Coats, from Indiana, on the floor. I \ninquire, would he like to speak on the bill now?\n  Mr. COATS. I have a hearing this morning at 10. If I could do that \nnow, I will not take a lot of time. I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield the floor so he can use some of his \ntime. The other Senator who desired to speak, for whom time is \nreserved, is Senator Simon from Illinois. I would like to put him on \nnotice, at this point we do not intend to use our 45 minutes, just a \nsmall portion of it. Senator Johnston is not going to use any of his \ntime. So, it would seem that the Senator from Illinois should be \nprepared to make his 15-minute remarks very soon. I hope he will be \nprepared to do that.\n  I do not mean to make things unaccommodating but, frankly, we do not \nneed 45 minutes. I do not have any objections of any significant nature \nto this bill.\n  I yield at this point to the distinguished Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nyielding this time. I asked for the time in order to explain the \nsituation to our colleagues over the whole issue of out-of-State trash.\n  As my colleagues know, this has been an issue that I have been \nrelentlessly pursuing now for 7 years or so, with great success in the \nU.S. Senate but lousy success in the House of Representatives, in terms \nof getting a bill to conference that we can then work out our \ndifferences on and put on the President's desk for signature.\n  Five times in the last 6 years the U.S. Senate has voted for \nlegislation I have presented regarding this question of out-of-State \ntrash, and voted so in a fairly overwhelming, bipartisan fashion. The \nbills that we have presented have been the work of some very diligent \nand painstaking work with our colleagues and their staffs to attempt to \nfind a resolution to a very difficult problem that exists in almost \nevery one of our States.\n  Many of our States, because of their population or their geographic \nlocation, environmental concerns or others, find themselves in a \nposition where they are not able to adequately dispose of the volumes \nof trash that are generated on a day-to-day basis. Other States have \nless density and capacity to receive some of that trash.\n  We are not attempting to impede the negotiated transfer of that trash \nfrom exporting States to importing States. What we are attempting to \ndo, and what I have attempted to do now over the last 6 or 7 years, is \nto fashion a way in which the importing States, of which I represent \none, have a say in the process.\n  Right now, because the Supreme Court has decreed over a number of \ndecisions that garbage, interstate trash, is considered interstate \ncommerce, the States have virtually no authority to regulate or to \nmonitor or to place any limitations on the amount of out-of-State trash \nthat comes into their particular States.\n  My effort has been to put them at the table so that they can sit down \nwith the exporting States and find a way to negotiate, if it is in \ntheir best interest--and it is in the interest of many States to \nreceive this because it is commerce and it does generate revenue--but \nalso to say that either we cannot do this now or our own needs have \nplaced us in a situation where we are at capacity and we cannot receive \nyour trash, and you will have to work something else out. In other \nwords, we want to give the recipient communities and States the right \nto dictate their own environmental future as it relates to the \ngeneration of everyday trash, which is literally millions of tons \nacross this country.\n  Recognizing the problems of the exporting States, recognizing the \nproblems of the importing States, we have been able to work with \nSenators, Governors, legislators, experts, waste haulers and others to \nfashion a compromise piece of legislation which gives importing States \nthe right to say no or to limit reasonably, but which also preserves \nthe right of exporting States to enter into agreements with the \nrecipient States and/or counties and/or municipalities if they so \ndesire.\n  As I said, these measures have passed the Senate in an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan fashion, only to hit a roadblock, particularly in the last \nCongress, in the House of Representatives. The relevant subcommittee in \nthe House passed out a measure, I believe, by unanimous vote but was \nnever able to secure a full Commerce Committee hearing or full Commerce \nCommittee disposition of that issue. And so, because that has been \nstalled in the other body now for more than a year, because our \nprevious efforts have been frustrated, sometimes in the House, \nsometimes in the Senate, but frustrated in terms of completing the \nprocess, I took the opportunity, along with Senator Levin, to search \nout a vehicle which we thought was as close to relevant as we could \nget, and attach what the Senate had passed, on an overwhelming basis--\n94-6, a pretty solid vote--attach that to the energy and water \nappropriations bill.\n  That is not my preferred option. My preferred option is to make it a \nstand-alone bill, as we did in the Senate, and have the House take it \nup in a stand-alone bill, but we were thwarted in that effort on the \nHouse side. So we thought, is there a way we can jump-start this \nprocess in the House? So we attached it to the energy and water \nappropriations bill, which then passed the Senate and went over to the \nHouse.\n  After some diligent efforts to encourage the conference committee to \npass back to the House and the Senate their conference bill with the \nSenate trash amendment attached, we were disappointed to learn that the \nHouse, despite some diligent efforts on the part of some Indiana \ncolleagues and others, friends in the House who supported this effort, \nCongressman Souder, Congressman Buyer, Congressman Visclosky, \nRepublicans and Democrats, we were not able to secure approval from the \nHouse conferees on this matter. So the energy and water bill conference \nreport comes back to us without the interstate trash measure attached.\n  I am bitterly disappointed that once again we are unable to deal \nsuccessfully with a problem that everybody knows needs to be dealt \nwith. It is not just my State of Indiana, which has seen a fairly \ndramatic decrease in the amount of trash come into the State. Since I \nhave taken such a vocal and active role, I think maybe the exporters \nand trash haulers are trying to tone down my rhetoric or dampen my \nenthusiasm for moving forward on this legislation. But what has \nhappened is that trash has simply moved to another State--Pennsylvania, \nOhio, Kentucky, Michigan, Virginia. A number of other States have now \nbecome unwanted recipients and virtually have no power to do anything \nabout it.\n  By the same token, we have seen a fairly dramatic increase in the \nexport of trash to Indiana. The first two quarters of 1996 now total \nalmost the entire amount we received in 1995. So our line has gone back \nup, and the problem is becoming serious again in Indiana.\n  But I am really here speaking for a broad coalition of States, of \nmembers of both parties, of Governors who represent both the Democrat \nand Republican parties, of States that feel that\n\n[[Page S10620]]\n\nthey have no control over their environmental future, over their \nenvironmental destiny. And they are basically saying, ``Look, we're \ntaking care of our problem intrastate, and we are simply asking that we \nhave an opportunity to address successfully our environmental goals in \ndisposing of our own waste without being overwhelmed by someone else's \nenvironmental problems that are loaded onto trucks and loaded onto \ntrains, on a daily basis, shipped overnight, and dumped in our \nlandfills.''\n  We have landfills in Indiana that, by referendum and painstaking \nefforts on the part of municipalities, have been created, with the \npromise to the taxpayers, the promise to the citizens of the community, \nthat it will take care of disposal needs for that municipality or that \ncounty for 15, 20, 30 years in the future. And so bond referendums are \npassed, the taxpayers commit to it, only to find out those landfills \nare filled up in 2 years by a massive influx of out-of-State waste over \nwhich we have no ability to say no or to let us reason together here. \n``We can't take yours, but there's one down the road that might be able \nto accept it, or you can enter into an agreement, and maybe if we can \nwork out some negotiated payments, and so forth, we can create a bigger \ncapacity, and we will take it to generate revenue for our communities \nand our schools and our roads,'' et cetera.\n\n  So here we are now with the energy and water conference report back \nwithout the trash. Trash, once again, has been allowed to flow without \nany reasonable restraints. I regret that.\n  But I wanted to let my colleagues know the diligent efforts that we \nhave been making in the Senate, the representation of our Senate \nconferees, Senator Domenici, Senator Johnston, representing the Senate \nposition, but we simply were not able to prevail over the House \nposition and those in charge who wanted to keep the energy and water \nappropriations report free of this particular legislation. I realize it \nis not directly relevant, but I am frustrated that I do not have any \nopportunity to move the process forward except to offer these kinds of \namendments.\n\n  I will conclude simply by putting the majority leader on notice that \nSenator Levin and I, Senator Specter and others, are seriously \nconsidering adding an amendment to a continuing resolution if, in fact, \nwe have to have a continuing resolution--not because we want to make \nthe majority leader's life any more difficult than it already is, not \nbecause we want to delay the Senate adjournment, not because we think \nit even necessarily belongs on a continuing resolution, but because we \nhave literally run out of options.\n  It will do no good in the Senate to pass the bill a third time. The \nHouse has made every possible effort--maybe there are some other means \nthey could use between now and the end of the session to try to force \nthe key people in the House to accept some type of legislation that \ndeals with this so we can at least get to conference and resolve our \ndifferences. Every effort that has been attempted over there has come \nup with an inability to finalize the process. So we will be looking at \nthat.\n  I just want to put the majority leader and my colleagues on notice \nthat this issue is not going to go away. It is not getting any better. \nIt is getting much worse for many, many States. As long as I have \nbreath and am privileged to represent the people of Indiana in the U.S. \nSenate, I am going to look for every way possible to pass this \nlegislation to give our States and other States the right that I \nbelieve they should constitutionally have to make decisions that affect \ntheir own environmental destiny, their own futures, and deal with their \nproblems.\n  It is reasonable legislation. We have every reason to believe it is \nconstitutional legislation. The Court has clearly said that this \nCongress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce. We are not \nattempting to stop interstate commerce. We are simply attempting to put \nthe receiver and the Senator at the table so they can reasonably \nnegotiate this flow of trash from one State to another without imposing \none State's burden on another State, when that State has no ability to \nnegotiate terms.\n  I want to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his efforts in \nhelping us to try to move the Senate position. I want to thank the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, for his efforts. I know I \nhave loaded their bill with something that they were not happy to see, \nbut yet they attempted to advance the Senate position. They have been \nsupporters of my efforts. I appreciate their efforts. I know they feel \nit is also unfortunate that we have not been able to move this. With \nthat, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 31 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to speak for 2 minutes \nbecause I see Senator Simon is here and would like to speak.\n  Senator McCain asked that we seek a rollcall vote. Therefore, I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Coats, I think oftentimes in the \nCongress it takes a lot longer for good things to get done than anybody \naround would ever imagine. I believe the cause that the Senator is \ntalking about here today is one of those.\n  The reason I helped on the floor is because it is inconceivable to me \nthat we will not make the Coats legislation the law of the land, it has \nsuch overwhelming support in this body. If you really have a vote in \nthe House of Representatives, it has overwhelming support there.\n  I am very sorry we are going to conference with a major piece of \nauthorizing legislation that was not in the House bill--that I could \nnot succeed in keeping it there. Obviously, the House has different \nfactions in regard to this bill. We were caught by those factions and \nsomething procedural that is not part of the Senate's business. We did \nthe right thing here in the Senate to give it a try.\n  I thank you for your kind remarks this morning. I think we did \neverything we could and still get a bill on appropriations. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for \nyielding.\n  I rise to express concern as to what is not in this bill. Thanks to \nthe cooperation of Senator Domenici--on a piece of legislation that is \ncosponsored by Senator Brown, the Presiding Officer--we did pass \nlegislation authorizing research in the area of converting salt water \nto fresh water.\n  Now, that may seem not very important, but long term, 20 years from \nnow--if I am around 20 years from now; the Presiding Officer will be \naround--the headlines in the newspapers are not likely to be about oil. \nThey are likely to be about water.\n\n  Let me give a capsule of where we are in the world and what we need \nto do to start moving ahead in the same way that Senator Domenici has \nbeen moving ahead on mental health. Sometimes you have to lose a few \nbattles before you win the battles. We are in a situation where, \ndepending on whose estimate you believe, in the next 45 to 60 years we \nwill double the world's population. Our water supply, however, is \nconstant. Now, you do not need to be an Einstein to understand we are \nheaded for major problems. Yet 97 percent of the world's water we \ncannot use. It is salt water. We live on less than 3 percent of the \nwater. I say less than 3 percent because a lot of the fresh water is \ntied up in snow and icebergs and other things. We are headed toward \nmajor problems.\n  The World Bank says in 20 years 35 nations will have severe water \nproblems. You can find substitutes for oil. There is no substitute for \nwater. That is why people like President Sadat, the late Prime Minister \nRabin and others have said if there is another war in the Middle East, \nit will not be over land, it will be over water.\n  There have been people in the past who have recognized this need. It \nis interesting, Mr. President, that Dwight Eisenhower, President of the \nUnited States, did on several occasions mention that this is an area we \nhave to move ahead on. In his final message to Congress, his final \nState of the Union Message, Dwight Eisenhower said one of the things we \nhave to work on is finding less expensive ways of converting salt water \nto fresh water. The reality is the cost of fresh water is gradually \ngoing up, the cost of desalinating\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nwater is gradually coming down, but there is a great gap there. That \ngreat gap is going to hurt us unless we move in the area of research. \nWhat I was trying to do and what we had on the floor here is we put $5 \nmillion out of the $14 million that are authorized.\n  Dwight Eisenhower was not alone. In 1962, John F. Kennedy was asked \nat a press conference, What is the most important scientific \nbreakthrough you would like to see during your term as President? He \nsaid, ``You heard me talking about getting a man to the Moon, but let \nme tell you if you really want to do something for humanity, we should \nfind a less expensive way of converting salt water to fresh water.''\n  Almost 70 percent of the world's population lives within 50 miles of \nthe ocean. If we could get a breakthrough on converting salt water to \nfresh water, California would not have the problems it is heading \ntoward and California could share water with New Mexico and other \nStates. I was looking through reports on rural water districts and was \nlooking at New Mexico the other day, and in New Mexico, unlike Illinois \nand many other States, there is an inadequate water supply for a lot of \nrural communities. Desalination, in some cases converting brackish \nwater to fresh water--primarily we have to be looking toward converting \nseawater to fresh water. And it is interesting--I was in Israel about 3 \nweeks ago. I met with the new Prime Minister and with former Prime \nMinister Shimon Peres. Let me tell you, every Israeli public official \ncan speak very knowledgeably about water because it is so crucial to \ntheir future. We have not had a significant breakthrough since 1978 in \nthis research. At one point, in current dollars, we were up to about \n$121 million a year that we were spending in research. It has gone \ndown. Incidentally, sometimes you accidentally get breakthroughs. \nThrough the breakthrough in reverse osmosis, we developed a \nbreakthrough in renal dialysis for people who have kidney disease. It \nused to be, if you had kidney disease and you wanted to have renal \nassistance, you had to go to a hospital. It was a very complicated \nprocess. It is still not good, but there was a significant \nbreakthrough. But we need to get additional breakthroughs at this time. \nIt is just vital to the future of humanity.\n\n  In areas that do not grow any crops, like much of New Mexico, if you \nget enough water there, all of a sudden, it is going to be very \nproductive land. There is nothing that could do as much to lift the \nstandard of living of humanity, as a whole, than to find less expensive \nways of converting salt water to fresh water. When you double the \nworld's population--and I stress that every estimate is that we are \ngoing to double the world's population either in 45 years or 60 years. \nI have seen, in my lifetime--and I was born in 1928--a tripling of the \nworld population. Fortunately, we have been able to produce enough food \nso that the quality of life for most people on the face of the Earth \nhas gone up. That will not continue, unless we find another supply of \nwater.\n  Converting salt water to fresh water is inexpensive enough for \ndrinking purposes. But the difficulty is that almost 90 percent of the \nwater we use is for industrial and agricultural purposes. That, today, \nis far too expensive.\n  One of our problems in Government--and I say this to the Presiding \nOfficer, who is retiring along with me and, I think, maybe looks at \nthese things from a little perspective--one of our problems in \nGovernment, as is the problem in American business today, is that we \nare much too short term in our outlooks. In politics, we are looking at \nthe next election and what is going to happen. In business, it is the \nnext quarterly report or the next stockholders meeting. One of the \nthings, long term, that is vital to humanity, is seeing to it that we \nhave water--water to grow crops, water for industry, water to drink. \nThis water that we take for granted is not something that can be taken \nfor granted in the future.\n  I mention this now not to raise opposition to this bill, but I will \nbe trying to put this small--and it is small, relative to where we \nshould be--my colleague, Senator Harry Reid said to me, ``It is almost \nembarrassing that we are just asking for $5 million when you have such \na pressing need.'' I am going to do my best to see that on the \ncontinuing resolution we have some money for this purpose. It really is \nvital to the future of our country. It is vital to the future of \ncivilization. I hope we can move in a constructive direction.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time \nremains now, and who has time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 29 minutes 22 \nseconds. The Senator from Illinois has 4 minutes 54 seconds.\n  In addition, other time is reserved for Senator Levin from Michigan, \nwho has 15 minutes, and Senator Johnston from Louisiana, who has 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me repeat, using my time, for Senator Levin, I \nunderstand that, according to the consent order, we could be here until \n11, and, technically, he could come here 15 minutes before and use his \ntime. I hope he tries to get here sooner than that because we are going \nto be finished soon, and I will yield back whatever time I have and \nleave the floor for Senator Levin. Let me take a couple of minutes to \nengage in dialog.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On my time, let me compliment the Senator from \nIllinois. As on much legislation around here, he has, again, taken a \nfarsighted view. I hope when you speak of living near oceans, you will \nadd to your thoughts and comments that there are millions who live near \nbrackish pools that look like seas, they are so big. We have a giant \none around the community of Alamogordo, NM, a huge brackish underground \nreservoir. It varies in its degree of salinization. On one end, it is \nalmost fresh. On the other end, it is contaminated mostly by salt.\n  It would transform many situations in our Nation, much less the \nworld, to water-supply long instead of water-supply short. I am not \nsure that $5 million would do the job. I think it is appropriate--and \nthe Senator alluded to it--other countries are spending significant \nmoney. I know that in the Middle East substantial money is being spent \nby Israel, and others, in attempting to make the scientific \nbreakthroughs. Obviously, we have many ways that we have proven up \nscientifically to produce potable water for drinking. It is economic in \nthat sense. People are going to have drinking water, because of a \nnumber of breakthroughs of the last decade, at rather reasonable rates. \nIt is the larger context of need that desalinization looks like a very \nexciting and much-needed technology that we ought to work on.\n  The Senator alluded to the last time we funded desalinization \nprojects. The last desalinization plant attempting to make \nbreakthroughs was actually Roswell, NM. It existed for 3 or 4 years \nafter everything else was shut down in the program. Frankly, the costs \nwere extremely high at that point, in terms of whether we were anywhere \nclose to a breakthrough. I assume much technology has gone through the \npipeline since then, and we are probably getting closer.\n  I am sorry that the House would not accept your $5 million proposal. \nObviously, we had a lot of requests and a shortage of money. On the \ndomestic side, which this would be, it is not part of the defense \nprograms in this bill. We actually had to remove many projects, or \nreduce them dramatically, that both Houses considered as being good. \nThat is because we did not have enough money. This one fell to the \nHouse's action on the basis that they did not consider it and they did \nnot have appropriate hearings in the House. I regret that is the case.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield, let me say that the conversion \nof brackish water is less expensive than the conversion of sea water. \nIt is one of these areas where the two work together. If we can find \nthe answer for one, we are going to find the answer for the other.\n  The Senator is correct that other nations are doing more. It is very \ninteresting that the metropolitan water district of Los Angeles, which \nis the biggest water district in the United States--maybe in the world, \nI don't know--is doing some research on desalinization. They are \ngetting $3 million in aid from Israel for their experiment, for their \nresearch. You know, we really should not have to depend on foreign aid \nto get this research done.\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\n  We ought to be working with other countries. I am not going to be \nhere next year. I hope we can get a small start for the $5 million yet \nthis year in the continuing resolution. And then I hope in the future, \nwhen Senator Domenici, Senator Specter, and others are here, that \nSenator Domenici can push this area that is so important.\n  Let me just add one final word. Shimon Peres wrote a book in which he \nsays that the real key to stabilizing the Middle East is finding less \nexpensive ways of converting saltwater to freshwater. That was one of \nthe points that Dwight Eisenhower made a long time ago.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n\n\n                       budget impact of h.r. 3816\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, H.R. 3816, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 1997, is well within its budget \nallocation of budget authority and outlays.\n  The conference report provides $20 billion in budget authority and \n$13.1 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain dependent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $19.9 billion in outlays.\n  For defense discretionary programs, the conference report is below \nits allocation by $248 million in budget authority and $194 million in \noutlays. The conference report also is below its nondefense \ndiscretionary allocation by $87 million in budget authority and $85 \nmillion in outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this conference report be inserted in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT   \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Budget          \n                                                      authority  Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........    2,863\n    H.R. 3816, conference report....................    11,352     8,176\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal defense discretionary..............    11,352    11,039\n                                                     ===================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........    3,970\n    H.R. 3816, conference report....................     8,621     4,914\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........     8,621     8,884\n                                                     ===================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........  .......\n    H.R. 3816, conference report....................  .........  .......\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget Resolution assumptions..................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Subtotal mandatory..........................  .........  .......\n                                                     ===================\n        Adjusted bill total.........................    19,973    19,923\n                                                     ===================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary...........................    11,600    11,233\n    Nondefense discretionary........................     8,708     8,969\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .......\n    Mandatory.......................................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Total allocation............................    20,308    20,202\n                                                     ===================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary...........................      -248      -194\n    Nondefense discretionary........................       -87       -85\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .......\n    Mandatory.......................................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n        Total allocation............................      -335      -279\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend. While there has been an overall \nreduction from the budget request for the environmental restoration and \nwaste management nondefense account, I would like to get an \nunderstanding from the chairman as to the priority the committee places \non meeting the vitrification and closure schedule at the West Valley \ndemonstration project in western New York. The project has been able to \nmaintain schedule and progress while accommodating budget reductions \nover the past 6 years.\n  The project began pouring glass this summer and is currently poised \nto complete this phase on or ahead of schedule. The project is also at \na crucial juncture regarding the completion of the work necessary to \nultimately close the site. Would the chairman agree that the Department \nof Energy should spend the funds from this account necessary to keep \nthis project on schedule?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In order to stay within the nondefense allocation \nprovided to the conferees it was necessary to reduce funding for a \nnumber of programs including the nondefense Environmental Restoration \nand Waste Management Program. To the extent possible, the Department \nshould apply those reductions in a manner that minimizes delay and \nimpact on on-going, high priority activities such as the West Valley \ndemonstration project.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                  Animas-Laplata Participating Project\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to make just a few brief \ncomments on one important provision adopted into the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 3816, the fiscal year 1997 energy and water \nappropriation measure. However, I would first like to recognize and \ncommend the work of the conference committee for their efforts to \ndevelop a conference agreement that is acceptable to many Members of \nthis Chamber, recognizing and settling several controversial issues \nthat had to be dealt with in conference.\n  Mr. President, one provision the conference committee had to address \nduring its deliberations was the issue of continuing funding for the \nAnimas-LaPlata participating project in southwestern Colorado. I \nappreciate the efforts of the conference committee for appropriating $9 \nmillion in fiscal year 1997 to permit the Bureau of Reclamation to \ncontinue their efforts with construction costs associated with the A-LP \nproject.\n  As was discussed in great length and voted upon previously in both \nChambers of the Congress, the completion of the A-LP participating \nproject has both tremendous Federal Indian policy implications as well \nas an incalculable tangible impact for many water users in southwest \nColorado and northern New Mexico. When the Congress passed, and \nPresident Reagan signed into law, the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1988, the Federal Government guaranteed to the two \nColorado Ute Indian tribes a final settlement of their outstanding \nwater rights claims in a solution that would also allow them to put to \nuse their entitled share of settlement water.\n  In addition, the 1988 Settlement Act reconfirmed the commitment of \nthe Federal Government to assist water users in the San Juan River \nbasin in the development of an adequate water storage system. Cities \nsuch as Durango, CO, to Farmington, NM, stand to benefit from \ncompletion of the A-LP project, and equally important, traditional \nagricultural users will also benefit.\n  While I am glad the conference committee provided funding based on \nthe practical merits of the A-LP project, I am dismayed that actions of \nthe administration, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency \n[EPA], continue to cause undue and very costly delays to full \nimplementation of the 1988 settlement. One very clear example of the \negregious behavior on the part of the EPA is their inability to work \nactively and constructively with the Bureau of Reclamation and other \nDepartment of Interior agencies to resolve outstanding environmental \ncompliance issues on the project.\n  As recently as a few weeks ago, the EPA again requested of the \nCommissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation an additional 90 days to \nreview the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement [FSEIS]. \nMr. President, this action comes after the EPA had already requested \none other 90-day extension for review.\n  Further, in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee \non VA, HUD, and independent agencies in May of this year, EPA \nAdministrator Carol Browner testified that by August 26, 1996, the EPA \nwould make a determination to, either, sign off on the project or refer \nthe matter to the President's Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ]. \nWell, here we are, September 17, and no decisions have been made.\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\n  I make this point, because as a Member of this Chamber, each of us is \nresponsible and accountable for every taxpayer dollar we spend. When \nthe actions of an agency, such as the EPA, continue to stall the full \nimplementation of a statute signed into law in 1988, merely for \npolitical purposes, who loses? The taxpayer loses due to added costs \nassociated with further delay.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the energy and water \nconference committee for their continued support for the A-LP project, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues on the respective \ncommittees of jurisdiction to ensure that adequate congressional \noversight is put in place to permit the timely progression of the \nproject.\n\n\n                             Corect Program\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, in 1988, Congress passed and President \nReagan signed in law the CORECT program. This program established a \nfederal interagency board to coordinate renewable energy exports and \nhas been a very successful example of how a very small program, funded \nat $2 million per year, can drive the tools of the U.S. Government to \nassist small businesses in gaining international market share. For \nexample, the U.S. solar industry exports over 85 percent of its product \nand has now ribbon-cut four new automated manufacturing plants in the \nUnited States to meet the growing global markets.\n  I am concerned that the energy and water development appropriations \nconference report, now before the Senate, could be interpreted as \nclosing down the CORECT program. Let me clarify with my friend from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, that the pending legislation is not to be \ninterpreted as terminating the CORECT program and that the Department \nof Energy may utilize other available funds to continue this program, \neven though Congress has provided no funding for the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am well aware of the CORECT program. I \nwant to assure the Senator from Oregon that the Department of Energy is \nfree to propose reprogramming up to $2 million from other programs to \nsupport the CORECT program. I assure my colleague from Oregon that the \nsubcommittee will expeditiously review any such request.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I want to thank my friend for his clarification of this \nimportant matter.\n\n\n                                 Fusion\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. As my good friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee and many other Members are \naware, the subcommittee continues to support a strong Fusion Energy \nSciences Program. As noted in the report language accompanying the \nSenate bill, the committee is pleased by the efforts of the fusion \ncommunity over the past year to restructure the fusion program. \nHowever, despite our best attempts to keep the budget essentially level \nthis year, we were forced to accept a cut in this important program \nbecause of the constraints imposed by the overall low level of funding \nfor the nondefense programs in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to get some additional clarification from my \ngood friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, about the statement of managers language \naccompanying the Fusion Energy Sciences Program. The language calls for \nthe operation and safe shutdown of the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor in \nfiscal year 1997. Is it the chairman's understanding that this language \ncan in any way be interpreted to imply a particular funding level or \nlength or operation for the TFTR in fiscal year 1997?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my good friend from Louisiana for pointing out \nthe importance of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and for his \nquestion. The conferees did not specify the level of funding to be \nprovided to the TFTR in fiscal year 1997. We recognized that, because \nthe Congress has not provided the full amount of the request for the \nFusion Program, reductions within the program will be necessary. Those \nreductions will include a reduction in the funds provided to the TFTR. \nIt is the Department's responsibility to determine the proper \nallocation of funds from within the amount provided in the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the chairman and note for the record that his \nunderstanding and expectation on this issue match mine.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I strongly support the conference report \nto accompany the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill. \nIncluded in the fiscal year 1997 energy and water conference report is \nan amendment that I authored to amend the Northwest Power Act. My \namendment, which has received bipartisan support, would amend the \nNorthwest Power Act to establish an independent scientific review panel \nand peer review groups, to review annual projects to be funded with BPA \nratepayer moneys.\n  Each year, roughly $100 million in BPA ratepayer dollars are spent to \nfund fish and wildlife projects that support the Northwest Power \nPlanning Council's fish and wildlife plan. The Northwest Power Planning \nCouncil is the regional body, created by the Northwest Power Act, that \nprovides advice and input to BPA in spending the annual $100 million in \nfish and wildlife funds. The purpose of the council program is to \nprotect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife populations along the \nColumbia and Snake River system.\n  Currently, the single body that provides advice to the council on the \nexpenditure of these funds, is the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife \nAuthority [CBFWA]. CBFWA is made up of affected tribal officials, State \nfish and wildlife managers, and representatives from the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Prior to my \namendment, CBFWA members had recommended that roughly 75 percent of the \n$100 million annual expenditure go to fund projects that would be \ncarried out by CBFWA members. This is a most serious conflict of \ninterest, one that was brought to my attention several months ago by \nconstituents in my State.\n  Let me be clear, CBFWA's advice is important. But, I believe that BPA \nratepayers expect their hard earned dollars to be spent wisely--not to \nfund the projects of a select number of groups.\n  My amendment requires the independent scientific review of projects \nproposed for funding under BPA's annual program and would remove any \nsuggestion of conflict of interest in prioritizing programs. I believe \nthat advice of independent scientists with expertise on the enhancement \nof Columbia River fish and wildlife will result in successful \nimplementation of the Northwest Power Planning Council's fish and \nwildlife program. The council recently recognized the need for \nindependent science recently, and together with the National Marine \nFisheries Service, has established an Independent Scientific Advisory \nBoard [ISAB] in order to provide scientific advice to the council and \nNMFS on the council's plan for fish and wildlife for the river system.\n  My amendment directs the National Academy of Sciences to submit a \nlist of individuals to the council to serve on an Independent \nScientific Review Panel to review projects for funding under BPA's \nannual fish and wildlife program. I would like to make clear that \nnothing in the bill language precludes NAS from recommending the same \nscientists that serve on the ISAB to serve on the newly created \nIndependent Scientific Review Panel, provided that members meet the \nconflict of interest standards spelled out in the bill language. If \nISAB scientists are selected to serve on the newly created panel, such \nscientists should not be compensated twice for their services.\n  My amendment also requires that the council establish, from a list \nsubmitted by NAS, scientific peer review groups to assist the panel in \nmaking its recommendations to the council. Projects will be reviewed \nbased upon the following criteria: Projects benefit fish and wildlife \nin the region; have a clearly defined objective and outcome; and are \nbased on sound science principles.\n  After review of the projects by the panel and peer review groups, the \npanel will submit its recommendations on projects priorities to the \ncouncil for consideration. The council will then make the panel's \nrecommendations available to the public for review.\n  The council is required to review recommendations of the panel, the \nColumbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority,\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\nand others, in making its final recommendations to BPA of projects to \nbe funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget. If the council \ndoes not follow the advice of the panel, it is to explain in writing \nthe basis for its decision.\n  Mr. President, an important part of my amendment requires the council \nto consider the impacts of ocean conditions in making its \nrecommendations to BPA to fund projects. Ocean conditions include, but \nare not limited to, such considerations as El Nino and other conditions \nthat impact fish and wildlife populations. My amendment also directs \nthe council to determine whether project recommendations employ cost \neffective measures to achieve its objectives. I want to make an \nimportant point here, Mr. President, the bill language expressly states \nthat the council, after review of panel and other recommendations, has \nthe authority to make final recommendations to BPA on project(s) to be \nfunded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget. This language was \nincluded to clear up any confusion as to the council's authority to \nmake final recommendations to BPA on projects to be funded through its \nannual fish and wildlife budget.\n  The amendment goes into effect upon the date of enactment, and it is \nintended that the provision be used to start the planning process for \nthe expenditure of BPA's fiscal year 1998 fish and wildlife budget. \nThis provision will expire on September 30, 2000.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to thank Senator Hatfield and \nSenator Murray, and the Northwest Power Planning Council for their \ninput in the development of the amendment. I believe that the final \nlanguage, as it appears in the fiscal year 1997 energy and water \nconference report, reflects a bipartisan effort to make sure that BPA \nratepayer dollars are spend wisely.\n  I believe that my amendment is the first step to restoring \naccountability in the decisionmaking process for the expenditure of BPA \nratepayer dollars for fish and wildlife purposes. I look forward to \nworking, on a bipartisan basis, with my Northwest colleagues to rewrite \nthe Northwest Power Act during the next Congress to ensure that \nNorthwest ratepayer dollars are spent effectively for fish and \nwildlife, and that the people of the Northwest are given a greater role \nin the decisionmaking process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Levin does not need \nhis time. In his behalf, I yield back his time. Mr. President, I \nunderstand Senator Johnston will yield back his time. In that he is in \nanother hearing, I yield back his time in his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time except the time of the Senator from \nNew Mexico has been yielded back. The Senator from New Mexico retains \n14 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania how much time does he desire?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I \nwould appreciate 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the suggestion of the majority \nleader, I yield back all time on the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10618-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor immediately \nafter attending a meeting with President Clinton, the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and Members of both Houses from both parties on the subject of \nIraq. I would like to comment about an issue which I raised \nspecifically with the President, and that is my urging him to submit to \nthe Congress of the United States the issue as to whether there should \nbe force used against Iraq in the gulf.\n  In time of crisis there is no question, under our Constitution, that \nthe President as Commander in Chief has the authority to take emergency \naction. Similarly, it is plain that the Congress of the United States \nhas the sole authority to declare a war, and that involves the use of \nforce, as in the gulf operation in 1991, which was really a war, where \nthe President came to the Congress of the United States in January \n1991, and on this floor this body debated that issue and, by a \nrelatively narrow vote of 52 to 47, authorized the use of force. It is \nmy strong view that the issue of the use of force in Iraq today ought \nto be decided by the Congress of the United States and not unilaterally \nby the President where there is no pending emergency and when there is \ntime for due deliberation in accordance with our constitutional \nprocedures.\n  I note when the first missile attacks were launched 2 weeks ago \ntoday, on September 3, the President did not consult in advance with \nthe Congress, which I believe was necessary under the War Powers Act. \nThat is water over the dam. At the meeting this morning there were \ncomments from Members of Congress about the need for more consultation. \nI believe the session this morning was the first time that there had \nbeen a group of Members of the House and Senate assembled to be briefed \nby the administration, by the President, and by the Secretary of State \nand Secretary of Defense.\n  We know from the bitter experience of the Vietnam war that the United \nStates cannot engage in military action of a protracted nature without \npublic support, and the first place to seek the public support is in \nthe Congress of the United States in our representative capacity. It is \nmore than something which is desirable; it is something which is \nmandated by the constitutional provision that grants exclusive \nauthority to the Congress of the United States to declare war. We have \nseen a transition as to what constitutes a war--in Korea, where there \nwas no declaration of war by the Congress, in Vietnam, where there was \nno declaration of war by the Congress. And we have seen the adoption of \nthe War Powers Act as an effort to strike a balance between \ncongressional authority to declare war and the President's authority as \nCommander in Chief; and, as provided under the War Powers Act, where \nthere are imminent hostilities, the President is required to consult in \nadvance with the Congress and to make prompt reports to the Congress, \nalthough the President does have the authority to act in case of \nemergency.\n\n  My legal judgment is that the President does have authority as \nCommander in Chief to act in an emergency, even in the absence of the \nWar Powers Act. But when there is time for action by the Congress of \nthe United States, then that action ought to be taken by the Congress \non the use of force, which is tantamount to war, which we saw in the \ngulf in 1991 where the Congress did act. And we may see--we all hope we \ndo not see it--but we may see that in Iraq at the present time.\n  The Congress is soon to go out of session in advance of the November \nelections. While we are here, this issue ought to be considered by the \nCongress of the United States as to whether we are going to have the \nuse of force.\n  In the meeting this morning, attended by many Members of the House \nand Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, there was considerable \nquestion raised on both sides of the aisle as to what our policy is at \nthe present time, whether we have a coherent policy as to what we are \ngoing to do there, not only how we get in but how we get out, and what \nour policy ought to be.\n  Those policy issues are really matters which ought to be debated by \nthe Congress of the United States and acted upon by the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\n  We know there is a considerable problem that we face today on getting \nsupport from our allies, and that is an indispensable prerequisite, it \nseems to me, for action by the United States military forces. We have \nseen the deployment of air power all the way from Guam for missile \nstrikes, and yet we wonder why we are not using air power from Saudi \nArabia or from Turkey, and the question is raised as to whether the \nSaudis or the people in command of Turkey are willing to allow us to \nuse their bases for these air strikes.\n  When it comes to the issue of containment, representations were made \nby key administration officials that there is a full and total support \nby the Saudis for our efforts to contain Saddam Hussein, but that when \nit comes to the issue of air strikes, the same cannot be said; there is \nless than a full measure of support from the Saudis. So that when we \ndeal with the issue of how much force the United States of America \nought to use in the gulf against Saddam Hussein, those are the issues \nwhich ought to be considered by Congress, and we ought to have a \nstatement of particularity as to just how much support we are going to \nget from our allies.\n  We know the French, illustratively, will refuse to supply in the \nexpanded zone to the 33d parallel. There have been reports from Kuwait \nthat the Kuwait Government is not prepared, not really willing to have \nus expand our military forces there. There is some dispute about that, \nwith representations being made by the administration that the media \nreports have been overblown and that there is really cooperation from \nKuwait and from Bahrain and from others. But on the face of what is at \nleast the public record, there is a serious question as to whether we \ndo have real support among our allies. That is something which has to \nbe considered in some detail.\n  In our meeting this morning, reservations were expressed by Members \non both sides of the aisle, and there was a question as to what we \nought to be doing with Saudi Arabia in terms of long-range policy and \nlong-range planning. When we moved into the gulf war in 1991, it was an \nemergency situation, but the plan was supposed to enable the Saudis to \nhave time to defend themselves and to take action in their own defense, \nand that has not happened. Every time Saddam Hussein moves, there is \nsignificant expenditure of U.S. resources and U.S. money.\n  In the middle of the discussion, we had the point raised about \nwhether the defense budget is adequate and a very blunt reference to \nthe Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta, as to agreeing to the figures which \nhave come from the appropriators, and that also was obviously a matter \nof fundamental importance by the Congress because we are the \nappropriators and we have had the administration take the position that \nthe administration does not like what the Congress is doing by way of \nappropriations. But the administration is coming in with a very \nexpensive operation, and it may be justified, it may be warranted, it \nmay be necessary, but that is a matter for the Congress to decide as to \nwhat our policy should be and how much money we are prepared to spend.\n  In the meeting today, the question was raised rather bluntly about \nthe credibility of the administration in expanding the no-fly zone to \nthe south when the actions come against the Kurds in the north, and \nthere seems to be a consensus that the action taken thus far by the \nadministration has not weakened Saddam Hussein but has strengthened \nSaddam Hussein and that he did, in fact, receive cover when certain \nKurdish leaders invited him in; and there is a distinction to be made \nabout what the United States will do for a vital U.S. interest \ncontrasted with what we might do for humanitarian purposes, and that \nwhile U.S. military personnel may be placed in harm's way where we have \nan issue of a vital national interest, there may be a difference of \nopinion if we are dealing with a humanitarian consideration.\n\n  Mr. President, all of this boils down to the judgment, my judgment, \nthat the American people today are not informed about what the \nadministration is seeking to do in the gulf and what the administration \nis seeking to do against Saddam Hussein, and the Congress has not been \nconsulted in advance of the initial missile strikes and has been, in my \nview, inadequately informed as we have proceeded. When you deal with \nthe use of force, which is tantamount to war, that is a matter to be \ndecided by the Congress of the United States, leaving to the President \nhis constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to act in cases of \nemergency. But at this time we do not have an emergency. We have time \nfor deliberation in the Congress, for debate in this Chamber and the \nfloor of the House of Representatives to decide what our policy should \nbe, what we are prepared to spend, and how we ought to proceed. That is \nwhy in the meeting I asked the President to submit to the Congress his \nrequest for an authorization for the use of force so that matter could \nbe decided by the Congress in accordance with constitutional \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, I noted that I made that request to the President, and \nI commented about a letter which I had sent to the President yesterday \non that subject. I ask unanimous consent that the text of that letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to you to express my \n     growing concerns over the escalation of U.S. military \n     activity in and around the Persian Gulf and to urge you to \n     promptly seek a resolution from Congress authorizing the use \n     of force in the Gulf. There is no emergency which would \n     require escalation of the use of force by you in your role as \n     Commander-in-Chief. The constitutional role of Congress as \n     the sole authority to declare war should be respected, as it \n     was in 1991, with the Congress determining national policy on \n     our objectives, the conditions of allied burden sharing, an \n     exit strategy and an overall policy which is lacking at the \n     present time. A further statement of my reasons follows.\n       First, let me repeat my publicly stated support for the \n     policy of containment of Saddam Hussein's regime and for the \n     practice of United States military involvement in the \n     enforcement of the United Nations' ordered no-fly zone in \n     southern Iraq. No less than in 1991, when I voted to support \n     the use of force in the Gulf War, the United States has vital \n     interests in this region which must be protected.\n       Second, I strongly support the bravery and professionalism \n     of our military men and women who are carrying out your \n     orders at substantial risk to their lives.\n       All this having been said, I believe your current course of \n     gradual escalation against Iraq, starting with the missile \n     attacks on September 4, (for which you sought no prior \n     authorization from Congress) constitutes the involvement of \n     our armed forces in the sorts of hostile and potentially \n     hostile situations so as to trigger the limit of your \n     authority as commander-in-chief established by the War Powers \n     Act.\n       Moreover, this present course of escalation--especially the \n     reported possible dispatch of 3-5,000 ground troops to Kuwait \n     --could well lead to a renewal of full scale war between the \n     United States and Iraq. For example, if, heaven forbid, our \n     Army units were to sustain losses from any form of Iraqi \n     attack, this country would be duty-bound to respond with \n     massive force.\n       I know you understand, particularly in view of this \n     country's bitter experiences with undeclared wars in Korea \n     and Vietnam, the paramount importance of the constitutional \n     principle that only Congress can declare war. It is an \n     unavoidable concomitant of this principle that the President \n     cannot have unilateral authority to set up a trip-wire which, \n     if breached, would surely commit this nation to war. Your \n     present posture toward Iraq, however, may be creating just \n     such a trip-wire.\n       Beyond the always vital matter of honoring basic \n     constitutional principle, I urge you to promptly seek \n     Congressional authority for the use of force against Iraq \n     because, just as in 1991, this democratic exercise is by far \n     the best way to clarify both the legitimate means and the \n     legitimate ends which underlie our national policy towards \n     Saddam Hussein.\n       A congressional debate now will focus you and the Congress, \n     and ultimately the American people, on what our policy should \n     be at this time in the Persian Gulf. It will define national \n     understanding and hopefully shape a national consensus on the \n     key questions which must be answered as the potential for \n     deeper conflict grows--questions such as the proper burden \n     sharing we must demand from our allies in the region and \n     around the world and, most importantly, about an exit \n     strategy to ensure a way back home, in reasonable time and at \n     reasonable cost, for the troops we so rapidly send today into \n     harm's way.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Arlen Specter.\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10624-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10626-S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, today the Senate takes up S. 1718, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. In addition to \ncontaining the annual authorization for appropriations for elements of \nthe U.S. intelligence community, this bill includes a number of \nimportant provisions intended to ensure that our intelligence agencies \noperate more effectively and more efficiently in the post-cold-war \nworld.\n  The end of the cold war did not solve America's national security \nconcerns. As evidenced by the bombing in June of the Khobar Towers \nfacility in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and the possible complicity of \ninternational terrorists in the downing of TWA flight 800 in July, the \nfocus of those concerns can shift with the speed and force of an \nexplosion. The need for a national security apparatus that is equally \ndynamic is clear. Title VII of S. 1718--the Intelligence Activities \nRenewal and Reform Act of 1996--contains measures designed to improve \nour Nation's intelligence capabilities in order to meet the rapidly \nchanging threats to our national security.\n  Title VII takes significant steps toward this objective in two ways: \nFirst, it improves an institutional framework for ensuring that the \ndecisionmakers who rely on intelligence can provide prompt, clear \nguidance to the intelligence community on what their needs are and what \nthe priorities are. Second, it improves the Director of Central \nIntelligence's authority and improves the structure he needs to respond \nquickly in an effective, efficient, and responsible manner.\n  S. 1718, as originally reported out by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, reflected the conclusions this committee had reached \nafter 6 years of focused examination of the missions, functions, and \norganizational arrangements for the intelligence community. Triggered \nby the end of the cold war, this examination had gained momentum in \n1994 in the wake of the Ames espionage case and the revelation that the \nNational Reconnaissance Office [NRO] had built an expensive new \nbuilding without adequately informing Congress.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues that just 2 years ago members \nof this body from both parties--angered by what appeared to be a lack \nof direction and accountability in the intelligence community, and \nparticularly in the CIA--stood in this Chamber to call for a massive \noverhaul of our intelligence apparatus. In order to avoid precipitous \naction, the Senate adopted a proposal offered by Senators Warner, \nGraham, and others to create a bipartisan Commission on the Roles and \nCapabilities of the U.S. intelligence community to conduct a credible, \nindependent, and objective review of U.S. intelligence. The Commission \nwas given a deadline of March 1, 1996, with the expectation that its \nreport would inform a legislative debate resulting in enactment of \nneeded changes during the 104th Congress. The Commission was chaired by \nformer Congressman and Secretary of Defense Les Aspin until his \nuntimely death and later by former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. \nThe 17-member Commission included two of our distinguished colleagues, \nJohn Warner and Jim Exon, and two of our former colleagues, Warren \nRudman, who served as vice chairman, and Wyche Fowler.\n  While the Aspin-Brown Commission was conducting its review, our \ncommittee and its staff also held a number of hearings, received \nbriefings, and conducted interviews regarding the appropriate missions \nand organizational structure of the intelligence community. During the \ncourse of these efforts, two additional incidents--the failure of CIA \nofficials to inform Congress of the possible involvement of CIA assets \nin human rights abuses in Guatemala and the failure of NRO officials to \ntell either the DCI or Congress that the NRO had accumulated over $1 \nbillion in unused funds--further convinced our Committee that the \nintelligence community needed greater central direction and \naccountability. Based on the Aspin-Brown Commission's recommendations \nand on the results of our own review, the committee reported out S. \n1718 on April 24, 1996.\n\n  The bill was subsequently taken on sequential referral by the Armed \nServices Committee, which informed the Intelligence Committee that it \ndid not want to consider any intelligence reform this year. The \nIntelligence Committee did not believe that intelligence reforms could \nbe put off for another year. The rapidly changing world, the recent \nincidents that have undermined public confidence in our intelligence \nagencies, and the work already done by the Aspin-Brown Commission and \nother groups--all of these factors led us to believe that the time was \nripe for intelligence reform. We marked up our bill in April in order \nto ensure that the Armed Services Committee would have plenty of time \nto consider it.\n  The Department of Defense, from the outset, opposed anything in the \nbill that enhanced the authority of the DCI at the expense of the \nSecretary of Defense. In an April 29 letter to the Armed Services \nCommittee, Deputy Secretary of Defense John White stated that ``clear \nand unambiguous lines of authority from the Secretary of Defense to the \nDefense intelligence agencies and the embedded Service intelligence \nelements are crucial'' to ensuring ``that those who depend on \nintelligence--especially our nation's military forces--receive the \ntimely and responsive intelligence they require.'' Deputy Secretary \nWhite argued that enhancing the DCI's authorities over NSA, NRO, and \nCIO would ``unnecessarily complicate those lines of command and \ncontrol.''\n  I agree completely that intelligence consumers, especially military \nconsumers whose lives may be at risk, must have timely and responsive \nintelligence. I do not agree, however, that this objective can be \naccomplished through exclusive management by the Secretary of Defense \nof NSA, NRO, and CIO. The fact is that in the course of running an over \n$240 billion department the Secretary of Defense simply does not have \ntime to exercise any degree of command and control over Defense \nintelligence agencies.\n  The consequences of continuing the fiction of Secretary of Defense \nmanagement of these intelligence agencies at the expense of real \nmanagement by the DCI is significant. The country needs to vest the \nauthority in the DCI so that intelligence, such as that produced by the \nDefense Intelligence Agency in mid-June warning of threats to United \nStates troops at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, is certain to receive \nthe kind of attention it is warranted. We need a DCI who can rattle the \ncages when necessary, so that consumers of intelligence cannot \nattribute policy failures to intelligence shortcomings. Both the \nDowning Commission and the staff report of the SSCI concluded that the \ntragedy at Khobar Towers was not attributable to an intelligence \nfailure. It is deeply regrettable that, as a result of changes insisted \nupon by the Armed Services Committee, the country will have to wait for \nanother Congress and perhaps additional bitter experiences before the \nneeded changes can be made.\n  Testifying before our committee on April 24, 1996, Director Deutch \nprovided some interesting insights on the ability of the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense to exercise the authorities DOD fought so \ndesperately to retain. When asked whether we should hold the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense or the DCI accountable for problems at the NRO, a\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\nkey national intelligence agency within the Department of Defense, he \nresponded:\n\n       The Deputy Secretary of Defense has got a tremendous set of \n     issues covering a much larger range of resources--10 times--\n     managing ten times the resources we're talking about for the \n     whole intelligence community.\n       So to say that you are going to go to the deputy--and I am \n     not talking about personalities--and say to the Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense, why didn't you catch this, he's going \n     to say, well, I count on the DCI to keep track of this and \n     to let the Secretary of Defense know.\n       So in some sense, if we are going to say that the Director \n     of Central Intelligence does not view himself or herself as \n     being responsible for the NRO, fundamentally nobody will be.\n\n  In light of these realities, this committee sought to give the DCI \ngreater authority and responsibility to manage the intelligence \ncommunity. The Armed Services Committee, asserting their jurisdiction \nover the Defense Department, insisted on a number of changes to keep \nprovisions that affected the intelligence agencies within DOD. The \nArmed Services Committee and the Defense Department were most concerned \nabout those provisions that would have given the DCI greater authority \nto manage the intelligence community, including those elements of the \ncommunity that are part of the Department of Defense such as the \nNational Security Agency [NSA], the National Reconnaissance Office \n[NRO], and the Central Imagery Office. These provisions would have \ngiven the DCI, as head of the intelligence community, authority to \nexecute the budgets for NSA, NRO, and CIO as well as shared \nresponsibility, together with the Secretary of Defense and for ensuring \nthat these agencies perform their national missions. The DCI would also \nhave been given authority to reprogram funds from one program to \nanother within the National Foreign Intelligence Program--which is the \nportion of the overall U.S. intelligence budget the DCI is responsible \nfor developing each year--even if the affected department or agency \nhead objected to that transfer. Finally, the Intelligence Committee had \nvoted for a provision to require DCI concurrence on the decision as to \nwho should head the major collection agencies: NSA, NRO, and the \nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency. This was watered down by Armed \nServices to a qualified concurrence, allowing the recommendation of the \nSecretary of Defense to be forwarded to the President over the DCI's \nobjection so long as that objection is noted.\n  Given the length of time the Armed Services Committee and, then, the \nGovernment Affairs Committee held this bill, and in light of the \nabbreviated legislative schedule, we were unable to bring these \nimportant issues to the floor of the Senate for debate and a vote. \nNevertheless, despite the Defense Department's initial refusal to \nrelinquish any significant authority to ensure more efficient and \neffective management of intelligence, we were able to get a bill out of \nthe Armed Services Committee that contains important new statutory \nassurances of DCI authority and should enhance the prospects that \nfuture DCI's will not have to rely merely on the good will of the \nSecretary of Defense in order to effectively manage intelligence. The \nbill before you today contains much of what the Intelligence Committee \ninitially proposed, but not as much as the country needs. That greater \nobjective will require continued efforts.\n  In addition to the amendments made to our bill by the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Government Affairs Committees took the bill for 53 days. \nAt the end of that time, they reported it out with minor modifications \nto the provision providing for a Commission to Assess the Organization \nof the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of \nMass Destruction.\n  Finally, the Rules Committee also originally requested sequential \nreferral of our bill in order to review a provision that would have \namended Senate Resolution 400, the charter for our committee, to \neliminate the 8-year term limit on committee membership. After \nconsultations between our two committees and in response to concerns \nexpressed by the majority leader, we agree to delete this provision and \nthe Rules Committee withdrew its request for sequential referral of our \nbill. We remain convinced that extending the terms for membership of \nthe oversight committee is an essential step in improving congressional \noversight of intelligence, and I note that elimination of term limits \nwas recommended by the Aspin-Brown Commission, on which Senator Warner \nserved. But in order to ensure consideration of S. 1718 in this \nshortened legislative year, we have agreed to put off this issue for \nnow.\n\n  Now let me summarize the provisions in our bill. I will begin with \nthe reform provisions in title VII. The key provisions enhance the \nability of the DCI to manage the intelligence community by providing \nhim with new statutory authority and an improved management structure. \nSpecifically, section 707 of the bill gives the DCI new statutory \nauthority to participate in the development of the budgets for the \nJoint Military Intelligence Program and for tactical intelligence and \nrelated activities; to approve all collection requirements and \npriorities and to resolve conflicts among priorities; and the right to \nbe consulted by the Secretary of Defense before the Secretary \nreprograms funds within joint military intelligence programs.\n  Section 707 would also require the DCI and the Secretary of Defense \nto develop a database of all intelligence programs and activities, \nincluding resource and budget execution information. The Office of \nScience and Technology Policy within the White House has recently \ndeveloped a database of all research and development activities within \nthe Federal Government, and this database has been invaluable for \nidentifying duplication among Federal R programs. The committee \nbelieves that the DCI has been hampered in his ability to manage the \nintelligence community by a lack of accurate and comprehensive \ninformation about all intelligence community activities. Development of \na database for intelligence activities should give the DCI one of the \nkey tools he needs to provide greater direction and control of U.S. \nintelligence programs.\n  In addition, section 716 of the bill would require the DCI to concur \nin recommendations by the Secretary of Defense to the President of \nindividuals to be directors of NSA, NRO, or the newly created National \nImagery and Mapping Agency, or to have his lack of concurrence noted. \nThe DCI would also have to be consulted by the appropriate department \nhead when appointing the heads of the major elements of the National \nForeign Intelligence Program, including the Assistant Secretary of \nState for Intelligence and Research, the Assistant Director in charge \nof the FBI's National Security Division, the Director of DIA, and the \nDirector of the Department of Energy's Office of Non-Proliferation and \nNational Security. This new authority will help to remedy a situation \nin which DCI's--despite their statutory role as head of the \nintelligence community--have had little or no say in the appointments \nof the heads of major intelligence community elements. The Armed \nServices Committee also agreed to include in the DOD authorization bill \na requirement that the DCI provide to the Secretary of Defense an \nannual performance evaluation of the heads of NSA, NRO, and NIMA.\n  The bill would also establish three new Senate-confirmed Assistant \nDirectors of Central Intelligence to assist the DCI in managing the \nintelligence community. One would focus on managing the intelligence \ncommunity's collection activities; the second would coordinate \ncommunity-wide intelligence analysis and production; and the third \nwould coordinate community administrative programs. The committee \nbelieves that one reason that successive DCI's have been unable to \nexercise stronger management over the intelligence community is that \nthey have lacked an adequate management structure. We believe these new \npositions will help the DCI fulfill his community role.\n  In addition to strengthening the authorities of the DCI, the bill \nalso creates two new committees of the National Security Council--a \nCommittee on Foreign Intelligence and a Committee on Transnational \nThreats--to provide better policy guidance for the intelligence \ncommunity and for departments and agencies involving in fighting \ninternational terrorism and crime. The creation of both committees were \nrecommended by the Aspin-Brown Commission.\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\n  Section 715 clarifies that intelligence collection agencies may \naccept tasking from law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence \nabout non-U.S. persons outside the United States. This provision is \nnecessary because CIA and NSA read their legal authorities as \npreventing them accepting tasking from law enforcement agencies lest \nthey be considered to be exercising law enforcement powers. The \nprovision is narrowly tailored to apply only to collection outside the \nUnited States about non-U.S. persons.\n\n  Section 717 of the bill calls for disclosure of the intelligence \nbudget top line--that is, the aggregate of NFIP, JMIP, and TIARA. This \nnumber has been in the public domain for some time, without carrying us \ndown the so-called slippery slope of more detailed disclosures. The DCI \nsupports disclosure, the Aspin-Brown Commission supports disclosure, \nand the administration supports disclosure. Disclosure of the top line \nprovides no new information to our enemies. In fact, I believe this \ndisclosure will actually strengthen our ability to protect vital \nnational secrets by bolstering the credibility of our classification \ndecisions--officially revealing the budget total tells the American \npublic is that we are using classification to protect vital national \nsecrets, not to conceal information that might be inconvenient to \ndefend. And I think it would not be difficult to defend the size of the \nintelligence budget, given the complex world we live in today.\n  These are the principal reform provisions contained in the \nIntelligence Authorization Act. The bill contains a number of \nadditional important provisions.\n  Title V of the bill criminalizes theft of economic proprietary \ninformation by a person acting on behalf of a foreign government or its \nagent. This provision is the result of nearly 4 years of hearing and \nstudy by our committee. We held hearings on this provision earlier this \nyear, and we are convinced by both the classified and unclassified \ntestimony that economic espionage is a problem that needs to be \nremedied immediately in the interests of our national economy and thus \nour national security.\n  Title VI would create a Commission to Assess the Organization of the \nFederal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction. The eight members of the Commission are to be appointed by \nthe President and the congressional leadership. The Commission is \nrequired to conduct a study of the organization of the Federal \nGovernment, including the intelligence community, for combating weapons \nproliferation.\n  Finally, title VIII of the bill, as amended by the Armed Services \nCommittee, codifies the national mission and tasking authorities of the \nDCI for the new National Imagery and Mapping Agency [NIMA]. NIMA is a \nnew agency within the Department of Defense formed from the current \nCentral Imagery Office, the Defense Mapping Agency, CIA's National \nPhotographic Interpretation Center, and certain other imagery related \nelements. As originally reported by our committee, title VIII included \nprovisions that would have established NIMA. The DOD authorization \nbill, which was reported by the Armed Services Committee later than our \nbill, included a more comprehensive statutory framework governing NIMA, \nand we agreed to the removal of the provisions establishing NIMA in our \nbill and their replacement with provisions in the National Security Act \ndefining the new agency's national mission and the DCI's tasking \nauthorities. The DCI's tasking authorities are especially important. \nFor the first time in statute, the DCI now has the specific authority \nto approve collection requirements, determine collection priorities, \nand resolve conflicts in priorities levied on our national imagery \nsatellites and other imagery assets.\n  I also want to mention that the Armed Services Committee attempted to \nestablish NIMA as a combat support agency of the Department of Defense. \nWe strongly opposed this formulation because it slighted the critical \nimagery needs of the National Security Council, the Department of \nState, and other non-DOD consumers. Our committee was unwilling to have \nNIMA cater to the exclusive needs of the Defense Department. \nAccordingly, we modified the language in the DOD authorization bill, \nwhich we took on sequential referral, to provide that NIMA is not only \na combat support agency but also has significant national missions. I \nalso want to note that although NIMA has been added to the list of \ncombat support agencies in 10 U.S.C. 193(f), subsection (d) of section \n193, as amended by the DOD authorization bill, specifically provides \nthat the Chairman of the Joint Chief's oversight over NIMA shall apply \n``only with respect to combat support functions [the Agency] performs \nfor the Department of Defense.'' This language makes clear that NIMA \nhas important noncombat support functions that are not subject to the \ncontrol of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n\n  This concludes my summary of this year's intelligence authorization \nbill, including the reform provisions in title VII. Congress has been \nconsidering legislation to reform the intelligence community to meet \nthe challenges of the post-cold-war world since at least 1990. Today, \ndespite continuing bureaucratic resistance, the Senate is taking \nsignificant steps toward finally achieving that objective.\n  I want to thank the distinguished vice chairman, Senator Kerrey, for \nhis unflagging and nonpartisan commitment to the work of the committee. \nSenator Kerrey brings to this committee a unique understanding of the \nbusiness of intelligence and a willingness and ability to master even \nthe most complex technical issues. His insights and efforts were \nabsolutely essential to the passage of this bill and to the committee's \nwork overall. In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the excellent work of the committee staff, particularly \nCharlie Battaglia, Chris Straub, Suzanne Spaulding, John Bellinger, and \nEd Levine.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this year's bill once again attempts to \nhelp the intelligence community make the transition to a post-cold-war \nworld where the looming military threat of the Soviet Union has been \nreplaced by a more subtle--but increasingly serious--array of threats. \nThe committee has attempted to help intelligence make the transition \nwith a series of provisions in the bill to reform the community's \nweaknesses and renew its confidence in itself and in the products it \nprovides to policy makers.\n  Chairman Specter has been key in ensuring the committee has moved \nforward to recommend to the Senate important changes in the \nintelligence community. Under his leadership, we have examined in \ndetail many shortcomings and failures which can only lead to the \nconclusion substantial change is in order. Without Chairman Specter's \ntireless efforts on the part of reform and renewal, the committee would \nnot have been able to get to the point where we are today: recommending \nimprovements that will have far reaching effects and make sure the \nintelligence community is positioned to understand the threats of \ntomorrow.\n  This year's bill also seeks to provide an adequate level of funding \nfor the intelligence community, with the committee seeking a modest, 1 \npercent increase to the President's request. Congress has cut the DCI's \nrequest for national intelligence each year for the past 7 years, and I \nbelieve stress and strain in our national intelligence capabilities \nwill follow unless we reverse this trend. However, since this bill was \nmarked up in April, the defense authorization conference acted to cut \nnational intelligence by some 3 percent and the ongoing defense \nauthorization conference is likely to redirect funds requested by the \nadministration for national intelligence to other defense programs. I \nam discouraged that there seems to be no constituency of support for \nnational intelligence, even in a year in which the Congress is adding \nsignificant resources to the defense budget.\n  I opened my remarks by saying the committee is once again attempting \nto reform and renew intelligence because it engaged in a similar effort \nas part of the fiscal year 1993 National Foreign Intelligence Program \nauthorization process. The committee ran into many roadblocks in the \nfall of 1992 which prevented it from moving ahead with substantial \nreforms. Unfortunately, the committee finds itself in somewhat of a \nsimilar position today. Nevertheless, we are offering reforms which \nhopefully will point us in the direction of\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nimproved intelligence support to policy makers while at the same time \nstreamlining some of the Intelligence community's procedures so they \nare more responsive to the evolving international environment.\n\n  There are many reasons for intelligence reform and renewal. Several \nof the most significant have found their way into the media. We are all \naware of the Aldrich Ames spy case where a CIA operations officer gave \nsome of our most sensitive information to the Soviet Union reportedly \nresulting directly in the deaths of at least 10 people. We also know \nabout the excess funds retained by the National Reconnaissance Office \nwhich prevented this funding from being available for more immediate \nprojects. Incidents such as these help to underscore the need for \nreform.\n  The need for reform is widely recognized outside of the Congress. \nLast year Congress authorized a special commission to ``conduct a \ncomprehensive review of American intelligence.'' In March of this year, \nthe Commission issued a 217-page report containing over 36 \nrecommendations for significant change. Similarly, the Council on \nForeign Relations this year issued its own report on the need for \nintelligence reform. Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of \nDiplomacy added its call for reform in a report entitled, ``Checklist \nfor the Future of Intelligence.'' And the executive branch recognizes \nthe need for reform as well. Their recognition is perhaps captured best \nby a CIA task force with the foreboding name of the ``Intelligence \nCommunity Revolution Task Force'' which called for sweeping changes.\n  The need for reform must be balanced by at least two considerations. \nFirst, the intelligence community is full of dedicated men and women \nwho, through a sense of patriotism and a desire to serve their country, \nwill successfully take the intelligence community into the 21st \ncentury. They will be mentally ready to confront any challenge. Second, \nreform does not mean we should create a ``Department of Intelligence.'' \nIntelligence supports policy. It informs leaders throughout the \nGovernment and does not have to be organized as a separate part of the \nGovernment in order to be effective. What must be done, however, is to \ncreate an organization capable of capitalizing upon the abilities of \nits dedicated men and women and organize it so the leaders of the \nintelligence community have the authorities commensurate with the \nresponsibilities for which we hold them accountable. The Congress and \nmany parts of the executive branch expect only the best intelligence, \nand the community must be prepared to serve all segments of the \nGovernment, including the Department of Defense.\n\n  In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee. We have worked together to \nmake sure intelligence support will be improved in the future and to \nguarantee our unsurpassed defense capabilities remain intact. Without \nthe support of the chairman and ranking member, we would not be able to \npresent a comprehensive package of reform to the Senate in which we all \nhave confidence we are doing the right thing.\n  This year, we voted a bill out of Committee: First, changing \nintelligence support to policymakers so the community could better \ncapitalize on the rich resources of its people; second, enhancing some \nof the powers of the Director of Central Intelligence so he would be \nable to exercise all of the necessary authorities in the areas for \nwhich we recognize his responsibility; and third, reorganizing parts of \nthe intelligence community so that it is better structured for the \nprofusion of different threats endemic to the post cold war world.\n  In order to support policymakers better, the bill we introduce today \ncontains several important innovations. First, it creates a Committee \non Foreign Intelligence as part of the National Security Council. This \ncommittee would meet at least semiannually to provide broad guidance to \nthe intelligence community on major issues. In addition to ensuring \nthat intelligence would more closely support the needs of all \npolicymakers in the Government, it would be required to document the \npriorities of the policymaking community so that intelligence would \nknow how to allocate its relatively scarce resources.\n  Second, the bill creates a Committee on Transnational Threats as part \nof the National Security Council. In many ways, the threats to our \nnational security have changed significantly since the bipolar world \nwhere the Free World confronted a Communist bloc. The role of the \nnation state is evolving into something different and several \nincreasingly serious threats to the United States crossnational \nboundaries. Among these, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction--and their means of delivery--appear as the most \nsignificant. The policy community, however, still largely focuses on a \nworld composed of nations which only theoretically control the \ndestinies of all mankind. The intelligence community is struggling to \nbring the transnational threats to the forefront but, since \nintelligence supports policy and not vice versa, its warnings sometimes \ngo unheeded. The Committee on Transnational Threats will help to change \nthe focus to the new international disorder.\n  Mr. President, the committee harbors no illusions about the possible \ndestinies of these committees. We all know quite well the usefulness of \nthe Low Intensity Conflict Board, an NSC-level board established by the \nCongress to force the policy community to address the growing \nimportance of low-intensity conflict. The Committee on Foreign \nIntelligence and the Committee on Transnational Threats both could \nbecome the moribund bodies the low intensity conflict board has become. \nNonetheless, our committee feels so strongly that intelligence can \nsupport policy properly only if the policy makers change their approach \nto international threats, we believe it is best to allow the \nintelligence community to focus its efforts in new and different ways \nbased on NSC-level committees. We recommend the Congress should take \nthe risk and create these two committees so the necessary tools will be \navailable to the President if he chooses to use them.\n  Our bill also requires the President to submit an annual report to \nCongress on intelligence needs and priorities for the next fiscal year \nand assess the performance of the intelligence community during the \nprevious fiscal year. We envision this to be a companion document to \nthe national security strategy of the United States which the President \nis required by law to submit annually to Congress. We believe this will \nhelp the Congress decide whether intelligence is supporting policy. As \nsuch, it will allow the Congress to make the tough decisions on which \nprograms should be funded and reject those programs inconsistent with \nthe President's national security strategy and congressional \npriorities.\n  In some respects, the bill has created controversy in the manner with \nwhich it addresses the office of the Director of Central Intelligence. \nMost Americans expect the DCI to be a director. After 49 years of \nexperience, however, it is still painfully obvious he is the \ncoordinator of central intelligence, not the director. Each year, after \nhe negotiates with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of Energy and the FBI Director, the DCI assembles an \nintelligence budget. It often reflects what is bureaucratically \npossible instead of what is required. Therefore, he does not direct \nanything in the fundamental way any leader steers an organization. He \ndoes not direct the intelligence community because he does not create a \nbudget based on his own tough decisions. To make matters worse, once he \nassembles the budget and Congress approves it, the DCI does not control \nhow the money is spent. That control belongs to the people with whom he \nnegotiated in the first place: the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary \nof State, the Secretary of Energy, and the FBI Director. Since the \nbill's provisions dealing with budget control have created such \ncontroversy--sometimes misrepresented in the media as an attempt to \ncreate a ``Department of Intelligence''--the committee is reporting a \nbill at this late date with fewer DCI budget authorities than \noriginally believed to be important. Nonetheless, there are some \ninnovations still in the bill which will help the DCI better execute \nhis responsibilities.\n\n  Among these innovations is the creation of the positions of three \nAssistant Directors of Central Intelligence.\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\n Generally, intelligence is conducted in three steps. First, \ninformation is collected. Second, the information is analyzed and a \nreport is written. Third, the report is disseminated to policy-makers. \nToday, no one other than the DCI is personally responsible for the \ncollection of the information and its analysis. I think we can all \nagree the DCI is far too busy to focus on each day's priorities and \nrequirements for collecting information. Further, he cannot personally \nsupervise the daily work of the thousands of intelligence analysts to \nensure their reports are properly focused, comprehensive, and delivered \non time. Thus, the DCI relies on a series of interagency committees to \nhelp him manage intelligence collection and analysis. We all know what \nit means when someone says a committee is in charge: no one is in \ncharge. The bill attempts to correct this lack of accountability for \nintelligence collection and analysis by creating assistant directors \nwho will be in charge of those areas important for the production of \nintelligence.\n  The bill also creates a third Assistant Director of Central \nIntelligence. Today, most people believe the Director of Central \nIntelligence is responsible for administering an intelligence community \nconsisting of tens of thousands of people. But, like the areas of \nintelligence collection and analysis, there is no one other than the \nDCI who is personally responsible for the daily management of the \nrambling institution we call the intelligence community. In order to \nassist the DCI in the daily execution of this important responsibility, \nthe bill creates the position of an Assistant Director of Central \nIntelligence for Administration.\n  The committee also has attempted in this bill to strengthen the DCI's \nabilities to discharge his responsibilities by statutorily requiring \nhis participation in important executive branch deliberations. As many \nof my colleagues will remember, late last year the media carried \nstories stating the National Reconnaissance Office had amassed a large \namount of funds excess to their immediate needs. Responding quickly in \nthe media, senior Defense officials placed blame elsewhere. They \naccused the congressional oversight committees of being lax. They said \na secret agreement between the DCI and Secretary of Defense prevented \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense from keeping tabs on NRO \nfunding. They said excess funding levels found in the NRO would not \nbe found in DOD programs because the NRO was not ``subject to the \nannual [DOD] programming and budgeting `scrub'.'' Based on these rapid \nDepartment of Defense off the record denials in the press, everyone \nturned to the DCI and asked, ``Where were you?''\n\n  As it turns out Mr. President, there was no secret agreement between \nDOD and the DCI. In fact, there was no agreement, secret or otherwise. \nWhen asked to produce a copy of the supposed agreement, the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense provided the committee with a memo signed in \nthe early 1980's. In it, the Secretary of Defense simply reminded his \nstaff they could not add or take money away from the National Foreign \nIntelligence Program without officially coordinating it with the DCI.\n  Further, at the committee's request, the DOD Inspector General looked \nat eight of DOD's hundreds of procurement programs to see if there were \nfunding levels in excess of annual requirements such as those Congress \nfound in the NRO. The results are quite enlightening. Despite DOD s \nearlier denials in the media, five of the eight randomly selected \nprograms had more money available than they needed in 1996. On the \naverage, these five programs had almost 3 months extra funding. In \nfact, one program had 10 months more funding available to it than it \ncould use in 1996. So after only a superficial IG evaluation of several \nDOD programs and despite DOD's protestations and claims of budget \nscrubs, we know DOD ends up each year with more funds than they can \nspend. I do not say this in criticism of Defense managers, but rather \nto point to a characteristic common to complex multi-year efforts \ninvolving new technology, regardless of the Government department \nresponsible for them.\n  What may be a surprise is the answer to the question: where was the \nDCI when the National Reconnaissance Office was accumulating a backlog \nof spending authority? The answer is, the DCI has no authority over how \nthe NRO spends its money after Congress authorizes and appropriates the \nfunds. Having no direct authority to move money around or to determine \nif the money could be spent better elsewhere, it should not be a \nsurprise the DCI was not monitoring NRO's execution of its budget. That \nauthority rested with the Secretary of Defense.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence does not have the authority to \nexecute the intelligence budget. This has many serious consequences \nboth from an internal executive branch oversight perspective and from \nan operational perspective. Budget execution authority has occupied a \nlot of the committee's attention. In the original version of the bill, \nthe committee attempted to give the DCI greater authority over his own \nbudget. In order to get the bill to this stage in the annual \nauthorization process, however, we have dropped several provisions \nwhich would have ensured greater internal oversight of spending on \nintelligence. Nonetheless, the bill still gives the Director some \ninsight into the Joint Military Intelligence Program, and Tactical \nIntelligence and Related Activities--programs funded by the Department \nof Defense. While a modest improvement in aligning the DCI's \nauthorities with his responsibilities, this new authority is important \nfor ensuring better intelligence support of policy and for improving \ninternal executive branch oversight of the Intelligence Community.\n\n  The bill also has one other significant improvement for ensuring \nbetter oversight of intelligence. The committee is recommending the \nposition of General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency be \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. As stated in \nits report, the committee believes the confirmation process enhances \naccountability and strengthens the oversight process. Currently, all \nelements of the intelligence community, except the CIA, are part of \ndepartments having statutory general counsels who are Senate confirmed. \nMany legal issues are unique to the CIA. Unlike the other Senate-\nconfirmed general counsels, there is little informed public debate to \naid the CIA's general counsel in its deliberations because the issues \noften involve sensitive intelligence sources or methods. The \nconfirmation process allows the Senate to ensure better accountability \nand oversight of this important position.\n  Finally, the bill enhances the Director of Central Intelligence's \nauthorities by giving him a formal say in the naming of the directors \nof two of his most important agencies: the National Security Agency and \nthe National Reconnaissance Office. Under current law and regulation, \nthe Secretary of Defense could name the heads of these two intelligence \ncommunity agencies without seeing if the DCI agrees with the \nnominations. I think it should be obvious to my colleagues what I meant \nwhen I called the DCI the Coordinator of Central Intelligence. Not only \ndoes the Director not have much direct control over his budget, he also \ndoes not even have a required formal role in the naming of the heads of \nthe intelligence community's agencies. The bill takes a small step \nforward in giving him the opportunity to formally concur with an \nappointment made by the Secretary of Defense. Even under the bill's \nprovisions, the Secretary of Defense has sufficient independence he \ncould appoint the heads of the National Reconnaissance Office and the \nNational Security Agency over the DCI's objection.\n  I must add one thing in closing. During the intense discussions over \nthe appropriate authorities of the Director of Central Intelligence, it \nbecame clear to some of us there is a basic misunderstanding of \nintelligence and its relationship to the Department of Defense. Mr. \nPresident, as I have said time and time again, intelligence supports \npolicy. It also supports the planning and the operations of our \nmilitary forces. The Secretary of Defense directly controls the \nintelligence assets to ensure that this essential function of \nintelligence will be fulfilled, and our troops will be properly \nsupported. In addition, as a principal customer of the DCI and the most \nknowledgeable and articulate customer, the Secretary of Defense will \ncorrectly ensure that national intelligence fulfills military \nrequirements. This is appropriate and everyone\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\nagrees it must occur without exception. But the Department of Defense \nis only one of many agencies that executes the foreign policy of the \nUnited States. And, historically, DOD is the last part of the executive \nbranch the President relies upon when he executes U.S. policy overseas. \nWe are a nation that believes military power is the court of last \nresort in resolving international disputes, not the first. This makes \nintelligence support to the warfighter the last step of intelligence \nsupport to foreign policy--not the first. Thus, as some push for more \nand more intelligence support to the warfighter, they in fact risk \ndiminishing the creativity and quality of our foreign policy by forcing \nthe intelligence community to become ``militarized.'' The intelligence \ncommunity's scarce resources can only do so much and if they focus \nalmost exclusively on the Department of Defense, the other elements of \nour Government will not have the benefit of their advice and support. \nThis is dangerous for the effectiveness of our foreign policy and could \neventually lead to an over-reliance on the Department of Defense to \nsolve our foreign policy problems simply because the best information \nwe have on a foreign policy problem is focused on how to solve it with \nmilitary force. Intelligence support outside of the Department of \nDefense is important, and it is critical to the proper functioning of \nthe Government. The Congress must remain vigilant to make sure we do \nnot cripple intelligence by relying too heavily on uninformed \ncriticisms of intelligence support to the warfighter.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the fiscal year 1997 intelligence authorization bill. In \naddition to containing the annual schedule of authorizations for \nintelligence activities, a matter vital to U.S. national security, this \nlegislation contains important provisions intended to reorganize the \nU.S. intelligence community in order to increase its efficiency and \neffectiveness. This bill also contains badly needed legislation to \ncriminalize the theft of U.S. economic and proprietary data by foreign \ngovernments or their agents.\n  My colleagues should be aware that notwithstanding the fall of the \nSoviet Union and the rise of modern information systems, the \norganization of the United States intelligence community has remained \nessentially unchanged since 1947. The modest changes proposed in this \nlegislation, intended to assist the Director of Central Intelligence \nmanage this disparate and complex community in behalf of its many \nconsumers, are in my view long overdue.\n  The U.S. intelligence community is without equal in terms of its \nsophistication and global access. Yet, I believe that we can acquire \neven more capability from our intelligence community if changes are \nmade to its organization and management. During the course of the last \nfew years, for example, we have learned that the National \nReconnaissance Office carried billions of dollars in so-called forward-\nfunding on its books. These funds, which might have been either \nreturned to the Treasury or used for more pressing activities in the \nintelligence community or Defense Department, remained hidden from view \nin large part because the Director of Central Intelligence [DCI] and \nhis staff were not even aware of their existence. I think this episode \nillustrates as well as any the fact that DCI has often been less of a \ndirector than a spokesman and ombudsman for the intelligence community. \nHis degree of control and access to information has often been \nshockingly limited, yet he is the individual that the President, \nCongress, and the Secretary of Defense look to ensure that the \nintelligence community is operating both effectively and within the \nlaw.\n  Another startling example of the limits of the DCI's control and \naccess occurred during the Intelligence Committee's investigation into \nthe tragic Aldrich Ames case. One of the surprising facts to emerge \nfrom this investigation was the revelation that neither William Webster \nnor Bob Gates knew the extent of the losses caused by Aldrich Ames \nwithin the ranks of the CIA's Russian assets, nor the degree of \npenetration that had obviously occurred. Senior managers in the \nDirectorate of Operations, like senior managers in the National \nReconnaissance Office, felt free to withhold this critical information \nfrom the individual nominally responsible for the performance of the \nU.S. intelligence community.\n  The bill currently before the Senate would significantly strengthen \nthe role of the DCI as the leader of the U.S. intelligence community \nand thereby help to ensure greater coherence and discipline within its \nranks.\n  First, section 707 of this bill grants the DCI new statutory \nauthority to participate with the Secretary of Defense in developing \nthe Joint Military Intelligence Program [JMIP] and individual service \ndepartment [TIARA] intelligence budgets. The intent of this section is \nto eliminate duplication among national and military intelligence \nprograms.\n  Second, this measure stipulates that the DCI is responsible for \napproving all intelligence collection requirements and priorities.\n  Third, it requires the DCI to be consulted regarding proposed \nreprogrammings within the Joint Military Intelligence budget.\n  Finally, section 707 requires the DCI and Secretary of Defense to \ndevelop a joint data base for all intelligence programs' budget and \nactivities. This provision will help to eliminate waste and duplication \nby ensuring that the DCI and his staff have access to all of the \ninformation necessary to evaluate programs within different \nintelligence organizations.\n  Section 716 of the bill will give DCI a voice in the selection of the \nindividuals who serve as the heads of U.S. intelligence organizations. \nWhile these same officials must in some cases also report to the \nSecretary of Defense, there is no reason in my view not to involve the \nDCI in their selection. Imagine trying to run a business in the private \nsector, or manage your office here in the Senate, if you were not free \nto select or discipline your subordinates. Yet, that is the situation \nthat the DCI finds himself in with regard to his nominal subordinates \nat DIAA, NSA, and NRO--the organizations which account for the great \npreponderance of personnel and resources within the intelligence \ncommunity. This bill will ensure that the DCI concurs in the selection \nof intelligence agency heads by the Secretary of Defense, or that his \nnonconcurrence be brought to the attention of the President in the \nevent of a disagreement. The DCI, pursuant to this provision, would \nalso provide the Secretary of Defense an annual performance evaluation \nof the heads of NSA, NRO, and the new National Imagery and Mapping \nAgency.\n  Sections 709, 710, and 711 of the bill strengthen the DCI's staff by \nestablishing new, senior intelligence community staff positions \ndirectly subordinate to the DCI. Specifically, the bill establishes DCI \ndeputies for collection, analysis, and administration. This approach \ndiffers from that proposed by the administration, which seeks to have a \nsingle DCI deputy for community affairs and a second for the CIA. I am \nconfident that these different approaches, which share a common \nobjective, can be resolved in discussions with the House Intelligence \nCommittee and the administration prior to approval of the Intelligence \nconference report later this month.\n  Mr. President, these organizational provisions are the product of \nnumerous hearings held by the Intelligence Committee dating back to \n1990. They are also to some degree the product of the Presidential \nCommission on Intelligence sponsored 2 years ago in the Senate by our \ndistinguished colleague Senator John Warner of Virginia. Finally, these \nprovisions reflect substantial contributions and refinements made by \nthe members and staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. These \nprovisions have been the subject of substantial discussions, hearings, \nand debate, and I believe they deserve the support of every Senator.\n  In addition to these very substantial and important organizational \nprovisions, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to \ntitle V of S. 1718, which criminalizes economic espionage conducted \nagainst the United States by foreign governments and their agents. Too \noften, when considering the issue of economic espionage, the question \nthat has been asked is whether or not the United States should try to \ncollect information that might be of value to U.S. industry. I believe \nthe answer to that question is\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\nclearly ``no.'' The issue that has not received as much attention as it \ndeserves, in my opinion, concerns the threat posed to the U.S. economy \nby acts of industrial espionage perpetrated by foreign governments.\n  Over the last few years I have tried to move the discussion of these \nmatters out of the closed-door settings of the Intelligence and Armed \nServices Committees and into the public domain. Nearly 3 years ago the \nSenate adopted an amendment I offered to S. 4, the National \nCompetitiveness Act, requiring the President to submit an annual report \non foreign industrial espionage modeled on the State Department's \nannual report on terrorism, which has done a great deal to increase \nmedia, and thus public, awareness of the terrorism threat. I offered my \namendment to the competitiveness bill so that it would attract the \nattention of the business media, rather than the defense-oriented \npress, and so that the Commerce Committee would have jurisdiction over \nit and become a forum for congressional oversight of this problem.\n  While this reporting requirement had to be moved to the intelligence \nauthorization bill after S. 4 stalled in conference, I am pleased that \nthe first two annual reports have resulted in more and better media \ncoverage of the threat that economic espionage poses to U.S. industry. \nAt the same time, the President's report relegated too much information \nto the classified appendix, not because release of the information \nwould have put at risk sources and methods, but because it would have \ndiplomatic repercussions. Nevertheless, awareness of the problem has \nbeen increasing, as has the need to provide new tools to the FBI to \ndeter the theft of critical U.S. trade and economic information.\n  To their credit, Director Freeh and other administration officials \nhave been forward-leaning in addressing the problem, and we are now in \nthe position of enjoying administration support for the legislation \nthat Senator Specter and I introduced, which has been incorporated in \nthis bill, to provide the FBI the tools necessary to defeat and when \nnecessary successfully prosecute acts of economic espionage. I expect \nthe FBI and the Justice Department to use the new authorities provided \nby this legislation to aggressively investigate and prosecute acts of \neconomic espionage.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, as well as their staff, for their \ndedication and hard work. It has not been easy to forge a consensus on \nthe many legislative provisions contained in this bill, but the very \ndedicated managers of the bill have found solutions to the concerns \nraised by the Armed Services Committee and the Department of Defense.\n  In closing, I would like to also express my admiration for the \nthousands of dedicated personnel who labor in obscurity within the U.S. \nintelligence community. Most of their accomplishments remain secret, \nbut in my nearly 10 years of service on the Intelligence Committee, I \nhave developed enormous respect and appreciation for their \nachievements. They deserve the support and appreciation of the American \npeople, the best managerial structure we can provide, and the resources \nnecessary to accomplish their many missions. I believe this bill is \nfully consistent with those objectives and I urge its adoption by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be agreed to; further, that an amendment offered \nby the managers and an amendment offered by Senator Thurmond which are \nat the desk be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5355 and 5356) considered and agreed to en bloc \nare as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5355\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 718, relating to terms of service of \n     members of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate)\n\n       On page 72, strike out line 14 and all that follows through \n     page 73, line 9.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5356\n\n   (Purpose: Relating to the functions of the Assistant Director of \n                  Central Intelligence for Collection)\n\n       On page 52, beginning on line 18, strike out ``shall \n     manage'' and all that follows through page 52, line 23, and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``shall assist the Director of Central \n     Intelligence in carrying out the Director's collection \n     responsibilities in order to ensure the efficient and \n     effective collection of national intelligence.'

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I understand the procedure, that now \nconcludes the intelligence authorization bill, but since I am here and \nit has just been acted upon, I would like to make a few comments to \nsupplement my more extended statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that this legislation is a \nvery, very significant step forward in reform of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity--candidly, not as far as we should have\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\ngone, not as far as I would like to have gone, but a considerable \ndistance, a significant distance in improving the intelligence \ncommunity in the United States.\n  The intelligence community has been under considerable attack with \ndisclosures of Aldrich Ames, with the problems in Guatemala, with many \nproblems around the globe. And last year, at the initiative of our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator John Warner, a commission was \nappointed to make recommendations on what should be done to reform the \nU.S. intelligence community. The commission--first headed by former \nSecretary of Defense Aspin, whose untimely death caused a vacancy and \nthe need to appoint a subsequent chairman, another former Secretary of \nDefense, Harold Brown--came up with a comprehensive list of \nrecommendations, and the Intelligence Committee then held extensive \nhearings on a subject that goes back many years.\n  The Intelligence Committee then submitted a program which we thought \nwould make very major changes in the U.S. intelligence community. There \nwas very considerable objection then raised from a number of quarters, \nprincipally by the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Finally, after very extensive negotiations, not only with the Armed \nServices Committee but also with the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand, to a lesser extent, with the Rules Committee, we have hammered out \nthe agreement which has been presented here and has been agreed to and \nwill now go to conference.\n  It had been my desire that there should have been more authority in \nthe Director of Central Intelligence on reprogramming, more authority \non concurrence on the appointment of key officials because of the \ngeneral responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence, but \nthat was not to be.\n  We filed our report at an early stage, but there was a reference \nunder the rules of referral to the Armed Services Committee which took \nconsiderable time and considerable time by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and I thank Senator Warner for not taking time in the Rules \nCommittee.\n  We find ourselves, as we frequently do in the legislative process, \nvery close to the end of the session, not with sufficient time to bring \nthe matter to the floor and to debate the issues of reprogramming or \nconcurrence or appointments or many other issues, so we have had to \nmake an accommodation to have the bill handled by unanimous consent in \nthe course of a few minutes as we have already done earlier today. \nSenator Kerrey, my distinguished vice chairman, and I have agreed to \nthis because, as I say, this is a significant step forward. We want to \ngo to conference. We want to get these provisions accepted and placed \ninto law even though a great deal more should have been done.\n\n  This bill contains very significant provisions on economic espionage, \ncontains a very significant provision on a commission to be established \nto streamline the Federal Government on our handling of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Some 96 different agencies now touch that issue. There is \nnot centralized command. And those are very, very important matters.\n  An interest which I had pursued, to try to give greater authority to \nthe Director of Central Intelligence, has come into the spotlight with \nthe terrorist attack on Khobar Towers on June 25 of this year, and the \nallegation by the Secretary of Defense, in a July 9 hearing in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, that there was intelligence failure, \nwhich I think was an incorrect assertion. The staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee--and I emphasize ``the staff'' and not the full Intelligence \nCommittee--but the staff prepared a report which was released last \nThursday with my conclusions in my capacity as chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, but again not the full committee, but my \nindividual conclusions that there was not an intelligence failure.\n  Then yesterday we had the report of the Downing task force which took \nto task the Pentagon as well as the local field commanders. I \npersonally visited Khobar Towers last month, and on viewing Khobar \nTowers and seeing a fence only 60 feet from these high-rise apartments, \nwhich house thousands of our airmen, 19 of whom were killed and \nhundreds of whom were injured, it was apparent to me, in the face of \nthe many intelligence reports which had been received, that there was \nnot an intelligence failure and that there was in fact a failure by the \nmilitary, going to the Pentagon and the highest levels of the Pentagon, \non failing to act to protect our airmen.\n  The conclusions yesterday of the Downing task force, as featured in \nthe Associated Press reports, faulted the Pentagon, as well as the \nlocal commanders, for what had been done. I make comment of this at \nthis time because I believe this ties into the reform of the \nintelligence community to have a Director of Central Intelligence who \ncollects all of the information and could, in effect, rattle the cages, \nwhere necessary, to call attention to the top Pentagon officials, \nincluding the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nabout the need for greater protection of our forces. We have not gone \nthat far, and we have not accomplished that. I make these comments in \nthe context of what had occurred on June 25 and what happened just \nyesterday with the filing of the Downing committee report.\n  But I have talked to my colleagues about where we stand now, and the \nsentiments have been expressed that we will have a chance to further \nimprove the intelligence community at a later date. But that remains, \nto some substantial extent, unfinished business, as we have unfinished \nbusiness as to how we handle not only intelligence but force protection \naround the United States.\n  But this is a significant step forward. This is the very best we \ncould do. Those who do not know the interworkings of the Senate might \nbe interested to know that any one Senator can tie up this bill. A \nnumber of Senators interposed objections, which we had to work through \nlaboriously to get this bill to the stage where it is now where it has \nbeen passed.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, who \nhas done an extraordinary job in many things over many years, but \nespecially on the Senate Intelligence Committee. As we have worked \ntogether, we have had some tough times, especially as the election \ngrows nearer. We have kept the Intelligence Committee working on a \nbipartisan, nonpartisan basis. I think it is indispensable on a \ncommittee of this sort that the chairman and the vice chairman and \nreally members on both sides of the aisle work very closely to keep \npartisan politics out of it. Senator Kerrey and I have worked \nlaboriously at that and I think we have succeeded, notwithstanding the \nfact that we face some very, very difficult issues and continue to face \ndifficult issues as we work to complete quite a number of projects \nwhich yet remain undone.\n  I would like to single out for special praise--this is always a \ndelicate matter--some key staffers, Charles Battaglia, who is the staff \ndirector, and Chris Straub, who is the staff director for the \nDemocrats, the minority staff director, for the extraordinary work \nwhich they have done on the nights, Saturdays, Sundays, you name it; \nand for general counsel, Suzanne Spaulding, and for Ed Levine, who has \nbeen a powerhouse in drafting very complex reports. I thank the Chair, \nand I note the presence of my colleague, Senator Pell. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague and friend for yielding at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10626-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10648-S10649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IT IS TIME TO DEBUNK THE DANGEROUS MYTHS ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the U.N. General Assembly will convene \nits 51st session. This occasion has particular meaning for me because \n51 years ago I had the honor of serving on the International \nSecretariat of the San Francisco Conference that drew up the United \nNations' charter. In 1970, I was privileged to serve as a \nRepresentative of the United States to the 25th session of the General \nAssembly of the United Nations. This year I have been honored again \nwith my nomination by President Clinton and confirmation by my Senate \ncolleagues to be a representative of the United States to the 51st \nsession of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\n  Having been present at the United Nations' creation and observed its \nwork over the last 50 years, I strongly believe in the need for such a \nbody and in the principles upon which it was founded. While I have \napplauded and participated in efforts to amend and improve the \norganization, I would argue that these last 51 years have witnessed an \nimpressive record of achievement. Though it has not always lived up to \nall the expectations of its founders, the United Nations has \nirrevocably changed the world in which we live. Despite the obstacles \nposed by the politics of the cold war, I can think of numerous examples \nwhere the United Nations succeeded in promoting international peace and \nsecurity--in Namibia, El Salvador, Cambodia, and countless other \ncountries. Whether brokering peaceful settlements to violent conflicts, \nhalting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, protecting the \ninternational environment, or immunizing children from disease, the \nUnited Nations has made the world a safer place. Clearly, if the United \nNations did not exist today, we would have to invent it.\n  I am therefore troubled by the increasingly violent attacks on this \nimportant institution--in Congress, the press, and other public fora. \nThese attacks seem symptomatic of a broader and dangerous tendency to \nseek to retreat from our international commitments and obligations. \nRevolutionary changes in communications, transportation, capital flows, \nand the nature of warfare have irreversibly linked our fate with that \nof the rest of the world. Today, there is no ocean wide enough--nor \nborder fence we could build that would be high enough--to keep out an \noften turbulent world.\n  Rather than abandoning our role as part of the international \ncommunity, we should endeavor to expand and improve cooperation with \nthose states that share our values in order to address our common \nproblems. The United Nations offers a valuable forum for such \ncooperation.\n  With this in mind, I would like to use this opportunity to address \nthree of the more dangerous myths that have been propagated recently \nregarding the United Nations:\n  The first of these myths is that the United Nations somehow threatens \nAmerican sovereignty. Critics of the United Nations have often depicted \nthe organization as a nascent world government eager to supplant the \nnation-state. In fact, the United Nations more accurately resembles an \nunruly debating club, where members control and vote on its activities. \nMoreover, the United Nations charter clearly states that resolutions of \nthe General Assembly are non-binding on member states. In similar \nfashion, United Nations conventions only apply to nations that elect to \nratify them. The one United Nations body in which decisions could be \nbinding upon member-states is the Security Council, where the United \nStates and other permanent members enjoy veto power. Because of these \ninstitutional checks, the United Nations usually must struggle to \nachieve enough of a consensus to make action possible. In no way could \none mistake this organization for an out-of-control bureaucracy \ntrampling upon the prerogatives of nation-states.\n  A second myth about the United Nations is that it does not serve \nAmerican interests. In the most extreme version of this myth, \ncritics imagine that the United States always fares worse when it acts \nmultilaterally, than when it goes it alone. In fact, given that many of \ntoday's most pressing problems--be it crime, disease, environmental \ndegradation, terrorism, or currency crises--transcend national \nboundaries, there is much to be gained from forging common solutions to \ncommon problems.\n\n  The end of the artificial divisions of the cold war has presented the \nUnited States with an extraordinary opportunity to use the United \nNations to advance its foreign policy goals. In the last U.N. session, \nmembers of the General Assembly voted with the United States 88.2 \npercent of the time; 91 percent of Security Council resolutions were \nadopted unanimously. The United Nations has enabled the United States \nto avoid unilateral responsibility for costly and entangling activities \nin regions of critical importance, even as it yields to the United \nStates a position of tremendous authority. To paraphrase former \nSecretary of State James Baker, U.N. peacekeeping is a pretty good \nbargain. For every dollar the United States spends on peacekeeping, it \nsaves many more dollars by preventing conflicts in which it might \notherwise have to become involved.\n  From a cost-benefit perspective, U.S. contributions to the United \nNations and its agencies have been a very worthwhile investment. In \naddition to the American lives and dollars saved by U.N. peacekeeping \nmissions, other U.N. agencies have worked to prevent disaster and death \nand to promote health and security both here in the United States and \nabroad. In 1977, the World Health Organization [WHO] averted an \nestimated 2 million deaths per year by eradicating smallpox. Today, \nWHO's children immunization program saves an estimated 3 million lives \nevery year. In 1992, during a severe drought in Africa, the Food and \nAgriculture Organization and the World Food Programme saved an \nestimated 20 million people from starvation. And in this last week, the \nU.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, which will contribute to the security and well-being of \ngenerations of peoples to come.\n  Which brings me to the third myth: that U.S. participation in the \nUnited Nations is ruinously expensive. In fact, in fiscal year 1996, \nthe United States' assessed and voluntary contributions to the U.N. \nsystem totaled $1.51 billion. That includes $304 million for the U.N. \ngeneral budget, $359 million for peacekeeping operations, $7 million \nfor war crimes tribunals, $337 million in assessments to the United \nNations' specialized agencies, and $501 million in voluntary \ncontributions to programs such as UNICEF and other programs that the \nUnited States has treaty obligations to support. This total American \ncontribution represented less than half of 1 percent of the current \ndefense budget; that allotted for peacekeeping less than the annual \nbudget of the New York City police force.\n  On a per capita basis, the annual U.S. contribution to the U.N. \nregular budget breaks down to slightly more than $1 per American. This \nis considerably less than what most other people in the world pay. For \nexample, the per capita contribution of the U.N.'s newest member state, \nPalau, is over $6 per person. Clearly, the American taxpayer is getting \na good deal for his money.\n  Of course there is certainly room for further economies. Like many \nlarge organizations, the United Nations could be leaner, more \nefficient, and more responsive. But rather than eviscerating one of the \nkey institutional underpinnings of the present international order by \nstarving it of funds, we should work patiently but determinedly with \nlike-minded states and with the U.N. Secretariat to reform and to \nimprove it. I am heartened by the consensus among such strong advocates \nfor U.N. reform as former Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and former \nAssistant Secretary of State John Bolton that the U.S. benefits greatly \nfrom its membership in the United Nations. I also agree with them that \na U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations would be contrary to our \nnational interests.\n  How we go about the task of reforming the United Nations will say a \nlot about the prospects for American leadership in the twenty-first \ncentury. As after World War II, the United States faces a decisive \nchallenge: whether to maintain the mantle of international leadership \nand stay engaged in the creation of a new international order, or to \nseek to retreat into isolationism. The latter course is an even more \ndangerous option today than it would have been 51 years ago. Only \nthrough international engagement and assertive leadership can America \nhope to prosper and safeguard its security in the next century. The \nUnited Nations can serve as an important vehicle for advancing these \nvital national interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10648-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10649-S10650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE RIGHT TO SAY NO\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to make a short statement on my \nstrong disappointment that the energy and water conference report does \nnot include the Senate-passed amendment giving the States and the \ncities the right to say no to the importation of out-of-State garbage.\n  I must say, and I think you remember, Mr. President, this is not a \nnew\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nissue. This has been around since 1989. Essentially, it is a battle \nbetween those States who want to export their trash to another State \nand those States on the receiving end who do not want it.\n  Not long ago in my State, the city of Miles City faced a prospect \nthat was practically a Noah's flood of garbage imports. Fortunately, \nthat plan fell through, but the really crazy and humiliating part of it \nall was that the 5,000 citizens of Miles City could only sit and wait. \nThey had no say at all and no way to stop the waste from coming in. \nWhy? Very simply, because the Supreme Court has struck down attempts by \nStates to limit importation of garbage, saying it violates the commerce \nclause of the Constitution. So we in the Congress have to act and pass \nFederal legislation that enables States and enables local communities \nto say no.\n  It is obviously wrong, Mr. President. It is unfair for any city, \nwhether Miles City or any other city in the United States, to not have \nthe right to say no to garbage coming into their State. As you recall, \nwe in the Senate have done our part. Way back in May of 1995, we passed \na bill to let Montana and other States say no to the importation of \nout-of-State garbage. The House of Representatives, however, has a \ndifferent story. They have stalled. They have stalled on any action in \nthis measure for a couple of years.\n  I say that the people of Montana, the people of Pennsylvania, \nIndiana, Michigan, Ohio, and other States affected by the deluge of \ngarbage coming into their States cannot afford to wait any longer. They \nare anxious. They are concerned. They feel the Government ought to be \nable to do something to address this situation. Some of these States \nare already importing millions of tons of garbage, and they do not want \nto import more.\n  Now it appears that New York City may add 10,000 tons or more of \ntrash every day--10,000 tons of trash every day--when it closes its \nFresh Kills landfill on the outskirts of New York City. That should \ndrive home to everyone, and especially the House, how important it is \nto act and to act quickly.\n  We talk a lot around here about local control, about letting States \ndecide their own destiny, letting local communities decide their own \ndestiny. By saying no to the Senate amendment on this conference \nreport, the House is preventing the people from controlling their own \ndestiny. By saying no, States cannot stop out-of-State garbage from \nbeing dumped in their own backyard.\n  Obviously, the Senate bill we passed is not perfect. It is a \ncompromise. It is a compromise between the importing States that take \ngarbage and do not want the garbage and the exporting States that, \nfrankly, want to export more. It is a compromise. It is a compromise we \ncan live with.\n  Now, the House, apparently, does not want to act. It is not \ncompromising. I say the House should pass something which at least they \nthink makes sense for them. That way, we can work another compromise \nthat is between the House and the Senate, and we can finally solve this \nproblem--it is not the perfect way, but in a way that generally \nresolves the problems so that today more local communities can say no \nto the importation of garbage coming into their States. That is only \nfair. I ask the House to act quickly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are some 25 or 30, at least, \namendments that are relevant to this bill on which the managers have \nbeen notified.

Mr. President, just a few moments ago the Democratic \nconferees that had intended to meet in conference between the House and \nthe Senate to consider the immigration bill were notified that \nconference was indefinitely postponed. No time was established when \nthere might be a follow-up conference.\n  The issues of illegal immigration are of enormous importance to this \ncountry. There are a number of States that are directly impacted by \nillegal immigration, but the problems of illegal immigration also \naffect just about every State in this country in one form or another. \nThere has been considerable discussion and debate about what policies \nwe ought to follow to address the issues of illegal immigration.\n  For a number of years, we have had special commissions that were set \nup by the Congress to look at various immigration issues. We had the \nHesburgh Commission. The commission was bipartisan in nature and made a \nseries of recommendations both with regard to legal and illegal \nimmigration. The Congress acted on both of the recommendations.\n  Subsequently, because of the enormous flow of illegal immigrants \ncoming to the United States, the Hesburgh Commission called for the \nUnited States to respond to the problem. After all, it is a function of \nour National Government to deal with protection of the borders, and \nalso to guard the borders themselves. This area of public policy \npresented an extremely important responsibility for national \npolicymakers.\n  Beginning just about 2 years ago my colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming became the Chair of the Immigration Subcommittee. I have \nenjoyed working with him on immigration--we have agreed on many, many \ndifferent items; we differ on some issues, and some we have had the \ngood opportunity to debate on the floor of the Senate on various \noccasions.\n  In fact, we agreed on many of the provisions in the Senate \nimmigration bill. I welcomed the opportunity to support the legislation \nwhich passed overwhelmingly--97 to 3. Although the legislation was not \nperfect, it represented a bipartisan effort to try to\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\ndeal with the problem of illegal immigration. I can remember how \nChairman Simpson dealt with the issues over a year ago when the Jordan \nCommission was winding up their consideration of illegal immigration \nissues. There were many who felt we ought to rush to judgment. That we \nought to provide amendments on different pieces of legislation. Senator \nSimpson said, ``No; we are going to follow a process and a procedure.'' \nHe spoke as a senior legislator and as someone who has provided \nimportant leadership on the issues of immigration.\n  So we consulted the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and later \nthe full Judiciary Committee, and we consulted with the Jordan \nCommission. We had extensive hearings. We moved through the process of \nmarkup. In the markup itself Senator Simpson took the time to visit the \nmembers of the committee, Republican and Democrat alike, to find their \nprincipal areas of concern--to see if we could find common ground. \nThen, in the best traditions of legislating, we had a series of days of \nmarkups. I daresay the participation of Republican and Democrat alike \nin those markups was enormously impressive. I do not think there is a \nmember of that committee on any side of any issue who does not feel \nthey were given a full opportunity to make the presentation of their \nconcerns and to engage in a dialog, discussion and debate. We had a \nfair hearing of every issue--conducted under the chairmanship of \nSenator Hatch. I believe the entire process took 9 days. They were full \ndays. We did it section by section of the legislation, with \nnotification so members would have an idea which areas were going to be \naddressed each day. This was really in the best traditions of \nlegislating.\n  We moved forward, passed the bill out of the Judiciary Committee, and \nhad extensive debate here on the floor of the Senate. It took a number \nof days, I believe 7 or 8 days. Sometimes the debate was tied up on the \nissues of minimum wage. By and large, the discussion focused on the \nissues of illegal immigration. Then we had the rollcall vote. As I \nmentioned earlier, rarely do we have a matter of this importance pass \nby a margin of 97 to 3 in the U.S. Senate. Especially involving an \nissue on which Senators have many different opinions.\n  Then something happened, Mr. President. We had the appointment of \nconferees in the Senate, Republican and Democrat, but the Democratic \nconferees were never invited to participate in pre-conference \nnegotiations with our Republican colleagues. There were only \nnegotiations between the Republicans in the House of Representatives \nand the Republicans in the Senate. It has only been in the last few \ndays that the House Democrats were actually appointed. It was only in \nthe last few days that they were able to obtain the legislation itself. \nAnd before the Democrats could find out what was in the bill the \nRepublicans drafted, the Democrats had to threaten parliamentary \nmaneuvers in the House.\n  Nonetheless, we were notified we were going to have the conference \nmeeting today at noon; that we were going to have a conference, break \nfor the leadership meetings and then go back and resume the conference. \nThere was a clear anticipation that action would occur on the \nconference report. I had hoped we would be able to revisit some of the \nitems. We had tried to work together with members of the conference who \nwere interested in some of these issues that were not necessarily \npartisan to see if we would at least have an opportunity for a brief \ndebate on some of those. I think we were prepared to have that \ndiscussion and debate and to raise those issues. The most important of \nall of the issues, of course, is the Gallegly amendment, and whether \nwe, as a public policy, are going to dismiss from the public schools of \nthis country those children who may be the sons and daughters of \nillegal immigrants. The Gallegly provision is strongly opposed by the \nlaw enforcement officials and by teachers, who do not become teachers \nonly to be turned into a truant officer who turns in names of suspected \nillegal immigrant children to INS. There were a number of other \nimportant issues in the Republican conference report, which I will \nmention in a few moments.\n  Then we were notified just a few moments ago that our Republican \nfriends are in disarray about what their position is with regard to the \nGallegly amendment, and that there is no consensus. Even right now, \nsince we have been notified that this conference is postponed, there is \nno effort to try to include Democrats in the conference, or to talk \nabout issues of concern to us. There is still no effort, even at this \nlate date, to craft legislation that would deal with a central concern \nof the people of this country, and that is the growth of illegal \nimmigration. The Republican conferees still have not allowed us to \naddress in a bipartisan way what this conference report means in terms \nof job loss for American workers, what it means in terms of crowded \nschools, and what it means for the challenges that we are facing on the \nborders, with all of the complex social and economic criminal elements \nassociated with it. These are complex issues that the Democratic \nMembers want to address and come to some conclusion on.\n\n  Now we are notified that we still do not have an opportunity to \nresolve these issues in a bipartisan way. The conference is postponed \nagain, but the Republicans say they somehow going to get together \nagain. I now understand the power of the majority in being able to push \nlegislation through. Certainly, they do in the House of \nRepresentatives. They are able to have the power to jam legislation \nthrough there. It is more difficult in the Senate. Although a \nconference report is a privileged item, nonetheless, what we find is, \nrather than just sitting down and discussing it in an open kind of \nforum, where the public would be invited to at least observe and to \nunderstand the public policy issues that are being debated, there are \nnegotiations taking place not with the Members of the Congress and \nSenate that have to vote on the legislation, not with the Members of \nthe House and Senate who have worked to try to be constructive and who \nhave supported the legislation here in the U.S. Senate the last time \nthat we came--oh, no, the negotiation is taking place with the Dole \ncampaign officials--the Dole campaign officials. They are the ones that \nare negotiating with the Republican leadership on the shape of the \nimmigration bill.\n  The stories have been out there of the meetings that took place last \nweek and the positions of candidate Dole, who wants, evidently, the \nGallegly amendment included in the final immigration bill, and others \nwithin the Republican Party do not want to have that. It is tied up, I \ndare suggest. It is always a concern to speculate on what the \nmotivations of other people are. But, it is increasingly apparent to \nmany of us that the Republicans want to make very difficult for the \nMembers to deal in a bipartisan way with the issue of illegal \nimmigration. It seems they either want the President to veto the \nlegislation, or let it die in the Senate in the final hours of the \nCongress while Republicans and Democrats alike express their dislike of \nthe Gallegly provisions.\n  So then there might be the opportunity for those to say, look what \nhas happened on the important issue of illegal immigration; we were not \nable to get the bill to the President. The Republican side says that if \nthey take the Gallegly amendment out, the bill may well go through the \nSenate of the United States and House of Representatives, and the \nPresident might sign it and get some credit for it. He might get some \ncredit for the bill in California in an important election year.\n  Now, Mr. President, I don't think I am far off from the facts with \nthat kind of a speculation, particularly when we find that about the \ninability of Republican leadership to try and bring forth a conference \nreport that reflects agreement among Republicans. The American people \ncan say, well, if we can get a good bill, why don't we do it? Do we \nalways have to include the Democrats in it? The fact of the matter is, \nwe have supported illegal immigration proposals. We are interested in \nthis issue of illegal immigration. It is an issue for the Nation to \ndeal with, but it is also a matter which has a dramatic impact on the \nlives of workers in this country, because when they find out that \nunscrupulous employers are going to hire illegals and pay them less \nthan their American counterparts, it has a dampening affect on wages \nfor American workers. That has been debated and discussed, and we have \nvarious studies in the Record. But it is\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\npretty self-evident that one of the principal factors of holding down \nwages in our country is the fact of illegal immigrants taking jobs here \nin the United States.\n\n  Was it so unworthy that we would try, in dealing with the problems of \nillegals. We must recognize that of the million and a half people that \ncome into the United States illegally each year, about 350,000 remain \nin the United States. Get this: Of the workers that come here and \nremain here as illegal workers, half of them came to the United States \nlegally, and overstayed their visas. No amount of border enforcement \ncan deal with them. But they are still taking American jobs, and they \nare continuing to depress the wages of American workers. The only way \nyou are going to get to these illegal workers is in the workplace. As \nthe Jordan Commission pointed out, the most likely employers that hire \nillegals are also the ones that do not respect the fair standards for \nworkers and the working conditions for American workers.\n  We find that in regions of the country where you have the \nexploitation of workers, you find, by and large, the greatest numbers \nof those employers that hire the illegals. Now, in the Senate bill we \nadded 350 labor inspectors to find employers who violate our labor laws \nby hiring illegal immigrants. That is a 50-percent increase in the \namount of inspectors the Department of Labor currently has. What \nhappened to that provision? It has been eliminated by the Republicans. \nIt has been cut out of the conference. It has been absolutely cut out \nof the conference report.\n  One of the important provisions that we debated in the Senate was the \ndevelopment of various pilot programs to verify the eligibility of \npeople to work in the United States. We had Senate provisions crafted \nto test what pilot program would work most effectively, so we can help \nemployers make sure they are able to hire without the fear of \ndiscriminating against American workers. Well, what happened with that \nlanguage? We had good pilot programs. But they were dropped. And a \ndifferent series of programs--and many of us question the effectiveness \nof their results--are authorized. Many would say that the Republican \nconferees eliminated the Senate pilot programs under the weight and \npressure of the business community and unscrupulous employers, so they \ndo not have to face the problems of dealing with hiring illegals.\n  And then, of course, there are the provisions in the law that \nundermine, in a very dramatic way, provisions placed in the Senate bill \nby Senator Simpson dealing with breeder documents--the birth \ncertificates and drivers licenses. This was controversial issue on the \nSenate floor. But, we debated it in a bipartisan way. Now, they too \nhave been changed.\n  One of the principal reasons breeder documents are so essential to \nthe control of illegal immigration is that the breeder document is the \nfundamental document to establish eligibility to work in the United \nStates. We need to cut back on the forgery taking place. What do we \nfind out from that? That provision has been emasculated. It says \ntamper-resistant birth certificates will only be required for future \nbirths, which means that we are going to have this problem for 30 or 40 \nyears, while the next generation begins to grow up and go into the job \nmarket. The conference report has made a sham out of true reform on \nthis issue.\n  It effectively emasculated those very, very important provisions that \nhad been included with the leadership of Senator Simpson. And I think \nthose were tough, difficult provisions for him to adopt and accept. \nBut, nonetheless, it was a very, very key element to controlling \nillegal immigration.\n  We also understand from the Republican conference report, that for \nthe first time in the history of American immigration law, if you are a \nworker working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks of the year, you have a \nvery good chance you will not make enough income to bring in your wife, \nor your husband, or your child. For first time in American immigration, \nthey set a standard of what your income is going to have to be in order \nto bring in a spouse, or a small child. The standard is even higher for \nother members of the family.\n  So the conference report says, if you have the resources, if you are \nwealthy, you are going to have the open opportunity to bring in your \nwife, your kids, your brothers, or your sisters, or your grandparents, \nbut not if you are a member of the working class.\n  This conference report is three strikes and you are out in terms of \nprotecting American workers. They lose protection in the workplace \nbecause the Republicans struck the provisions to provide protection for \nAmerican jobs. They lose the protections that would come out of the \npilot programs to protect American workers--and we are talking about \nAmerican workers--that may trace their ancestry to different parts of \nthe world. But because of the color of their skin, or their accent, or \ntheir appearance, they are the subjects of discrimination. \nDiscrimination which we know exists because GAO has documented it in \nthe past. We are interested in trying to deal with illegal immigration; \nthose who are going to be a burden on the American taxpayer. But we are \nalso interested in trying to protect American workers. And these are \nthe provisions that would have helped to protect American workers, and \nthese are the provisions which have been changed or removed altogether.\n  Mr. President, we had an excellent meeting just a short while ago \nwith a number of our Democratic colleagues from the House and the \nSenate. We reviewed some of the problems we have with this legislation. \nI will try and include as part of a general statement their comments. \nCongressman Becerra talked about the additional kinds of burdens needy \nlegal immigrants are going to face under this legislation. Senator \nLeahy's excellent presentation on summary exclusion pointed out that \nsummary exclusion was a good name for his amendment because so many of \nthe Members of the House and Senate have been summarily excluded from \nany of the conference considerations. But he has reminded us of what \nwould happen to those that have a very legitimate fear of persecution \nand death coming here under the procedures which have been accepted \ninto this legislation despite the fact that the Justice Department in \nthis administration has doubled the number of deportations. Congressman \nFrank and Senator Simon talked about the changes in the test for \nfollowing proving discrimination in the workplace. Under the conference \nreport, you must prove discrimination by an intent test rather than the \neffects test. They talked about how that will complicate enforcement \nand make it exceedingly more difficult to hold any employer liable even \nif they had a pattern or practice of discrimination; Congressman \nRichardson, Howard Berman, Zoe Lofgren of California; and others, \nincluding Congressman Bryant--the ranking member of the House \nImmigration Subcommittee.\n  They talked about the different aspects of this conference. Most, if \nnot all, supported the original legislation. We are deeply disappointed \nin the process and the conference report. It has been four months since \nwe passed the immigration bill in both the House and the Senate. In the \nSenate we voted in early May, and now it is going into the backside of \nSeptember. We voted on this issue. And we have the cancellation of the \nconference. The Senate conferees were appointed right away in May. Now \n4 months later, nothing.\n  Now we hear they are cooking up yet another version of the Gallegly \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this demonstrates that the Republicans really are not \nserious about dealing with illegal immigration. They want a campaign \nissue, not a bill. If they were serious, the conference would be \nmeeting now with bipartisan input. And with the challenge to all of the \nMembers of the House and the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--can we \nget a bill that is going to deal with the problems of illegal \nimmigration?\n  Illegal immigration is a problem. We are committed, as the vote in \nthe U.S. Senate showed, to trying to do something about it. It is not \ntoo late to do something about illegal immigration. But as long as our \nRepublican friends are going to continue to meet behind the closed \ndoors, refusing to let the sunshine in, I fear for what eventually will \ncome out of it.\n  It is a real, great disservice to the American people and to this \ninstitution that we are in this situation. But\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\nwe will be resolute. We still are strongly committed to trying to get \nlegislation that is responsible and that will be effective. We still \nawait any opportunity that might come up to try to offer whatever \njudgments that we might have that can move this process forward in a \nway which would deserve strong bipartisan support for this legislation.\n  It is a complex and a difficult issue. But there is no reason in the \nworld that we can't do it, and do it before the end of this session. \nBut to do so, we have to have the doors and windows opened up for the \npublic's involvement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, let me explain to my colleagues the \ndifference between this amendment and my amendment that you voted on \nearlier this year. In March, I offered an amendment that increased the \nFederal grazing fee for all permittees and those who controlled more \nthan 2,000 animal unit months paid a higher fee. This amendment is \ndifferent. I have raised the ante to provide that, unless a permittee \ncontrols 5,000 animal unit months, he is totally unaffected by my \namendment. In fact, any permittee who controls less than 5,000 animal \nunit months pays the present grazing fee.\n  Let me go back. What is an animal unit month? When you lease lands to \ngraze cattle on Federal lands, you lease it by what is called an AUM, \nor animal unit month. That is the amount of grass it takes to feed one \ncow and her calf for 1 month. Some ranchers, for example those in \nsouthern Arizona and New Mexico, graze 12 months a year. However, most \nof the permittees only graze 4 or 5 months because there is not any \ngrass in the winter months. So you can calculate, based on the current \nrate of $1.35 an AUM, how much a permittee is paying.\n  Why is this important? It is not the money. It is the principle. Mr. \nPresident, grazing occurs on 270 million acres of our Forest Service \nand Bureau of Land Management lands, all Federal lands belonging to the \ntaxpayers of this country--270 million acres. 97 percent of the people \nwho hold grazing permits on those 270 million acres, and there are \n22,350 total operators, are unaffected by the Bumpers amendment. Even \nthe other 3 percent, who are the really big boys, are unaffected on the \nfirst 5,000 AUM's.\n  In other words, if you have 6,000 AUM's on your permit, for the first \n5,000 you would pay the same rate you are paying right now, but on the \nextra 1,000 you pay whatever rate you would have to pay if you leased \nState lands in that particular State where the lands lie.\n  What does that amount to? It means, for example, that the average on \nState lands is $5.58. In Colorado the rate is $4.04. So you pay the \ndifference in Colorado lands for every AUM over 5,000, and you would \npay $4.04.\n\n  Who are these people? Who are these 3 percent that have these AUM's? \nI will show you. I want you to bear in mind we passed a rather harsh \nwelfare bill here just recently. The poorest of the poor in this \ncountry took it on the chin, and yet here is the biggest corporate \nwelfare ripoff going on in America.\n  Who are these people that have more than 5,000 AUM's? And can they \nafford to pay more? If they lease State lands, they pay $5.58. If they \nlease private lands they have to pay $11.20. If they lease Federal \nlands it is $1.35. Can they afford it? Here is Zenchiku, a Japanese \ncorporation, 40,000 acres, 6,000 AUM's. Newmont Mining Co., the biggest \ngold mining company in the world, 12,000 AUM's. William Hewlett of \nHewlett-Packard, 100,000 acres and 9,000 AUM's. Anheuser-Busch, one of \nthe 80 biggest corporations in America, 8,000 AUM's. So I ask you, can \nthese people--J.R. Simplot, in Idaho, an Idaho billionaire, a \nmultibillionaire that controls 50,000 AUM's. Can Mr. Simplot, who is \nworth billions, afford to pay maybe $2.50 more for all his cows above \n5,000?\n  Mr. President, this national ripoff has been going on for almost 50 \nyears. In March the offer I made to the Senate was anything above 2,000 \nAUM's, and I lost by three votes. So yesterday I amended my amendment \nto make it 5,000 hoping I could at least cause three people to change \ntheir minds about this. It is a terrible thing for us to continue to \nallow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 6 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe Senator Craig will be down here shortly. I \nask that the Chair inform me when I have used 5 minutes, if you would, \nplease, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, there are very different ways in which \nthe public domain is used from the standpoint of grazing permits. It \nhappens in a State like mine we have 5,000 permittees. The overwhelming \nnumber are small ranchers. And they use, for the most part, the public \ndomain for 12 months out of the year.\n  So the amendment that Senator Bumpers is talking about uses this big \nnumber, 5,000 animal unit months, which is really about 400 head of \ncattle if you graze on the public domain for 12 months out of the year. \nSo it sounds like a monster, but in States like mine it is a relatively \nmodest cattle ranching operation.\n  Second, to say to those who ranch on the Federal land, ``You may be \nasked to pay the same as the State fee for this land,'' not only \ninvites a fee schedule that is different from State to State, but the \nState leases its land on completely different rules than the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Yesterday, in a few minutes on the floor, I suggested that if the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas would like to make the public \ndomain in a sovereign State subject to the same inhibitions and/or \nrestrictions that the State land has, then maybe some consideration \nmight be given to charging a State fee.\n  Let me give you a major example. In one of the States, the State land \ncannot be used for anything other than grazing, if you lease it for \ngrazing, everyone else is denied access to that land. You cannot get on \nit for recreation. You cannot get on it for hunting and fishing. But we \nhave decided on the public domain that we lease our land under \ncompletely different conditions. We lease for grazing, and it is still \nopen to hunting and fishing and to the building of habitat for wild \ngame and for fish.\n  So the argument that there is some kind of advantage and some kind of \nreality and some kind of logic to saying, let us charge what the \nState's charge is, ignores the fact that the State leases its land \nunder completely different rules, regulations, conditions, and \ninhibitions.\n  Additionally, we do not need two sets of fees. We do not need a fee \nfor the rancher in northern New Mexico who has 200 head of cattle and \nup the road\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\nfor somebody who has 600 head of cattle a different fee schedule. That \nis subject to manipulation. Even the Department of the Interior, when \nwe suggested it before, said it will not work to have two separate sets \nof fees. I am not here defending large versus small, but clearly, we do \nnot need that. I gave some examples yesterday of how that might work. \nIt would come out with very large corporations being able to pay the \nlower fee and very small, independent operators with 450 head having to \npay a higher fee.\n  Last, but not least, an amendment comparable to this was introduced \nlast year. It failed. We took a comprehensive bill to the House. That \nbill changes some of the rules and regulations and increases the fee \nabout 40 percent. We believe you need to change the rules and \nregulations before you increase the fees. That is pending between the \nHouse and the Senate. And to come along on an Interior appropriations \nbill and change the fee schedule, as recommended, does not seem to this \nSenator to be the thing to do at this time.\n  So when the time is up, I will move, on behalf of all of those who \nhave supported the grazing reform and the defeat of a similar \namendment, I will move to table it. I hope that the Senate will respond \nby letting this matter lie where it is, an argument now between the \nHouse and the Senate on a comprehensive reform bill which also will \nprovide for very significant increases in grazing fees. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Bumpers amendment to raise grazing fees on public lands. The future \nof many livestock producers in Utah and elsewhere in the country is \nthreatened by this amendment.\n  I am not aware of any cattle producers in Utah who will be making a \nprofit this year. At the same time as Utah ranchers are facing dismally \nlow prices for their cattle, they have been hit with a devastating \ndrought. On top of this, economic conditions in Canada and Mexico have \nflooded our United States market with their cattle.\n  Ranchers who have grazed these lands for generations are being forced \nto pull up their stakes and close up shop. With the cattle industry in \nsuch bad shape, many agricultural lenders, aware of the possibility of \nincreased grazing fees on public lands, have become increasingly \nunwilling to lend to livestock producers. An increase in grazing fees \nnow could be devastating.\n  This amendment would exempt ranchers from higher fees who have \npermits for fewer than 5,000 AUM's, or animal unit months. Animals are \nnumbered and accounted for by animal unit months. An AUM represents a \nunit of forage that is normally consumed by one cow and her calf or \nfive sheep over a 1-month period. Unlike many States, Utah public lands \nare grazed in the summer and the winter. A rancher owning as few as 500 \nhead of cattle and grazing them for 10 months would need 5,000 AUM's. \nSuch a rancher would be subject to these higher fees. Especially hard \nhit by this amendment would be Utah's beleaguered sheep grazers, a \nlarge proportion of whom would be faced with these higher fees.\n  Grazing fee increases will accomplish little more than to drive many \nfamily ranchers out of business. Of course, some private land owners \ncharge more than the Federal Government for grazing on their lands. \nPrivate owners provide services which public lands do not. The Federal \nGovernment does not stock water ponds, provide fences, or provide \nroads. Ranchers using the public lands must provide these things for \nthemselves at their own expense.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will not result in increased revenue \nfrom public lands. It will more than likely decrease revenue as \nranchers who can no longer afford to use public lands find other \noptions or go out of business.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that there are few other options for \ngrazing land in Utah. The BLM controls 22 million acres of land in our \nState. The Federal Government controls 70 percent of our State.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to maintain what is not \nonly an important part of our Western heritage, but an important sector \nof the economy of many Western States. The next time my colleagues sit \ndown to a nice juicy steak or to a hamburger with their kids at the \nlocal fast food restaurant, I hope my colleagues will remember that \nsome rancher worked hard to produce it and may have even lost money for \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the \nBumpers amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have certainly enjoyed over the years \nthe spirited debates in which I have engaged with my good friend from \nthe State of Arkansas. He is a most passionate and articulate \nrepresentative of his constituents and he is certainly a credit to \nthem. In the debate over raising grazing fees on ranchers who use the \npublic lands, however, I find myself pining for a new subject. We have \noft been down this road before. We have heard it all; about how those \nrotten billionaire ranchers are ripping off the American people; about \nhow they are overgrazing and ruining the lands; about how we should \nhave a progressive fee system that would hit some ranchers hard and \nleave others alone; about the inequity of rates charged for Federal \nversus State lands. It is all ``old hat.''\n  Mr. President, I commend Senators Thomas, Craig, Domenici, Burns and \nall the others who have spoken out against this poor idea. I would be \nhard pressed to express my objections more cogently than they have \ndone. Let me just underline a few concerns that those of us from \nWestern States share with regard to this issue.\n  And these concerns are many. Indeed, I dare say that I cannot see one \nvirtue in this amendment. To begin with, let there be no doubt about \nit: This amendment is not an effort to inject fairness into public \nlands grazing. Rather, this is the effort of interests who want nothing \nmore than to get private ranchers off of public lands. ``Cattle free in \n93'' was the clarion call during the last Presidential election of \nthose who hold this view. Fairness? What is fair about it? As my good \nfriend and colleague from the State of Idaho has pointed out, if it is \nfairness this amendment is after, then all parties should be paying the \nsame rate, rather than pitting one class against the other. Of course, \nthose of us on this side of the aisle are not surprised by this pitch: \nIt is just such attempts to engender class warfare that those on the \nother side of the aisle have excelled at for lo these many years. \nFairness? What is fair about penalizing success? What is fair about \ndiscouraging small ranchers from becoming successful ranchers? The \nsupporters of this amendment moan that the taxpayers aren't getting \ntheir money's worth out of our ranchers. How much money do they think \nwill be returned to the Treasury when many of these ranchers go out of \nbusiness because they have been barred from these lands--and again let \nme stress: This is most assuredly their ultimate goal.\n  Environmentalists are forever trying to sell the American people a \nquick Persian rug about ``enviro dollars,'' and all of the money just \nwaiting to be generated by tourism. Good heavens. In Western States \nlike mine the tourist season on these lands is only a few months long \nat best. And has it occurred to no one what tourist jobs pay? Unless \nyou own the motel you are probably making five bucks an hour changing \nbed sheets. Colonial Williamsburg, just a couple hours drive south of \nhere, is one of the healthiest tourist enterprises in the country, yet \nthere are people with 15 years seniority there who topped out long ago \nat eight or nine dollars an hour. The chimera of Tourism as a \nsubstitute for natural resource use on our public lands is one of the \ngreat hoaxes perpetrated on the American people by environmentalists. I \nguarantee you that tourism will not return more money to the Treasury \nthan grazing lease holders.\n  But perhaps most offensive about the effort to rid our public lands \nof private ranchers is the fact that Western States are owned to an \nenormous degree by the Federal Government: My State of Wyoming--52 \npercent; Idaho--63 percent; Nevada--a whopping 87 percent. What are the \npeople of the West to do but use these lands? Eastern States are not \nowned by the Federal Government to near this degree. Nor is the State \nof Arkansas, as my friend from Idaho has pointed out.\n  Fairness? What is fair about charging the same to graze on BLM lands \nas that charged on State and private\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\nlands? BLM land users have to furnish their own improvements; fences, \nculverts, water tanks. They must contend with public access to their \nherds. They have tighter restrictions on what predators they can and \ncannot control and a host of other differences.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is neither fair nor prudent. We have \ndefeated it before and I encourage my colleagues to defeat it again. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on our side and on Senator \nBumpers' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 4 minutes, 53 \nseconds remaining; the Senator from Arkansas has 3 minutes, 42 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield all of my time to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me echo again what the Senator from New \nMexico has just said. This is a fascinating precedent being established \nhere in this amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, precedent in the \nway we would sell public resources.\n  Never before have we said to a large timber company, ``You're going \nto pay a premium for the tree because you're larger,'' and to the \nsmaller timber producer, ``You'll pay less.'' We have never said to a \nrich person who walked into a national park, ``You're rich, so you'll \npay more.'' And we have never said, therefore, to the poor person, \n``You will pay less.'' We have always established what we believed was \na fair market price for the value of the public resource. That is your \njob, Mr. President, and that is mine.\n  This past year we made every effort to accomplish that. We debated it \nlong and loud in the committee that the Senator from Arkansas and I are \nmembers of. We agreed and disagreed; and we came back again and \nstructured another provision to reform. It had a fee increase in it for \nall parties who would lease the public's grass.\n  But what the Senator from Arkansas is saying is, ``If you're rich, \nthis blade of grass for your cow will cost you more than if you are \nless rich.'' You and I both know that deciding who is rich and who is \nnot rich is very arbitrary. Sometimes you can own 1,000 head of cattle, \nand owe the bank $5 million, and have a net worth of nearly zero. That \nhappens in the cattle business on occasion. I doubt that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas would call that rich, because if that individual rancher \nliquidated, there may be nothing left, especially after estate taxes \nand all of those kinds of things.\n  But the important issue here is that the Senate heard the need from \nthe public to raise the grazing fees and to reform grazing, and we \ndid, and the Senate acted.\n\n  I do not know where the Senator from Arkansas is coming from at this \nmoment other than for the political sound bite for the up and coming \ncampaign, because it is precedent setting, very precedent setting, to \nargue that we will divvy up the blades of grass of the public domain by \nwho is rich and who is poor, and we will use that as a determination. \nWe have never done it in any other way of selling a public resource, \nand we all recognize the importance of marketing public resources to \nget a fair and effective return to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, that is what this Senate did. I think we ought to be \nproud of that work. Now, to attempt an end run around that effort, an \nend run that is precedent setting and totally unbalanced, is, without \nquestion, in my opinion, the wrong way to go. It divides the grazing \ncommunities of the West. It should not be allowed to do that. It \ntotally rearranges what has been a historic arrangement that has \nstabilized the West and brought good stewardship to the public lands.\n  The stewardship now recognized by the Department of the Interior has \nresulted in better conditions on Western grazing lands than in the last \n100 years. We, as trustees of that public domain, ought to be proud of \nthat because we have insisted that stewardship go forward.\n  Now, that stewardship is a product of the relationship of the \npermittee--that is, the rancher who has the permit that leases the \ngrass that grazes the cattle--that stewardship resulted in the quality \nof the rangeland we now have. If you break it up into a rolling crap \nshoot of a kind that has been proposed by the Senator from Arkansas, \nthat stewardship goes away. No longer do you have the kind of longevity \nin grazing that goes from generation to generation with the clear \nrecognition that that has produced quality stewardship, quality \nrangeland, quality wildlife habitat, and by the Department of Interior \nmanagers' own admission, the best conditions in rangelands in 100 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I hope we could table this amendment. I think it is \nwrong. I think it is unfair to divide the rich and the poor and \nestablish that kind of an argument. If we do that, I think you and I \nwill want to come back here and say to the millionaires that walk into \nour national parks, ``You are rich, you pay more; for those on food \nstamps, if you can get to the parks, you pay less.''\n  That that should not be the way we do it, but that is what is being \nproposed here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from \nArkansas has 3 minutes and 42 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, which \nis not about rich and poor, but about marketplace economies and \ncapitalism, which made this country great. Basically, what we have here \nis a program which essentially allows people to take advantage at an \nextraordinarily low rate, a subsidized interest, paid for by the \ntaxpayers of America.\n  Mr. President, $58 million a year is spent on this land. The United \nStates gets back $14 million. What we are suggesting is that for those \npeople who use this land excessively, who have a large number of AUM's \nthat exceed the 97 percent of the people who are not going to be \nimpacted, just the top 3 percent of the people using this land, who use \nit to such an extensive rate, that those people should pay a rate that \nis a higher rate.\n  Today's rate is 43 percent less than what was paid in 1980. What we \nare suggesting is a rate which does not even account for what the \ninflation increase would be had that 1980 rate not been brought \nforward. It is a reduced rate, even by the simple terms of reflecting \nback to the 1980's and adding inflation.\n  We are suggesting a rate much closer to fairness, to equity, that \ngives to the taxpayers of this country, all of whom happen to own this \nland--it is not just owned by folks in the West--a reasonable return on \nthe investment they are making.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Idaho alluded to what fair market prices are. If you live \nin Idaho--the Senator from Idaho mentioned he tried to establish a fair \nmarket price--the price is $1.35 AUM if you lease lands for grazing \nfrom the U.S. Government. But if you lease lands for grazing from his \nhome State of Idaho, you have to pay $4.88 for the same thing, and in \nNew Mexico, it is $3.54.\n  The average that States charge for the same thing we get $1.35 for is \n$5.58. Why are the States so much smarter than we are? If you rent in \nthe private sector, the national average is $11.20.\n  The Senator from Idaho said we are trying to separate the rich from \nthe poor. Nothing of the kind. These people I am talking about--\nAnheuser-Busch, Newmont--I do not think they argue they are poor, they \ncannot afford to pay more, for example, than what his State would \ncharge. If they are poor, if people who have 5,000 AUM's, which is all \nthis amendment covers, if they are poor, who are these 97 percent below \nthem? We do not touch anybody except people like Anheuser-Busch, \nNewmont Mining, William Hewlett, J.R. Simplot, the biggest \ncorporations, wealthiest people in America.\n  I do not blame them. I would get land for $1.35 before I would lease \nit from the State of Idaho for $4.88, or lease it from somebody who \nowned land for $11.20. All we are trying to do is say, if you want this \nland, fine, we will give you 5,000 AUM's at this ridiculously low \nprice. If you go above that, you will have to pay a little more.\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n  We all know what this is. I heard all of this debate yesterday about \nall these poor little ranchers. The poor little ranchers out there are \nnot touched under this amendment. They can graze 418 head every month \nfor 12 months. Most permittees do not graze livestock on the Federal \nlands for 12 months. Most of them only graze about 5 months a year, so \nyou have to have 1,000 head on most of this land before you even get \ntouched by this. If you have 1,000 head, you ain't poor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arkansas has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Bumpers amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Howard Greene traveled across the \nChesapeake Bay from Lewes, DE, to the Senate in 1968, and he has been \npresent in the Halls of the Capitol ever since. He developed a deep \nknowledge and understanding of the Senate as he rose through the ranks \nfrom Doorkeeper to Cloakroom assistant to Secretary for the Minority \nand Majority to Sergeant at Arms. His loyal service spans from \nRepublican leaders Everett Dirksen, Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and Trent \nLott. He served almost three decades.\n  Members have come to rely on Howard's ability to help count noses. I \nknow I did when I was whip in the Chamber here for 8 years.\n  While sometimes it seemed that Howard had a crystal ball, it was his \ncareful analysis, knowledge of the issues, understanding of the \nMembers, and his hard work that provided information that usually made \nhis forecasts correct. Vice Presidents, in their role as Presidents of \nthe Senate, have relied on Howard's assistance and experience \nparticularly during times when debates were intense and votes could be \nclose.\n  We have been able to count on Howard for almost 30 years, and he has \nbeen there when he was needed by the Senate. But better than that, he \nhas been able to participate where he could be of help. He has not had \nto be asked. His colorful descriptions of everyday situations and sense \nof humor helped lighten the atmosphere during some of our longer and \nlongest days and nights. He was here on some of the longest ones.\n  Those of us who traveled with Howard over the years know what a fine \ntraveling companion he really is. One of his sad tasks was to arrange \nfor Senators to travel to funerals or memorial services for departed \nSenators. When Howard made those arrangements, the appearance of \nMembers of the Senate was one of dignity, organization, and meaningful \ncaring for those who survived one of our former colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe Senators on both sides of the aisle know \nthat Howard's allegiance to the Senate and his loyalty to its Members \nand his love of our country would be hard to match. Many Senators and \nstaff members who have retired would echo my words of tribute to my \nfriend.\n  Today, as his service in the Senate is about to end, I have asked for \npermission to request the Senate to pay this special tribute to Howard \nGreene. He will be missed by many of us.\n  I understand there will be time up to 15 minutes for Members of the \nSenate to add their comments, but let me first ask unanimous consent \nthat the resolutions be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and statements made to \nthese resolutions appear at this point in the Record.\n  The second resolution is comparable to that which was offered for \nseveral other Sergeants of Arms and recognizes their service by a \nprovision for terminal leave compensation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions (S. Res. 293 and S. Res. 294) were agreed to.\n  The preamble to Senate Resolution 293 was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 294) is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 294\n\n       Resolved, (a) That the individual who was the Sergeant at \n     Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate on September 1, 1996, and \n     whose service as the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the \n     Senate terminated on or after September 1, 1996 but prior to \n     September 6, 1996, shall be entitled to one lump sum payment \n     consisting of severance pay in an amount equal to two months \n     of the individual's basic pay at the rate such individual was \n     paid on September 1, 1996.\n       (b) The Secretary of the Senate shall make payments under \n     this resolution from funds appropriated for fiscal year 1996 \n     from the appropriation account ``Miscellaneous Items'' within \n     the contingent fund of the Senate.\n       (c) A payment under this resolution shall not be treated as \n     compensation for purposes of any provision of title 5, United \n     States Code, or of any other law relating to benefits \n     accruing from employment by the United States, and the period \n     of entitlement to such pay shall not be treated as a period \n     of employment for purposes of any such provision of law.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, in praising Howard Greene. During the 16 \nyears that I have had the privilege of serving in the Senate, I have \ncome to know Howard Greene and have great admiration and respect for \nhim.\n  Senator Stevens talked about the Republican majority leaders Dirksen \nand Baker and Dole and what great service they received from Howard \nGreene. In a sense, Howard Greene was a leader's leader because he \nwould always provide information and insights of enormous value to the \nleadership.\n  We are blessed, in the Senate, to have personnel who serve in the \ncapacity of--you might call them clerks, or you might call them \ndirectors, or you might call them, in effect, assistant leaders. When \nHoward Greene was here, I would frequently go to him, as would most of \nmy colleagues, and want a prediction about what was going to happen. \nPeople who may watch the Senate intermittently on C-SPAN do not know \nthat our schedules are very unpredictable. Some times people ask, \n``When will the Senate adjourn?'' I customarily say, ``When the last \nSenator stops speaking.'' Howard Greene customarily had a good idea as \nto when the last Senator would stop speaking.\n  When he was promoted to the Sergeant at Arms, a very important and \nprestigious position in the Senate, I was, in a sense, sorry to see it \nhappen, because no longer would Howard Greene patrol the floor. That \nfamiliar sight when he would come out of those double doors, straighten \nhis tie and adjust his coat and walk down that step. Even Elizabeth \nGreene laughs at the recapture of Howard Greene entering\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\nthe Senate Chamber. He was always busy. Howard Greene was really a \ngreat aid and comfort to all the Senators. When the going got rough, I \nwould call him in the evening or call him on weekends, and he was \nalways available to help over the rough administrative hurdles.\n  I know my colleague Senator Roth has come to the floor, and he \nintends to talk about Howard Greene as well. But I think Howard Greene \nwas a tremendous asset to the U.S. Senate. I, for one, am very sorry to \nsee him terminate his service here. But I wish him the very best in the \nyears ahead, and I know we will all continue to work with him and \nadmire him and respect him for his contribution to this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I just take a moment to associate myself \nwith the remarks of the distinguished Senators from Alaska and \nPennsylvania, as they relate to our friend Howard Greene.\n  I think you have to understand the institution to understand the \nvalue of an individual like Howard Greene. I think you have to \nunderstand the fairness, you have to understand that your word is good, \nthat when you tell a Senator something, that is the way it is. If \nsomething happens that it cannot occur that way, you have the good \njudgment to come back and say to that Senator it cannot happen now, and \ntell him why.\n  I have never talked to Howard Greene and asked for anything, but what \nI received the most courteous attention as if I was the only one \nseeking any kind of information or help from him.\n  So I will miss Howard Greene. I think the Senate will miss Howard \nGreene. I hope those who are taking Howard's place will understand that \nthey are filling very, very large shoes.\n  To my friend Howard, I wish him well. I hope his days ahead are full \nof pleasure, and I hope that he can find something that will fulfill \nhim as much as his operation here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I join in the tribute to Howard Greene. \nI worked with him here in my 17\\1/2\\ years in the Senate. He has been \nvery helpful to me. He has been a friend of mine. He has been an \noutstanding public servant, a man of conviction and honesty and hard \nwork.\n  I do not know if the public realizes how hard some of these staff \npeople work around here to keep this place going. I saw it firsthand, \nin many cases when we were in session at night.\n  Howard Greene certainly exemplifies hard work and honesty and \ngoodness. I join my colleagues in paying tribute to him here today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I just want to pay my respects to Howard \nGreene for being such a good friend and a solid worker around here in \nthe U.S. Senate. Wherever he has worked he has served with distinction, \nhe served with a great deal of verve, and he has been a very good \nfriend for all of us. I would feel very badly if I did not get out here \nand say a few nice things about him, because Howard has always had an \nopen mind, he has always been willing to listen, he has always tried to \nhelp. He has helped me on a number of occasions, as I know he has every \nSenator, and he deserves our respect, and I certainly want to pay my \nrespect to him today.\n  I am sorry he is retiring, but I wish him the very best in his \nretirement, and I hope, if there is ever any occasion for me to give \nany assistance or help to him, I would certainly like to be there for \nhim. He is a great person who I think served this U.S. Senate with \ngreat distinction. I just wanted to say those few words here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is fitting for me to offer a few words \nconcerning Howard Greene and his service to the U.S. Senate. Howard is \nfrom my home State of Delaware. He began his service to the Senate in \n1968, as a doorman in the gallery. At the time, he was only 26, \nattending the University of Maryland. His objective was to become a \nhistory teacher. Howard was an ambitious young man--bright and \nextremely able. In this environment, he gained the attention of \nSenators and became more and more interested in the political process--\nespecially the daily proceedings here on Capitol Hill.\n  When an opportunity presented itself in the early 1970's, Howard \nmoved into the Republican Cloakroom. After this important promotion in \nHoward's young life, you can imagine his surprise when his mother said, \n``Congratulations, Dear. Does that mean you'll be hanging up the \nSenators' coats?'' It was while in the Cloakroom that Howard \ndistinguished himself as one who could get things done. His attention \nto detail, and service to others became defining qualities, as did his \nkeen insight into complex legislative issues.\n  Those who knew Howard, trusted his insights, and his activities drew \nhim into even greater involvement with the daily affairs of the Senate. \nThey prepared him well for a new assignment as Assistant Secretary for \nthe Minority, under Mark Trice.\n  With the election of Ronald Reagan and the Republican majority, \nHoward was appointed Secretary by Howard Baker. It was while he served \nin that capacity that many of us came to appreciate his organizational \nskills, his diplomacy, and leadership.\n  Howard has now served 2 years as Sergeant at Arms. His love for the \nSenate and the legislative process have continued. In his years of \nservice, he had done Delaware proud.\n  From his upbringing in the small town of Lewes, to his work in the \nmost powerful legislative body on Earth, Howard Greene is, indeed, a \nsmalltown boy who made good.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate, I can say \nwithout any equivocation, Howard Greene was one of those individuals to \nwhom I and my colleagues--we had one of the largest classes of Senators \nat that particular time; took our oaths in 1979--but he was the man to \nwhom we looked for a lot of advice and guidance.\n  The distinguished Senator, Mr. Howard Baker, was then our leader on \nthe Republican side. And it was clear that Mr. Baker placed in Howard \nGreene a great deal of confidence and respect, and indicated to Mr. \nGreene, to the extent he could be of assistance to the newcoming \nSenators, to do so. That early experience with him led to many, many \ntimes that we worked together.\n  I find him to be a person extremely knowledgeable about the rules of \nthe Senate. While the rules of the Senate are the subject of great \ndiscussion many, many times, there is a lot that is not in the rules. \nBut, nevertheless, Senators are expected to follow the traditions. And \nhe was particularly astute about all the unwritten traditions of the \nSenate. And certainly in my class--and I hope it will always be a part \nof Senate life--we were very anxious to comply with the rules of the \nSenate, be they written or unwritten, as a part of tradition.\n  Howard Greene played a very valuable role to my class. I see my \ndistinguished colleague here from Wyoming, Senator Simpson. He \nremembers well Howard Greene and how he worked with our class, and in \nthe years thereafter. He was also pretty tightlipped. There were many \ntimes he sat in on meetings. I found that he was able to hold those \nexchanges that sometimes were heated between Senators, and do it very \nwell.\n  So speaking for myself, and I hope others will join me, we wish him \nvery well in his next challenge in life professionally. I wish to \nexpress my fond farewell and my gratitude in terms of what he did for \nme individually, what he did for my class of Senators, and\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\nwhat he did for almost three decades of service in the U.S. Senate. I \nhope that younger persons now coming along and seeking to have a role \nin the Senate will look upon Howard Greene as one that set standards \nthat they should strive to accept. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in paying \ntribute to Howard Greene for the service that he has provided this \nbody. My personal association with Howard goes back to my election to \nthe Senate and coming to this body in 1980. I had little association \nwith Washington, DC, and little association with Senate procedure, and \nI found Howard extraordinarily talented in addressing the egos of some \n100 individual Members of this body.\n  He always reminded me of a person who had the ability to keep all the \nballs up in the air, all at once if necessary, and in meeting the \nneeds, the desires, not only of the Members during the normal course of \nbusiness, but oftentimes it would be necessary to phone him after \nhours. I found him more than willing to go beyond just accommodating \nMembers in the normal activities of our daily lives, but to make an \neffort to accommodate the needs of family and family members.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that as I look back on my career in the \nSenate, approaching some 16 years, I look back on it with fond memories \nof my association with Howard.\n  The occasional traveler. Howard was, in my opinion, a white-knuckle \nflier. He had some inhibitions about the ability of the particular \ncraft to get him to where he was going and, more importantly, back. One \nnight we were flying over the Atlantic, and I do not know whether we \nwere in the Azores or where, but we had to refuel. And we were in an \nold Boeing 707 that the Air Force had, and occasionally the gear did \nnot go down. One of the gears locked up on this particular night, would \nnot go down. The normal procedure for eliminating that experience was \nto put the plane in a slide dive and pull up rather abruptly, and that \ntheoretically would drop the gear. Of course, the Air Force aircraft \nare not known for their public address systems. Some of us had some \nidea of the procedure, and Howard was simply terrified through the \nentire process, which I think resulted in some libation of some nature, \nor at least a visit to a watering hole when we hit the ground, to which \nhe was entitled and probably all of us as well.\n  I cite a more recent visit that I had with Howard when I had an \nopportunity to participate as chairman of the United States-Canadian \nInterparliamentary where we flew out of Prince Rupert, British \nColumbia, with many of our Canadian counterparts, Members from \nParliament from both the lower house and the upper house, and then took \nan Alaskan ferry on up through Ketchikan and Juneau, and then went on \npast the Yukon Railroad out to Whitehorse where we were again joined by \nmembers of the Yukon territorial parliamentary body. And I found his \ninsight, his long memory of the Senate, particularly some of the \nhumorous sides of our relationships with one another, to be very \ninteresting and rewarding.\n  So I just add, that Howard Greene's contribution to the Senate will \nbe long remembered by those who served with him, who knew him, and who \nloved him. I join others in wishing him well as he proceeds with what \nis ahead of him in his life. And I thank him for his friendship and for \nhis accommodation. I wish him well. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my friend from Alaska, Mr. President.\n  Just let me pay my own personal tribute for a moment to Howard \nGreene. When I came here to the Senate with Senator Warner, our first \nmeeting, our first official conduct, our first official briefing, was \nwith one Bill Hildenbrand and with Howard Greene, very special people, \nboth of them. They worked so well together. These two smoothed my path \nin this place, and certainly Howard Greene was, in my role as assistant \nleader of the Senate, always there. He was there. He gave me full \nmeasure of himself, as so many have here who do the work of the Senate.\n  Those who are here today who knew Howard, worked with him closely, he \nwas always there for me in my role as assistant leader. As I say, he \ngave me full measure--loyal, helpful, persistent, a source of good \ncounsel--and a strong, yes, yes, strong, taskmaster. He was good at \norganizing things, the official visits, the trips, the Presidential \nfunerals, the official trips we had to do, and he was always well \norganized.\n  He will be remembered for his love and loyalty to the Senate as an \ninstitution, for he loved this place from his youth and from his early \nbeginnings. He was my strong right arm in my work, and I owe him my \ndeepest thanks and respect. I shall miss his good humor, ribald as it \nwas. I wish him well. There is much more for him to do in life. I wish \nhim well. I wish him peace of mind. I wish him good health. He has many \nfriends. He can certainly always know that this is one. Ann and I wish \nhim the very best. God bless him in his new endeavors of life.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in paying \ntribute to Howard Greene and in saying words about our good friend. He \nhas been my good friend for the past 20 years.\n  I came to the Senate, and Bill Hildenbrand and Howard Greene were two \npeople who took me under their wings. My own judgment at the time was \nthat Bill Hildenbrand knew almost everything that needed to be known \nabout Washington. He seemed to be a man of consummate experience, a \nperson who had been involved in campaigns but, likewise, in the running \nof the Senate from time immemorial. Howard Greene seemed to be his \ndeputy, his teammate, a person of great vigor, who would stride up and \ndown the aisles of this Hall with determination and always with success \nin finding the person, the bill, the detail that was required.\n  It was exciting to watch them. It gave me confidence that some people \nhad confidence in what was being done, and I thought if I watched \ncarefully I might learn more, and I did from both of these gentlemen. \nDuring recent years, Howard's growing responsibilities have been a real \npleasure--seeing his own growth as a person, as an administrator, as \none who has served Government well, has served the people of the United \nStates, really, with distinction, in large part because he helped all \nof us to be more effective and to have some idea of what we were doing \nand how we might do it better.\n  I am delighted to have this opportunity, and I appreciate the leader \ngiving us the opportunity today, to say good words about people who \nhave meant a lot to us, and especially about the person that we honor \non this particular afternoon, Howard Greene.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I noticed that some of my colleagues \ncommented about the service of Howard Greene, retiring as Sergeant at \nArms of the Senate. They referred to their long years of experience \nwith Howard and the great service that he has rendered to the Senate \nduring those years.\n  I am a relatively new Senator and don't have that kind of experience \nto draw on, but I can offer the perspective of a relative newcomer to \nthis body and to the service that Howard Greene provided when I was \ntrying to find my way around. I found very quickly that if I wanted an \nanswer to a question, I went to Howard Greene and I always got one--\nquickly, accurately, and sometimes very, very succinctly. Howard is not \na man who wastes words.\n  I found when I needed assistance in working through possible \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\nassignments and understanding the program and how it all works, Howard \nGreene was there at my side to give me the assistance I needed and \nhelped me find my way through that, which could be so confusing to a \nnewcomer. Subsequently, as a member of the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I had the opportunity to \ninteract with Howard during appropriations hearings that he was called \nupon to attend as the Sergeant at Arms. I found that he was not only \nconcerned about Senators and taking care of the needs of Senators, he \nwas also very concerned about the people under his jurisdiction. The \nCapitol Police come to mind as one area where Howard focused primarily \non the personal needs of the members of the Capitol Police.\n  When I made a suggestion in the subcommittee about something that \ncould be done within the law that would make life better for the \nCapitol Police, Howard picked up on it immediately and said, ``We will \ndo that.'' A little while later, I checked back and said, ``Has anybody \nfollowed through on this?'' I needn't have done that checking back. It \nwas Howard Greene who said, ``We will do that,'' and the staffers \nlooked at me and said, ``Yes, Senator, that is in the bill.''\n  So as he moves on to another circumstance and phase in his life, I \nwant him to know that he goes with not only the good wishes of some of \nthe old-timers around here, but a few of us newcomers as well recognize \nthe service he has rendered, the friendship that he has offered, and \nthe excellence with which he has performed his job.\n  I wish Howard the very best in whatever he now undertakes and tell \nhim that the Senator from Utah will always look fondly upon Howard \nGreene as one of his friends.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join with my \ncolleagues this afternoon in paying special respect here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate to our friend Howard Greene. He has served this \ninstitution with great dignity, with great candor, and certainly with \ngreat understanding and respect for the Senate of the United States and \nfor each and every Senator.\n  He has respected and served and answered to not only the Senators on \nthat side of the aisle, but he has been most respectful and most \nhelpful also to the Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\n  Howard Greene is the type of individual who makes the U.S. Senate not \nonly unique, but I think that because of his service to the Senate and \nhis years involved with the Senate, the U.S. Senate is better today \nbecause of his years of very, very distinguished service. He is a part \nof the heart and the nerve and the sinew that makes the U.S. Senate \nwhat it is today, Mr. President.\n  I take great pride in being able to add this humble voice as a vote \nof confidence for this fine man and as one who has worked with him and \nalongside him for a number of years. Mr. President, it gives me great \npleasure to add my words of support and best wishes to this fine \nservant of the people of our country and the U.S. Senate, Howard \nGreene.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, each day the Senate is in session, at \nleast one Member rises to pay tribute to a friend, a constituent, or a \ncolleague who has distinguished himself, or has decided to leave \nGovernment service. Today, Most members of this body are taking to the \nfloor to say ``goodbye'' to a gentleman who has not only been a fixture \nof the U.S. Senate for many years, but has grown to be a friend to most \nof us, Sergeant at Arms Howard Greene.\n  Howard is one of those unique individuals who has spent most of his \nadult life here on Capitol Hill. Beginning his career just outside this \nchamber as a doorkeeper, Howard worked hard and moved up the ladder of \nadministrative jobs in the Senate, taking over the position of \nSecretary to the Majority at the beginning of the 104th Congress, later \nassuming the duties of the Sergeant at Arms. In every job he held, \nHoward distinguished himself as an individual of ability, dedication, \nand character, and he earned the respect of Members from both sides of \nthe aisle for his thoroughness and commitment.\n  As the Republican Party had not held control of the Senate since the \n1980's Howard had a challenging task before him at the beginning of the \n104th Congress. No doubt, his encyclopedic knowledge of the history, \ntraditions, and procedures of this great body aided him greatly as he \nadministered to his tasks as Secretary to the Majority and Sergeant at \nArms. I am certain that all would agree that the transfer of power from \nthe Democrats to Republicans was smooth, and that the functions over \nwhich Howard had responsibility functioned efficiently and effectively \nduring his tenure.\n  Mr. President, as you know, Howard Greene is about to end his service \nto the U.S. Senate. He can be proud of the work he has done as a part \nof this institution during his many years on the Hill, and I know that \neach of us wishes him good health, great success, and much happiness in \nthe years to come.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, I delivered the first of a number \nof speeches on the fiscal follies of the Dole economic plan. I gave a \nbrief history of voodoo economics in the Reagan-Bush years, its \nfailure, and the economic carnage it left in its wake. I hope that I \nwas able to shed a little light on an issue of great concern to all \nAmericans.\n  Today, I ask the American people to look at the Dole economic plan--\nadvanced voodoo economics, if you will. And if it wasn't for all of the \nharm it would cause, the Dole plan would be pretty amusing to this \nSenator who has worked on the budget for a long, long time.\n  I must say that Bob Dole's supply-side plan reminds me of a 17th \ncentury scientist by the name of van Helmont who actually had a formula \nfor making mice out of old underwear. At its heart, that's the Dole \nplan: taking bits and pieces of discarded economics and turning them \ninto something unrealistic.\n  Last week, I had the privilege to join with Democratic colleagues at \nan important forum on the Dole economic plan. Benjamin Friedman, \nprofessor of political economy at Harvard University, warned, ``The \nDole-Kemp proposal is a reprise of a gamble that failed.''\n  Former Budget Director Charles Schultze concluded,\n\n       A reasonable and prudent person would have to question \n     severely the wisdom of repeating what the country did 15 \n     years ago--enacting a large tax cut before budget balance is \n     well in hand.\n\n  The Dole plan is mired in the same specious supply-side arguments and \noptimistic assumptions that made up the economic quicksand of 15 years \nago. The original trickle-down economics delivered mediocre economic \nperformance and a mountain of debt. Is there any reason to believe it \nwill be different this time around? The answer is a resounding, ``No.''\n  Like the original voodoo, the Dole voodoo II relies on bogus \nassumptions to hide its disastrous deficit consequences. It's a \nWhitman's Sampler of candy-coated scenarios. The Dole plan includes a \n$254 billion fiscal dividend for cutting the deficit; a $147 billion \ngrowth dividend for expanding tax breaks; and an $80 billion revenue \ndividend from projecting out a short-term blip in revenues. It hides \nthe cost of back-loaded tax breaks and massive, unspecified spending \ncuts that no one believes will happen. As Mr. Dole ups the ante on his \neconomic plan, he raises questions about its credibility.\n  In spite of the truth nipping at his heels, candidate Dole assumes \nthat he if he says nonsense enough times it will be believable. He's \nwrong. The latest New York Times: CBS poll shows that 64 percent of the \nelectorate does not believe that Mr. Dole will be able to deliver the \npromised tax cuts.\n  True to form, the Dole plan postulates that tax cuts largely pay for \nthemselves through economic dividends. The Dole dividends are doubly \nimplausible because most of the tax cut consists of items that have \nnothing to do with the economy's longrun capacity to grow. Most will do \nlittle or\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\nnothing to stimulate savings, investment, or work effort.\n  The Dole tax cuts' effects on the economy are likely to be worse than \nthe lackluster performance posted during the Reagan-Bush years. The \nfirst supply-side gamble was taken at the trough of the 1981-82 Reagan \nrecession, the deepest since World War II. Not surprisingly, the 1981 \nacross-the-board tax cut did boost the economy by stimulating spending, \nand not savings--boosting demand in the economy, not supply. As a \nconsequence, much of the employment growth during the Reagan years \nresulted merely from people getting back jobs they lost during the \nrecession.\n  Unlike the early 1980's, when the unemployment rate reached 10.8 \npercent, strong job growth over the last few years has brought our \ncurrent jobless rate down to 5.1 percent. A shot of demand stimulus now \nwould risk overheating the economy, push up inflation and interest \nrates, and do little to improve the already tight labor market.\n  Any benefit from a trickle-down tax cut now would have to come from \nimprovements in the economy's long-run capacity to grow. The prior \nexperience with Reaganomics is not reassuring, since growth slowed to \nits previous longrun pace once the economy's slack had been taken up.\n  The Dole plan also assumes that an unexpected jump in revenues this \nyear will persist forever, even though CBO in its latest Economic and \nBudget Update argues that this blip may well be temporary.\n  In fact, it could be worse. I am deeply concerned about the effects \nof the Dole tax cuts beyond the year 2002. There is no cutoff point; \nthey keep growing and growing. The farther out the tax cuts are \nprojected, the less coherence the Dole plan has, and the wider the \ndeficit projections become.\n  Like his supply-side predecessors, who stretched credibility like \ntaffy, candidate Dole promises to balance the budget despite tax cuts \ntotaling $550 billion. This would require spending cuts far more \nextreme than those that the Republicans failed to pass over the past 2 \nyears. And remember too, the number of programs that Dole has put off-\nlimits: Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans, interest on the \ndebt, the New Mexico labs, military retirees, and the list keeps \ngrowing every day. Even George Bush's Budget Director, Richard Darman, \nsaid that the Dole plan was not realistic politically.\n  In most cases, the Dole plan leaves these huge spending reductions \nunspecified. In those instances where they are specific, however, the \nDole campaign's own figures imply that some programs, like the Energy \nDepartment, should be cut by more than 100 percent. At least we can all \nagree that that will be a difficult task indeed.\n  As I have said, the Dole plan will merely build the current mountain \nof debt to new heights. And history does not provide much comfort to \nthose of us concerned about this horrible monument of fiscal \nirresponsibility. If past is prolog, we are in for more debt. Some have \nincorrectly claimed that President Reagan would have balanced the \nbudget in 4 years as promised, save for the fact those Democrats were \nin control of the legislative branch. For three-fourths of the time \nthat President Reagan was in office, he enjoyed the support of a \nRepublican majority in the Senate. The record clearly shows that \nPresident Reagan failed to use the ultimate and readily available \nauthority he had--the veto to cut spending. He clearly had more than \nsufficient votes to sustain a veto. Furthermore, neither Presidents \nReagan nor Bush submitted a balanced budget certified by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  So what's the bottom line on the Dole economic plan? In the September \n2, 1996, New Republic, Matthew Miller writes ``It's a fraud, covered up \nthrough deception and double counting.'' That's pretty harsh but I have \nto agree. Bob Dole shouldn't gamble away the future of our Nation with \na farfetched, losing proposition that in the end will only end up with \nmore spending.\n  I simply say that the authority that the President has to cut \nspending should be used and the veto pen should always be their. It \nseems to me, Mr. President, that we should realize and recognize that \nwe have had four straight reductions in the annual deficit of the \nUnited States.\n  It seems to me that we should not go hellbent for election with an \neconomic plan that this Senator believes is doomed to failure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10660-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10661-S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR DOLE'S ECONOMIC PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple comments in \nresponse to my colleague from Nebraska. He made a very strong statement \nagainst Senator Dole's economic package. Let me make a couple of \nstatements in rebuttal to that.\n  The Senator quoted a poll which said that 64 percent of the American \npeople do not believe there is really going to be a tax cut. A lot of \npeople are very skeptical of politicians, in particular when they make \nstatements as it pertains to taxes and you look back in history a \nlittle bit. George Bush said, ``Read my lips. There will be no new \ntaxes.'' And he passed a tax increase, and I believe it cost him his \nreelection.\n  Bill Clinton, when he was campaigning in 1992, campaigned on a tax \ncut, told people throughout the country there would be a tax cut, \ntalked about a $500 tax credit per child, or at least a tax credit for \nfamilies, but it did not happen. As a matter of fact, in 1993, there \nwas not only not a tax cut but the largest tax increase in history.\n  So a lot of people are very cynical when politicians talk about \ntaxes, maybe because for the last few years they have not seen people \nfollow through with what they stated they were going to do. That quite \npossibly is understandable.\n  Candidate Bill Clinton in his book said there would not be an \nincrease in the gasoline tax, but he actually did. He passed a gasoline \ntax increase, as we all know. He did not tell people there was going to \nbe an increase on Social Security recipients, but there was.\n  So my point is, yes, there may be some people who are cynical, but \nthat does not mean that just because Bill Clinton did not do what he \nsaid he was going to do Bob Dole will not. I have had the pleasure of \nserving with Bob Dole, and he is a man of his word, and he is very \nsincere. He is very sincere about cutting taxes and reducing the growth \nof spending. I will just mention that he doesn't even cut spending. He \nslows the growth of spending under his proposal. The facts are we are \nspending $1.55 trillion right now, and under Senator Dole's proposal we \nare going to end up spending about $1.8 trillion in the year 2001. But \nhe does commit to balancing the budget. That is doable. We have done \nit. President Clinton, unfortunately, vetoed it.\n  Can you cut taxes and reduce the growth of spending and still end up \nwith a balanced budget in a few years? Yes; you can. We have proved \nthat you can.\n  I want to allude to one other thing that was mentioned. It is said, \nwell, Senator Dole's tax cut is paid for by voodoo economics, or it is \ngoing to provide tax cuts to pay for itself. That is not the case. He \ntook a very conservative assumption that the tax cuts proposed in his \nproposal would stimulate growth and that would pay for about 27 \npercent--not even half, 27 percent.\n  So I just make mention of the fact that some people assume this \nreally does stimulate the economy and therefore pay for itself. Some \npeople make that assumption. Senator Dole did not. He said it will \nstimulate the economy; the economy will grow a lot faster. It has grown \na lot faster. The growth of the economy for the last 3 years has really \nbeen pretty anemic--about 2.2 percent compared to the last 10 or 12 \nyears when it has been about 3.3 percent, about 50 percent higher. We \ncan do better. We should do better. I hope we will do better.\n\n  I also heard a statement, well, very little is in Senator Dole's \npackage that would stimulate the economy. I disagree. Allowing people \nto keep more of their own money, when you are talking about the child \ncredit--Senator Dole's package has provision for a $500 tax credit per \nchild. That is very family friendly. That says families, if you have \nfour kids and you are making $60,000, maybe two people working, you are \ngoing to have $2,000 more of your own money to spend at the local \nrestaurants or at schools or for your family. That is going to help \nthose businesses. Those businesses are going to\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\nmake more money. They are going to generate more jobs. It is going to \nhelp the economy and, I believe, actually spend it better than how the \nGovernment would spend it.\n  He also cuts the capital gains rate in half. Some people disagree \nwith that. I believe we have at least a strong majority vote in the \nCongress to do it, because if you reduce the tax on financial \ntransactions, you are going to have more. Some countries do not even \ntax financial transactions.\n  I think there are several things in Senator Dole's proposal that will \nstimulate the economy, that will balance the budget. He is also calling \nfor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. So he is sincere \nabout doing it. I think he will do it. In spite of the fact that maybe \none or two of his predecessors did not do what they said they were \ngoing to do, did not follow through, did not tell the truth to the \nAmerican people, I believe Senator Dole is telling the truth. He is a \nman of his word. We will cut taxes. We will balance the budget. We will \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I think that is \nsignificant, it is positive, and it will help the American economy and \nhelp American families as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not want to cut off anybody, but I am trying to \ncall up a bill that is a major bill.

Mr. President, we have had three experiences in this \ncentury of increasing revenues: One was in the 1920's, one in the \n1960's, and then in the 1980's. All three times it was a result, \neconomists had to agree, of the fact that we reduced taxes and gave \npeople more freedom. As a matter of fact, it was not a Republican but \nit was a Democrat, it was President Kennedy back in the 1960's, who \nobserved that we have to increase revenues and the best way to do that \nis to reduce taxes. Of course, history showed that it did work. It \nworked again in the 1980's when we went from a total expenditure to run \nGovernment in 1980 of $517 billion to $1.03 trillion in 1990, a 10-year \nperiod in which we had the most dramatic decreases in taxes.\n  So I would certainly agree with the man who I believe will be the \nnext President of the United States that the best way to get this \ncountry back on the right track is to reduce regulation, reduce taxes, \nand give people more individual freedoms.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10662-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10662-S10681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 539, S. 1994, the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1994) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1994, the \nFederal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996. Today, I am offering a \nmanager's amendment to the bill as originally considered by the \nCommerce Committee which includes a variety of critically needed \nimprovements to address important safety and security issues affecting \nairports, airlines, and the travelling public.\n  This legislation is a comprehensive effort to deal with virtually all \naspects of our Nation's air transportation system including: funding \nissues, security, the replacement of aging air traffic control \nequipment, and infrastructure development.\n  Mr. President, first and foremost, we must act to reauthorize the \nprograms of the FAA before we leave this year or the FAA will be \nprohibited from issuing grants to airports for needed security and \nsafety projects. In light of recent air transportation tragedies, we \nmust act now to ensure this vital revenue stream remains available.\n  As I have indicated, there are dozens of important provisions in this \nlegislation, but Mr. President, I would like to focus my remarks on \nthree main areas.\n  First, aviation safety. Air transportation in this country is safe \nand remains the safest form of travel, however, we can and we must do \nmore. This legislation facilitates the replacement of outdated air \ntraffic control equipment. Importantly, it also puts in place a \nmechanism to evaluate long-term funding needs at the FAA. Much work has \nbeen done by Senator McCain, Hollings, Ford, Stevens, and others, as \nwell as the administration, and I want to congratulate them and thank \nthem for their efforts in this regard. This effort is critically \nimportant given the projected growth in air travel over the next \nseveral years. Ensuring adequate funding in a time of increasing \npassenger traffic and diminishing Federal resources is a difficult \nissue and this legislation takes important steps forward.\n  A second area I want to highlight is aviation security. This \nlegislation contains numerous provisions designed to improve security \nat our Nation's airlines and airports. Here again, I would like to \nthank a bipartisan group of Senators for their efforts to develop \ncomprehensive recommendations for the bill. Senators Hutchinson and \nLautenberg deserve special thanks for their tireless work in this area \nover the past several months. The measure before us today incorporates \nmany of the suggestions from the House-passed antiterrorism bill, as \nwell as new recommendations from the Gore Commission of which I am a \nmember. Passage of this bill will improve aviation security by: \nspending deployment of the latest explosive detection systems; \nenhancing passenger screening processes; requiring criminal history \nrecord checks on screeners; requiring regular joint threat assessments \nand testing baggage match procedures.\n  The third and final area I wish to highlight Mr. President, is how \nthis legislation will help small community air service and small \nairports, such as those in my State of South Dakota. The legislation \nbefore us today reauthorizes the Essential Air Service Program at the \nlevel of $50 million. This program is vital to States such as South \nDakota and others. The bill also directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to conduct a comprehensive study on rural air service \nand fares. For too long, small communities have been forced to endure \nhigher fares as a result of inadequate competition and the Department \nof Transportation will now look into this issue as a result of this \nbill. This follows on the important work that I instructed the General \nAccounting Office to initiate last year. And finally, in this \nlegislation, we have taken steps to protect smaller airports in the \nevent of funding downturns in the appropriations process.\n  The legislation guarantees that if airport funding were to be \nsignificantly reduced, smaller airports would not be disadvantaged \ndisappropriately. As my colleagues know, larger facilities have a \nnumber of funding options available to them, including access to the \nbond communities, PFC, rates, and charges and the like. Smaller \nairports do not have the same options. I am pleased that we have \ndeveloped a safeguard for smaller airports without significant \nmodifications to the existing allocation formulas, while protecting \nexisting letters of intent for multiyear funding projects at larger \nairports.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this legislation represents the \nculmination of over a year's work by the Commerce Committee and other \ninterested Senators. It addresses our most pressing aviation needs--\nsafety, security, and funding.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of S. 1994. We cannot \nadjourn for the year without taking final action on this important \nlegislation. If we fail to act, the FAA's hands will be tied and they \nwill be unable to address needed security and safety issues in every \nState in the Nation.\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\n  I should pay special tribute to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Aviation Subcommittee, Senators McCain and Ford, who have done so \nmuch fine work on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a longer statement I will give in a \nminute, but I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Pressler, who made possible this legislation through \nhis leadership, through the efforts of his staff, whose names will be \nmentioned later.\n  I say to Senator Pressler, I do not believe this legislation would be \nbefore us today without your leadership. We look forward to your active \nparticipation and assistance as we move this legislation through to its \ncompletion, hopefully by tomorrow. I extend my deepest appreciation to \nSenator Pressler.\n  Although we have not completed this legislation yet, and I will save \nmy remarks about my friend from Kentucky, with whom, for 10 years now, \nI have had the opportunity of working, the Senator from Kentucky has \nproven again that the only way you achieve legislative successes are \nthrough bipartisan efforts, not only working together on both sides of \nthe aisle but with the administration. There are many people, including \nthe Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Pena, and the FAA Administrator, \nand especially the Deputy Administrator, Linda Daschle, and their hard \nworking staff.\n  I ask my friend from Kentucky if he would like to proceed with our \nopening statements, or would he like to go directly to the amendments \nthat are pending?\n  Mr. FORD. I would say to my friend that I will have a very short \nopening statement. I think we can encourage our colleagues, if they \nhave any amendments that have not been taken care of in the managers' \namendment. I think many of those have already been taken care of. They \nwill be in the managers' amendment. So, for all practical purposes, I \nwould be more than pleased to see if any of my colleagues have any \namendments they would like to put on, because, at some point tonight, I \nthink the chairman of the subcommittee will want to get a finite list \nof any amendments that are not taken care of in the managers' \namendment, or are agreed to or voted on tonight.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the Senator from Kentucky, I believe it is \nthe wishes of the majority leader and the Democratic leader to get a \nfinite list, unanimous-consent agreement on that, and have whatever \nvotes are necessary sometime tomorrow morning. So I, like the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, urge my colleagues who have additional amendments to \nthose that we already have to come over to propose those, propound \nthose amendments, and let us act on them.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, S. 1994 authorizes the programs of the FAA \nfor 1 year. The bill must pass because it is an authorization bill. The \nFAA cannot issue any airport grants unless this bill is passed. Under \nS. 1994, the FAA would spend approximately $35 million more on small \nairports for fiscal year 1997 than was spent in fiscal year 1996. I \nbelieve the chairman of the committee, Senator Pressler, noted that was \none of the things he felt was so important in S. 1994.\n  The House has passed its FAA reauthorization bill. That is H.R. 3539. \nThey did that last week. So it is incumbent upon us to get our bill out \nso we can go to conference and have the bill back to be presented to \nboth the House and the Senate as soon as possible.\n  S. 1994 also contains a title that addresses FAA reform, the long-\nterm issues relating to how much money FAA needs, and how to raise the \nfunds. A task force will review these issues and work with the \nSecretary of Transportation on developing legislation that will be \nsubmitted to Congress for review. We have no expedited procedures here, \nso what we are saying is that this task force will get it together with \nthe advice and counsel of the Secretary of Transportation, and that \npackage is to be submitted to Congress for our review or support or \nwhatever it might be. So I think it is real important--very important \nthat we get this out.\n  The structure of the FAA would change slightly--and I underscore \n``slightly''--making it more independent of oversight by the Secretary \nof Transportation in the safety regulatory arena.\n  Finally, the bill includes a title concerning aviation security and \ncovers many of the issues that Senator Pressler said, as a member of \nthe Gore Commission, that they recommended. These items are generally \nconsistent with the Gore Commission's recommendation.\n  The bill also authorizes the collection of up to $100 million in \noverflight fees, fees charged to foreign air carriers flying through \nour air traffic control system. Some of this money could help pay for \nthe essential air service programs that are so important to less \npopulated areas.\n  Mr. President, I might say, one of the reasons this is put in here is \nthat other countries charge us overflight fees. We have never done \nthat. So I do not think there could be any retribution of any kind if \nwe add those fees, because we will be doing the same thing they are \ndoing. They are using our system, they are flying over this country in \na safe manner, and therefore we charge them a fee for our services.\n  So I hope my colleagues are listening. I hope if my colleagues have \nany amendments that they want us to consider as they relate to S. 1994, \nthat they come forward and we be able to put those on the list. Those \nSenators who might be concerned if their amendment has been included in \nthe managers' amendments or not, we will be more than pleased to visit \nwith them right away so we can assure our colleagues that their \namendment has been taken care of.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to moving this legislation forward. \nI look forward to cooperating with my friend from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, and that we will pass a piece of legislation that will be \nacceptable and that we will be proud of in the final results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this collaborative work has resulted in \nlegislation that will benefit everyone who uses this country's air \ntransportation system, including air travelers, airports of all sizes, \npilots and other airline and airport employees, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, major, regional, and short-haul air carriers, general \naviation pilots and manufacturers, and all others in the aviation \nindustry. This bill will do the following:\n  Ensure that the FAA and our Nation's airports will be adequately \nfunded by reauthorizing key FAA programs, including AIP, for fiscal \nyear 1997;\n  Ensure that the FAA has the resources it needs to improve airport and \nairline security in the near term;\n  Direct the National Transportation Safety Board to establish a \nprogram to provide for adequate notification of and advocacy services \nfor the families of victims of aircraft accidents;\n  Enhance airline and air travelers' safety by requiring airlines to \nshare employment and performance records before hiring new pilots;\n  Strengthen existing laws prohibiting airport revenue diversion, and \nprovide DOT and the FAA with the tools they need to enforce Federal \nlaws prohibiting revenue diversion;\n  Make needed changes relating to MWAA, which is Metropolitan \nWashington Airport Authority; and, most important, provide for thorough \nreform, including long-term funding reform, of the FAA.\n  Each of the elements of S. 1994 is essential to fulfilling Congress' \nresponsibility to improving our country's air transportation system. \nClearly, Congress, the White House, DOT, the FAA, and others throughout \nthe aviation industry have been under close scrutiny regarding the \nstate of the U.S. air transportation system. The traveling public has \ntold us they are worried about the safety and security of U.S. airports \nand airlines, and the ability of the Government to alleviate these \nconcerns. Recent tragic events suggest that this apprehension is \njustified, and we have been strongly encouraged to correct the problems \nin one air transportation system. I believe that the legislation we are \nconsidering today will go a long way toward making the system safer and \nbetter in every way.\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\n  I would like to discuss briefly the importance of addressing and \nresolving the FAA's funding problems. I have long been a strong \nsupporter of comprehensive FAA reform, which includes helping to create \na more autonomous and accountable FAA, giving the FAA flexibility in \npersonnel, procurement, and regulatory matters, and ensuring that the \nFAA has a long-term, user fee based funding system that considers the \nFAA's costs of providing services, increases the efficiency with which \nthe FAA provides its services, and enhances the safety of the U.S. air \ntransportation system.\n  Although S. 1994 includes an FAA reform package that I fully support \nand that encompasses several elements that the FAA needs to resolve its \nproblems, the legislation does not mandate a user fee based on long-\nterm funding system for the FAA. I still believe that a user fee system \nwould be the most equitable and efficient funding system for the FAA. \nYet, after working and consulting with many others in Congress, the \nadministration, and the aviation industry, this legislation instead \nsets up a task force, which will study and recommend to Congress the \nbest funding system for the agency. I am pleased that we are taking \nthis critical step today toward achieving long-needed, comprehensive \nFAA reform.\n  I would also like to address the safety and security provisions in \nthis bill. We all know that the traveling public is worried about their \nsafety when they fly. Provisions in this legislation were developed to \nrespond quickly and precisely to concerns we have heard in first-hand \nconversations with those who use our Nation's airports and airlines.\n  In specific, to assure air travelers and other users of our air \ntransportation system that safety is paramount, this bill requires the \nFAA to study and report to Congress on whether certain air carrier \nsecurity responsibilities should be transferred to or shared with \nairports or the Federal Government; requires the NTSB to develop a \nprogram to provide family advocacy services following commercial \naircraft accidents; requires NTSB and the FAA to work together to \ndevelop a system to classify aircraft accident and safety data \nmaintained by the NTSB, and report to Congress on the effects of \npublishing such data; ensures that the FAA gives high priority to \nimplement a fully enhanced safety performance analysis system, \nincluding automated surveillance; requires the FAA to conduct a study \non weapons and explosive detection technology. And by the way, Mr. \nPresident, I believe that technology is out there and, with the proper \nfunding in research and development, we can develop it, I have no doubt \nabout that. Improves standards for airport security passenger, baggage, \nand property screeners, including requiring criminal history records \nchecks; requires the FAA to facilitate quick deployment of commercially \navailable explosive detection equipment; contains a sense of the Senate \non the development of effective passenger profiling programs; \nauthorizes airports to use project grant money and PFC's for airport \nsecurity programs; establishes aviation security liaisons at key \nFederal agencies; requires the FAA and FBI to carry out joint threat \nand vulnerability assessments every 3 years; directs the FAA to set up \na pilot program to determine whether baggage match requirements would \nenhance safety and security; requires all air carriers and airports to \nconduct periodic vulnerability assessments of security systems; and \nfacilitates the transfer of pilot employment records between employing \nairlines so that passenger safety is not compromised.\n\n  This legislation addresses two other critical aviation issues. First, \nit contains provisions intended to reverse the disturbing trend of \nillegal diversion of airport revenues. To ensure that airport revenues \nare used only for airport purposes, this legislation would expand the \nprohibition on revenue diversion to cover more instances of diversion. \nIt also would establish clear penalties and stronger mechanisms to \nenforce Federal laws prohibiting revenue diversion. In addition, the \nbill would impose additional reporting requirements so that illegal \nrevenue diversion is easily identified and verified.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation makes certain changes to the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority required following recent \nFederal court rulings. In specific, the bill abolishes the MWAA Board \nof Review, and increases the number of Presidentially-appointed members \nof the MWAA Board of Directors. It also conveys the sense of the Senate \nthat the MWAA should not provide free, reserved parking areas at either \nWashington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport \nfor Members of Congress and other Government officials, or diplomats.\n  Mr. President, the recent horrible aircraft accidents, and continuing \nreports of power outages and equipment failures in our air traffic \ncontrol centers, have raised questions about the safety of our Nation's \nair transportation system and the effectiveness of the Federal \nGovernment in safeguarding the traveling public. We must do our part to \nreassure the traveling public that we have the world's safest air \ntransportation system. This comprehensive legislation will go a long \nway in reassuring the public that the system is safe, and ensure the \nFAA will have a stable, predictable, and sufficient funding stream for \nthe long term.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at an appropriate time during the \nproceedings of this legislation, I will offer an amendment.\n  We live in a world that is increasingly unstable and more dangerous \neach day. Unfortunately, the origins of most of this danger are the \nnations around the world that export its violence and its terrorism.\n  This world is full of various cultures. Many diametrically differ \nfrom each other, but no clash of ideals and societies justifies state-\nsponsored terrorism and aggression.\n  The resolution unequivocally notifies the world that the United \nStates will not tolerate state criminal activity against American \ncitizens and their property. The amendment that I will offer will \noutline this in some detail.\n  Mr. President, those of us who serve in this body fly all the time, \nso perhaps because of that we recognize every time there is a TWA \nflight 800 or Pan-American, we cannot only see ourselves, but our \nfamilies, in these aircraft that are so treacherously destroyed.\n  The resolution that I will offer warns the world that the United \nStates will not accept in the slightest degree any assault on its \ncitizens by another nation. The resolution that I will offer will \nconvey a sense of the U.S. Senate that any state-sponsored condoned \nhostilities toward Americans will in fact be an act of war and that we \nshould strongly consider that an act of war.\n  Mr. President, this principle applies to any act of hostility, \nincluding but not limited to airplanes that are hijacked or destroyed \nin the skies, to the hostage taking of American citizens living \noverseas and to the destruction of buildings in which Americans reside, \neither on American soil or otherwise.\n  The United States does not go to war against common criminals, but if \na nation is going to plan and organize the aggression, assist in the \nexecution of terrorism or condone the hostility by hiding the \nterrorists, then there will be a consideration of a state of war \nbetween America and that nation.\n  Mr. President, it is a responsible response to an aggressive act by a \nforeign state. The existence of these acts is itself, I believe, a \ndeclaration that they have no concern for human safety, of life, and \nthat we should strongly consider this to be an act of war.\n  I hope that it will be a deterrent to continued terrorist activity, \nbringing down on a hostile government many numerous negative \nconsequences, such as economic warfare, that is, affecting the ability \nof the country to obtain loans. No government in the world today can \nafford to have their credit cut off or their borrowing power removed.\n  Second, causing neutral nations to quit trading or doing business in \na terrorist country is something we should consider would exist. If \nthere is risk to\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\ntrading with a country who exports violence and upon whom there has \nbeen or is considered a declaration of war, then neutral nations will \ncease trading with these venues of violence.\n  Increasing insurance rates for the terrorist-sponsored government. \nAny nation that sponsors terrorism itself is at risk of violent \nretaliation, and consequently will see their insurance rates, which \ncountries depend on in this modern world, as a detriment to their doing \nthese acts of violence.\n  What is a state of war? Among other things, the first response that \ncomes to mind, of course, is a military response, such as the one that \nPresident Reagan initiated against Libya. The military power of the \nUnited States is well known and respected throughout the world, and is \na principal option we would have.\n  Additionally, of course, naval blockades are an option, though less \ndramatic and violent than a full military response. Mr. President, \nnaval blockades have been used in recent times, particularly in Cuba, \nand in other nations whose reliance on ports and waterways are \nfundamental to their economy and their way of life.\n\n  A third form of response could be an economic response, in effect, \neconomic warfare that engages a variety of sanctions against that \nnation's economy. This could range from a total embargo, to dramatic \ntariffs, to a removal of the most favored nation status. This response \ncould vary with the resistance of the nation concerned.\n  I discuss these options of retaliation to clarify that this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution is not necessarily saying, as we did during the \nVietnam conflict, that we will, in effect, try to bomb them back to the \nStone Age--nothing to that effect. Rather, we will take the \nresponsible, firm actions necessary in a state of war to respond to \nstate-sponsored terrorism.\n  To declare a state of war under such circumstances is well within the \nnorm of international war and even historical precedent. The War of \n1812 started because American sailors were being taken and impressed \ninto the British Navy. The British Government declared war against the \nBarbary pirates who terrorized the American coastline. Of course, there \nwas the threat of war by Theodore Roosevelt against the Moroccan \nGovernment over the kidnapping of an American family.\n  But even if it were not preceded in history, by the examples I have \ngiven, we must recognize the changing world in which terrorists are \ngovernment supported, and that fanatical leaders of nations are willing \nto terrorize the lives of innocent people.\n  So, Mr. President, this resolution that I will offer at some \nsubsequent time in these proceedings would send a clear, unequivocal \nmessage, both abroad and to our own communities and States, by saying \nthat the American Government will protect its citizens when other \nnations sanction the assault, killing, and terrorizing of our citizens, \nthat we will retaliate.\n  At the appropriate time, Mr. President, I will urge my colleagues to \nsupport this sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would articulate \nclearly the gravity with which we consider the terrorism that has been \nexported and is being exported by foreign nations.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Allegheny County Airport Privatization\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I met recently with County Commissioners \nLarry Dunn and Bob Cranmer, who are very interested in the economic \ndevelopment that could be generated from privatizing Allegheny County \nAirport, a general aviation airport which has not had commercial \npassenger service since 1956. During my visit to the airport on \nSeptember 9, 1996, I again heard of the strong local interest in \nprivatization, which the county has estimated could generate as much as \n$20 million in business growth in the Monongahela River Valley, an area \nhurt in recent years by severe unemployment.\n  I am advised that Federal law and regulations are the principal \nobstacles to privatization of airports. The House FAA reauthorization \nbill contains a provision allowing for the sale or long-term lease, \nwith the approval of the FAA, of up to six airports, of which one must \nbe a general aviation airport or similar airport not in commercial \nservice, such as Allegheny County Airport. The Senate bill we are \nconsidering today does not contain language authorizing such a pilot \nprogram, but does provide for a report to the Secretary by an \nindependent task force that will consider innovative financing \nmechanisms.\n  Upon this state of the record, and as a member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I believe that for Allegheny County \nAirport to realize its fullest potential, private investment is \ncrucial. I would ask my distinguished colleagues, the chairmen of the \nAviation Subcommittee and the full Commerce Committee, whether the \nAllegheny County Airport is the type of airport in which privatization \nshould be facilitated by Congress?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As my good friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nknows, I have been reluctant to support legislation in this bill \ndirecting the agency to establish a pilot program on airport \nprivatization, particularly because of the revenue diversion issue. \nHowever, if there is a legislative effort to facilitate privatization, \neither as a result of an independent task force recommendation, as \nprovided for in section 674, or as a result of subsequent conference \nnegotiations on general aviation privatization with the House of \nRepresentatives, I could support privatization as long as no such \nlegislation permits the egregious activity of revenue diversion and as \nlong as it continues to meet the airport users' needs. Allegheny County \nAirport appears to meet the criteria of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration for inclusion in a privatization test program.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In response to the concerns raised by the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, I would note that I made my point in our \nrecent correspondence that it is important to be openminded and \ninnovative in thinking about airport funding at a time of declining \nFederal resources. Undoubtedly, the privatization issue will be taken \nup by the conference and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto address the needs of general aviation airports, such as Allegheny \nCounty Airport. If the conferees determine that a privatization pilot \nprogram is appropriate for general aviation airports, I am sure that we \nwill accord Allegheny County Airport all due consideration for \ninclusion in any such program and would hope that the agency would do \nlikewise.\n  Mr. FORD. I want to add my voice to this discussion. I know that the \nHouse has included a privatization provision, which I cannot accept. I \nwant to let my colleagues know of my grave concerns about this matter. \nI know others share my concerns. If Senator Specter's concern is over \none general aviation report, I suspect we all can appropriately address \nthat matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, for his agreement to a colloquy, and we \nwill make sure that every consideration is given to his commitment to \nthe Allegheny County Airport.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment later this \nevening that is designed to give transparency to some of the bidding \nprocess with regard to large construction contracts.\n  I was surprised, in reviewing the records of the Denver Airport, to \nfind that it was difficult to ascertain why people had not been awarded \nthe contract even though they were the lowest qualified bidder. I had \njust assumed that, when you put a project out to bid and you had \nnarrowed the field of people who bid on that contract, you were obliged \nto take the lowest bid. Certainly, that would be in the best interest \nof the taxpayers if you could get\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\nthe work done by someone who you yourself said was qualified. It came \nas a surprise to me that, at times, the lowest bidder did not get the \nwork, even though deemed qualified.\n  What was of more concern was the fact that it was very difficult to \nidentify when this had happened and how much it had cost the taxpayers. \nLiterally, in working with the GAO audit at the Denver Airport, we were \nadvised that it was going to be next to impossible for them to identify \nwhich contracts had not taken the lowest bid and how much was lost to \nthe taxpayers or how much cost was increased because of that.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware of the problems of overregulating this \narea. I want to commend the committee for their efforts in the past to \ntry to loosen up this area, to give more flexibility to the levels of \ngovernment that work in this area. My understanding is that the \nadvancements in that area have been made and that a general guideline \nindicating an effective contracting procedure should be set forth but \nthat the Transportation Department has the ability to move away from \nthe very restrictive legislation in this area which has existed in the \npast and still, for example, exists with the Pentagon.\n\n  So it is not my purpose to reregulate this area. But it is my \npurpose--and I think it would serve an advantage--if, when the lowest \nqualified bidder is not selected, that at least the information is \navailable as to why the lowest qualified bidder wasn't selected and how \nmuch difference there was in the bids on the contract. I believe that, \nif there is something wrong--and I don't mean to suggest there is \nalways something wrong if you don't take the lowest bidder. I suspect \nthat there are circumstances where that is explainable and \nunderstandable. But I believe if you have to at least present the \ninformation and make it public and available, the free press in our \nfree system will do a great deal to police the situation. Transparency, \nexposure of the facts, will help guarantee that the taxpayers get the \nbest contract for their dollar and get the best performance.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be a mistake to continue a practice \nwhich allows people to literally hide from the public the fact that \nthey haven't taken the best bid from qualified bidders in these \ncircumstances. Mindful of the costs of imposing this burden, we have \nsuggested a $1 million threshold, and maybe it should be even higher. \nThe Defense Department has a $25,000 threshold for their requirement \nfor the competitive bidding. So I don't suggest doing anything like \nwhat the Defense Department has done, but I think at least with the \ndisclosure of the $1 million threshold--we will eliminate the small \ncontracts--we will make it available. Literally, when you don't take \nthe best bid, you at least ought to make an explanation and the facts \navailable to the public.\n  Mr. FORD. If the Senator will yield for a question, without his \nlosing the right to the floor. The Senator is asking for kind of a \npublic notice of taking a bid when it is not the lowest bid, but we \nalways put the lowest and best. So if you want us to say that we don't \nthink the contractor is qualified and so, therefore, we put out openly \nthat the reason we turned down the lowest bid is we didn't think the \ncontractor was qualified, then you would open the airport board up--or \nwhoever it is--to a lawsuit saying that this contractor is not \nqualified and, therefore, we are throwing out his bid. That gets to be \na little bit tough, I imagine, when there is a bid of any significance.\n  I am trying to prevent lawsuits on my airport board.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the interest of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I know he is very knowledgeable in this area. You will \nbe relieved to know that is not the way the amendment is drafted. My \nsense was that, in a circumstance where the airport authority, or \nothers, have deemed the bidders qualified, among the bidders that they \ndeemed qualified, if they don't take the best bid, they would be then \nobliged to give some indication of the reason they had not taken the \nbest bid, but it would only be among those who were qualified. They \nwould be the determinants of those qualified.\n  Mr. FORD. Sometimes, I say to my friend from Colorado, when you have \nto publicize the bid, it is in the local paper, and you can go by and \npick up blueprints for $25 or $100, or whatever it is, and you take it \nand work up your estimate. When the bid date comes, you make your bid. \nWhen do they determine that contractor is qualified or not qualified?\n  Mr. BROWN. Obviously, the procedure followed will depend on the \nentity and, of course, we are dealing with a nationwide effort. The \nDepartment of Transportation, for the contracts that they let \nthemselves, follows a different procedure than, perhaps, local airport \nboards would.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will my colleague yield and allow me to make a statement \non behalf of the leader?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent, with the Senator \nfrom Colorado not losing his right to the floor, to make a statement on \nbehalf of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked me to \nannounce that we are seeking a finite list of amendments, with the \nintention of propounding a unanimous-consent agreement at the \nappropriate time, and that it be a limited number of amendments, to be \ntentatively voted on--those that require votes--at 11 o'clock tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The majority leader asked me to announce that there will be no \nfurther votes this evening. I urge my colleagues to come over with \ntheir amendments so we can compile a complete list of amendments, which \nwe hope to follow with a unanimous-consent agreement limiting the bill \nto those amendments in further consideration of the bill.\n  I yield the floor back to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I haven't seen the \namendment, so it is hypothetical. You made a statement that left an \ninference here on what we were supposed to do, and so I will wait and \nget a copy of your amendment. I think your intent is good, but I am not \nsure that the end result will get what you are looking for. I would \nlike to see the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say that I appreciate my friend's interest and, \nparticularly, his expertise in this area. We will get him a copy of the \namendment and would, obviously, appreciate any suggestions the Senator \nhas. It is not my purpose to restrict, in any way, airport authority, \nor anybody, from making determinations as to who is qualified to bid, \nnor would it be to require an investigation. It is my intention that \nwhen you come down to several parties being deemed qualified and the \ncontract not going to the one who is qualified and the lowest, then I \nthink the public is entitled to at least an explanation.\n  That is the intention of the amendment we will be offering. I will \nfile it at the desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am disturbed by this amendment. This \namendment is the total Department of Transportation. It has nothing to \ndo directly with aviation. This is an aviation bill. This indicates to \nme that, if you do not like the winner, this gives you the ability to \nget rid of him. It is page after page of what a contractor has to do, \nwhat the Secretary of Transportation has to do, and all of these \nthings. This is the total Department of Transportation. We are here \ntoday to talk about airports. I thought it was referring to airports, \nand about airport authority. This says the Secretary of Transportation \nor the Administrator to award a contract in an amount greater or equal \nto $1 million.\n  So the Senator from Colorado is going to have to do a lot of work on \nthis one before this Senator agrees to it, and he will have to present \nit and have a vote in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say it is my understanding that the amendment does not give \nanyone a chance to open up bids. All it does is merely ask for \ndisclosure. It suggests that there ought to be a bidding process. I \nwant to assure my\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\nfriend from Kentucky that I will be happy to work with him on his \nconcerns. We will try to see if we can't develop what he wants.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, one of the mistakes that has been made here \ntonight is, I guess, saying no more votes. When it is said ``no more \nvotes,'' they scatter like a covey of quail. So we will be looking for \namendments as best we can.\n  We have a managers' package that will take care of many of the \nSenators who have offered amendments. We are, I think, fairly close--\ndown to maybe six or eight amendments that will be the finite list. But \nwe never know.\n  The thing I want my colleagues to understand is that the majority \nleader has told the Senator from Arizona that he wants to get a \nunanimous-consent agreement tonight on a finite list of amendments and \nstart voting on it at 11 o'clock tomorrow. All I can do is try to \nprotect my colleagues as best as I can to a point.\n  So I hope at least those on my side, if you have an amendment, will \nplease come and let me have it so that it can be on the list. If not, I \nthink you may get left out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to echo the sentiments of my \nfriend from Kentucky. I hope that the relevant amendments will be \nbrought over. We are in the process of compiling that list. It is my \nunderstanding that the intention of the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader is to complete this bill tonight with the relevant \nvotes held over until tomorrow at 11.\n  So I again urge my colleagues to come over.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased that this bill has made its way to the \nfloor. Included in this important legislation is a provision I helped \nto craft which mandates an extensive review of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's financing needs. A private industry commission is \nestablished under this bill that will make recommendations on whether \nthe FAA's financing system needs to be modified.\n  I know that we all agree that the aviation industry and the traveling \npublic need to have a fully funded, efficient, Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  What we disagree on, and what the industry disagrees on, is how to \nreach that goal.\n  There is a bill on the calendar which mandates the implementation of \nuser fees to fund the Agency. That bill has drawn so much opposition \nthat it is stalled.\n  The so-called big seven air carriers have visited many of our offices \nwith a different user fee proposal--that concept also has not been \nadopted.\n  An alliance has been formed of air carriers, general aviation, \nmanufacturers, and others to block all user fee proposals.\n  Rather than settling on a funding mechanism, the industry is battling \namongst itself. Some players are urging a long-term reinstitution of \nthe ticket tax. Others say they will fight to the death if the tax is \nextended beyond the end of this year.\n  And meanwhile, uncertainty mounts about how the FAA will meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Last year, when S. 1239 came before the Commerce Committee, I offered \nsubstitute legislation to remove the mandated user fee system \ncontemplated by that legislation.\n  My concept was that Congress needed more facts to cut through the \nissues raised by both sides--and frankly, I was concerned that S. 1239 \npreordained user fees as the only way to meet the FAA's needs.\n  My belief then, and now, is that an independent authority must review \nthe FAA's budgetary projections and determine whether they are sound. \nAll of us must agree on the needs, before we mandate the solutions.\n  The compromise before us today does that. An independent assessment \nof the FAA's financial requirements is conducted, and then an \nindependent panel takes the financial information and proposes to us, \nand the administration, specific recommendations on how to fund the \nagency, and how to get the most efficient system for the dollars spent.\n  I will be blunt. I believe the flat-tax concept of the excise taxes \nhas worked. It is not perfect, but I fear there is no perfect funding \nmechanism in this area.\n  But we will let the independent task force work its will--and we will \nact on the proposals it promulgates.\n  I want to thank Senators McCain, Ford, Hollings, and Pressler for \ntheir hard work and leadership on this bill. We all care about the FAA \nand want to see it work efficiently and effectively. Many good people \nwork at the FAA, and the agency is absolutely essential in my State \nwhere more than three-quarters of our communities are accessible only \nby air.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nthe work that he has done on the aviation security issue and the \naviation funding issue. He has worked on that for a long time. It is \nsomething that we share as an issue.\n  Having been a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, I \nhave looked at aviation safety for a long time. I think that the United \nStates and the FAA have done a very good job with the job at hand. The \nissue used to be hijacking. That is what we were worried about. That is \nwhen passenger screening came into being--when we worried about the \npossibility of someone with a firearm coming in and taking the plane \naway to hijack it and the passengers.\n  But now we have a different threat. Now we must meet a different \ntest. And that threat, of course, is terrorism. We must do everything \nwe can to protect the traveling public against the people in this \ncountry that would kill and maim innocent people in the name of a \ncause; people who would go in and blow up a building, or blow up an \nairplane, or any other kind of heinous crime not even knowing the \nvictims, not even knowing their families. And, yet, because they \nbelieve in some cause that they want to get publicity for they would do \nthese terrible acts.\n  It is hard to deal with something like that, but we must try. And we \ncan do a lot just by having in place strong security measures that \nwould protect the traveling public and let would-be terrorists know we \nare going to meet them at every point that they would try.\n  I think Senator McCain's bill is a good one because it does put in \nplace studies where we are not sure what the ramifications would be, \nand regulations to be made by the FAA where we know that we can do \ncertain things that will make it better.\n  I think baggage checks, which is something that is done on \ninternational flights, is something that we ought to look at on \ndomestic flights. It is not easy. I know that the airlines are very \nconcerned about not only passenger security but, of course, the ease of \ntravel and the ability to keep time. It is an issue for them. I \nunderstand that. But I think we have to try. I think we have to see how \nwe can make it work.\n  Technology is changing every day. It is getting better. I went to the \nairport yesterday morning, and they put my ticket through a screening \ndevice and brought out the boarding pass. Clearly, they are now being \nable to check whether a ticket is valid. That is good. I was pleased to \nhave that little, tiny delay because I knew that it made me safer in \nthe air.\n  So I think with the technology we have, that probably we can work out \nsomething with baggage checks that would not be onerous for the \nairlines. Certainly, background checks for baggage handlers and \npassenger screeners is going to be something we would like to have \nlooked at.\n  We want to make sure that we are able to screen people who are going \nto have access to the tarmac. I think these are prudent measures and \nsomething that we need to know all the ramifications of. We need to \nknow what the costs are. We need cost-benefit analyses. That is common \nsense. But I think, in the end, this can be done with a cost-benefit \nanalysis that does make sense.\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\n  I am very pleased we are going to look at passenger facility charges \nand Airport Improvement Programs for the funding of these security \nmeasures. The Senator from Arizona is making it possible in this bill, \nin the managers' amendment, to have access to those funding mechanisms \nfor more of the security screening systems that are a higher and better \ntechnology than those being used at most airports today.\n  We have a number of things that will improve our airport security in \nthis bill. I do think it is important that we take every step we can, \nthat we work with the FAA, that we bring the FBI in to an even greater \nextent. They are working now with the FAA, but I think they could do \neven more. I think it very important that we bring all of this together \nwith the mandates and the studies to make sure we do everything \npossible to make the traveling public safe and to let them know we are \ntaking these steps to make them safe and also to let the potential \nterrorists know we are taking these steps to counter the threats that \nthey might make on our traveling public.\n  So I am very pleased to have worked with Senator McCain on this bill, \nto bring what I learned in my days at the National Transportation \nSafety Board to bear on this, although I must say, when I was on the \nNational Transportation Safety Board terrorism was not the threat. That \nwas in the old days when we were worried about other safety issues, and \nI think now we do have the safest aviation system in the world, and we \nare just going to take the next step to make it safer.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky for \ntheir work on this bill. We must pass it, and we will.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank the \nSenator from Texas. She brings a degree of experience and expertise to \nthe Commerce Committee on aviation issues that no other Member of the \nSenate has, due to her long involvement with aviation safety as a \nmember of the National Transportation Safety Board. She worked on a \nspecial task force on antiterrorism after the TWA 800 tragedy. She has \nadvised the Senator from Kentucky and me, but, more importantly, she \nhas been responsible for specific recommendations that are part of this \nbill which I think will help us achieve the goal which we all seek, and \nthat is a reduction in the threat to the safety of those American \ncitizens and others who make use of airlines not only in the United \nStates but throughout the world.\n  So I extend my deep appreciation to the Senator from Texas. The bill \nwould not be, I believe, as encompassing as it otherwise is without her \nassistance, and I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to speak \nabout a couple of provisions in this legislation which includes a \nnumber of very important provisions that are very important to all \nparts of America, but especially to rural America. I wanted to make \nnote of a couple of them.\n  Before I do, I wish to talk generally about what persuaded me to \nadvance an amendment in this legislation dealing with essential air \nservice. This bill contains an amendment I offered in the Commerce \nCommittee dealing with the essential air service program.\n  I want to go back, as boring as it might be for some, to revisit the \ndecision on deregulating the airlines. We have people here in Congress \nwho still think deregulation was a wonderful thing to do. If they could \nget pompoms, they would do jumping jacks and wave pompoms, saying \nairline deregulation was a wonderful thing for our country. Well, it \nwas for some Americans.\n\n  If you live in Chicago, I guarantee you grin from ear to ear about \nderegulation because if you happen to be traveling to Los Angeles, you \ncan go to O'Hare Airport, find many carriers flying to Los Angeles, \ncompeting aggressively against each other, providing competitively \nlower prices. You will find a heck of a bargain if you want to travel \nfrom Chicago to Los Angeles. If you want to travel from Chicago to New \nYork, the same deal--a lot of carriers competing aggressively, \ncompeting by lowering prices. You get a heck of a deal.\n  What about people who do not live in the largest cities? What about \nsomeone who lives, for example, in a State like North Dakota? Before \nderegulation, there several major airlines that flew jets in North \nDakota: Western Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Republic, formerly North \nCentral Airlines, Delta Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental \nAirlines. Do you know who flies jets in North Dakota today? Northwest \nAirlines--a good carrier. One jet service carrier servicing our State. \nIt is a good carrier, good company, but our people deserve some \ncompetition.\n  The result of all of this is that in rural parts of the country when \nyou have less service, fewer companies and less competition? Higher \nprices and less service.\n  I'll give you an example which I have used before in the Commerce \nCommittee. Let us assume that a Senator from Colorado desired to fly \nfrom Washington, DC, to go to Disneyland and see Mickey Mouse and all \nof the merriment at Disneyland, traveling all the way across the \ncountry. And the Senator from Colorado called a travel agent and said, \n``I want to go see Disneyland in California. What is it going to cost \nme?'' And they would give him a price for a ticket, maybe a 2-week \nadvance, to fly all the way across the country. And then I convinced \nhim you ought not go to Disneyland; you ought to go see the world's \nbiggest cow on a hill overlooking New Salem, ND--Salem Sue, a giant \nplastic dairy cow that sits on a hill. So he decides he will fly from \nWashington, DC, to Bismarck; he would be going to see Salem Sue instead \nof Mickey Mouse. So he calls the same travel agent and says, ``Well, \nyou charge $300 for me to fly from Washington, DC, to Disneyland. How \nmuch will it cost me to go half as far to see the world's largest cow \non a hill outside New Salem, ND?''\n  Answer, twice as much.\n  Fly half as far, pay twice as much. Or, said another way, fly twice \nas far, pay half as much.\n  What kind of a pricing system is that? Would that be a bureaucratic \npricing system? Would that be a function of some bureaucrat in \nGovernment who decided let me see if I can mess up our pricing system \nso we can charge people higher prices to fly fewer miles? No, that is \nnot what this is about. It is about airline deregulation and the lack \nof competition, which means that rural areas, people who live in \nsmaller States with less population, end up paying higher prices for \nfewer choices. That is where deregulation has left us.\n  Some people think that does not mean very much. We still get all this \nrobust competition in the major cities, and that is a good thing for \nthe major cities. Yes, it sure is. It is a good thing for the major \ncities. But it has been devastating for rural areas of the country.\n  I could go on at some length but I shall not do that, except to say \nthat, because of our experience, in which deregulation of the airlines \nhas made the rural areas an impoverished area with respect to that part \nof transportation service we used to expect--some kind of competition \nwith jet service going to some hubs--because of that we have to rely \nmore and more on other kinds of devices. We have become very strong \nsupporters of the Essential Airline Service Program, called EAS. That \nwas a program--when deregulation was enacted--that was advertised as a \nmeans to continue to provide some support and help to the smaller \nareas. That program used to be funded at $80 million a year. Then it \nwent to $40 million a year, then $30 million, then $25 million. Slowly \nbut surely it has been diminishing and many have tried to kill it.\n  What I did in this bill was offer an amendment that is now part of \nthis legislation that provides a permanence to the Essential Air \nService Program by funding it with a fee which this country should \nattach to foreign carriers overflying America. Every other country \nassesses this fee. Our country never has. This bill will assess a fee \nfor foreign overflights of our country, just as other countries do, and \npart of the proceeds of that fee will be used to provide for an \nEssential Air Service Program that is more robust than the current \nprogram is.\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\n  Under my amendment, the Essential Air Service will be administered by \nthe FAA; no longer the DOT, as is currently the case. It will be \nauthorized at $50 million a year. This bill passed the Commerce \nCommittee with broad, wide, bipartisan support. I appreciate very much \nthat it is on the floor and likely will pass through the Senate. We \nexpect to keep this in conference and, once and for all, solve this \nproblem. This is a good piece of legislation that addresses a problem \nthat we are stuck with as a result of deregulation in rural areas of \nthe country.\n  My friend from Arizona is a particularly articulate supporter of \nderegulation. I understand why, and I do not contest his view of why it \nhas been beneficial to some areas of the country. Nor would I expect he \nwould contest my view that some areas of the country have been hit \nvery, very hard by a theory that says we will create, in our \ntransportation system, networks in which, if you get a decent income \nstream that supports a service, fine; if not, service is unavailable \nand unimportant to you.\n  We have always, in transportation and communications and certain \nother areas, said let us try to provide broad networks of opportunity. \nThat should be true in air travel. It is true in communications, \ntelephone service, and other areas as well. But deregulation has \nchanged that. We have had an opportunity, now, to sample the bitter \nfruit of what deregulation does for us in some areas, and do not like \nit very much. That is why the Essential Air Service Program is \nincreasingly important to us.\n  I would like to move from that just for a moment to one other item. \nThis piece of legislation is critically important. I commend the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky and all others who \nhad a role in bringing it to the floor of the Senate, because this \nlegislation must be enacted by this Congress. We must reauthorize the \nFAA, provide for some continuity, and we must recognize its new and \nexpanded role in dealing with all of the issues we deal with all \nthroughout the year on air service issues in the Commerce Committee.\n\n  But something has happened here that causes me great concern. Let me \nexplain to the Senator from Arizona. I know he is aware of this and he \nprobably feels the same way I do about this, but it causes me great \nconcern. We have funded most of the FAA through the aviation trust \nfund, financed, in part, with a 10-percent ticket tax on airline \ntickets in this country. What happened is that this 104th Congress we \ngot into a wrestling match about a whole range of issues and the ticket \ntax expired. All those many months the ticket tax has expired the $500 \nmillion a month that should have been going into the trust fund to help \nfund the programs in the FAA, depleting the trust fund.\n  Then the 10-percent ticket tax was reinstated, but it was not \nreinstated for the purpose of funding the FAA. It was reinstated for \nthe purpose of paying for a small business tax program that was \nattached to the minimum wage bill.\n  I know about double entry bookkeeping, and this truly stretches \ndouble entry. Either the 10-percent ticket tax is designed to help fund \nthe functions of the FAA, or it is designed to help pay, as a revenue \nsource, for a range of tax breaks--many of which I supported, many of \nwhich I thought were meritorious--tax breaks for small business. But it \ncannot do both. And the more egregious approach here is that, on \nDecember 31, the 10-percent ticket tax will expire again and, on \nJanuary 1 and 2, there will be no 10-percent ticket tax. The Congress \nwill not be in session. The Congress will come back into session the \nfirst week for a day, for swearing in. Then its committees will \norganize. And, as all of us know, there is not going to be a \nreattachment of a ticket tax in January; unlikely in February; and we \nare right back into the same problem that all of us should have learned \nabout in recent months.\n  This is not being critical of one side or the other. It is saying \nthis is an awful way to do business. I have supported the ticket tax \nbecause I think it is an appropriate way to raise the revenue to help \npay for the functions of the FAA. We lost $500 million a month, have \nsubstantially depleted the trust fund, we reattached the 10-percent \nticket tax, not for the purpose of refunding the FAA, but for the \npurpose of allowing another bill to pass that provides tax cuts for \nsmall businesses, some tax help for small businesses, and then attached \nit only until December 31 when it is certain to expire again and all of \nus know it.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong with that happening. The \nresponsibility for us to address that is ours, all of ours, on both \nsides of this political aisle. We ought to run this place the right \nway, and the 10-percent ticket tax, if that is the choice to largely \nfund the FAA functions, let us put it in place and keep it in place and \nnot play games with it. One of the reasons I believe it is extended \nonly by the Finance Committee through December 31 is because I think \nthere is a belief by some that they can use it for the small business \ntax breaks now, which they have done, and then they can come back on \nJanuary 1 and use it again because it will be new money. It will not be \na tax that exists. It will be a new tax and they can use it for other \npurposes in January. It is a budget game and everyone in this Chamber \nknows it.\n  More important, it is playing a game with the wrong entity. The FAA, \nfor all of the controversy that it seems to receive every time there is \na major problem, the FAA is an institution that has an enormous \nresponsibility. I, like my colleagues, have flown in various parts of \nthe world. I tell you, at least with respect to the FAA--and I know we \nare talking vacuum tubes and all kinds of other issues here--with \nrespect to the FAA, I feel more safe flying in this country than I do \nanywhere else in the world. Is the FAA perfect? Have we had problems? \nNo, it is not perfect. Yes, we have had problems. But is this the kind \nof organization that deserves to have this kind of plug-in and pull-out \ncircumstance on the 10-percent ticket tax? I do not think so. It is not \na good way to do business. I think my colleague from Arizona would \nagree with that.\n\n  I am not standing here lacing criticism at one person or one \ncommittee or one party. I am just saying this is not the way for the \nSenate to do business and we ought to change it. If we are going to be \nhere a week or two more, the Finance Committee ought to report \nsomething out that does this in the right way, and that would be to \npermanently attach that ticket tax so it does not expire on January 1 \nand attach it as a permanent funding source to the FAA, as it has been \npreviously. That is what I would expect of this Congress. That is what \nI think most of the American people would expect of this Congress.\n  So, that is therapy. I got that off my chest. I have been complaining \nabout that for some while to no avail. You talk to some who say, ``this \ncommittee has jurisdiction,'' ``this happened,'' ``there are \ncircumstances we cannot always control,'' ``I wish it were \ndifferent''--the fact is, we can make it different. We run things, all \nof us together. We in Congress can make our own decisions about what is \nright or what is wrong and it is fundamentally wrong that we are going \nto leave here and on January 1 have no ticket tax that is funding the \nmanner the FAA runs, the way you and I and everybody expects it to \noperate.\n  Mr. President, I know others may want to speak on this. Having \ncomplained now for a bit about this, I do want to come back to say that \nI appreciate a lot of work that the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Kentucky have done to bring this to this point. I know \nthere have been a number of fences to climb and a number of fences to \nget under, even, to get here. I do not expect they will all be recited \non the floor of the Senate, but this is the right subject. We need to \nreauthorize this bill, and the work that these two have done, I think, \nmay allow us to accomplish that in a way that will be helpful to this \ncountry. If we will add to it a piece that solves the ticket tax issue \nin the way that people would expect it to be solved, then I think we \nwill have done something more for this country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from North Dakota concerning the ticket tax. If, last year at \nthis time, the Senator from North Dakota and I had been told that the \nticket tax would\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\nhave been jerked around in this fashion, I would have just said it is \nnot possible. I mean, aviation in America is too important. We have to \nhave these funds. We know what method of transportation more and more \nAmericans take, and the importance of modernization. We all know the \nproblems with the air traffic control system. We all know the issues \nthat face us. Yet the ticket tax was allowed to lapse for what, 10 \nmonths, I ask my colleague from North Dakota? It staggers the \nimagination. For us to only, as the Senator from North Dakota says, \nextend that ticket tax to December 31 is really unfair. It is unfair to \naviation safety, it is unfair to modernization, it is unfair to the \ntowns and communities that the Senator from North Dakota talked about \nwhich have lost air service as a result of deregulation.\n\n  I just would like to say now, especially since my friend from \nKentucky is here, maybe if the three of us and like-minded Senators got \ntogether and just said, ``Look, we're not going out of session until we \ndo resolve this ticket tax issue,'' remembering that in this bill, it \ndoes call for at some point a commission report to the Commerce \nCommittee, to the Finance Committee, and then to the floor of the \nSenate, so we can fundamentally restructure the way the financing is \ndone.\n  But until there is that kind of agreement, we are stuck with a ticket \ntax. I don't think it is the fairest kind of tax, I will tell my friend \nfrom North Dakota, and I don't think he does either. I think people who \nuse the system are the ones who should be paying. Right now, for \nexample, business jets pay about one-tenth into the system that they \nuse. That is wrong. That is not fair. In all due respect to my friends \nin the corporate world, they can afford it.\n  There are significant inequities associated with the ticket tax, but \nfor us to allow the aviation trust fund to become depleted to the point \nwhere we can't carry out our fundamental obligations, in my view, is--\nthe kind of description I would use is inappropriate.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky wants to add a comment on that \nbefore I also respond on the issue of essential air service, which I \nthink the Senator from North Dakota and I have been debating going on 7 \nyears, and I have no illusion of changing his views tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan. You never know when you get up on the floor and make a \nstatement about the way you feel--the response from the Senator from \nArizona, chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, is that he agrees with \nyou. I agree with you. So now we have three. So when you start out, \nmaybe you thought you were by yourself, but you are not.\n  One item I would like to add to what we expect from FAA is that we \nput responsibility on those who are operating FAA to do all these great \nthings, and then we don't give them the wherewithal to do it. Think \nabout that. We demand the safest airline service in the world, but yet \nwe say we're going to play Mickey Mouse with your money.\n  We went 10 months at $19 million a day lost, and now on January 1, we \nwill start losing a similar amount until we wake up and try to fund it. \nSure, we have in this bill a study on other ways to finance, but we \ndon't have it yet. That study has to be sent to us for review by the \nSecretary of Transportation.\n  What do we do between now and then? We are going to hear some folks, \n``Where's my money for my airport?'' Well, you didn't pay for it. \n``Where is my help on essential air service?'' The Senator from North \nDakota made his point.\n  In the managers' amendment that will be agreed to shortly, the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota, as it relates to small \nairports, essential air service, all those things will be in this bill. \nHe has made a great contribution.\n\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, I know his toughness, I know his \nability, and I will be glad to follow his lead in trying to work out \nsomething before we leave here to extend the ticket tax until such time \nas a report comes back under this bill. That would at least give us \nsomething to go on.\n  But I understand the turf around here. I understand we have \njurisdictions in our committee. I understand the smoke and mirrors that \nare being played with the ticket tax. It ought to go to airlines. It \nought to go to FAA. It ought to go to safety. It ought to go to small \nairports. But, no, we play Mickey Mouse, and we then turn around and \nsay, ``Where's all our help?'' You just can't do it.\n  So I agree with my friend from Arizona, and, in particular, my friend \nfrom North Dakota. I thank him for his statement tonight. I believe if \nthose Senators who didn't hear his statement--their staffs hopefully \ndid--they will have an opportunity to read the Record in the morning to \nsee what the Senator said, and he makes sense. There wasn't anything \npartisan about his statement. There is nothing partisan about the \nstatement of the Senator from North Dakota. He was just spelling out \nthe facts, and when you listen to the facts and you don't respond, as \neloquently as he laid them out, then I think we have something more \nthan trying to serve our constituency back home permeating this \nChamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am about to send to the desk a managers' \namendment to the bill.

The Senator's request with regard to original\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\ntext is approved by the Senate. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We seek adoption of the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to adoption of the \nmanagers' amendment under the conditions that have been stated? Without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5360) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me finish with a very brief statement. \nI do not want people to misunderstand what we are discussing here. This \nis not myself or others suggesting that we like a 10-percent ticket tax \nbecause it has the word ``tax'' in it. Let me explain exactly what this \nis.\n  For some many years we have had a 10-percent tax added to the price \nof airline tickets for the purpose of funding a wide range of \nactivities in the Federal Aviation Administration, the construction of \nairports, the purchase of equipment dealing with airline safety, a \nwhole range of things dealing with FAA control towers. We have always \nfunded that with this 10-percent tax on tickets.\n  To decide that there shall not be a 10-percent tax on tickets means \nthat there is no funding, or at least the major funding for the FAA is \nnot going to be available. That is why I say it does not make much \nsense for us to worry about and talk about the FAA and its functions, \nthe critical functions it performs for passengers in our country, and \nthen to allow the disconnection of the major revenue source to fund the \nFAA.\n  Not too long ago I asked to tour the FAA control tower at the \nMinneapolis-Saint Paul Airport. I have been in towers before, but I \nhave not been in very large towers. I have flown an airplane myself and \ncalled the tower on approach, so I know a little about the system. But \nI went up into the tower at Minneapolis-Saint Paul because I was \ncurious how they work on approach control with airplanes coming in and \ngoing out, on the ground, in the air, dealing with thunderstorms, and \nit was really quite remarkable to watch.\n  The one thing that was interesting to me is they had a very large \nscope in the middle of this dark room, a very large round scope. When \nthey pushed a button on that scope, which covered a map of the United \nStates and part of Canada on that scope, it would light up with about \n4,500 white dots, each of which represented an airplane at that moment \naloft being tracked by our system in the FAA.\n  You could point to any one of these dots on that giant screen with a \ncomputer and you could find out instantly what airplane that was, what \nits call signal was, what kind of plane it was, what direction it was \nheading, how fast it was going, what altitude it was--every single \nplane on that screen.\n  Then they had men and women up and down the row--and many of you have \nseen this in a control tower--in the dark room with the flow of \nincoming traffic and the flow of outgoing traffic dealing with that. \nThen you had the folks up on top who were dealing with the visual \naspects of landings and takeoffs and people on the ground. I will tell \nyou, I watched these people for some while. I was enormously impressed. \nThese are skilled, trained, tough professionals who know what they are \ndoing. I came away from that not thinking that this is a system with a \nlot of worry about it; I came away enormously impressed by the men and \nwomen who were running that system at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul \nAirport. I do not know about all Senators, but I know what I saw that \nday enormously impressed me. These are very capable people.\n  Can the system be improved? Yeah, probably.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield just for one additional comment I \nwould like to make?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now that the managers' amendment has been accepted, we \ncontinue to seek any additional amendments that our colleagues may \nhave. The Senator from Rhode Island has, after the Senator from North \nDakota is finished with his remarks, an amendment. We will be awaiting \nor anticipating any additional amendments, again, reminding my \ncolleagues that we will be seeking a unanimous consent agreement \ntonight to close out further amendments so that we will be able to have \nvotes on pending amendments and final passage at 11 o'clock tomorrow, \nwhich is the direction of the leaders on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor back to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will finish in 1 minute.\n  Let me say this. The men and women in that tower in Minneapolis and \nSaint Paul who tonight are working that air traffic control system, and \ndoing it with great skill, deserve a Congress that does right by them. \nThat means reconnecting the revenue source that is going to fund the \nFAA functions in this country.\n  Senator McCain invited that maybe some of us ought to decide this \nCongress ought not adjourn until it resolves that issue. Well, sign me \nup, count me in. Count me in for maximum trouble and minimum time. I \nwant to find any way possible to deny us from going home and not doing \nright by the people who are running that FAA system who are in those \ncontrol towers tonight.\n  We have an obligation. We have a job to do. All of us understand what \nit is. We ought to do it. The American people ought to expect that we \ndo it. I am pleased with the support by the Senator from Arizona and \nthe support from the Senator from Kentucky on these issues. I hope in \nthe coming couple of days the three of us, conspiring in a thoughtful \nand interesting way, can find a way to solve this problem. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the managers' \namendment, and to express my appreciation to the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Pressler, for working with me to ensure \nthat this bill addresses an important issue facing the Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA]--the issue of safety.\n  My language in the managers' amendment responds to the request made \nby the Secretary of Transportation on June 18, when he called on \nCongress to: ``* * * change the FAA charter to give it a single primary \nmission: safety and only safety.''\n  In light of the many safety concerns that have become public as a \nresult of the tragic crash of ValuJet flight 592 and TWA flight 800, it \nis important to restate the commitment of Congress and the FAA to \nensuring the safety of air travel in this country. By addressing the \nissue of the dual and dueling missions of safety and air carrier \npromotion, as one reporter so accurately put it, there will be no room \nfor doubt in the minds of the traveling public--or the FAA--that safety \nis its job--first, last and always.\n  The underlying bill includes the Wyden-Ford amendment, which I \nsupported in committee, that took an important step in the direction \nrequested by the Secretary. That amendment added the word ``safety'' to \nthe statute outlining the FAA's mission on air commerce promotion, and \nI agree that it is important to reemphasize safety in this area. This \nstill leaves us with a dual mandate, however.\n  The Snowe language requires the Management Advisory Council [MAC], \ncreated under the bill to provide oversight for management and policy \nmatters to the FAA Administrator, and to review the overall condition \nof aviation safety and the extent to which the dual mission of the FAA \nundermines the safety mission. The MAC has 180 days to report back to \nCongress, in conjunction with the FAA, with its recommendations for \nnecessary changes in the mission.\n  I would have preferred to simply eliminate the mandate, as I did in \nthe Snowe-Pressler freestanding bill on this issue, S. 1960. But I \nunderstand the concern that development and safety issues are closely \nlinked in some cases, and a review is necessary in order to determine \nthe most appropriate distribution of functions between the FAA and \nother agencies within the Department of Transportation. I believe that \nthis language provides for a process that will allow Congress to put to \nrest concerns that the FAA is not focused on safety.\n  We cannot expect the FAA to regain the trust of the traveling public \nwhile it maintains its dual mission of both ensuring their safety while \nat the same time continuing to promote the growth\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\nof the carriers. The current mission of the FAA places it in the \nuntenable position of being both the chief enforcer and the best friend \nof the airlines--no one should be asked to perform both roles, and no \none can be expected to do both well.\n  The dual mandate places the FAA in the position of conflict between \nthe American consumer and the airlines. It has raised questions about \nthe FAA's actions with regard to moving forward in a timely fashion on \nthe safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety \nBoard; and most importantly, it has raised questions about whose side \nthe FAA is really on.\n  As James Burnett, Jr., former Chairman of the National Transportation \nSafety Board, said ``It's as if the FAA acts to protect the airline \nrather than the consumer until they just can't maintain that position \nany longer.''\n  I believe that a review of FAA functions by the MAC, as required \nunder my language, and subsequent action by Congress on the MAC's \nspecific recommendations for changes necessary to ensure that safety \nremains the focal point of the FAA's mission, will enable us to \nreassure the American public that the FAA is looking out for their \nsafety at all times.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that included in the \namendment offered by the managers is a provision regarding \ndiscretionary Airport Improvement Program [AIP] grants to reliever \nairports. This language would clarify one of the factors that the \nFederal Aviation Administration [FAA] considers in determining grants \nfrom the discretionary fund.\n  The AIP provides grants to airports which help insure the safety of \nair travel in this Country. Seventy-five percent of the money \ndistributed annually from the AIP is allocated to primary and reliever \nairports from the discretionary grant fund. In determining whether to \nmake a grant to improve an airport, the Secretary of Transportation \nconsiders three criteria: First, the capacity of the national air \ntransportation system; second, the costs and benefits of a project; and \nthird, the financial commitment to be made from sources other than the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, language included in the amendment offered by the \nmanagers clarifies the second criteria, the costs-benefit analysis. \nCurrently, the FAA does not consider the cost savings to the primary \nairport in its analysis of improvements to the reliever airport even \nthough they might be cheaper than expenditures to upgrade the primary \nairport. In other words, a small investment could be made to upgrade \ncapacity at a reliever airport that would result in very large cost \nsavings at the primary airport. However, this does not qualify as a \npositive cost-to-benefit comparison under the FAA interpretation.\n  Mr. President, the Rock Hill-York County Airport, a small facility \nthat serves the north central part of South Carolina, is experiencing \ndifficulties with their grant application due to this interpretation. \nThe Rock Hill Airport is a designated reliever airport to the growing \nCharlotte/Douglas International Airport. In 1991, the FAA published a \nCapacity Enhancement Plan for the Charlotte Airport that recommended \nupgrading the capabilities at the reliever airports serving Charlotte. \nIt was estimated that if the Rock Hill Airport were equipped to handle \ngeneral and corporate aviation during bad weather, the Charlotte \nAirport would save $5.6 million per year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from \nMr. T. J. Orr, Aviation Director of the Charlotte Airport, that \noutlines this situation be inserted in the Congressional Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Pursuant to this report, the Rock Hill-York County \nAirport applied to the FAA for a $350,000 airport improvement grant to \ninstall an instrument landing system [ILS]. However, the FAA will not \nconsider the cost savings to Charlotte in the application submitted by \nRock Hill. Further, they base their decision solely on the number of \nflight operations currently at Rock Hill.\n  Mr. President, this puts Rock Hill in dilemma. They cannot \ndemonstrate the required number of operations to satisfy the FAA \nbecause they do not have an ILS and they cannot get the required number \nof operations without the ILS. While I believe the FAA is wrong, it \nappears that legislation is needed to correct this problem. I thank the \nmanagers for including language in their amendment that will force the \nFAA to examine this situation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 Charlotte/Douglas\n\n\n                                        International Airport,\n\n                                  Charlotte, NC, October 10, 1995.\n     Ms. Carolyn Blum,\n     Regional Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, \n         Southern Region, College Park, GA.\n       Dear Ms. Blum: The Federal Aviation Administration, airport \n     operators, and the users of the national air transportation \n     system a few years ago initiated Airport Capacity Design \n     Teams to identify, develop and evaluate means of reducing \n     delays at high activity airports, such as Charlotte. \n     Ancillary benefits based upon implementation of a number of \n     these recommendations have resulted in increased air traffic \n     control system safety and efficiency.\n       In April of 1991, the Charlotte/Douglas International \n     Airport Capacity Enhancement Plan, completed by the Charlotte \n     Capacity Design Team, was published by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. This plan was the result of a two year \n     collaborative effort by a design team which included \n     representatives from: the FAA System Capacity and \n     Requirements Office; the FAA Technical Center, Aviation \n     Capacity Branch; the FAA Southern Region Air Traffic \n     Division, Airway Facilities Division, Airport District \n     Office, and the Charlotte Tower; USAir, Air Transport \n     Association; Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; and the \n     City of Charlotte's Aviation Department.\n       One of the key recommendations of this plan was the upgrade \n     of capabilities and services offered by the reliever airports \n     serving the Charlotte area. In fact, an estimated savings of \n     $5.6 million per year in 1991 dollars was forecast as a \n     result of reducing demand at the Charlotte/Douglas \n     International Airport generated by general aviation, business \n     and corporate aviation demand. Much of this demand at the \n     Charlotte/Douglas International Airport occurs during \n     critical periods of instrument meteorological conditions when \n     reliever airports are simply not equipped to serve aircraft \n     in these weather conditions. The resultant involuntary \n     movement of general aviation, business and corporate aircraft \n     from a reliever airport to a major commercial service airport \n     hub could not come at a worse time or under worse conditions.\n       In recognition of these critical capacity, efficiency and \n     safety issues, the Rock Hill-York County Airport, an FAA \n     designated reliever airport to the Charlotte/Douglas \n     International Airport, has applied to the FAA Southern Region \n     for approval and funding of an AIP project to upgrade its \n     Runway 02 Localizer to a full Runway 02 ILS by the addition \n     of a glideslope and related improvements. The benefits of \n     lowering the approach minima to Rock Hill Airport, as a \n     result of these improvements, will accrue a substantial \n     benefit to the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport as \n     promised in the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport \n     Capacity Enhancement Plan.\n       Because of Rock Hill's willingness to fund a major portion \n     of this project's capital, design and maintenance costs from \n     non-FAA funding sources, it appears this is a project of \n     excellent value if the FAA considers its overall \n     infrastructure benefits. I strongly endorse this initiative \n     by Rock Hill and would appreciate your help in assisting Rock \n     Hill in obtaining the necessary project approval and funding \n     on a priority basis.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration of this matter.\n           Best personal regards,\n                                                         T.J. Orr,\n                                                Aviation Director.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5361\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 5361.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 78, line 12, strike ``and aircraft engine \n     emissions,''.\n       On page 78, line 19 through 24, strike all of paragraph (C) \n     and insert the following:\n       (C) The Administrator, as the Administrator deems \n     appropriate, shall provide for the participation of a \n     representative of the Environmental Protection Agency on such \n     advisory committees or associated working\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\n     groups that advise the Administrator on matters related to \n     the environmental effects of aircraft and aircraft engines.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Baucus. Mr. President, what does this amendment do? \nThis amendment would remove a provision in the bill which gives the \nFederal Aviation Administration, which sometimes is referred to as the \nFAA, removes the authority given to the FAA under this legislation to \nregulate air pollution emissions from aircraft engines.\n  This new authority--this is not authority that they currently have; \nthis is brand new authority to the FAA. It would duplicate authority \nwhich is already assigned to the Environmental Protection Agency under \nthe Clean Air Act. The amendment that Senator Baucus has joined me on \nwould encourage greater cooperation between EPA and FAA in this area, \nbut it would preclude the confusion and waste that would result from \ntwo Federal agencies charged to do the same job. That is what this \nlegislation does; it sets up one more agency to do exactly the same \nthing that the EPA does now.\n  Mr. President, we object to giving the FAA this authority for three \nreasons. First, there is no need to duplicate the authority that the \nEPA already has. There is no evidence, Mr. President--no evidence--that \nEPA has abused this authority or that it has overregulated aircraft \nengines. The last time EPA issued regulations for aircraft engines was \nin 1982. Mr. President, that was 14 years ago. So that is hardly a case \nof overregulation.\n  As a practical matter, Mr. President, the way this system works is \nthat the world's three major aircraft engine manufacturers--there are \nthree in the world, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls \nRoyce--comply with emissions standards that are set by an international \nbody, sometimes referred to as ICAO. That international body's \nregulations cover more pollutants and are more stringent than EPA \nregulations.\n  So, Mr. President, to instruct two separate Federal agencies to issue \nregulations on the same subject is to set the stage for confusion and \nconflict and wasted resources, both public and private.\n  Second, the FAA is in no position to regulate aircraft engine \nemissions as provided in this legislation. The FAA does not have the \nexpertise to know which air pollutants adversely affect human health or \nthe environment. The FAA does not know how emissions from aircraft \nengines fit into the bigger picture on air quality problems.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Commerce Committee has received a letter, \ndated just 5 days ago, from Secretary Pena of the Department of \nTransportation asking that this provision, the provision I am referring \nto, giving the same powers that the EPA has, giving those to the FAA in \nthis bill--Secretary Pena has written asking that this provision be \nremoved from the bill because the FAA does not have that expertise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nPena be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I will read a portion of this letter \naddressed to the Honorable Larry Pressler, chairman of the Committee on \nCommerce, dated September 12, 1996. Page 2 reads:\n\n       In consideration of the very significant budget constraints \n     faced by the FAA, I urge the deletion of the new \n     responsibilities that section 631(a)(1) of S. 1994 entitled, \n     ``Aircraft Engine Standards'' would impose on the agency. If \n     adopted, this section would vest responsibility to set \n     aircraft engine emission standards with the FAA. Such \n     responsibility would not only duplicate the responsibility \n     and authority already vested with the Environmental \n     Protection Agency [EPA] under the Clean Air Act, but would \n     also require the expenditure of substantial resources to \n     develop a level of expertise requisite to environmental \n     rulemaking that already exists at EPA.\n\n  What is the third reason that this provision should be stricken? If \nthe provision in the bill has the effect of forestalling any EPA \nregulation of aircraft engines--which probably is the effort here, to \nget EPA out of this--the result will not be less regulation or less \ncostly regulation. It will merely mean, and this is important, more \nregulation for other sources like small businesses and automobile \nowners and manufacturing facilities.\n  Airplanes emit hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen into the \natmosphere where they combine with the air pollutants admitted by \nthousands of other sources to form what is known as smog. The way the \nClean Air Act works, States must adopt regulations reducing pollution \nfrom targeted sources until a safety level for smog pollution is \nattained. In other words, the States have this responsibility. If \naircraft engines, the airlines, and air transport companies are not \nrequired to reduce their pollution, then somebody else has to do it. It \nmight be the dry cleaner, it might be a small manufacturing company, it \nmight be a bakery. Somebody has to reduce its, his, or her, emissions, \nand will probably have to do more and do it at a higher cost than if an \noverall look could be taken and seen where it can be done most \neconomically. That might in certain instances pertain to aircraft \nengines.\n  This provision does not reduce regulation. It just shifts the burden \nto somebody else, somebody else who is not represented by a high-\npowered lobbyist that can send letters saying, ``Take EPA out of \nthis.''\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, Senator Baucus and I are offering \nthis amendment to remove the provisions creating duplicative regulatory \nauthority and encouraging more cooperation. What our amendment does is \nsay, yes, there should be more cooperation between the FAA and EPA. The \nEPA should consult with FAA on these matters.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me just say the following: I am deeply \ndisturbed by the trend that is taking place in connection with what I \nbelieve to be ill-advised efforts to cut back on environmental \nregulation. Here is one industry attempting to be exempted, then \nanother, then another. We have a bill over in the House of \nRepresentatives dealing with immigration. What does it say? You can \nbuild a fence to keep out immigrants and you do not have to pay any \nattention to the Endangered Species Act. But that is not enough. They \nthen go on to say pay no attention to the Endangered Species Act and, \nindeed, pay no attention to what is known as the National Environmental \nPolicy Act. In other words, forgo all environmental regulations while \nyou are building this fence. Build this fence in California between \nMexico and the United States--oh, no, to build any fence anywhere in \nthe United States, dealing with immigration, pay no attention to the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.\n\n  Mr. President, this Nation was blessed in the early 1970's by a \nseries of great Senators, and we know who they are. They are Ed Muskie, \nJennings Randolph, Howard Baker, Bob Stafford, who in a bipartisan \nfashion brought forward in this Nation tremendous environmental \nprotection laws, and whether you are talking the Clean Air Act or the \nClean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the creation of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency or the National Environmental \nProtection Act, whatever it is, those were the bills that were brought \nforward. They were brought forward because there was a need for them.\n  When the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire, it caught the \nattention of the people in the United States--something is wrong with \nthe waters of this Nation. So we embarked on a $60 billion program over \nthe course of the years to clean up discharges from municipalities, and \nthe industries, likewise, complied, because we had regulations. Now we \nhave clean waters. At that time, one-third of the waters of the United \nStates' lakes, rivers and streams were fishable and swimmable. Now two-\nthirds of the lakes, rivers and streams in the United States of America \nare fishable and swimmable, and every year that percentage increases. \nSo we have been blessed by these laws.\n  I, Mr. President, find it discouraging and disappointing that \nconstantly there is an effort to nibble away at those statutes. Here in \nthis one, to remove the aircraft engine and the Air Transport \nAssociation's aircraft from the restrictions that have been applied, \nwisely, by the EPA over many years, and give it to another agency where \nthey think they will find a much more sympathetic home.\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I hope we do not turn our backs on those \nmagnificent achievements that were made in the early 1970's and \ncontinued since then, whether it is the control of toxic waste and the \nmanner in which we dispose of them, whether it is what we did in the \nClean Air Act in 1991, all of these statutes have been for better \nhealth and a better America. I, Mr. President, just hope we will not \nnip, nip, nip away at cutting back on these statutes that have meant so \nmuch to our Nation and the health of our people.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have appreciated your past support for \n     the important work that the Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA) does to provide the American traveling public with safe \n     and efficient air travel. I know you agree that a strong, \n     effective FAA is absolutely essential for aviation safety in \n     this country. The safety and security of our air \n     transportation system have always enjoyed bipartisan support \n     in Congress.\n       It is because of this shared vision that I urge you to \n     enact--before Congress adjourns--the comprehensive FAA reform \n     and reauthorization legislation contained in S. 1994. Without \n     the timely enactment of this legislation, it will be \n     considerably more difficult for the FAA to meet the safety \n     demands of the traveling public.\n       This legislation will reauthorize funding for critical FAA \n     safety, security, air traffic modernization, and research \n     programs. It will also reauthorize the airport development \n     grant program. In the absence of an extension of the airport \n     grant program, FAA's ability to fund many important airport \n     projects involving capacity, safety, and security will end \n     October 1.\n       S. 1994 also contains critical provisions to help ensure a \n     better way to finance the FAA. These provisions will help to \n     ensure FAA has adequate resources in the future, but are also \n     designed to provide appropriate incentives to users of the \n     air traffic control system and ensure that the air traffic \n     control system is used in the most cost-effective manner. A \n     bill that does not contain the foundation for meaningful \n     financial reform for the agency will undermine the FAA's \n     ability to meet the safety and security needs of the \n     traveling public, and lessen public confidence in our air \n     transportation system.\n       Congress has already taken critical steps in the past year \n     to provide FAA with needed acquisitions and personnel reform. \n     It is imperative that Congress stay the course on these \n     reforms and not tie FAA up once again with unnecessary red \n     tape that will impact the efficiency of the air traffic \n     control system and delay air traffic modernization efforts. \n     The most significant step is to pass meaningful financial \n     reform since these reforms will be limited without sufficient \n     resources and budget flexibility for the agency. The lapse of \n     the Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes this year underscores \n     the need to find a long-term, new funding solution for the \n     FAA.\n       In consideration of the very significant budget constraints \n     faced by the FAA, I urge the deletion of the new \n     responsibilities that section 631(a)(1) of S. 1994, entitled \n     ``Aircraft Engine Standards,'' would impose on the agency. If \n     adopted, this section would vest responsibility to set \n     aircraft engine emission standards with the FAA. Such \n     responsibility would not only duplicate the responsibility \n     and authority already vested with the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act, but would \n     also require the expenditure of substantial resources to \n     develop the level of expertise requisite to environmental \n     rulemaking that already exists at EPA. It is our \n     understanding that the Senate will exempt military aircraft \n     from the overflight user fee proposed in section 673, and we \n     do not object to that change.\n       I urge you to move the legislation to the floor and through \n     conference expeditiously so that we can assure that FAA has \n     the tools and resources necessary to meet its vital \n     responsibilities to the American public. We look forward to \n     working with you on this important effort, and thank you for \n     your continued support of aviation safety and security \n     programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that there will be \nset aside tomorrow before we vote, 15 minutes, of which Senator Baucus \nwould have 10 minutes and I would have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. If it is all right with the Senator, I think I have it \ncleared with my colleague. I ask unanimous consent this amendment by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, be set aside until tomorrow, \nand that before the amendment is voted upon, there be 15 minutes of \ndebate, 5 minutes for the Senator from Rhode Island and 10 minutes for \nSenator Baucus of Montana.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do I understand the Senator's request that all \nthe time reserved would be for the proponents of the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am agreeable.\n  Mr. FORD. What I am trying to do is give them 15 minutes. That does \nnot preclude me or anybody else from taking time because they get a \nminimum of 15 minutes tomorrow.\n  If I want to oppose the amendment I will oppose it and take 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Whatever time we get, perhaps it would be best if it were \nevenly divided.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I make the request, if I could. I think it is fair that \nthe opponents get some time. I am not trying to cut anybody out of \ntime.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we will just set this amendment aside and \ntake our best hope tomorrow and go.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And reach a time agreement tomorrow?\n  Mr. FORD. That would be fine. I do not know how much time in \nopposition because I have not had much information tonight relating to \nthe opposition to your amendment.\n  I suspect, since you have offered the amendment to take it out of the \nbill, that there will be a lot of work going on tonight and there will \nbe a few people who will want to speak against your amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I ask this, Mr. President: Is there a time certain \nset to vote tomorrow on this measure?\n  Mr. FORD. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not. There is no time certain set for \na vote tomorrow on this measure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding since we have not agreed on \nanything that there is no time agreement.\n  Mr. FORD. That is correct. The only thing I was attempting to do \nhere--if there are other amendments that come up, we will set yours \naside. Once that amendment is taken care of, yours will come back as \nthe pending business. That is what I am trying to do, because there \nwill not be a vote tonight.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is fair enough. We will work it out tomorrow.\n  Mr. FORD. Sure, we will.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am perfectly prepared, and I want to make sure that the \nopponents get whatever time they want. Thank you.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the FAA authorization \nbill. Although I recognize the necessity to authorize certain FAA \nactivities, such as the Airport Improvement Program [AIP], I am \nconcerned with two provisions in the bill. I appreciate the hard work \nthat the managers have put in on this legislation, and I thank them for \nthe opportunity to speak on this bill.\n  I support the reauthorization of FAA activities, believing that the \nmanagers have succeeded in funding the AIP program at the appropriate \nlevel. It is important to many airports and travelers around the \ncountry that Congress finish its work in this area. For example, in my \nhome State of Arizona, officials from the airports in Phoenix, \nChandler, Glendale, Yuma, and Tucson have contacted me in support of \nthe AIP program. The FAA has projected that the number of passengers in \nthe domestic aviation system will reach 800 million annually. The \nAmerican Association of Airport Executives and the Airports Council \nInternational-North America recently completed a comprehensive study on \nthe capital needs of U.S. airports. The study concluded that the \nNation's airports have capital needs around $10 billion annually. So I \nurge my colleagues to support the authorization of the AIP program.\n  While I support parts of the bill, I must comment on two provisions \nwhich I believe Congress must be careful in implementing. First, there \nis a provision that would set up an independent task force to study how \nFAA activities may be funded for many years. I am concerned that the \ntask force may be used to implement a user-fee system. I ask that the \nchairman and the ranking member to work with the task force to ensure \nthat all areas of aviation are heard. Many in my State have expressed \nconcern about\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\nfunding FAA activities with a user-fee system. I believe it could have \na negative effect on such local airlines as America West and Southwest. \nArizona is also a State with many citizens who pilot their own planes, \nand I am advised such a system could harm the general aviation \nindustry. I support the current ticket-tax system and I am glad that \nCongress approved its temporary extension as part of the small business \ntax relief bill.\n  My second concern is that the parts of the bill that address aviation \nsecurity will not adequately protect us. I know that it is easy to get \ncaught up in the apprehensions created in the wake of the crash of TWA \nflight 800. We all want to make aviation a safer means of \ntransportation, but we must have the proper priorities. I believe that \nany changes to aviation security should focus on greater intelligence \ngathering. If the explosion on TWA flight 800 was a bombing, it was a \nterrorist attack not on a particular airline but against our whole \ncountry. We must take strong and concerted steps as a nation to deal \nwith such heinous attacks. A strong intelligence system is the key \nhere. Recently, the Air Transport Association made several \nrecommendations to the White House Commission on Aviation Safety, \nchaired by Vice President Gore. I would like to make note of two of \nATA's recommendations. First, the association told the Gore Commission \nthat there must be an increase in the amount of funding available to \ndevelop the software necessary for automated passenger profiling--that \nis, profiling of suspects who may be traveling the airways. ATA member \nairlines, according to the association, are committed to the full \nimplementation of automated passenger profiling through their \nreservations systems. Second, ATA recommended that the commission \nshould establish strong, new inter-agency coordination requirements to \nensure the timely, accurate, and comprehensive communication of \ndetailed intelligence assessment information necessary to permit the \ninformed participation of the aviation industry in responding to \nidentified threats. Mr. President, there will be many antiterrorist \ninitiatives which I believe will help thwart terrorist attacks, such as \nmore advanced detection devices and bomb-sniffing dogs. However, I \nbelieve that our priority must be to develop ways to enhance the \ntracking of those persons already identified as a threat to the general \npublic.\n  I urge the chairman and ranking member to make note of my concerns, \nand I thank them for the opportunity to discuss the issues.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are nearing the witching hour of the \nunanimous-consent agreement on the amendments that will be considered \ntomorrow. I have proposed to my colleague that even those amendments \nthat we have included in the managers' package be listed, in case there \nmight be some wording change that might be needed. If they are not on \nthe list, therefore, it would be difficult, parliamentary wise, for \nthem to be accommodating. I don't want any of my colleagues not to have \nthe ability to change a word or something like that tomorrow. I don't \nthink we ought to get into a unanimous-consent agreement on changing. \nThen we get unanimous-consent agreements for additional amendments. Of \ncourse, I would like to get them cut off tonight if at all possible.\n  So we will have at least one more amendment that will be offered. \nThen we are looking at around 8:15, or somewhere in that neighborhood, \nfor a unanimous-consent agreement on the finite list of amendments for \nS. 1994.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to the pending \nFAA bill, that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments, \nand following the disposition of the listed amendment, the bill be \nadvanced to third reading, and the Senate immediately proceed to \nCalendar No. 588, the House companion bill, all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and the text of the Senate bill, as amended, be \ninserted, and H.R. 3539 be immediately advanced to third reading.\n  The list is as follows:\n  Pressler, relevant; Lott, relevant; McCain, relevant; Inhofe, \nemergency revocation; Warner, PFC; Warner, rapidly growing airports; \nSantorum, relevant; Brown, bidding; Brown, relevant; Roth, aviation \ntrust fund spending; Roth, task force; Roth, user fees; Roth, committee \nconsultation; Thurmond, reliever airport criteria; D'Amato, relevant; \nGorton, relevant; Burns, medical certificates; Domenici, three relevant \namendments; Helms, airports; Simpson, airport safety; Jeffords, pension \naudits; Nickles/Lott, pensions; Baucus, FAA aircraft emissions \nstandards, with Chafee; Breaux, relevant; Boxer, cruise ships; Bryan, \ntwo relevant amendments; Byrd, one relevant amendment; Conrad, two \nrelevant amendments; Daschle, two relevant amendments; Dorgan, \ntransportation; Exon, relevant; Ford, two relevant amendments; Graham, \nrelevant; Harkin, slots; Heflin, Alabama Airport; Hollings, relevant; \nInouye, relevant; Kerry, relevant; Moseley-Braun, train whistle, with \nWyden; Reid, state-supported terrorism; Simon, pensions; Wyden, train \nwhistle, with Moseley-Braun; Wyden, three relevant amendments.\n\n  That completes the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object. I would like to make a point here. Many of these amendments \nare included in the managers' amendment to the bill. This is so that \nthere will be no problem tomorrow with our colleagues coming in and \nsaying we did not get the right language or the right words, they are \ncovered under this situation. If the managers' amendments are all \nright, we will strike them off. I think you will find that about two-\nthirds of these will be gone; at least two-thirds of the relevants will \nbe gone. So when you get right down to how many amendments we will have \ntomorrow, it will be very few.\n  I hope we can expedite the passage of this legislation. I wanted my \ncolleagues to be sure that we are trying to protect them, so that they \nwon't come in here tomorrow and say we have done something wrong and \nwords were left out.\n  I wanted to be sure that everybody understood that. And that is one \nreason that the list is so long because we have basically taken care of \nmost of them.\n  So I thank my friend for what he is attempting to do here. I think it \nis the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise because I want to support this \nlegislation to reauthorize many of the FAA programs and to do what we \ncan to improve our Nation's system of aviation security, a subject I \nhave had a longtime interest in. I did serve on the Pan Am 103 \nCommission that reviewed what took place there and was one of the \nauthors of the recommendations that were submitted in 1990.\n  First, I commend my colleague, my friend from Kentucky, Senator Ford, \nand my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for their work \non this issue. It is not only a critical\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\nissue, but the timing certainly is critical in terms of some response \nthat we have to have to what has been taking place. Terrorist threats \nto our aviation system as well as our general living in this country \ncertainly call for a response from this body and from our colleagues \nacross the Capitol to try to do something to improve a system that is \nfundamentally pretty good. As a matter of fact, it is very good.\n  I could not have faced, as I have in the State of New Jersey, people \nwho lost loved ones on Pan Am 103 in 1988 nor those who lost family \nmembers, friends, loved ones on TWA 800--I was in Long Island shortly \nafter that plane went down. I was out there a couple of weeks ago with \nthe Secretary of Transportation, met with the FBI, people from the \nNTSB, people from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I could \nnot have faced any of the surviving families and said to them, be \nassured; the system is safe. The fact that they lost a son, a daughter, \na mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a child is enough to say the \nsystem is not safe enough, that regardless of how efficient the system \nis, it is not efficient or sufficient as we see it in our family's \ngrief and our family's emptiness.\n  And so, Mr. President, it is not simply, although a critical part of \nthe issue, aviation security, safety overall, a necessity to bring the \nsystem up to the capacity the public currently demands. The projected \nfigures of growth in aviation travel are almost exponential in terms of \nthe size of the base; over 500 million people a year enplane to go \ndifferent places from within the States and from the United States to \nother airports--but to make sure that not only can they travel safely \nbut efficiently, with airplanes leaving on time, with the investments \nin the system being made in a timely and businesslike fashion to make \ncertain that the taxpayers' money, the travelers' taxes or fees are \ninvested in a way that reflects serious interest in getting this system \nup to the capacity that is presently there and ultimately will be \ndemanded.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is essential to our Nation's aviation \nsystem. Importantly, the bill would extend the authorization for the \nAirport Improvement Program, what we affectionately refer to as the \nAIP. We will make some reference to that. Without that authorization, \ncritical infrastructure funding for airports will just not be \navailable. At the same time, it is important to emphasize that this \nauthorization is not sufficient, as I said earlier, to keep up with our \nNation's airport needs.\n  In addition to enacting an authorization bill, the aviation trust \nfund needs to be adequately financed and the expenditures to be \nreplenished, and that is going to require either an extension of the \nexisting ticket tax, as we heard from our colleague from North Dakota \nsome moments ago, and we heard from the two managers of the bill, or \nsome other financing mechanism. Otherwise, even if the bill before us \nis enacted, the trust fund will run out of money next year.\n\n  To some who may be listening, that would sound like an abstraction--\nthe trust fund runs out of money. But if it does run out of money, and \nif we are unable to make the improvements that are required, the public \ncan look forward to further delays, to further inconvenience, and to \nincreased costs substantially for the improvements we ultimately must \nmake. We cannot let that happen. I strongly urge my colleagues, \nespecially those who serve on the Finance Committee, to act before \nDecember 31, when the existing tax will expire, to address this \nproblem.\n  I would like to turn for a moment to the provisions in this \nlegislation that are of particular interest to me and on which I have \nworked fairly extensively, and that is aviation security.\n  This legislation does not represent a comprehensive aviation security \nplan. However, in conjunction with the ongoing efforts of the Gore \nCommission and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, it will help \nto tighten aviation security at our airports and on our airways.\n  When I say it is not a comprehensive aviation security plan, I do not \nwant any misinterpretation to occur. I do not want to suggest that my \ncolleagues who brought this bill to the floor have been less than \ndiligent. They have been. They have surmounted enormous obstacles to \nget the bill to this point on this night. The provisions in this bill \nare needed to enhance the aviation security system, but by themselves \nthey are not sufficient. They are a significant beginning.\n  Two months ago today for us here, an eternity for those who lost \nfamily members on TWA flight 800, it hardly seems that enough has \nhappened since that airliner was destroyed and fell into the waters \njust south of the Long Island seashore. Still, at this time, with the \nmost diligent effort, painstaking work, having created a record number \nof dives into the sea of any Navy mission ever undertaken--over 2,000 \ndives were taken to try to pick up the remnants of TWA 800 off the sea \nfloor--we still have no conclusive evidence.\n  But, regardless of what the cause was, we know that we have to do \nsomething to improve the safety of the traveling public, even though, \nas I said earlier, the system is fundamentally very safe. When my \nchildren or my grandchildren, the members of my family, fly, I send \nthem off with full confidence that the system is working well. And, \nLord grant us, I hope that always proves to be the case. But we can \nalways make it a notch safer.\n  Unfortunately, the definitive proofs may lie yet on the ocean floor. \nIt still appears that terrorism is the likely cause of the disaster, \nbut we dare not draw conclusions until the evidence is clearly at hand.\n  The crash of TWA flight 800 reminded me of a similar tragedy almost 8 \nyears ago. I have exceptionally vivid memories of the downing of Pan Am \nflight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. After that crash, I helped to \ncreate, with President Bush's encouragement and that of others here, \nthe President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism. I \nsponsored the Aviation Improvement Act of 1990, with others, which was \nenacted into law. There is no question that, as a result of the work \ndone at that time, that security was improved. But the world has \nchanged. This latest tragedy has focused renewed national attention on \nthe terrorist threat to American aviation and to the American traveler. \nIt is a threat that will continue to increase in scope and \nsophistication. No one here believes that we are doing all we can to \nfight the ongoing expanding threat of terrorism. It has become, for us, \none of the most difficult situations that we as a free society and \nother free democratic countries face.\n  The growth of terrorism is an enormous threat because, not only is it \nthe work of madmen who, at times, are willing to give their lives or to \nrecommend that their sons give their lives to be martyred in some \nfashion, but the sophistication of the weapons, bombs in containers the \nsize of a watch with the impact of TNT--it is an enormous threat and it \nis a threat that we have to work ever harder to contain. No aviation \nsecurity system is foolproof, we know that. But we also know that we \ncan do much more to deter the terrorist threat.\n  TWA 800, like Pan Am 103, was a wake-up call, and we need to respond \nas quickly as we can. Shortly after the TWA crash, I introduced the \nAviation Security Act. My bill, S. 2037, would enhance security at \ndomestic airports by instituting a truly comprehensive security system. \nThe legislation calls for tightened security to check baggage, cargo \nand mail, and increase screening, training and job performance measures \nfor security personnel at our airports. My bill also requires that \npassenger profiles be undertaken on a routine basis and that state-of-\nthe-art explosive detection devices be installed in those airports that \nhave the greatest security risk.\n  To address the needs of families of victims and survivors, the bill \nestablishes an Office of Family Advocate, an office that would be \nresponsible for developing standards for informing, supporting, and \ncounseling the families of victims of airline disasters.\n  Finally, I suggested the increased security measures be funded by a \nfee of not more than $4 per round trip ticket, a figure that was \nrecommended by those responsible for aviation security working in the \nDepartment of Transportation. It was believed that, with that \ninvestment and other sources of revenue, we could do a lot more to \npreserve the safety of our airplanes and to deter the threat of a \nterrorist attack. I am pleased that many of the ideas contained in my \nlegislation have already\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\nbeen adopted by the administration and are included in recommended \nrules and regulations. Shortly after the TWA crash, President Clinton \nestablished the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. \nThat commission, now known as the Gore Commission, worked with the \nalready-established Aviation Security Advisory Committee to develop a \nplan to meet the challenges posed by the proliferation of terrorist \ngroups.\n\n  The Gore Commission issued its recommendations last week, and the \nPresident moved immediately to implement them. They are a good first \nstep toward strengthening aviation security. The bill before us \nincludes many of the commission's recommendations. I am pleased that \nthe legislation was worked out in a cooperative, positive, bipartisan \nmanner, and that is as it should be when it comes to something as \nimportant as keeping our airlines and our people safe.\n  This bill directs the FAA to begin deploying state-of-the-art \nexplosive detection devices, ensuring that the flying public is \nprotected by the most technologically advanced system. It also requires \nthat personnel who operate security screeners be subjected to \nbackground checks, as are most other airport security employees. It \nrequires that the NTSB and the FAA begin developing a ``right to know'' \nprogram which would let consumers know about the airlines' accident and \nsafety records. The bill also directs the FAA to continue working with \nthe airlines in developing programs identifying high-risk passengers \nand high-risk destinations.\n  In addition, this legislation recognizes that aviation security needs \nare constantly evolving. The best laid plans are worthless if they are \nnot implemented in a timely fashion and monitored regularly. The bill \nrequires that each airport and each air carrier conduct vulnerability \nassessments on their own, or comprehensive self-audits of their entire \nsecurity systems. These assessments will enable both the airport and \nthe air carriers to know their own systems and their weaknesses and \nwill encourage them to make the needed changes over time.\n  Because terrorists look for cracks in the security systems, the bill \nwould require the FAA to stay one step ahead by finding those breaches \nfirst. Under the bill, the FAA could conduct periodic, unannounced, and \nsometimes anonymous tests of airport and air carriers' security \nsystems. This would keep the airports and air carriers on their toes \nand provide the oversight needed.\n  Both of these provisions were addressed in the bill I introduced in \nAugust. Other provisions of the bill require the administration to \nissue reports to Congress on their implementation of a number of the \nGore Commission's recommendations. For example, the President ordered \nheightened security measures for air cargo, and the Gore Commission \nrecommended a pilot program to ensure that checked baggage is matched \nwith passengers who actually board the plane. We will need to know the \nresults of these initiatives so Congress can evaluate the need to do \nmore.\n  One thing we do know. The Nation's aviation system is in need of \nchange, in need of improvement. We have waited too long to implement \nthe reforms. This legislation makes an important contribution to that \neffort.\n  Mr. President, our work cannot stop there. We need to ensure that all \npromised reforms are appropriately implemented and in the spirit in \nwhich they were intended.\n  So I express my appreciation, once again, to Senator Hollings, \nSenator Ford, Senator Pressler, Senator McCain, and Senator Hutchison \nfor their cooperation on this legislation.\n  I also thank the many aviation security advocates, the families of \nthe victims of airline disasters, airports, air carriers and many \nothers to implement sound and secure reforms.\n  It is obvious, Mr. President, this legislation will not solve all of \nour problems. However, as I earlier mentioned, this is an important \nstep that will make our skies safer for the public, make a meaningful \ncontribution in our battle against terrorism, and will indicate to the \npublic that the U.S. Government is interested in what I will call their \nplight, their concerns, their anxiety. We have to put those to rest, \nand the best way to do it is to do something about it, as we are with \nthe bill before us.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg, for his work on this bill, along with Senator \nHutchison. He is one who is very knowledgeable on aviation issues and \nhas been involved for many years.\n  I express the appreciation of all of us who have been involved in \nthis legislation for Senator Lautenberg and the efforts he made which \ndramatically improved this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all relevant amendments \nbe filed by 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SIMON. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, just so I understand the procedure, does \nthat mean we will not go through the amendments this evening \nnecessarily?\n  Mr. McCAIN. We will try to dispense of as many amendments as we can \nthis evening. What I was going to say, after gaining a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, is that the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader have said that they won't spend more than an hour or so \nadditional time after 11 o'clock tomorrow. If we cannot get these \namendments resolved and taken care of within an hour or so, the bill \nwill be pulled. I think that would be a terrible thing to happen, given \nthe absolute urgency of this legislation, not only funding the aviation \nsystem but many of the issues that the Senator from New Jersey \npropounded.\n  So we are trying to get the amendments disposed of as quickly as \npossible, and after 11 tomorrow, when all amendments are going to need \nto be filed, if the unanimous consent request is agreed to, we do not \nanticipate being on the bill more than an hour or so.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would like to accommodate the Senator from Arizona. So \nyour preference would be that I go ahead with this amendment this \nevening?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That would be my preference.\n  Mr. SIMON. I have no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Illinois would show his usual \ncourtesy which he is known for throughout this body, I would very much \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would it be in order for the managers to \nreceive the amendment of the Senator from Virginia?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. All amendments listed must be filed.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I am prepared briefly to handle two \namendments, I say to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia, I appreciate that, \nbut that would not affect this unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. I did not mean to interrupt. I did not realize we had not \nachieved it.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I regret I \nhave to do this. We have a call in, in fact two of them. I will have to \nobject to the unanimous-consent request at this time, and I will have \nto get on the phone to see if I can straighten this out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very briefly, I ask my colleagues, especially the \nobjections that just came in, I do not believe that it is unreasonable \nto ask the amendments be filed by 11 o'clock tomorrow. I hope that we \ncan resolve those objections. It is agreed to on both sides that we \nneed to get this legislation passed. I hope that the Senator from \nKentucky can use his usual powers of persuasion and get this resolved \nso that I can propound, again, this unanimous-consent request, and we \ncan get it accomplished tonight. Until such time as that, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\nand the Senator from Kentucky. I will proceed with two amendments. I \nhave discussed this with the managers, and we are prepared to handle \nboth. Before doing so, I noted that our distinguished colleague from \nArizona recognized the Senator from Illinois and made specific mention \nof his reputation in the Senate for courtesy. We shall dearly miss him \nwhen he departs because, indeed, he is an example of senatorial \ncourtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5362\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the use of passenger facility fees for a debt \n                           financing project)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5362.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 8, strike lines 14 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n       paragraph (D); and\n       ``(B) by striking subparagraph (F) and inserting the \n     following:\n       `` `(F) for debt financing of a terminal development \n     project that, on an annual basis, has a total number of \n     enplanements that is less than or equal to 0.05 percent of \n     the total enplanements in the United States if--\n       `` `(i) construction for the project commenced during the \n     period beginning on November 6, 1988, and ending on November \n     4, 1990; and\n       `` `(ii) the eligible agency certifies that no other \n     eligible airport project that affects airport safety, \n     security, or capacity will be deferred as a result of the \n     debt financing.' ''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision \ncontained in the House-passed Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act which would make a very narrow change, referred to \nas a PFC; that is passenger facility charge. This is a measure put in \nthe House legislation by my distinguished colleague and personal \nfriend, Congressman Bliley. Congressman Bliley, as we know, is chairman \nof the House Committee on Commerce. I join him in this effort.\n  This provision would allow a nonhub airport in my State, \nCharlottesville--that is Albemarle--to be eligible to use its own PFC \npassenger facility charge authority for debt service associated with \nits passenger terminal project. They just completed a very fine \nmodernization program.\n  The FAA's PFC regulations have always allowed eligible projects to be \nrefinanced with PFC dollars after--after, Mr. President--they have been \ncompleted, provided only that the notice to proceed with construction \nwas given after November 5, 1990. These are highly technical \nprovisions.\n  The House bill has the Bliley provision which relates only to the \ndate--and I urge my colleagues to take note of that--the date when \nconstruction of an otherwise eligible PFC project was begun and should \nnot adversely affect any other airport in the United States.\n  I have discussed this with the managers, and I rely on the judgment \nof both managers that this matter will be addressed with fairness and \nobjectivity in the conference. And at the specific request of the \nmanagers, and to accommodate this with the understanding this will be \naddressed in conference, Mr. President, I ask at this time that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5362) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5363\n\n(Purpose: To provide for additional considerations for the selection of \n            projects for grants from the discretionary fund)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5363.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 23, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 11, line 4, strike ``and';''.\n       On page 11, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       ``(4) any increase in the number of passenger boardings in \n     the preceding 12-month period at the airport at which the \n     project will be carried out, with priority consideration to \n     be given to projects at airports at which, during that \n     period, the number of passenger boardings was 20 percent or \n     greater than the number of such boardings during the 12-month \n     period preceding that period; and;''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I further thank my colleagues for the \ninclusion of this amendment for high-growth airports. These are the \ncommercial airports which logically would be experiencing \ninfrastructure and facilities problems as a result of their rapid \ngrowth, making the adoption of this amendment, I think, in the interest \nof all parties.\n  At this time, I urge the adoption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the managers of the bill--and I have \ndiscussed this with Senator Ford--have no objection and we appreciate, \nby the way, Senator Warner's agreement to withdraw his previous \namendment, given the fact that it would have been somewhat \ncontroversial. I do assure him that proposal of his will be treated \nwith utmost concern and scrutiny in the conference.\n  We have no objection to the amendment, Mr. President, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleague, I thank him \nvery much for the first amendment. There is a second amendment pending. \nI urge its adoption. I presume it is acceptable to the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5363) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senate for just \na few more minutes with regard to a second matter.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved for many years in seeking to \ndevise a legislative solution to the constitutional issues that exist \ndue to the decisions of the Congressional Board of Review, as that \nboard has jurisdiction over Dulles and National airports.\n  Mr. President, the Senate may recall that many years ago I introduced \na bill, together with my then-colleague from Virginia, Senator Trible, \nby which these airports became subject to this particular board of \nreview. It enabled these airports then to begin to proceed to get the \nneeded dollars and financing to modernize both Dulles International and \nWashington National Airports.\n  This amendment, S. 1994, the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of \n1996, which is almost identical to S. 288, as reported out of the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, provides a \nnecessary cure to a constitutional deficiency, as defined by the \nFederal courts, in the structure of the Airports Authority. The \nAirports Authority is involved in the operations and improvements of \nour two airports that serve the Nation's Capital and the Washington \nregion, again, Washington National and Washington Dulles International.\n  In April 1994, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit found that the Board of Review, made up of current and former \nSenators and Members of Congress, violated constitutional separation of \npowers principles. This was the second time the Federal courts struck \ndown the Board of Review, which was designed to represent users of the \nairports and to preserve some Federal control over them.\n  The Court of Appeals stayed its decision until the Supreme Court had \ntime to consider the issue. The Supreme Court decided not to hear the \ncase in January, and the stay expired March 31, 1995.\n  At this juncture, all Congress is required to do to keep the airports \nin operation is to pass this legislation. Such continued uninterrupted \noperations are essential to the travel requirements of Members of \nCongress as well as all people in the greater metropolitan Washington \narea. It is essential to the economy of this area, Mr. President; and, \ntherefore, I am pleased to submit this.\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\n  We are at a point in the current and projected operations of \nWashington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport \nwhereby if we do not act promptly, the Airports Authority board of \ndirectors will lose its power to take basic critical actions, \nincluding, most importantly, Mr. President, the ability to award \ncontracts, issue more bonds--that is the financing structure--amend its \nregulations, change its master plans or adopt an annual budget. In \nother words, it really is brought to an end in its operations. And this \nis not the intention of the Congress.\n  For this reason, I find it necessary to offer this amendment today, \ndespite my own personal objections--I must say on behalf of myself and \nmy distinguished Governor, George Allen--to the addition of two new \nFederal appointees to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to \nkeep our Washington National and Dulles International operational and \nfunctional.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the inclusion, and \nacceptance by the managers, of this amendment in S. 1994, the pending \nmeasure. Mr. President, I thank again the managers, and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on \nthis piece of legislation, the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 1996, which I introduced. I believe it \nrepresents a solid legislative accomplishment for this Congress and for \nair service to small cities, such as those located in my home State of \nSouth Dakota.\n  This bill, which I commend the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nfor who have worked on it, must pass the Congress before the end of \nthis session. Otherwise, we will not be able to provide Airport \nImprovement Program [AIP] grants to our airports across the country.\n\n  The bill will more than double the size of the Essential Air Service \n[EAS] program to $50 million per year. That will directly help cities, \nsuch as Yankton, Mitchell, and Brookings in my State. The EAS program \nwas the result of an agreement when we deregulated the airline industry \nand Congress wanted to ensure our smaller cities did not lose air \nservice altogether.\n  It also will protect small airports and the way AIP funds are \nallocated. Let us remember that we depend heavily on our major airport \nhubs, but we also depend on a lot of smaller cities to feed passengers \ninto those hubs to make our national air system work. And it is not \njust in South Dakota, it is also in California--Fresno or Sacramento--\nor upstate New York.\n  We must remember that small cities such as Aberdeen, South Dakota, \nwhich recently received a grant to repair its main runway, and others \ndepend heavily on AIP funds. This bill has a fairer formula to protect \nsmall airports if AIP funds decline.\n  Mr. President, this bill also requires a study be prepared on air \nfares to rural and small communities. The price of flying to and from \nsome of these small airports are just astronomically high. For example, \nif you travel from Rapid City to Denver, and then go on to your \ndestination, your flight from Rapid City to Denver may be the most \nexpensive part of your trip.\n  Throughout my State I hear complaints about the cost of airline \ntravel. In some cases, it can cost as much to get to the hub airport as \nit does to fly from the hub to London. I believe this study will be \nvery helpful in assisting Congress in its understanding of what is \ngoing on with the cost of air travel to and from small communities.\n  This bill will also improve aviation security in our small cities \nwithout unfairly imposing burdens and expensive requirements on small \nairports and small airlines.\n  Let me briefly address each of these benefits for small community air \nservice.\n  In 1978, Congress recognized that all cities would not participate \nequally in the benefits of airline deregulation. In fact, Congress \nrealized some of our smallest cities might lose air service altogether. \nTo address this threat, Congress wisely put in place the EAS program to \nensure our smallest cities would continue to have air service. Without \nsuch service, communities such as Brookings, Mitchell, and Yankton in \nmy home State, would be virtually cut off from the national air service \nnetwork.\n  It is very important to these smaller towns that they be a part of \nthe national air service network. With air service as well as \ntelecommunications capability, small communities can grow and be \ndynamic contributors to our national economy. In fact, with the \nadvances in telecommunications, smaller cities are now on an equal \nfooting with bigger cities in terms of attracting industry. Small \nhospitals can do as sophisticated procedures as big hospitals by using \ntelecommunications; and smaller universities can share in research \nprojects with larger universities. Telecommunications capability alone, \nhowever, is not enough. It is critical that small cities also have \nreliable and affordable air service. And that is what this is all \nabout. Make no mistake about it, the EAS program--since it ensures air \nservice to our smallest and most underserved cities--is absolutely \ncritical to the economic vitality of many small communities.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that this bill, S. 1994, will more than \ndouble the size of the EAS program. The $50 million EAS program this \nbill would create will safeguard air service in some small communities \nand permit an expansion of flights in others. It is a solid legislative \naccomplishment for economic development in numerous small communities.\n  S. 1994 also will help promote and maintain some of our smallest \nairports which are critical to adequate air service in small cities. \nThe AIP program has been under significant budget pressure. The amount \nof AIP appropriations have fallen significantly since 1992, and our \nsmall airports have shouldered the unfair, disproportionate burden of \nthese budget cuts. Since AIP funds are often the only source of funding \nfor repairs and safety improvements at small airports, our small \nairports have suffered significantly as a result.\n\n  I am pleased that this bill will correct this problem. We worked long \nand hard on this formula. The bill ensures that if AIP funding \ndeclines, our small airports will be protected and will continue to \nreceive their historic share of AIP funds. This is good policy. It is \nfair policy. And it is very important to small city air service.\n  In addition to expanding the EAS program, and protecting the AIP \nfunding of our small airports, S. 1994 will require a study of air \nfares to small communities. This is very welcome news for South \nDakotans and other small city passengers who unfairly pay exorbitant \nair fares. We need more air service competition in small city air \nmarkets. Hopefully, in addition to highlighting the extent of the high \nair fare problems in small communities, this study will offer new \ninsights on how air service competition in small communities can be \nenhanced.\n  Finally, S. 1994 resisted the temptation to impose expensive security \nmeasures on our small airports and small communities. In contrast, the \nHouse recently passed a provision based on the erroneous premise that \none size fits all in aviation security. The Senate, however, correctly \nrecognized there are thoughtful ways to ensure travelers to and from \nsmall cities have the same level of safety and security without \nimposing the identical, expensive security measures required for \ninternational airlines and major hub airports.\n  A one size fits all approach to aviation security undoubtedly would \nlead to a further deterioration of small city air service. I am pleased \nS. 1994 will improve aviation security for small city travelers without \nhaving the unintended consequence of driving air service out of some of \nour smaller cities.\n  Mr. President, let me make some additional general observations about \nair service. Somehow all this gets tied together.\n  We have on the international front this past year had great struggles \nin helping our major airlines fly beyond Tokyo by ensuring the \nGovernment of Japan recognizes their beyond rights. Similarly, our \nmajor carriers continue to be blocked out of serving London's Heathrow \nAirport and points beyond the United Kingdom. We did, however, secure a \ntruly historic open skies agreement with Germany which is great news \nfor the United States economy and our carriers. The United\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\nStates/German open skies agreement will put competitive pressure on the \nUnited Kingdom and France and ultimately should help to force both \ncountries to agree to open skies accords in the future. We must \ncontinue to put competitive pressure on the British and the French by \nfully utilizing our liberalized aviation agreement with Germany.\n  Let me underscore my great concern with the current impasse in our \naviation relations with Japan. The Japanese continue to wrongly block \nour carriers from serving the United States/Asia air service market via \nJapan. This continues to be a significant problem for Jerry Greenwald \nof United Airlines and Fred Smith of Federal Express. It also is a \nmajor problem for Northwest Airlines, the largest carrier in South \nDakota. I have led efforts by the Commerce Committee to help correct \nthis totally unacceptable situation. Along with my colleagues, we have \nsent letters to the President urging that the Administration stand firm \nin our aviation dispute with the Japanese and accept nothing less than \nfair treatment for our carriers in the area of aviation trade.\n  I intend to continue pressing for fair aviation trade with the \nJapanese. The United States/Asia air service market, as well as the \nintra-Asian air service market, is far too valuable to concede to \nJapanese carriers. It is vitally important to our balance of trade that \nour airlines can use Japanese airports to serve countries throughout \nAsia such as China, Indonesia and Malaysia. Make no mistake about it, \ninternational aviation is an important component of U.S. trade. Our \nnegotiators must continue to treat it as nothing less. It is completely \nunacceptable that our carriers, both passenger and cargo, continue to \nbe blocked out of lucrative air service markets beyond Japan and the \nUnited Kingdom by unfair trade practices.\n  Even when our large airlines are operating thousands of miles away \nfrom the United States, their ability to successfully compete abroad \nhas an indirect impact on their financial ability to serve some \ndomestic markets. In fact, large and small airlines work \nsynergistically to provide air service through code-sharing agreements. \nFor instance, I have had an excellent experience with Doug Voss of \nGreat Lakes Aviation which is a key regional carrier in my home state \nof South Dakota. Great Lakes operates as United Express in South Dakota \nand the success of United abroad has a bearing on the service United \nExpress can provide in small city air service markets such as the route \nbetween Sioux Falls and Rapid City in my state.\n  I have had discussions with airline executives where they say, \n``Senator Pressler, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, can you help \nus gain access to Heathrow or assist us with our beyond Tokyo \nproblem?'' And I say, ``Yes, I will try to help but I have problems \nbetween Sioux Falls and Rapid City where I would like help, and I have \nproblems between Huron and Denver and problems between Yankton and \nMinneapolis,'' and so forth. The more successful our carriers are in \nlucrative international markets, the better able they are to serve less \nprofitable small city air service markets. The international picture is \ntied into the local picture in our country.\n  As far as the national air service picture in this country is \nconcerned, we have only built one new airport since 1974--Denver \nInternational Airport. Even that airport is struggling to complete all \nof its planned runways. Capacity in many airports is nearly full. \nRegrettably, a lack of airport capacity is a barrier to entry for new \nairlines. There are only so many slots and so many gates at our \nairports. Chicago has tried to build a new airport but because of \nenvironmental concerns, neighborhood concerns, and noise concerns it \nhas almost given up. Minneapolis-St. Paul thought about building a new \nairport but got so much local resistance that they have given up.\n\n  The point is our airports are crowded. They are pressing up against \ntheir capacity. It is true advanced air traffic control technology will \nhelp move commercial airliners more efficiently from point to point. \nHowever, airplanes need adequate runway capacity. Also, airplanes need \nadequate access to gates. Without either, the benefit of air traffic \ncontrol improvements will be lessened. The point is we have to make \nsome decisions in our country about building infrastructure or we will \nhave our airlines in a stalemate and not being able to expand. \nSignificantly, newer competitive entrants will be blocked out of \nmarkets and consumers will be deprived of the benefits vigorous air \nservice competition brings.\n  Our airport capacity challenges are not going to go away. In fact, \nthey clearly will escalate as more and more people fly. Currently, more \nthan 1.5 million people board commercial airplanes in the United States \neach and every day. Within the next four years, the number of daily \nboardings is forecast to climb to almost 2 million. We cannot ignore \nour airport infrastructure challenges. We should meet our long-term \ntransportation infrastructure challenges head-on.\n  Airport capacity is but one of many challenges. Aviation is another \ncritically important challenge. Our people expect the finest aviation \nsafety system in the world. I am committed to working to ensure our \ntravelling public receives nothing less than that. Currently, I serve \nas a representative to the Gore Commission on Aviation Safety and \nSecurity. As Chairman of the Commerce Committee, I have held numerous \nsafety oversight hearings this Congress. In fact, we held a closed \nhearing on aviation security just this morning which included FAA \nAdministrator David Hinson. In the past, on numerous occasions we have \nheard testimony from the National Transportation Safety Board, and its \nChairman Jim Hall, who is doing an outstanding job.\n  The point I am making is that all these problems of aviation --\ninternational, national, and local--tie together. We have a very \nchallenging situation to meet the aviation needs of our country both \nlocally, nationally and internationally. This bill before the Senate \nwhich reauthorizes the FAA is a step forward. It is a good bill. It has \nbeen worked out carefully and in a bipartisan manner. It is a key part \nof that big picture that I covered so briefly here. I am proud to have \nworked with Senators McCain, Ford, Stevens and many others. I am glad \nto enthusiastically support this bill and urge my colleagues to do so \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5364\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n        with respect to the auditing of employee benefit plans)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of Senator \nJeffords and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] for himself and Mr. \n     Jeffords proposes an amendment numbered 5364.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROVISIONS RELATING TO LIMITED SCOPE AUDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (C) of section 103(a)(3) of \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1023(a)(3)(C)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new clause:\n       ``(ii) If an accountant is offering his opinion under this \n     section in the case of an employee pension benefit plan, the \n     accountant shall, to the extent consistent with generally \n     accepted auditing standards, rely on the work of any \n     independent public accountant of any bank or similar \n     institution or insurance carrier regulated and supervised and \n     subject to periodic investigation by a State or Federal \n     agency that holds assets or processes transactions of the \n     employee pension benefit plan.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 103(a)(3)(A) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     1023(a)(3)(A)) is amended by striking ``subparagraph (C)'' \n     and inserting ``subparagraph (C)(i)''.\n       (2) Section 103(a)(3)(C) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     1023(a)(3)(C)) is amended by striking ``(C) The'' and \n     inserting ``(C)(i) In the case of an employee benefit plan \n     other than an employee pension benefit plan, the''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to opinions required under section \n     103(a)(3)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974 for plan years beginning on or after January 1 of the \n     calendar year following the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. It will be a great disappointment but I will only speak\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\nabout 5 minutes on this amendment. I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Jeffords and myself, an amendment that does not have anything \nto do with aviation, but we need a vehicle on a bill that is eminently \nsound and is really needed.\n  Mr. President, we have right now $3 trillion worth of pension funds \nthat are backed by ERISA. Of those $3 trillion, better than $2 billion, \nalmost $2.1 billion, are adequately audited.\n  The GAO and the inspector general of the Department of Labor say that \nwe should do away with what is called the limited scope audit. Now, \nwhat is a limited scope audit? A limited scope audit permits a bank or \nan insurance company simply to sign a statement to a pension fund, \nsaying we have $300 million in assets, period. This bill does away with \nthat because we have $950 billion worth of taxpayer funds at risk if we \ndo not modify this. That is what GAO tells us and this bill is what GAO \nhas recommended.\n  Let me just add, this does not require the pension fund to go in an \naudit. I assume a bank or an insurance company will have their own \nauditor. This simply says we need an audit report, not simply a one-\nline statement saying that they have so many million dollars in assets.\n  Let me just read one section here: ``If an accountant is offering his \nopinion under this section in the case of an employee pension benefit \nplan, the accountant shall, to the extent consistent with generally \naccepted auditing standards, rely on the work of any independent public \naccountant of any bank or similar institution or insurance carrier \nregulated and supervised and subject to periodic''--and so forth.\n  So we permit those institutions to use their own audits.\n  I was stunned, frankly, when I heard that we do not have adequate \nauditing on $950 billion worth of employee pension funds. That is what \nthis takes care of. The accounting profession is for it. People who \nhave examined this are astounded that we have not done it before. I \nunderstand the reluctance on the part of the Senator from Arizona to \ntake an amendment that has nothing to do with aviation. But if we are \ngoing to protect the taxpayers on this--and I know my friend from South \nDakota, the Presiding Officer, wants to protect the taxpayers, the \nSenator from Kentucky does, and all of us do--this is a chance to do \nit.\n\n  I hope that this will be accepted when we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, unless anyone has any questions or anyone seeks the \nfloor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that \nall amendments that are on the list submitted earlier under a \nunanimous-consent agreement be filed by 11 o'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, before you rule on that, I want to point out that that \ndoes not preclude extended debate. There are no time limits involved in \nthat. It simply requires that the amendments on the list be filed by \nthe hour of 11 a.m. tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I remind my colleagues that there \nare still a number of these amendments on the list. I believe that a \nlarge number of them have been taken care of in the managers' \namendment. But both the majority leader and the Democratic leader have \nstated that we won't stay on this bill more than an hour or so in order \nto dispense with it and get final passage.\n  I want to also thank, again, my dear friend from Kentucky for all of \nhis help tonight, and, hopefully, he and I will be able to conclude \nthis legislation tomorrow at a very early time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am glad to cooperate with my friend in \ngetting any kind of objections to his unanimous-consent agreement \nworked out. I think we are at a position where, if we just sit down and \nbe reasonable tomorrow, we can move very quickly. I hope that the \nmajority leader will not entertain the notion to pull this bill down if \nwe can't finish it in an hour or so tomorrow. I think there is too much \nin this bill, and we have worked too hard and come too far for that \neven to be considered.\n  I hope that we can go ahead and move this bill and move it \nexpeditiously, and that we are not in a position where we have to do it \nin an hour or hour and a half or 2 hours. On the other hand, I think as \namendments are offered we should attempt to try to limit each of those \namendments by some time agreement as it relates to the amendment being \nconsidered at the time. Or we might work our list. We could work our \nlist tomorrow and see how much time would be needed by each presenter, \nand maybe we could have a time agreement or a UC early tomorrow.\n  I will attempt to look at these amendments and see if there is a time \nagreement. I am going to call some of the Senators and say, ``Your \namendment is in the managers' amendment. There was nothing wrong with \nit, so your name gets scratched.'' So I am going to proceed on that \nbasis and attempt to help my friend and see if we can't secure some \ntime agreements prior to 11 o'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. Mr. President, just to clarify, there \nis also permitted under this UC--because it is not precluded--second-\ndegree amendments that are relevant. So my colleagues, I hope, will not \nmake use of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10662-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families \ncontribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples \nmarried today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it \nis both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the \ncommitment of till death do us part seriously, demonstrating \nsuccessfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. \nThese characteristics make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Truman and Dorothy \nEken of Sedalia, MO, who on August 25, 1996 celebrated their 50th \nwedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we \ncan celebrate a similar milestone. Truman and Dorothy's commitment to \nthe principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10681-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, our friend and colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Hank Brown, will be leaving at the end of the 104th Congress \nafter only one term in the Senate. But, he will nevertheless leave a \nlasting legacy of accomplishment that matches that of others who have \nserved here for far longer periods. I have had the pleasure of serving \nwith Hank on the Judiciary Committee during the last few years. His \nleadership on that committee and his contributions to our sometimes \ncontroversial debates were always thoughtful, analytical, fair, and \nrespectful. He has been firm in his beliefs\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\nand opinions, but never failed to listen and consider those of the \nother members of the committee.\n  Senator Brown has also been an outstanding leader on military, \nforeign policy, trade, budgetary, and a host of other issues. I was \nespecially impressed with his efforts to resolve the dispute with \nPakistan over certain weapons transfers. He was able to forge a \ncompromise between the administration and Congress which serves our \nnational interests as well as those of India and Pakistan. He has \ncovered a great deal of public policy territory during his relatively \nshort tenure in the Senate.\n  Hank Brown was born in Denver, CO, on February 12, 1940. He received \nhis bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in 1961 and his \nlaw degree from there in 1969. He began his career as an accountant. He \nreceived a master of tax law degree from the George Washington \nUniversity here in Washington in 1986, while serving in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The future Senator from Colorado served as a lieutenant in the U.S. \nNavy from 1962 to 1966, including service as a forward air controller \nin Vietnam. He was awarded the Air Medal with two gold stars, the \nVietnam Service Medal, Naval Unit Citation, and National Defense Medal. \nHe served in the Colorado State Senate from 1972 to 1976, where he was \nthe assistant majority leader for 2 years. In 1973, he was named \n``Outstanding Young Man of Colorado.''\n  In 1980, he was elected to the House of Representatives, serving \nthere until his election to the Senate in 1990. While he was in the \nHouse, he sponsored the first wild and scenic river designation for the \nCache La Poudre River, and worked to expand the Rocky Mountain National \nPark. He also sought tougher child support enforcement mechanisms and \nspecialized in ethics issues as a member of the House Ethics Committee. \nLikewise, he has been an outspoken leader in urging Congress to be \ncovered by the civil rights and labor laws it imposed on others. The \nCongressional Accountability Act, which passed the Congress and was \nsigned into law in early 1995, was due in large measure to his efforts \non this issue.\n  Senator Hank Brown has been a true friend to the people of Colorado \nand an outstanding legislator who consistently strived to do what was \nbest for the Nation. His presence will be sorely missed when the next \nCongress convenes early next year, but I join my colleagues in \ncongratulating and commending him for his public service and in wishing \nhim and his family well as he moves on to the next phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10681-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague from Maine, \nSenator William Cohen, will be leaving the Senate at the end of the \n104th Congress. His departure will leave a void for his State of Maine \nand for the Nation that will be extremely difficult to fill. We were \nboth first elected to the Senate in 1978 and will now be leaving \ntogether. He has been a true friend and a wonderful colleague to serve \nwith over these last 18 years.\n  In addition to being an outstanding Senator and leader on a wide \nrange of issues, Senator Cohen is an accomplished poet and spy novelist \nin his own right. Among his books are: ``Of Sons and Seasons,'' ``Roll \nCall,'' ``Getting the Most Out of Washington,'' ``The Double Man,'' \nwhich he wrote with former Senator Gary Hart, ``A Baker's Nickel,'' \n``Men of Zeal,'' which he wrote with former Maine Senator and Majority \nLeader George Mitchell, ``One-Eyed Kings,'' and ``Murder in the \nSenate.''\n  Altogether, Senator Cohen will have served for 25 years in Congress \nwhen he retires. Born in 1940, his father was a baker in Bangor, ME. He \nreceived his bachelor of arts degree from Bowdoin College in 1962 and \nhis law degree from Boston University 3 years later. He later became \nthe assistant county attorney for Maine's Penobscot County and was \nelected vice president of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association in the \nearly 1970's. He was the mayor of Bangor, ME and a fellow at the John \nF. Kennedy Institute of Politics. He was elected to the 93d Congress on \nNovember 7, 1972, and served in the House until his election to the \nSenate 6 years later.\n  As a Member of Congress, William Cohen has not been afraid to break \nwith his party when his conscience dictated it. Overall, he has been a \nleading advocate of a more assertive American defense posture. This was \nhis view long before the defense build-up of the 1980's. As a Senate \ncandidate in 1978, his platform was military preparedness and when he \narrived here, he immediately got a seat on the Armed Services \nCommittee. He opposed the SALT II Treaty, strongly supported President \nReagan's defense build-up, and spoke out against the nuclear freeze. He \ncondemned Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for using chemical weapons \nlong before the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and in July of that \nyear was instrumental in the debate over sanctions against Iraq. He \nserved as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the \nlate 1980's, working closely with its chairman, Senator David Boren. He \nalso served on the Iran-contra committee, on which I served as well.\n  On trade issues, he has been for free but fair trade. He has worked \nto ban the import of underweight lobsters and opposed the American-\nCanadian Free Trade Agreement.\n  Senator Cohen is known as somewhat of a maverick, but there is no \nquestion that he put the concerns of his country and State at the top \nof his agenda. There is a great need for mavericks--really, I should \ncall them independents. There is also no question that his sincere \ninterest and leadership in public policy issues at the national level \nhas led to many benefits for the American people in general. He will be \nsorely missed after he leaves the Senate early next year, but I join my \ncolleagues in wishing him and his lovely wife, Janet Langhart-Cohen, \nwell as he embarks on a new phase of his life. I also look forward to \nreading more of his novels in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10682-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10682-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10682-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment.\n\n       S. 677.

A bill to save taxpayer money by reducing the unnecessary \nincrease in Pentagon spending in fiscal year 1997; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                  pentagon budget request legislation\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we must maintain a strong national \ndefense. There can be no question about that. I believe part of that \nstrength comes from wise use of taxpayer dollars. The $265.6 billion \nauthorized by this Congress is $11.3 billion more than the Pentagon \nrequested. I am offering this bill today to roll back this addon and \nrestore the Pentagon's requested level. It directs the Secretary of \nDefense to\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nachieve this goal by making adjustments that do not jeopardize our \nmilitary readiness or the quality of life of our military personnel.\n  The Secretary of Defense should not have trouble finding areas to \ntrim. This budget adds less than $1 billion for readiness and quality-\nof-life issues. Too much of the rest is for gold-plated hardware and \nquestionable weapons development.\n  Some star wars items, like the space-based laser system at an \nadditional $70 million, or the kinetic energy antisatellite program at \nan additional $75 million, are expensive, destabilizing, and probably \nwon't work. Other items, like the Kiowa helicopter, at an additional \n$190 million have missions that can be filled by other weapons at less \ncost. In this era of tight budgets, when we are slashing other \nprograms, I don't see how we can justify these unwise, unwanted, \nunnecessary and untimely expenditures.\n  Mr. President, this simply defies common sense. The cold war is over.\n  The proposed increase, by itself, is only slightly smaller than the \ncombined defense budgets of North Korea, Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Cuba. I \nthink the American taxpayers are owed an explanation of this excessive \nspending.\n  I would like to know how my colleagues plan to pay for such \nextravagance in this time of constrained spending. This bill will \neither steal from parts of government that are already doing their part \nto reduce the deficit, or it will add billions of dollars to the \ndeficit. We simply can't avoid one of these consequences.\n  Mr. President, let me put the magnitude of this fiscal \nirresponsibility into perspective. The $11.3 billion bonus is almost \nequal to the budgets of the National Institutes of Health and the \nTransportation Department. It's about twice the budget of the Interior \nDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency, and it's almost \nfour times larger than the budget of the National Science Foundation. \nFurthermore, for this amount of money we could fund the Pell Grant \nProgram for 2 years or we could fund the Head Start Program for over \n2\\1/2\\ years.\n  To look at it in terms of my State of Iowa, this addon of $11.3 \nbillion is almost three times the budget for the entire State of Iowa. \nIowans could fund their K-12 education system, some 500,000 pupils in \nabout 380 school districts, for 5 years. At the current spending and \nenrollment levels, the $11.3 billion could fund Iowa State University \nfor 94 years, the University of Iowa for 99 years, the University of \nNorthern Iowa for 166 years, or all three together for 38 years.\n  We simply can't justify this excessive spending, we shouldn't ask our \nconstituents to fork over $11.3 billion for programs the Pentagon does \nnot need or could safely delay.\n  It's time for some fairness. It's time for some common sense. And \nfairness tells us that the Pentagon shouldn't be exempt from our \nefforts to balance the budget. Common sense dictates that we can't \nafford $11.3 billion in addons over what the Pentagon and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff say we need to maintain a strong national defense. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of this commonsense bill to \ncut the deficit and put our priorities back in order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2081. A bill to limit Department of Defense payments to \ncontractors for restructuring costs associated with business \ncombinations; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                     corporate mergers legislation\n\n Mr. HARKIN Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will put a \nmoratorium on taxpayer subsidies for mergers between defense \ncontractors, and give the Government the tools to monitor these deals \nand recoup any overpayments.\n  To quote Lawrence Korb, Assistant Secretary of Defense under \nPresident Reagan in a recent article in the Brookings Review, \n``Remember the $600 toilet seats and the $500 hammers that had \ntaxpayers up in arms during the mid-1980s? Today's subsidized mergers \nare going to make them look like bargains.''\n  Here is what some public interest groups say about the policy:\n  The CATO Institute--``The costs associated with mergers should not be \nabsorbed by federal taxpayers. This is a egregious example of \nunwarranted corporate welfare in our budget.''\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense--``It's time for the Pentagon to drop this \nridiculous `money for nothing' policy.''\n  Project on Government Oversight--``The new policy is unneeded, \nestablishes inappropriate government intervention in the economy, \npromotes layoffs of high-wage jobs, pays for excessive CEO salaries, \nand is likely to cost the government billions of dollars.''\n  In 1993 then Undersecretary of Defense John Deutch made a major \npolicy change with regard to Defense Department acquisition practices. \nHis decision allowed the DOD to start subsidizing defense contractor \nmergers.\n  The taxpayers have already paid $300 million to wealthy defense \ncontractors and the GAO estimates that they will pay another $2 billion \nor more in the next few years.\n  If Deutch's decision was a policy change, as I believe, then the \nproper procedures were not followed. The new policy was never printed \nin the Federal Register and there was no opportunity for public comment \non it, so the contracts written under this policy may be invalid.\n  If it was a clarification of policy, as the proponents claim, then \nthe taxpayers may be liable for paying restructuring costs on mergers \nall the way back to the 1950's. The cost to American taxpayers could be \nstaggering.\n  In either case, the decision involves an interpretation of the \nFederal Acquisition Regulations [FAR] and may allow contractors for all \nFederal agencies and departments to collect such costs. Imagine \nMedicare paying restructuring costs for all Federal agencies and \ndepartments to collect such costs. Imagine Medicare paying \nrestructuring costs for all major hospital mergers. This could add \nbillions of taxpayers dollars to the total cost of this policy.\n  Proponents claim the subsidies save taxpayers money, but the record \non these savings is spotty at best. According GAO studies of two \nbusiness combinations the measured savings are far less than the amount \npromised. In one case the GAO found that ``the net cost reduction \ncertified by DOD represents less than 15 percent of the savings . . . \nprojected to the DOD 2 years earlier when they sought support for the \nproposed partnership.''\n  Moreover, the cost accounting is incomplete and there is no way for \ntaxpayers to recoup the costs when the amount paid to contractors \nexceeds the actual benefit received. The current practice is to measure \nonly costs to the Department of Defense when contractors merge and give \nthousands of hard-working Americans the boot. The costs associated with \nGovernment subsidized social services like worker retraining are not \ntallied. Neither are the costs associated with lost payroll tax \nrevenue. My bill would fix these deficiencies.\n  Although I believe this practice must stop, I realize that is too new \nfor most to make an informed decision about. That is why I am offering \nthis very moderate bill. It will merely put a 1-year moratorium on \nthese payments so that the Comptroller General can give us the tools we \nneed to take a close look at the policy and ensure that the taxpayers \nrecoup any payments in excess of realized benefits. It will also allow \nus to have hearings on this far-reaching policy change.\n  So, again Mr. President, this modest bill will give us the time and \ntools we need to thoroughly examine this policy. I urge my colleagues \nto support this common sense bill so that we can study this issue with \nall the care that it deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 2082. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to eliminate \ngood-time credits for prisoners serving a sentence for a crime of \nviolence, and for other purposes; to the committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                The 100 Percent Truth in Sentencing Act\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last Friday I spoke on the Senate \nfloor about legislation that I am proposing to make Americans safer in \ntheir homes and communities. Today I am formally introducing that \nlegislation, and I wanted to take a few moments to describe in further \ndetail what my bill would do and why it is needed.\n  All of us who are concerned about violent crime in this country know\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\nthat the causes of crime are complex and difficult. I certainly do not \npretend to have all the answers. But there are some basic, commonsense \nsteps we can take to reduce the amount of violent crime in this \ncountry--the first of which is to keep those people that we know are \nviolent criminals off the streets.\n  My bill, the 100 Percent Truth in Sentencing Act, will eliminate the \naward of good-time credits for violent offenders in the Federal prisons \nand require violent offenders to serve 100 percent of their sentences. \nThis is not a punitive action against criminals; it is a preventive \naction against violent crime.\n  Let me tell you why my bill will save lives and prevent violent \ncrime. It does not take a genius to know who will commit the next \ncrime--likely, it will be someone who already committed a crime. One-\nthird of all violent crime is committed by someone who is already know \nto the criminal justice system and is ``under supervision''--that is, \nout on the streets because of parole, probation, or pretrial release.\n  This frightening statistic is not the result of actions by just a few \nhardened criminals. Rather, the majority of violent offenders will be \nrearrested for another crime within 3 years of their release. Fully \none-third of all violent criminals released from prison will be \nrearrested for another violent crime within that timeframe.\n\n  These statistics are well known and undisputed, yet more than 90 \npercent of violent criminals are released early from prison. Back in \n1984, we acknowledged that early release leads to more violent crime \nand, as a result, we abolished parole in the Federal system. But our \nsystem continues to award ``good-time'' credits--essentially, time off \nfor good behavior--to the most violent felons in the system. The reason \nis that good time credits are awarded automatically to almost every \ninmate. In the Federal prison system, every prisoner--regardless of how \nbrutal their crime--receives 54 days of good time per year unless they \nviolate significant prison rules.\n  I could spend hours telling you about violent offenders who were \nreleased early from Federal prisons, but let me tell you about just one \nof them. Martin Link has a long history of brutal, violent crime. In \n1982, he grabbed a 15-year-old girl in an alley in south St. Louis, \nsodomized her, and tried to rape her. In 1983, he forced another young \ngirl into his car, took her to East St. Louis, and raped her. Although \nhe was sentenced to 20 years in Federal prison, he was released in 6 \nyears because of combined good time credits and parole. Soon afterward, \nhe got a year's probation for soliciting sex from an undercover agent.\n  The next year, in 1990, he stole a car, but was still on the streets \nin 1991 when he murdered 11-year-old Elissa Self-Braun while she was \nwalking home from her schoolbus. The same month that he murdered \nElissa, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Link robbed, \nsodomized, and tried to rape a woman he grabbed at a self-service \nlaundry, snatched another woman's purse, tried to rape another woman at \nknifepoint, almost abducted an 8-year-old girl, and held up an ice \ncream shop. If Link had served his full sentence for an \nearlier abduction and rape, none of these crimes would have been \ncommitted and Elissa would be alive today.\n\n  Link is now serving a sentence of life in prison without parole. But \nin my view, the death of little Elissa was completely preventable and \ninexcusable. We know that violent criminals often repeat their crimes. \nAt a minimum, we must take steps to keep violent offenders behind bars \nfor the full terms of their sentences.\n  This bill is not my first attempt to end good time for violent \noffenders. In 1994, I offered an amendment to the Violent Crime Control \nand Law Enforcement Act of 1994 designed to eliminate good time for all \nviolent offenders unless they exhibited ``exemplary'' behavior while in \nprison. My intent was that only those violent offenders who \ndemonstrated that they were rehabilitated would be released from \nFederal prison before the end of their sentences.\n  That amendment was accepted and is now law. Unfortunately, the \nJustice Department has interpreted that provision to mean that violent \noffenders will continue to receive automatic good time credits unless \nthey break significant prison rules. This was not the intent of my \namendment in 1994, and the bill I am now offering clarifies my \nposition: violent offenders should remain in jail until they have \ncompleted their court-imposed sentences.\n  Prison officials tell me that they rely on good time credits as a \ndisciplinary tool. On a recent visit to a Federal prison, officials \ntold my staff that Federal inmates are increasingly young, \nundisciplined, violent, and unpredictable. ``Without good time to use \nas an incentive to control inmates,'' one official confided, ``we would \nfear for the lives of our prison guards!''\n  I am very sympathetic to the arguments they raise. It is the job of \nprison administrators to control inmate populations and ensure a safe, \norderly prison atmosphere. I would not take unnecessary risks with that \nimportant goal. However, it is our job, as United States senators, to \nsecure the safety of those who live outside the prison walls--law-\nabiding citizens taking an evening stroll, or stopping at the ATM \nmachine, or, like Elissa Self-Braun, walking to a school bus from our \nhome. To argue that inmates are too dangerous to keep in jail is \noutrageous and unacceptable.\n\n  I am also skeptical that good time is a necessary or effective \ndisciplinary tool in most cases. Prison officials have a broad range of \ndisciplinary tools at their disposal, including visitation and \ntelephone privileges, recreation time, commissary privileges, and work \nopportunities. Most of these incentives provide an immediate reward, \nwhile the reward of good time credits is not realized for many months, \nand often years, after the desired behavior. I am not a psychologist, \nbut it seems to me that young, impetuous criminals are more likely to \nappreciate an immediate, rather than a long delayed, reward.\n  In fact, statistics compiled by the Office of Justice Statistics seem \nto support this theory. Over the last few years, the incidence of \nviolent misconduct in federal prisons has declined by more than 30 \npercent, even though prison officials no longer have parole as an \nincentive and the amount of allowable good time has decreased from as \nmuch as 120 days per year (prior to 1984) to 54 days.\n  The bottom line is this: early release for violent offenders costs \nlives. Today, there are more than 100,000 inmates in nearly 90 federal \nprisons and in contract facilities across the country. About 20,000 of \nthese inmates are serving time for a violent offense. If they are \nreleased early from prison, 7,200 will be re-arrested for a violent \ncrime within 3 years of their release.\n  My bill, the 100 Percent Truth In Sentencing Act, is the most \nstraightforward, common sense approach that I have seen for putting \nviolent criminals behind bars and keeping them there. Senator Robb \nalready has agreed to join me in co-sponsoring this legislation, and I \nhope all my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``100 Percent Truth in \n     Sentencing Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF CREDIT TOWARD SERVICE OF SENTENCE FOR \n                   SATISFACTORY BEHAVIOR.\n\n       Section 3624(b) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(1) A prisoner'' and inserting ``(1)(A) \n     Subject to subparagraph (B), a prisoner'';\n       (2) by striking the second sentence; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) A prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of \n     more than 1 year for a crime of violence shall not be \n     eligible for credit toward the service of the prisoner's \n     sentence under subparagraph (A).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 2083. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to set forth \nthe civil jurisdiction of the United States for crimes committed by \npersons accompanying the Armed Forces outside of the United States, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\n             the military and civilian law coordination act\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I believe certain elements of the \nU.S. military justice system need to be reformed. For example, current \nconditions contain loopholes that allow military criminals to receive \npay--even after conviction. They allow nonmilitary personnel residing \non military bases who commit crimes to escape criminal prosecution. And \nthey allow military personnel who have committed crimes to be \ndischarged without their criminal records being included in the FBI's \nNational Crime Information Center system.\n  I believe we must close these loopholes.\n  Mr. President, under current law, a soldier sentenced to and awaiting \ndishonorable discharge, remains on the taxpayer's payroll, unless \notherwise ordered by the military court. While in military custody, \nthat lawbreaker continues to collect a paycheck from the rest of tax-\npaying America.\n  Mr. President, this simply should not be the case, in the streets of \nCleveland, Seattle, or Denver, when a criminal breaks the law, he is \nremoved from those streets. When he is allowed to return to those \nstreets, his time in jail will have cost him a few things. Of course, \nchief among these things is his loss of freedom for the period of \nconfinement. But he will also not collect a paycheck while \nincarcerated. We do not pay and should not pay our prisoners for \nserving their time in jail.\n  A Cincinnati man, convicted of rape, burglary, and assault by a \nmilitary tribunal, later collected something on the order of $40,000, \nafter taxes, for serving out his sentence. A Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase airman, convicted of molesting a 4-year-old girl, has collected an \naverage of $4,700 per month while serving out his sentence. Three years \nafter his confession, he had received $148,616 from the U.S. taxpayers. \nHe even received raises while behind bars.\n  There are many such stories, Mr. President.\n  This bill addresses that injustice to the taxpayer. This bill makes \nthat law-breaker serve out the sentence he has earned--at his own \nexpense. It is already enough of a burden that the taxpayer has to pay \nfor the room and board of that prisoner during the sentence, after he \nor she already paid more than enough to train and keep that soldier.\n  The loss of opportunity and earnings should be something the criminal \npays for himself, the taxpayer should not pay for it. When that \nsoldier breaks the law--and in doing so, breaks his agreement with the \ntaxpayer--that should be the end of the taxpayer's responsibilities.\n\n  Once that soldier decides he no longer wants to be a law-abiding \ncitizen, he is on his own, financially and otherwise. Mr. President, \nagain, we should not pay our criminals for serving out their sentences.\n  My bill addresses another important gap in the law. Under current \nlaw, many illegal acts committed abroad by U.S. soldiers or \naccompanying civilians go unaddressed by the military courts. The \nprosecution of these crimes is left to the discretion of a military \ncourt, which often decides to do no more than hand down a dishonorable \ndischarge, unleashing that criminal on civilian society. This should \nnot be the case. Mr. President, there should be no geographical limits \nto the law.\n  This bill guarantees that a soldier or accompanying civilian abroad, \ncommitting an illegal act punishable under the United States Code by \nmore than a year's imprisonment, will be handed over to civilian \nauthorities for prosecution under the United States Code. The military \nshould not be able to rid itself of its criminals at the expense of law \nabiding civilians. These criminals belong behind bars, not just out of \nthe service and back in our streets. This bill will keep them out of \nour streets.\n  There is a final aspect of this bill intended to protect civilian \nAmericans from the actions of enlisted criminals. This bill also \nmandates that when an enlisted criminal is discharged from the service, \nthe military Secretary will turn over to the FBI all the criminal \nrecords of that soldier for inclusion in the FBI criminal records \nsystem. It also requires sex offenders who are discharged from the \nmilitary to submit a DNA sample before discharge so that that sample \ncan be included in the FBI's CODIS system.\n  Again, Mr. President, this is another way to protect the tax-paying, \nlaw-abiding American from dishonorably discharged criminals. Under \ncurrent law, the criminal histories of these military personnel do not \nbecome part of the National Crime Information Center database and the \nFBI's CODIS system. This bill will ensure that they do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Burns \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n\n  S. 2086. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain rules relating to the taxation of U.S. business \noperating abroad, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n The International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \ntoday that would provide much-needed relief to American-owned companies \nthat are struggling to compete in the world marketplace. This bill is \nan attempt to simplify the overly complex international tax rules. I \nwish to thank my fellow cosponsors for their support--Senators Lott, \nBaucus, Burns, D'Amato, Hatch, Hatfield, Gorton, Murray, and Nickles.\n  America's economy is more and more linked to the success of our \nbusinesses in the international economy. That's not a surprise to any \nof us. As the economies of previously less-developed countries around \nthe world begin to expand, and the economic boundaries between our \ncountries become more blurred, it is increasingly important for our \nbusinesses to be able to operate abroad from their most competitive \nposition. Restraining our own companies through redundant and \nunnecessary complexities in our own Tax Code dampens their ability to \ncompete for foreign business. In the end, it only hurts our own \neconomy.\n  There are many factors that affect U.S. world competitiveness--\nfactors over which we have little control. I know our international \ntrade negotiators labor hard to change those factors we can control, \nsuch as barriers to foreign markets and existing agreements designed to \nkeep trade free and fair. This is an issue of importance to me. I have \nsought to open markets for many South Dakota products--wheat in Africa, \nbeef in Asia, and pork products in the former Soviet Union.\n  While we have had some successes in opening markets, barriers remain. \nAnd I intend to push for open and fair trade among all of our trading \npartners. However, we can do more than just open barriers. We can \nreform our tax code in a way that will ensure continued U.S. success in \nthe world economy. If we miss this opportunity, we risk the erosion of \nU.S. international competitiveness as countries with simple, favorable \ntax treatment of businesses lure away American businesses.\n  This is a risk that is very real. A recent report by the Financial \nExecutives Research Foundation found some rather shocking declines in \nU.S. competitiveness. This report found that over the last three \ndecades, the global economy has grown more rapidly than our own \neconomy. This is due, in part, to the recovery of Japan and Europe from \nthe aftermath of World War II, and as a consequence, the United States \npresence in global markets has become less prominent. Their findings \ncomparing the first half of the 1990's with the 1960's found the U.S. \nshare of world GDP has declined to 26 percent--from 40 percent; the \nU.S. share of cross-border investment has fallen to 25 percent--from 50 \npercent; and the U.S. share of world exports has dropped to 12 \npercent--from 17 percent. In 1960, 18 of the world's 20 largest \ncorporations were headquartered in the U.S. Today, that number is a \nmere eight.\n  There is a strong correlation between American corporate \ncompetitiveness overseas and the ability of those companies to continue \nto provide jobs at home. A 1991 Council of Economic Advisors Economic \nReport to the President explained:\n\n       In most cases, if U.S. multinational corporations did not \n     establish affiliates abroad to produce for the local market, \n     they would be too distant to have an effective presence in \n     that market. In addition, companies from other countries \n     would either establish such\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\n     facilities or increase exports to that market. In effect, it \n     is not really possible to sustain exports to such markets in \n     the long run. On a net basis, it is highly doubtful that U.S. \n     direct investment abroad reduces U.S. exports or displaces \n     U.S. jobs. Indeed, U.S. direct investment abroad stimulates \n     U.S. companies to be more competitive internationally, which \n     can generate U.S. exports and jobs. Equally important, \n     U.S. direct investment abroad allows U.S. firms to \n     allocate their resources more efficiently, thus creating \n     healthier domestic operations, which, in turn tend to \n     create jobs.\n\n  Overseas operations are frequently necessary to reduce costs of \nproduction and transportation, and locating facilities abroad increases \nbrand familiarity. Within the United States, export related jobs pay on \naverage a significantly higher wage than non-export related jobs. All \nof these factors combine to strengthen the U.S. parent company and \nbolster our economy here at home.\n  The compliance costs associated with filing a tax return for overseas \nbusiness operations of a U.S.-based company are staggering. My state of \nSouth Dakota is home to the credit card headquarters of Citibank. In \nits printed form, the Federal income tax return form for Citibank \nstands over 9 feet high--taking tens of thousands of hours to complete. \nThe compliance cost burden associated with the foreign source income \ntaxation rules is disproportionate to the amount of tax raised by these \nsections. For example, a 1989 study by the University of Michigan \nOffice of Tax Policy Research, quoted in recent Financial Executives \nResearch Foundation report, states that 39.2 percent of Federal income \ntax costs are attributable to foreign source income, while foreign \noperations represent only 21 percent of assets, 24 percent of sales, \nand 18 percent of employment. And a 1993 survey of 17 large \nmultinationals indicates an even higher percentage of Federal income \ntax compliance costs are attributable to foreign source income (51 \npercent)--indicating that compliance costs associated with foreign \nsource income amount to 8.5 percent of the Federal income tax collected \nfrom this source. In comparison, a European Commission report found \nthat among European multinational corporations, there is no evidence \nthat compliance costs are higher for foreign than domestic source \nincome.\n  The bill I am introducing today seeks to simplify and correct various \nareas in the Code that are unnecessarily restraining U.S. businesses. \nSome changes are areas in need of repair, and some changes are to take \ninto consideration international business operations that exist today, \nbut which were domestic-only or nonexistent businesses when the 1986 \ntax reform laws were implemented.\n  One of the most substantive and important changes included in the \nbill would repeal the so-called 10/50 foreign tax credit basket rules \nthat force U.S. corporations to calculate separate foreign tax credit \nlimitations for each of its foreign joint venture businesses--foreign \nbusiness operations in which it holds at least 10 percent but no more \nthan 50 percent of the stock. Along with creating administrative \nnightmares for U.S. companies that may have hundreds of such foreign \njoint venture operations, these rules impede the ability of U.S. \ncompanies to compete in foreign markets.\n  Today, United States businesses find it necessary to operate in joint \nventures overseas, particularly in emerging markets such as the \nPeople's Republic of China and the former Soviet Union. Such joint \nventures are necessary often times because U.S. investors face \nsignificant local country legal and political obstacles to taking a \ncontrolling interest in foreign companies. This is particularly the \ncase for telecommunications companies and other regulated businesses. \nWhile such joint ventures are thus necessary for U.S. companies to \nenter and compete in foreign markets, our current tax law acts to \ndiscourage such operations.\n  Our bill would eliminate the needless administrative hassles of \ncurrent law and put U.S.-backed joint ventures on equal footing with \ncompetitors from other countries by replacing the 10-50 separate \nforeign tax credit limitation. The proposal would provide for so-called \nlook-through treatment. That is, income from such entities would be \ncomputed for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation based on the \nunderlying character of the income earned by such corporations, as is \nthe case for income earned through controlled foreign corporations.\n\n  Another important correction to current rules relates to Foreign \nSales Corporation [FSC] treatment for software. Ten years ago we did \nnot have the level of software exports that we do today, and because \nthe tax laws have not kept up with the changes in the high-technology \nbusiness world, software exports are currently discriminated against by \nour own Tax Code. This bill would provide a legislative modification to \nthe FSC statute to provide the same tax benefits for licenses of \ncomputer software as are currently available for films, records, and \ntapes. The United States is currently the world leader in software \ndevelopment, employing approximately 400,000 people in high-paying \nsoftware development and servicing jobs. Much of the growth experienced \nby this industry is due to increased exports. The denial of the \nbenefits of the FSC rules to software sold overseas ultimately harms \nthe U.S. economy by constructing an impediment to the competitiveness \nof U.S. manufactured software. If theses exports are not given FSC \nbenefits, many of these jobs could eventually move to other countries. \nThe potential loss of these jobs would hurt our economy. My bill \ncorrects this inequity.\n  The goal of the international tax simplification for American \ncompetitiveness bill is to give fair tax treatment to American \ncompanies who operate abroad. This bill is truly a technical correction \nand simplification bill designed to correct inequities in our Code and \nto help place U.S. companies on a level playing field with their \nforeign competitors. Without these corrections, American companies will \nlose ground vis-a-vis their foreign counterparts, which will weaken \ntheir ability to operate successfully at home and harm our Nation's \neconomic potential. Americans are the most creative and competitive \nworkers in the world, and releasing them from unnecessary constraints \nat home will help us maintain our economic lead in the world \nmarketplace--guaranteeing quality, high-paying jobs at home and a \nstronger national economy.\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Pressler, as an original cosponsor of the \nInternational Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act. This \nimportant bill will begin the process of dismantling tax barriers that \nhinder American businesses who find themselves in an increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace. Although American firms have succeeded \nto date in spite of the current complexity and unfairness of our \ninternational tax regime, the added costs imposed by our tax rules take \ntheir toll. We must move to identify and eliminate those harmful and \nunnecessary provisions that stand in the way of a continuing leadership \nrole for American business in world markets.\n  New York is home to many industries that are driven by global \ncompetition. Industries like the securities and banking industries, \ncomputer and other high technology firms, and countless other \nbusinesses in my State must have fair treatment at home in order to \ncompete effectively abroad. For example, during the last decade the \nsecurities industry has been transformed from a largely domestic-\noriented industry to an industry in which U.S. and international \nfinancial institutions compete against each other in the principal \ncapital markets around the world. U.S.-based securities firms are \nrecognized leaders in their industry worldwide. Maintaining this \nposition is important not only for these firms, but also for their U.S. \nemployees and for their U.S. customers who benefit from the innovative \nproducts and services offered by U.S.-based securities firms.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, U.S. tax law has failed to keep pace \nwith the rapid changes in the world economy. The international \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code were last substantially debated \nand revised in 1986. And in many cases, our foreign competitors operate \nunder simpler, fairer, and more logical tax regimes. This mismatch \nbetween commercial reality and the U.S. Tax Code creates a structural \nbias against the international activities of U.S. companies. This \ncannot and should not be allowed to continue.\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\n  The International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act \nacknowledges and addresses a number of problems our tax laws create for \nAmerican businesses facing increasing global competition. This bill \nrepresents an important step toward correcting complexities of the \nantideferral rules under subpart F, including their inappropriate \napplication to active financing income of bona fide financial \ninstitutions and the current definition of investment in U.S. property, \nand excessive limitations on the use of foreign tax credits.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. business community has had significant input \nin the development of this bill. This proposed legislation now will be \nevaluated and studied, and I welcome suggestions for its further \nimprovement. It is my intention, as our analysis progresses, that we \ninclude other important issues not currently addressed in the bill, \nsuch as the appropriate allocation of interest expenses for foreign tax \ncredit purposes, particularly for highly leveraged entities such as \nsecurities firms.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Pressler on this important \nbill, and urge my colleagues on both sides to become \ncosponsors.\n      Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-\n     sponsor of the bipartisan ``International Tax Simplification \n     for American Competitiveness Act.''\n  In 1997, Congress will take up tax reform. Discussions will range \nfrom replacing the current system to fixing what we have. Many \nMontanans ask me: How should we make taxes fairer for parents who are \nraising and educating their children, encourage our entrepreneurs to \ncreate and expand their businesses, and encourage all citizens to save?\n  Our international tax provisions also need reform. The bill we \nintroduce today is a placeholder to keep international tax reform on \nthe legislative radar screen.\n  As you can tell from the list of cosponsors, Mr. President, a number \nof Members have made contributions to the bill before us. Am I \ncomfortable with every provision in the bill as written? No, I'm not. \nBut I am comfortable every provision in the bill merits our \nconsideration.\n  The Finance Committee will take up tax reform next year. We will \nconsider simplification of the international tax provisions in that \ncontext. I hope that the bill we introduce today will establish the \nparameters from which the Finance Committee addresses the need to \nsimplify our international tax provisions. We will hear from a number \nof witnesses ranging from the business community to the Department of \nTreasury and, no doubt, the language before us will undergo change.\n  We live in a global economy, Mr. President. Many businesses in \nMontana sell products directly or indirectly into that global economy. \nThe international tax provisions should be simplified to make American \ncompanies competitive in the global economy while fairly taxing their \nprofits.\n  I look forward to working with the cosponsors of this bill and with \nthe members of the Finance Committee and ultimately with all of my \ncolleagues in restructuring and simplifying the Tax Code to benefit all \nof our citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2087. A bill to direct the Secretary of the department in which \nthe Coast Guard is operating to provide rescue diver training under the \nCoast Guard helicopter rescue swimming training program; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the rescue diver training act of 1996\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rescue Diver \nTraining Act of 1996. This bill would provide required Congressional \nauthorization for the Coast Guard to expand its current use of Coast \nGuard divers to form a broader search and rescue mission application.\n  I want to acknowledge my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, \nCongressman Gerry Studds, who is the author of the Coast Guard Rescue \nSwimmer Training Program which this legislation amends and with whom I \nhave worked in developing this legislation which he will introduce in \nthe House.\n  The Coast Guard has used its divers, trained at the Naval Diving \nSchool in Panama City, FL, only for salvage operations associated with \nCoast Guard aids to navigation and ice-breaking missions. This bill \nwould authorize the Coast Guard to develop and implement a program to \nextend the use of these highly trained divers to search and rescue \nefforts.\n  Under current search and rescue procedures, the Coast Guard will \ndispatch a helicopter when a ship is reported to be in distress or a \nmarine accident is reported. When it is anticipated that a diver may be \nneeded to assist in a rescue, the Coast Guard uses contract personnel \nwho usually are volunteer policemen, firemen, or local State marine \npolicemen who have had specialized diver training. A call will be made \nto secure the services of a diver, and the helicopter will wait to \ndepart until the diver reaches its station, or it will fly to another \nlocation to pick up the diver--all before it flies to the rescue scene. \nThis often results in the helicopter being delayed--even if only a few \nminutes--in reaching the rescue scene. Sometimes no diver is available \nwithin a reasonable period of time, in which case the helicopter \nproceeds to the scene with no diver on board.\n  The program that this legislation will establish is designed both to \nspeed this process in the realization that, in rescue situations, \nminutes and even seconds can mean life or death--especially in the \nwaters off our northern coasts, and to provide a pool of divers within \nthe Coast Guard. Where a qualified diver is available at a Coast Guard \nstation, a rescue helicopter can load that diver and immediately depart \nfor the rescue situation without any delay.\n  A recent episode in the North Atlantic off Massachusetts amply \nillustrates how the program this legislation would establish could make \na vital contribution. In the early hours of September 5, the fishing \nvessel Heather Lynne II carrying a crew of three capsized. The rescue \nhelicopter was unable to bring a diver with it because none was \navailable when the emergency call was received. After reaching the site \nof the capsized vessel, and determining that a diver was needed, the \nhelicopter had to return to the mainland to pick up a diver. A \nconsiderable amount of time was lost in this process.\n  The Coast Guard is charged with maintaining constant vigilance--to \nprotect lives and property on our waterways and to enforce our \nmaritime, immigration, antidrug, and other laws. In my judgment, it has \nperformed capably and honorably throughout its history, and Americans \nshould take both considerable pride and comfort in that knowledge.\n  It is the Congress' responsibility to provide the Coast Guard with \nthe resources it needs to perform its missions. This legislation will \nenhance the service's resources for its search and rescue mission, and \nincrease its ability to save lives and property. All who use our \nwaterways and oceans will be safer as a result.\n  Mr. President, this legislation should be approved by the Congress as \nsoon as possible--I hope it will be this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rescue Diver Training Act of \n     1996.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESCUE DIVER TRAINING FOR SELECTED COAST GUARD \n                   PERSONNEL.\n\n       The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is \n     operating may provide rescue diver training to selected Coast \n     Guard personnel, under the helicopter rescue swimming program \n     conducted under section 9 of the Coast Guard Authorization \n     Act of 1984 (14 U.S.C. 88 note).\n\n

PERSECUTION OF \n                          CHRISTIANS WORLDWIDE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Coats, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. \nHelms) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 71\n\n       Whereas oppression and persecution of religious minorities \n     around the world has emerged as one of the most compelling \n     human rights issues of the day. In particular, the worldwide \n     persecution and martyrdom of Christians persists at alarming \n     levels. This is an affront to the international moral \n     community and to all people of conscience.\n       Whereas in many places throughout the world, Christians are \n     restricted in or forbidden from practicing their faith, \n     victimized by a ``religious apartheid'' that subjects them to \n     inhumane, humiliating treatment, and in certain cases are \n     imprisoned, tortured, enslaved, or killed;\n       Whereas severe persecution of Christians is also occurring \n     in such countries as Sudan, Cuba, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, \n     China, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Laos, Vietnam, and \n     certain countries in the former Soviet Union, to name merely \n     a few;\n       Whereas religious liberty is a universal right explicitly \n     recognized in numerous international agreements, including \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II recently sounded a call against \n     regimes that ``practice discrimination against Jews, \n     Christians, and other religious groups, going even so far as \n     to refuse them the right to meet in private for prayer,'' \n     declaring that ``this is an intolerable and unjustifiable \n     violation not only of all the norms of current international \n     law, but of the most fundamental human freedom, that of \n     practicing one's faith openly,'' stating that this is for \n     human beings ``their reason for living'';\n       Whereas the National Association of Evangelicals in January \n     1996 issued a ``Statement of Conscience and Call to Action,'' \n     subsequently commended or endorsed by the Southern Baptist \n     Convention, the Executive Council of the Episcopal Church, \n     and the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. \n     They pledged to end their ``silence in the face of the \n     suffering of all those persecuted for their religious faith'' \n     and ``to do what is in our power to the end that the \n     government of the United States will take appropriate action \n     to combat the intolerable religious persecution now \n     victimizing fellow believers and those of other faiths'';\n       Whereas the World Evangelical Fellowship has declared \n     September 29, 1996, and each annual last Sunday in September, \n     as an international day of prayer on behalf of persecuted \n     Christians. That day will be observed by numerous churches \n     and human rights groups around the world;\n       Whereas the United States of America since its founding has \n     been a harbor of refuge and freedom to worship for believers \n     from John Winthrop to Roger Williams to William Penn, and a \n     haven for the oppressed. To this day, the United States \n     continues to guarantee freedom of worship in this country for \n     people of all faiths;\n       Whereas as a part of its commitment to human rights around \n     the world, in the past the United States has used its \n     international leadership to vigorously take up the cause of \n     other persecuted religious minorities. Unfortunately, the \n     United States has in many instances failed to raise \n     forcefully the issue of anti-Christian persecution at \n     international conventions and in bilateral relations with \n     offering countries; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring--\n       (1) unequivocally condemns the egregious human rights \n     abuses and denials of religious liberty to Christians around \n     the world, and calls upon the responsible regimes to cease \n     such abuses; and\n       (2) strongly recommends that the President expand and \n     invigorate the United States' international advocacy on \n     behalf of persecuted Christians, and initiate a thorough \n     examination of all United States' policies that affect \n     persecuted Christians; and\n       (3) encourages the President to proceed forward as \n     expeditiously as possible in appointing a White House Special \n     Advisor on religious persecution; and\n       (4) recognizes and applauds a day of prayer on Sunday, \n     September 29, 1996, recognizing the plight of persecuted \n     Christians worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10690-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10690-S10691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 293--SALUTING THE SERVICE OF HOWARD O.

KERR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT.\n\n       For fiscal year 1997 and each fiscal year thereafter, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall not recommend that the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission impose, and the \n     Commission shall not impose, as a condition to the \n     modification of the Kerr Hydroelectric Project (FERC Project \n     No. 5-021), a requirement to construct offshore revetment \n     structures in Flathead Lake, Montana.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President; I submit an amendment to H.R. 3662, \nthe fiscal year 1997 Interior appropriations bill.\n  From 1961 to his retirement from the Senate in 1977, Montana's Mike \nMansfield served as Senate majority leader. It was the longest term as \nmajority leader in American history.\n  During these years, the Senate passed the Voting Rights Act, created \nMedicare, passed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, debated the Cuban \nmissile crisis and the war in Vietnam. On all these issues and more, \nMike was a respected national leader.\n  Yet when Mike was asked to reflect back on his years in the Senate \nand identify his single proudest accomplishment, he responded, ``saving \nFlathead Lake from the Army Corps of Engineers.''\n  If you don't know Montana; and you don't know Flathead Lake; and you \ndon't know Mike Mansfield, this answer may come as a surprise. But for \nthose of us who know all three, this is perfectly easy to understand.\n  Located in western Montana, between Missoula and Kalispell, Flathead \nLake is the largest fresh water lake in the United States, outside of \nthe Great Lakes. Surrounded by the Mission Mountains and the Swan Range \nto the west, it is a place of spectacular beauty.\n  And it is also a place that is very much a part of so many \nMontanans--including this Senator. From boating, water skiing, fishing, \nor just sitting around a bonfire along the Lake's shore, Flathead Lake \nis a very special Montana place.\n  The corps had a plan to radically raise the level of this lake, \ntransforming it forever and drowning many of the coves, shorelines, and \nfishing spots Montanans know so well. Montanans liked it just the way \nit was--and we still do today.\n  Yet some folks outside Montana just don't get it. They think they can \nimprove Flathead Lake. And that brings me to the amendment now before \nus.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has asked the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission for approval to construct an 8,700-foot-long \nretaining wall, at the cost of $10 to $14 million, near the north shore \nof the lake.\n  In theory, this great wall would prevent shore erosion and restore \nwaterfowl habitat. These are commendable goals. But the cost of this \nproposal outweighs any possible benefits.\n  The view of the lake from the town of Bigfork, for example, would be \nruined. Boaters would see a neo-industrial monstrosity instead of a \npeaceful shore. It is a bad idea, and my amendment would nip this weed \nin the bud by prohibiting construction of this wall.\n  Frankly, the Fish and Wildlife Service doesn't need to mandate \nlowering the level of Flathead Lake. And it doesn't need to mandate a \nbig concrete slab in the lake to stem shoreline erosion. If erosion is \nproven to be an ongoing and significant problem, the Fish and Wildlife \nService needs to find unobtrusive remedial measures that respect \nFlathead Lake and the people who enjoy it.\n  I believe this is just simple common sense. One Great Wall of China \nis plenty. None of us will ever improve on what the Good Lord did when \nhe created Flathead Lake. Let us admit that right now and pass this \namendment. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10691-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10691-S10708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HEFLIN AMENDMENT NO. 5358\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1994) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \nreauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 409.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this title, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the \n     Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n\n     SEC. 603. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this title and the amendments made by \n     this title shall take effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                     Subtitle A--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 621. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, \n     being one of the few non-defense government agencies that \n     operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while \n     continuing to rely on outdated technology to carry out its \n     responsibilities for a state-of-the-art industry.\n       (2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation \n     system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, \n     with the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. \n     The General Fund contribution of the years is one measure of \n     the benefit received by the general public, military, and \n     other users of Administration's services.\n       (3) The Administration must become a more efficient, \n     effective, and different organization to meet future \n     challenges.\n       (4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it \n     may become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient \n     General Fund contributions to meet the Administration's \n     future budget needs.\n       (5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the \n     national air transportation system by seeking to spend all \n     moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses \n     representing past receipts must also be spent for the \n     purposes for which such funds were collected.\n       (6) The aviation community and the employees of the \n     Administration must come together to improve the system. The \n     Administration must continue to recognize who its customers \n     are and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the \n     system to make safety improvements and increase productivity.\n       (7) The Administration projects that commercial operations \n     will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 \n     percent by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion \n     and system modernization, these needs cannot be met.\n       (8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future \n     challenges and needs cannot be met.\n       (9) The Administration must have a new way of doing \n     business.\n       (10) There is widespread agreement within government and \n     the aviation industry that reform of the Administration is \n     essential to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected \n     growth of aviation within the next decade.\n       (11) To the extent that the Congress determines that \n     certain segments of the aviation community are not required \n     to pay all of the costs of the government services which they \n     require and benefits which they receive, the Congress should \n     appropriate the difference between such costs and any \n     receipts received from such segment.\n       (12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user \n     fees on segments of the industry, an independent review must \n     be performed to assess the funding needs and assumptions for \n     operations, capital spending, and airport infrastructure.\n       (13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and \n     assessment must be performed of the costs to the \n     Administration and the costs driven by each segment of the \n     aviation system for safety and operational services, \n     including the use of the air traffic control system and the \n     Nation's airports.\n       (14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity \n     in that it is a participant in the daily operations of an \n     industry, and because the national air transportation system \n     faces significant problems without significant changes, the \n     Administration has been authorized to change the Federal \n     procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the \n     Administration has the ability to keep pace with new \n     technology and is able to match resources with the real \n     personnel needs of the Administration.\n       (15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-\n     term planning or timely acquisition of technology by the \n     Administration.\n       (16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, \n     personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration will \n     continue to experience delays and cost overruns in its major \n     modernization programs and needed improvements in the \n     performance of the air traffic management system will not \n     occur.\n       (17) All reforms should be designed to help the \n     Administration become more responsive to the needs of its \n     customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.\n\n     SEC. 622. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure that final action shall be taken on all \n     notices of proposed rulemaking of the Administration within \n     18 months after the date of their publication;\n       (2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional \n     review, to establish a program to improve air traffic \n     management system performance and to establish appropriate \n     levels of cost accountability for air traffic management \n     services provided by the Administration;\n       (3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable \n     Administration within the Department of Transportation; and\n       (4) to make the Administration a more efficient and \n     effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, \n     growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling \n     public.\n\n     SEC. 623.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lowell \nMohler of Missouri, who is retiring after many decades of service to \nthe Missouri Farm Bureau.\n  Lord Chesterfield, an English statesman in the 18th century advised \ncitizens to ``Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell \nthem so.'' This advice has been practiced regularly by 20th century \nMissourian Lowell Mohler, from the halls of the University of Missouri \nto the State and Nation's Capitol, where he has advised farmers, \nprofessors, Governors, and Senators. Though Lowell's tenure at Farm \nBureau was slightly more brief than the 20th century, his service on \nbehalf of rural Americans has been immense. His approach is always \nwarm, his counsel wise, his strategy practical, and his word true.\n  Lowell Mohler is truly representative of the Missouri Farm Bureau, an \norganization of members who are characterized by common sense, work \nhard, value initiative and character, and who love agriculture, family, \nGod, and country--not necessarily in that order. He, like they, live by \na more stringent self-imposed code of right and wrong which is an \nexample for all to observe.\n  Lowell also has the typical nonmodern and unrealistic view of \nretirement. He said he is going to retire to spend more time extolling \nthe virtues of the University of Missouri and to farm. He reminds me of \nthe Missouri farmer who came out of retirement to farm and was asked if \nhe was going to work full time. ``No, just 6 days a week,'' the elderly \nfarmer replied.\n  I hope that Lowell will now have some well-deserved time to spend \nwith his terrific family, of which I know he is very proud. He and his \nwife, JoAnn, can grow asparagus and hornets and maybe catch some fish \nat their farm. They can invite large crowds of friends to backyard \nbarbecues and leave the cleanup duties to the coyotes which come up \nfrom the river near his house and clean perfectly the remains.\n  Only Lowell could make the availability of coyotes useful. It must \nrelate to his affinity with members of the media and politicians that \nhe can appreciate coyotes. If he is so inclined, he\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\ncan come to Mexico, Missouri and help me keep the deer away from my \ntree orchards. Maybe we can plant some walnut trees.\n  Lowell Mohler's career climbed heights he surely never expected, but \nhas never lost sight of where he came from, or the conventions and \nneeds of the ordinary women and men who live the life that makes this \ncountry great. His work made rural America better; he left his mark and \nhe did it his way, the Farm Bureau way. He is and will be remembered as \na great American example.\n  JoAnn, thank you on behalf of everyone for sharing Lowell with us. We \nreturn him to you with immense gratitude, and wish you both well as you \nenter this new chapter of your lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10710-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STUDENT-SPONSOR PARTNERSHIP\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Adlai E. Stevenson remarked of \nEleanor Roosevelt that ``She would rather light candles than curse the \ndarkness.'' The same can be said of my dear friend, Peter M. Flanigan. \nI rise to call to the Senate's attention the Student-Sponsor \nPartnership, a program for troubled students that Mr. Flanigan started \nin 1986. Private donors help pay the tuition for New York City high \nschool students whose backgrounds include poverty, poor grades, and \ndiscipline problems so that they may attend Catholic schools.\n  In 1984 Mr. Flanigan promised a class of sixth-graders that if they \nfinished high school he would pay for their college education. It soon \nbecame clear that even this was insufficient incentive for many of the \nparticipants to complete high school, and Mr. Flanigan realized that a \ndifferent approach was needed. He learned that Catholic schools had \nhigher graduation rates, and so concluded that he would help students \nattend such schools by subsidizing their tuition. Mr. Flanigan also \nrealized the importance of providing each student with a mentor to \nprovide encouragement and counsel.\n  This program works; 75 percent of the participants graduate in 4 \nyears, and 90 percent eventually go on to college. These are remarkable \nstatistics for a group made up of troubled students. I congratulate \nPeter Flanigan for all his concern and efforts, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that an article in the September 12 New York Times on the \nStudent-Sponsor Partnership Program be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 12, 1996]\n\n   Private Program for Troubled Students Echoes Catholic School Plan\n\n                            (By Mirta Ojito)\n\n       Two years ago, Sean Kendell Winn was the kind of student \n     who is at the heart of the plan advocated this week by Mayor \n     Rudolph W. Giuliani to send some public school students to \n     Roman Catholic schools.\n       A Bronx student who would get into fights and end up \n     suspended, Sean was accepted by a Catholic school in his \n     first year of high school. Almost all expenses were paid by \n     private donors.\n       ``My life,'' Sean said yesterday, ``is much nicer now.''\n       Sean, now a 16-year-old junior at All Hallows High School \n     with an 85 average, is a beneficiary of a 10-year-old private \n     program, Student-Sponsor Partnership, which was created by \n     Peter M. Flanigan, an investment banker.\n       The partnership, which has helped 825 students enrolled in \n     18 Catholic schools to graduate since 1986, bears striking \n     similarities to a proposal recently made by the Roman \n     Catholic Archdiocese of New York and, since Sunday, backed by \n     the Mayor.\n       Under the Archdiocese's plan, Catholic schools would \n     educate 1,000 of the city school system's worst students, \n     providing both secular and religious instruction. Their \n     tuition would be paid by private businesses.\n       After some board members cited Constitutional concerns \n     about having school employees acting as admissions counselors \n     for Roman Catholic schools, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said \n     yesterday that the Board of Education would not compile lists \n     of eligible students for the program advocated by Mr. \n     Giuliani.\n       But the Chancellor's spokeswoman said that guidance \n     counselors would continue to advise students to seek \n     scholarships to private schools, and would release school \n     records for students applying for scholarships. The public \n     schools have been giving that help to Student-Sponsor \n     Partnership for 10 years.\n       ``We hope that what we are doing could serve as a blueprint \n     for what the Mayor is proposing,'' said Mayree Clark, the \n     chairwoman of the partnership's board, who is the director of \n     global research at Morgan Stanley.\n       Ms. Clark said 75 percent of the program's students \n     graduate in four years and 90 percent go on to college. Omar \n     Antigua, a 20-year-old junior at Carnegie Mellon University \n     in Pittsburgh, is one of them.\n       ``They opened up so many doors for me, I couldn't even \n     begin to count them,'' said Mr. Antigua, the third child of \n     an unemployed immigrant who reared three boys by herself in a \n     tough Bronx neighborhood. ``Where I come from, I'm a \n     rarity.''\n       Mary Grace Eapen, the partnership's executive director, \n     said the program works to make students feel special. ``They \n     want discipline, they want order,'' she said. ``They want to \n     have someone in their lives who expects great things from \n     them, and we do.''\n       Applicants learn of the program through their eighth-grade \n     guidance counselors or community leaders, Ms. Eapen said. \n     Once a student decides to apply, school counselors or \n     teachers supply test scores, a list of the student's \n     weaknesses and strengths and an analysis of why the student \n     would probably not succeed were he or she to continue in the \n     public school system.\n       ``Counselors are very vigilant at spotting the kids that \n     could benefit the most from our help,'' Ms. Eapen said. \n     ``They want what's best for their kids and they know we \n     provide it.''\n       Of the thousands of students who apply every year, several \n     hundred are accepted. This year, 345 new students entered the \n     program.\n       Although the partnership program is similar to the one \n     advocated by the Mayor, it differs in two ways.\n       First, its eligibility requirements are broader: It \n     considers poverty, poor grades and disciplinary problems as \n     qualifications for entry, not simply whether a student has \n     been identified as one of the school system's worst. Second, \n     it provides mentors to guide students in addition to paying \n     their tuitions.\n       The partnership has 1,030 students and but is short 150 \n     mentors.\n       Sponsors pay at least $850 in tuition a year for four \n     years. The rest of a student's tuition, which could be as \n     high as $3,800 is paid by parents, who contribute $30 a \n     month, and money raised from foundations and private \n     businesses.\n       The idea for the partnership came about when Mr. Flanigan \n     realized that it took more than the promise of a bright \n     future to make students finish their education, Ms. Eapen \n     said. More than a decade ago, he promised a class of sixth \n     graders that if they finished high school, he would pay for \n     their college education. Despite the incentive, many students \n     dropped out of school.\n       The schools, he concluded, were failing the students. About \n     the same time, Mr. Flanigan learned that Roman Catholic \n     schools were more successful in keeping students in the \n     classroom, so he shifted his focus and decided to encourage \n     public school students to attend those private schools. To \n     further increase the students' chances of success, he paired \n     students with mentors.\n       The partnership tries to match sponsors with students based \n     on shared interests or experiences, sometimes a difficult \n     goal because most of the students are black or Latino while \n     88 percent of the sponsors are non-Hispanic whites.\n       But most of the time, despite cultural and economic \n     differences, a bond is forged. It happened to Sean and his \n     sponsor, James Jurney, a 26-year-old who went to boarding \n     school, lives at Central Park West and works at Morgan \n     Stanley. Their bond is theater. Sean wants to be an actor; \n     Mr. Jurney is interested in television and films.\n       ``We go to the theater.'' Mr. Jurney said, ``we talk. He \n     tells me about his girlfriends. I'm his big brother. He's a \n     good kid.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10711-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10711-S10712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO KELLY SERVICES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Kelly \nServices on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Founded on October 7, \n1946, in Detroit, MI, by William Russell Kelly, Kelly Services blazed a \ntrail in the office staffing industry. Built on a strong reputation of \ncaring for its customers and employees, Kelly has grown into a Fortune \n500 company. Today, Kelly provides the services of more than 675,000 \nemployees annually to 200,000 customers. With more than 1,300 offices \naround the world Kelly is a major player in the office staffing \nindustry.\n  Recognizing the changing needs of our economy, Kelly has branched out \ninto legal services, full as well as partial office staffing, assisted \nliving, and\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nthe research and development of software for testing and training \nproducts. Kelly's innovative training and testing programs have kept it \nat the head of its industry. The experience of this Michigan company \nshows that hard work and dedication to quality service and integrity \npave the road to success.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that Kelly Services, based in Troy, MI, is \npart of the vibrant and growing business community in my State of \nMichigan. The quality and innovation shown by this aggressive \nenterprise under the leadership of President and Chief Executive \nOfficer Terence E. Adderley have been an inspiration to all business \npeople in my State. Through its contributions to area businesses it has \nimproved life in the 37 Michigan communities in which it has branches, \nas well as the communities all over the world in which it conducts \nbusiness.\n  Kelly Services has been celebrating its anniversary throughout this \nyear. The company will host a major event at its headquarters in Troy \non October 7. I would like to extend my best wishes to Kelly Services \nfor a festive celebration and for another 50 years of superior success \nthrough superior service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10711-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to explain why I supported the Employment Nondiscrimination \nAct.\n  In an earlier vote, I supported the Defense of Marriage Act because I \ndo not believe that we should change the definition of marriage that \nhas made the family--a husband, wife, and children--the cornerstone of \nour society.\n  But the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is about a different issue. \nIt is about whether discrimination in the workplace against homosexuals \nis permissible. I supported this bill because I do not believe we \nshould tolerate discrimination of any type in the workplace.\n  The people of this Nation already have decided that it is \nunacceptable to discriminate against someone in the workplace just \nbecause of that person's race, gender, or religious beliefs. I just \ndon't believe that one's sexual orientation is relevant to whether or \nnot they can do a job, and it ought not be a permissible basis for \ndiscrimination.\n  This bill includes substantial protections and safeguards for \nemployers. It includes exemptions for the Armed Forces, small \nbusinesses, religious institutions, and private membership clubs. Most \nimportant, the bill states clearly that it does not protect \ninappropriate or public sexual conduct by any employee, whether or not \nthat employee is homosexual.\n  Some people have said that this legislation isn't necessary, that \nthere is no discrimination against homosexuals in the workplace. I \nwould like to give you just one example of why I think this legislation \nis needed: Ernest Dillon was a postal employee in Detroit, MI. He \nworked hard and everyone agreed he was good at his job. But that wasn't \nenough. When Ernest's coworkers found out he was homosexual, they \nrepeatedly taunted him until one day, while he was on the job, they \nbeat him unconscious. Their harassment continued unabated until he was \nforced out of his job, fearing for his life. Although he went to the \ncourts for relief, there was nothing there to protect him.\n  It is time for our country to decide that we will not tolerate that \nkind of discrimination. This legislation does that. Nine States have \nalready enacted legislation similar to this bill.\n  I have heard from many of my own constituents and from mayors, \nGovernors, religious leaders, corporate CEO's, and others that, \nregardless of their views about homosexuality, they support this bill \nbecause they oppose discrimination in all its forms. I agree, and that \nis why I voted for this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10712-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THANKS TO PRODIGY SERVICE CORP.\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to \nProdigy Service Corp. for responding promptly to the letter sent out by \n19 Senators and myself on August 1, 1996. In the letter, my colleagues \nand I urged Prodigy and several other Internet service providers and \nsearch engines to adopt company policies to block access to bomb-making \ninformation through their services.\n  Prodigy is the first of these companies to respond and I am pleased \nto announce that letter provides some hope in our efforts to curb the \navailability of bomb construction information on the Internet. This \noutstanding company has already begun to offer its customers free \ninstallment of the CyberPatrol access control software program, which \nblocks access to bomb-making information. This generous contribution to \nour Nation's safety and well-being is commendable.\n  While Prodigy's efforts help solve the problem of the wide \navailability of dangerous bomb construction information, the \nCyberPatrol program also demonstrates that blocking bomb-making \ninstructions on the Internet is possible.\n  At this time, I ask that the Senate join me in urging other Internet \nservice providers to adopt similar policies. I ask that Prodigy's \nresponse be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                                      Prodigy,\n\n                                    New York, NY, August 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: Thank you for your letter of August 1, \n     regarding bomb-making information on the Internet. We, too, \n     are outraged by the cowardly, senseless acts of terrorism \n     that have victimized so many innocent individuals and \n     families. We are repulsed by the twisted minds of people who \n     disseminate bomb-making information for reasons known only to \n     them.\n       As you know, bomb-making information is available widely \n     and publicly today through a large number of channels, \n     including bookstores and libraries, and governmental attempts \n     to restrict the availability of otherwise lawful information \n     raise serious First Amendment concerns. Nevertheless, Prodigy \n     tries to strike a responsible balance, providing a safe \n     environment for users to openly exchange valuable \n     information, while enabling them to insure they won't come in \n     contact with inappropriate material.\n       Unlike other media, the online environment does offer an \n     effective way for consumers to exercise control. Earlier this \n     year, Prodigy began offering our members the CyberPatrol \n     access control software program, which they can install on \n     their family's personal computer at no extra charge (Prodigy \n     picks up the cost of the program). This easy-to-use program \n     automatically filters and blocks access to bomb-making \n     information and other inappropriate content on the Internet.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you have any further \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Marc Jacobson,\n\n     Vice President and General Counsel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10712-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10712-S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPEAL OF SECTION 434 OF THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK \n                 OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced \nlegislation to repeal section 434 of the recently enacted Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Section \n434 provides that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or \n     local law, no State or local government entity may be \n     prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or \n     receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS \n     information regarding the immigration status, lawful or \n     unlawful, of an alien in the United States.\n\n  This provision is ill-advised and threatens the public health and \nsafety of residents of New York City because it conflicts with an \nexecutive order, issued by the major of New York in 1985, prohibiting \ncity employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service unless the alien has been \ncharged with a crime. The executive order, which is similar to local \nlaws in other States and cities, was intended to ensure that fear of \ndeportation does not deter illegal aliens from seeking emergency \nmedical attention, reporting crimes, and so forth.\n  On September 8, 1995, during Senate consideration of H.R. 4, the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995, Senators Santorum and Nickles offered this \nprovision as an amendment. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 91 to \n6. The Senators who voted ``no'' were: Senators Akaka, Campbell, \nInouye, Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, and Simon.\n  Four of these six--Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Simon, and the \nSenator from New York--were also among the 11 Democrats who voted \nagainst H.R. 4 when it passed the Senate on September 19, 1995. H.R. 4, \nof course, was later vetoed by President Clinton.\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\n  Last week, Mayor Rudolph W.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nElectropac, a New Hampshire company, in honor of their 20th \nanniversary. On September 19 and 20, a number of employees, \nindividuals, and organizations will gather together at Electropac's \ncorporate headquarters in Manchester, NH, to celebrate their 20th year \nof business. I would like to congratulate everyone who helped this \ntechnology company grow to become the success it is today. The \ndedication and hard work, as evidenced by the growth that Electropac \nhas experienced over the years, is truly unparalleled.\n  Electropac is an independently owned, small to mid-sized company that \nspecializes in manufacturing high-tech printed circuit boards for the \ncomputer, telecommunication, medical instrumentation, and military \nindustries. The circuit boards they produce are state of the art, \ndouble sided, multilayered boards.\n  The Manchester office of Electropac has served as Electropac's \ncorporate headquarters and center of manufacturing operations since \n1980. In addition to being located in Manchester, Electropac has \nexpanded with a prototype facility in Londonderry, and with circuit \nboard companies in Montreal, Canada, and Ste-Catharines, Ontario. At \nthese locations, Electropac employs over 400 people and brings in over \n$33 million in business. This is an enormous increase considering the \ncompany's founder and president, Raymond Boissoneau, established \nElectropac with only one employee and $1,000 in cash.\n  Electropac has been included on a regular basis as one of the top 50 \nand the top 75 privately owned companies in the State of New Hampshire. \nJust this past year, Electropac designed a program with the Manchester \nSchool of Technology that brings students into the company and allows \nElectropac to become their classroom, thus providing students with \nhands-on experience and training in high-tech manufacturing. Electropac \nsupports a number of organizations throughout the State of New \nHampshire including the N.H. Job Training Council, the Manchester \nChamber of Commerce, the Made in New Hampshire Expo, the Merrimack \nYouth Association, and the Merrimack Rotary and Lions Clubs. Among \nnumerous other awards, Raymond Boissoneau has received the New \nHampshire High Technology Council's Entrepreneur of the Year Award. It \nis through his leadership and inspiration that has caused Electropac to \nrise to be the success that it is today. Raymond Boissoneau places the \nresponsibility of the company with the employees, which adds great \nmeasure to the company's prosperity.\n  Electropac's success over the years can be attributed to a number of \nfactors. One factor is the emphasis placed on the level of service and \nquality, rather than on quantity and growth. By maintaining several \nmedium sized operations, Electropac diversifies itself, providing its \ncustomers with efficient and cost-effective service specialities. \nFlexibility is the key to their success in such a competitive market \nbecause they are able to adapt their products quickly to the \ntechnological growth of today's industry. Also, Electropac is the first \nmanufacturer in the United States and only the second in the world to \nprovide a beta sight. A beta sight essentially is a test sight for \noutside companies. Electropac opens their manufacturing operations and \nallows various companies to test new technical products, that are not \non the market yet, using all of Electropac's facilities and machinery.\n  Mr. President, I commend Electropac and its employees for their \nsupport of New Hampshire, and for their contributions as a whole to the \nindustry of America. Electropac is an excellent example of a truly \nsuccessful and dynamic New Hampshire company. Congratulations to \nRaymond Boissoneau and his dedicated employees who have made Electropac \nso competitive in today's technology industry. May you experience \ncontinued growth and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10713-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO JOSEPH J. FRANK\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I congratulate my fellow \nMissourian, Joseph J. Frank, on his election as national commander of \nthe American Legion, at the 78th national convention, on September 5, \n1996.\n  I am very proud that the Legion, the Nation's largest veterans' \norganization, comprised of over 3 million members, will be represented \nby an individual with the kind of dedication, integrity, and commitment \nthat has been Mr. Frank's hallmark.\n  My State is proud of our military heritage, and we revere native \nmilitary leaders such as John J. Pershing, the first six star general \nsince George Washington. Joe Frank, born and raised in St. Louis \nCounty, MO, has achieved another first: he's the first Missourian and \nfirst Vietnam veteran to command the American Legion. I am sure both of \nthese firsts will bring new insights and perspectives to the post.\n  Mr. Frank served in Vietnam in 1968. He was wounded severely and \ncontinues to cope each day with the paralysis which resulted, but these \nwounds have not dampened his patriotism or his commitment to serving \nhis fellow Americans. Immediately after recovering from the wounds he \nsustained in Vietnam, Mr. Frank founded the Crestwood Memorial American \nLegion Post 777, now the Joseph L. Frank Memorial Post 777, renamed in \nmemory of his father. Since founding the post, Mr. Frank has gone on to \nserve as post commander, district commander, and state commander. He \nhas also held several previous leadership positions on the national \nlevel, including national vice commander, chairman of the national \neconomic commission, and chairman of the foreign relations commission.\n  But Joe Frank's service radiates well beyond the American Legion. He \nhas dedicated himself to helping individuals with disabilities through \nhis positions on the Executive Board of the President's Committee on \nEmployment of People With Disabilities, and the Missouri Governor's \nCouncil on Disability. Mr. Frank has also been recognized by the White \nHouse for his service to the Selective Service System.\n  I am confident, Mr. President, that Joe Frank, from my own great \nState of Missouri, will serve his fellow veterans with dignity, vigor, \nand direction. He already has set forth part of his agenda, by \nidentifying three priorities: increasing membership, protecting the \nU.S. flag from desecration, and improving and expanding health care to \nour veterans. Because of my own involvement in the area of veterans \nhealth care through my chairmanship of the Senate appropriations \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over veterans programs, I am especially \ndelighted to recognize Mr. Frank's leadership in this area.\n  It is my honor to join with Mr. Frank's wife, Barbara, his family, \nmany friends, and especially his fellow American Legion members in \nsaluting Joseph J. Frank for providing inspiration and a source of \npride for veterans, Missourians, and for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10713-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10713-S10717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ELECTRONIC FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third time, and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1090), as amended, was deemed read the third time, and \npassed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President: I am delighted that the Senate has today \npassed important amendments to the Freedom of Information Act that will \nbring this statute into the electronic age. Passage of these amendments \nare a tremendous way to mark the 30th anniversary of the Freedom of \nInformation Act.\n  The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the right of \nAmericans to know what their government is doing--or not doing. As \nPresident Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of \nInformation Act into law:\n\n       This legislation springs from one of our most essential \n     principles: A democracy works best when the people have all \n     the information that the security of the Nation permits.\n\n  Just over the past few months, records released under the FOIA have \nrevealed FAA actions against Valuejet before the May 11 crash in the \nEverglades, the government's treatment of South Vietnamese commandos \nwho fought in a CIA-sponsored army in the early 1960's, the high \nsalaries paid to independent counsels, the unsafe lead content of D.C. \ntap water, and the types of tax cases that the IRS recommends for \ncriminal prosecution.\n  In the 30 years since the Freedom of Information Act became law, \ntechnology has dramatically altered the way government handles and \nstores information. Gone are the days when agency records were solely \non paper stuffed into file cabinets. Instead, agencies depend on \npersonal computers, computer databases and electronic storage media, \nsuch as CD-ROM's, to carry out their mission.\n  The time is long overdue to update this law to address new issues \nrelated to the increased use of computers by federal agencies. \nComputers are just as ubiquitous in Federal agency offices as in the \nprivate sector. We need to make clear that the FOIA is not just a right \nto know what's on paper law, but that it applies equally to electronic \nrecords.\n  That is why Senator Brown, Senator Kerry, and I, with the strong \nsupport of many library, press, civil liberties, consumer and research \ngroups, have pushed for passage of the Electronic FOIA bill. The Senate \nrecognized the need to update the FOIA in the last Congress by passing \nan earlier version of this bill.\n  This legislation takes steps so that agencies use technology to make \ngovernment more accessible and accountable to its citizens. Storing \ngovernment information on computers should actually make it easier to \nprovide public access to information in more meaningful formats. For \nexample, people with sight or hearing impairments can use special \ncomputer programs to translate electronic information into braille or \nlarge print or synthetic speech output.\n\n  Electronic records also make it possible to provide dial-up access to \nany citizen who can use computer networks, such as the Internet. Those \nAmericans living in the remotest rural area in Vermont, or in a distant \nState far from Federal agencies' public reading rooms here in \nWashington, DC, should be able to use computer networks to get direct \naccess to the warehouse of unclassified information stored in \ngovernment computer banks. The explosion of the Internet adds \nenormously to the need for clarification of the status of electronic \ngovernment records under the FOIA and the significance of this \nlegislation for citizen access. These amendments to the FOIA will \nencourage federal agencies to use the Internet to increase access to \ngovernment records for all Americans.\n  Ensuring public access to electronic government records is not just \nimportant for broader citizen access. Information is a valuable \ncommodity and the Federal Government is probably the largest single \nproducer and repository of accurate information. This government \ninformation is a national resource that commercial companies pay for \nunder the FOIA, add value to, and then sell--creating jobs and \ngenerating revenue in the process. It is important for our economy and \nfor American competitiveness that fast, easy access to that resource in \nelectronic form be available. The electronic FOIA bill would contribute \nto our information economy.\n  I would like to highlight some of what this bill would accomplish. \nFirst, it would require agencies to provide records in a requested \nformat whenever possible.\n  Second, the bill would encourage agencies to increase on-line access \nto government records that agencies currently put in their public \nreading rooms. These records would include copies of records that are \nthe subject of repeated FOIA requests.\n  Finally, the bill would address the biggest single complaint of \npeople making FOIA requests: delays in getting a response. I understand \nthat at the FBI, the delays can stretch to over four years. Because of \nthese delays, writers, students and teachers and others working under \ntime deadlines, have been frustrated in using FOIA to meet their \nresearch needs. Long delays in access can mean no access at all.\n  The current time limits in the FOIA are a joke. Few agencies actually \nrespond to FOIA requests within the 10-day limit required in the law. \nSuch routine failure to comply with the statutory time limits is bad \nfor morale in the agencies and breeds contempt by citizens who expect \ngovernment officials to abide by, not routinely break, the law.\n\n  I appreciate the budget and resource constraints under which agencies \nare operating. We have made every effort in this bill to make sure it \nworks for both agencies and requestors. Some agencies, particularly \nthose with huge backlogs of FOIA requests resulting in delays of up to \nfour years for an agency response, are concerned that the bill removes \nbacklogs as an automatic excuse to ignore the time limits. We should \nnot give agencies an incentive to create backlogs. Agencies will have \nto show that they are taking steps to reduce their backlogs before they \nqualify for additional time to respond to a FOIA request.\n  While increased computer access to government records may necessitate \nan initial outlay of money and effort, as more information is made \navailable on-line, the labor intensive task of physically searching and \nproducing documents should be reduced. The net result should be \nincreased efficiency in\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\nsatisfying agency FOIA obligations, reduced paperwork burdens, reduced \nerrors and better service to the public.\n  The Electronic FOIA bill should help agencies comply with the law's \ntime limits by doubling the ten-day time limit to give agencies a more \nrealistic time period for responding to FOIA requests, making more \ninformation available on-line, requiring the use of better record \nmanagement techniques, such as multi-track processing, and providing \nexpedited access to requestors who demonstrate a compelling need for a \nspeedy response.\n  All these steps, and others in the bill, may not provide a total cure \nbut should help reduce the endemic delay problems.\n  This has generally been a very partisan Congress. I commend members \nof the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Government \nManagement, Information and Technology, and, in particular, Chairman \nStephen Horn, ranking member Carolyn Maloney, and Representatives Randy \nTate and Collin Peterson, for rising above the partisan fray and moving \nthis legislation in the House. They saw this bill for what it is: a \ngood government issue, not a partisan one. We have worked diligently to \nsort out any differences in the House and Senate bills, and we can all \nbe proud of the final product reflected in both the Substitute \namendment to S. 1090 and the final version of the bill passed by the \nHouse.\n  Even as we have worked on this legislation, new issues about the \ncoverage of the FOIA have surfaced. I refer specifically to the D.C. \nCourt of Appeals case, decided on August 2, 1996, that the National \nSecurity Council is not an ``agency'' subject to the FOIA, despite the \nfact that the NSC has complied with the FOIA for years under both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents. Litigation on this matter \ncontinues and the case may now go to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nClarification of which offices within the White House are ``agencies'' \nsubject to the FOIA may be a matter requiring congressional attention \nin the next Congress.\n  As the Federal Government increasingly maintains its records in \nelectronic form, we need to make sure that this information is \navailable to citizens on the same basis as information in paper files. \nDoing so will fulfill the promise first made thirty years ago in the \nFOIA that citizens have a right to know and a right to see the records \nthe government collects with their tax dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of that \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of Substitute to Leahy-Brown-Kerry Electronic FOIA Improvement \n                             Act (S. 1090)\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the \n     ``Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.''\n       Section 2. Findings and Purposes. The findings make clear \n     that Congress enacted the FOIA to require Federal agencies to \n     make records available to the public through public \n     inspection and upon the request of any person for any public \n     or private use. The findings also acknowledge the increase in \n     the government's use of computers and exhorts agencies to use \n     new technology to enhance public access to government \n     information.\n       The purposes of the bill include improving public access to \n     government information and records, and reducing the delays \n     in agencies' responses to requests for records under the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n       Section 3. Application of Requirements to Electronic Format \n     Information. The bill would add a definition of ``record'' to \n     the FOIA to address electronically stored information. There \n     is little disagreement that the FOIA covers all government \n     records, regardless of the form in which they are stored by \n     the agency. The Department of Justice agrees that computer \n     database records are agency records subject to the FOIA. See \n     ``Department of Justice Report on `Electronic Record' Issues \n     Under the Freedom of Information Act,'' S. Hrg. 102-1098, \n     102d Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1992). The bill would define \n     ``record'' to ``include any information that would be an \n     agency record subject to the requirements of this section \n     when maintained by an agency in any format, including an \n     electronic format.''\n       Section 4. Information Made Available in Electronic Format \n     and Indexation of Records. The Office of Management and \n     Budget has directed agencies to use electronic media and \n     formats, including public networks, to make government \n     information more easily accessible and useful to the public. \n     This bill will help effectuate this goal.\n       This section of the bill would require that materials, such \n     as agency opinions and policy statements, which an agency \n     must ``make available for public inspection and copying,'' \n     pursuant to Section 552(a)(2), and which are created on or \n     after November 1, 1996, be made available by computer \n     telecommunications, as well as in hard copy, within 1 year \n     after the date of enactment. If an agency does not have the \n     means established to make these materials available on-line, \n     then the information should be made available in some other \n     electronic form, e.g., CD-ROM or disc. The bill would thus \n     treat (a)(2) materials in the same manner as it treats (a)(1) \n     materials, which under the Government Printing Office \n     Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (``GPO \n     Access Act''), Pub. Law 103-40, are required, via the Federal \n     Register, to be made available on-line.\n       This section would also increase the information made \n     available under Section 552(a)(2). Specifically, agencies \n     would be required to make available for public inspection and \n     copying, in the same manner as other materials required to be \n     made available under Section 552(a)(2), copies of records \n     released in response to FOIA requests that the agency \n     determines have been or will likely be the subject of \n     additional requests. In addition, they would be required \n     to make available a general index of these prior-released \n     records. By December 31, 1999, this index should be made \n     available by computer telecommunications. Since not all \n     individuals have access to computer networks or are near \n     agency public reading rooms, however, requesters would \n     still be able to access previously-released FOIA records \n     through the normal FOIA process.\n       As a practical matter, this would mean that copies of \n     prior-released records on a popular topic, such as the \n     assassinations of public figures, would subsequently be \n     treated as (a)(2) materials, which are made available for \n     public inspection and copying. This would help to reduce the \n     number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records \n     requiring separate agency responses. Likewise, the general \n     index would assist requesters in determining which records \n     have been the subject of prior FOIA requests. Since requests \n     for prior-released records are more readily identified by the \n     agency without the need for new searches, this index would \n     assist agencies in complying with the FOIA time limits.\n       This section would make clear that to prevent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may \n     delete identifying details when it makes available or \n     publishes the index and copies of prior-released records.\n       Finally, this section would require, consistent with the \n     ``Computer Redaction'' requirement in Section 9 of the bill, \n     an agency to indicate the extent of any deletion from the \n     prior-released records and, where technically feasible, to \n     indicate the deletion at the place on the record where the \n     deletion was made. Such indication need not be included when \n     doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption in \n     subsection (b) under which the deletion was made.\n       Section 5. Honoring Form or Format Requests. Section 5 \n     would require agencies to assist requesters by providing \n     information in the form requested, including requests for the \n     electronic form of records, if the agency is able to \n     reproduce it in that form. This section would overrule \n     Dismukes v. Department of the Interior, 603 F. Supp. 760, 763 \n     (D.D.C. 1984), which held that an agency ``has no obligation \n     under the FOIA to accommodate plaintiff's preference [but] \n     need only provide responsive, nonexempt information in a \n     reasonably accessible form.''\n       This section would also require agencies to make reasonable \n     efforts to search for records that are maintained in \n     electronic form or format, unless such search efforts would \n     significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's \n     automated information systems.\n       The bill defines ``search'' as a ``review, manually or by \n     automated means,'' of ``agency records for the purpose of \n     locating those records responsive to a request.'' Under the \n     FOIA, an agency is not required to create documents that do \n     not exist. Computer records located in a database rather than \n     in a file cabinet may require the application of codes or \n     some form of programming to retrieve the information. \n     Under the definition of ``search'' in the bill, the search \n     of computerized records would not amount to the creation \n     of records. Otherwise, it would be virtually impossible to \n     get records that are maintained completely in an \n     electronic form, like computer database information, \n     because some manipulation of the information likely would \n     be necessary to search the records.\n       Section 6. Standard for Judicial Review. Section 6 would \n     require a court to accord substantial weight to an agency's \n     determination as to both the technical feasibility of \n     redacting nonreleasable material at the place on the record \n     where the deletion was made, under paragraphs (2)(C) and \n     subsection (b), as amended by this Act, and the \n     reproducibility of the requested form or format of records, \n     under paragraph (3)(B), as amended by this Act. Such \n     deference is warranted since an agency is familiar with the \n     availability of technical resources within the agency to \n     process, redact and reproduce records.\n       Section 7. Ensuring Timely Response to Requests. The bill \n     addresses the single most frequent complaint about the \n     operation of the FOIA, namely, agency delays in responding to \n     FOIA requests by encouraging agencies to employ better \n     records management systems.\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\n       Multitrack Processing.--An agency commitment to process \n     requests on a first-come, first-served basis has been held to \n     satisfy the requirement that an agency exercise due diligence \n     in dealing with backlogs of FOIA requests. Processing \n     requests solely on a FIFO basis, however, may result in \n     lengthy delays for simple requested due to the prior receipt \n     and processing of complex requests, and in increased agency \n     backlogs. The bill would permit agencies to promulgate \n     regulations implementing multitrack processing systems, and \n     make clear that agencies should exercise due diligence within \n     each track. Agencies would also be permitted to provide \n     requesters with the opportunity to limit the scope of their \n     requests in order to qualify for processing under a faster \n     track.\n       Unusual Circumstances.--The FOIA currently permits an \n     agency in ``unusual circumstances'' to extend for a maximum \n     of 10 working days the statutory time limit for responding to \n     a FOIA request, upon written notice to the requester setting \n     forth the reason for such extension. The FOIA enumerates \n     various reasons for such an extension, including the need to \n     search for and collect requested records from multiple \n     offices, the volume of records requested, and the need for \n     consultation among components of an agency.\n       For unusually burdensome FOIA requests, an extra ten days \n     still provides insufficient time for an agency to respond. \n     The bill would provide a mechanism to deal with such \n     requests, which an agency would not be able to process even \n     with an extra ten days. For such requests, the bill would \n     require an agency to inform the requester that the request \n     cannot be processed within statutory time limits and provide \n     an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of the \n     request so that it may be processed within statutory time \n     limits, or arrange with the agency an agreed upon time frame \n     for processing the request. In the event that the requester \n     refuses to reasonably limit the request's scope or agree upon \n     a time frame and then seeks judicial review, that refusal \n     shall be considered as a factor in determining whether \n     ``exceptional circumstances'' exist under subparagraph \n     (6)(C).\n       Requesters should not be able to make multiple requests \n     merely to avoid the procedures otherwise applicable in \n     unusual circumstances. To avoid the potential problem of \n     multiple requests for purely circumvention purposes, the bill \n     would permit agencies to promulgate regulations to aggregate \n     requests made by the same requester, or group of requesters \n     acting in concert, if the agency reasonably believes that \n     such requests actually constitute a single request, which \n     would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified \n     in subparagraph (6)(B)(iii) of the bill. The aggregated \n     requests must involve clearly related matters. Agencies are \n     directed not to aggregate multiple requests involving \n     unrelated matters.\n       Exceptional Circumstances.--The FOIA provides that in \n     ``exceptional circumstances,'' a court may extend the \n     statutory time limits for an agency to respond to a FOIA \n     request, but does not specify what those circumstances are. \n     The bill would clarify that routine, predictable agency \n     backlogs for FOIA requests do not constitute exceptional \n     circumstances for purposes of the Act, unless the agency \n     demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of \n     pending requests. This is consistent with the holding in Open \n     America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1976), where the court held that an unforeseen \n     3,000 percent increase in FOIA requests in one year, which \n     created a massive backlog in an agency with insufficient \n     resources to process those requests in a timely manner, can \n     constitute ``exceptional circumstances.'' Routine backlogs of \n     requests for records under the FOIA should not give agencies \n     an automatic excuse to ignore the time limits, since this \n     provides a disincentive for agencies to clear up those \n     backlogs. The bill also makes clear that those agencies with \n     backlogs must make efforts to reduce that backlog before \n     exceptional circumstances will be found to exist.\n       Section 8. Time Period for Agency Consideration of \n     Requests. The bill contains provisions designed to address \n     the needs of both agencies and requesters for more workable \n     time periods for the processing of FOIA requests.\n       Expedited Access.--The bill would require agencies to \n     promulgate regulations authorizing expedited access to \n     requesters who demonstrate a ``compelling need'' for a speedy \n     response. The agency would be required to make a \n     determination whether or not to grant the request for \n     expedited access within ten days and then notify the \n     requester of the decision. The requester would bear the \n     burden of showing that expedition is appropriate by \n     certifying in a statement that the demonstration of \n     compelling need is true and correct to the best of the \n     requester's knowledge and belief. The bill would permit only \n     limited judicial review based on the same record before the \n     agency of the determination whether to grant expedited \n     access. Moreover, federal courts will not have jurisdiction \n     to review an agency's denial of an expedited access request \n     if the agency has already provided a complete response to the \n     request for records.\n       A ``compelling need'' warranting expedited access would be \n     demonstrated by showing that failure to obtain the records \n     within an expedited time frame would: (I) pose an imminent \n     threat to an individual's life or physical safety; or, \n     (II) ``with respect to a request made by a person \n     primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to \n     inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal \n     government activity.'' Agencies are also permitted to \n     provide for expedited processing in other cases as they \n     may determine.\n       Expansion of Agency Response Time.--To assist federal \n     agencies in reducing their backlog of FOIA requests, the bill \n     would double the time limit for an agency to respond to FOIA \n     requests from ten days to twenty days. Attorney General Janet \n     Reno has acknowledged the inability of most federal agencies \n     to comply with the ten-day rule ``as a serious problem'' \n     stemming principally from ``too few resources in the face of \n     too heavy a workload.''\n       Estimation of Matter Denied.--The bill would require \n     agencies when denying a FOIA request to make reasonable \n     efforts to estimate the volume of any denied material and \n     provide that estimate to the requester, unless doing so would \n     harm an interest protected by an exemption pursuant to which \n     the denial is made.\n       Section 9. Computer Redaction. The ease with which \n     information on the computer may be redacted makes the \n     determination of whether a few words or 30 pages have been \n     withheld by an agency at times impossible. The bill would \n     require agencies to indicate deletions of the released \n     portion of the record and, where technically feasible, to \n     indicate the deletion at the place on the record where the \n     deletion was made, unless including that indication would \n     harm an interest protected by an exemption pursuant to which \n     the deletion is made.\n       Section 10. Report to the Congress. This section would add \n     to the information an agency is already required to publish \n     as part of its annual report. Specifically, agencies would be \n     required to publish in its annual reports information \n     regarding denials of requested records, appeals, a complete \n     list of statutes upon which the agency relies to withhold \n     information under Section 552(b)(3), which exempts \n     information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by \n     other statutes, the number of backlogged FOIA requests, the \n     number of days taken to process requests, the amount of fees \n     collected, and staff devoted to processing FOIA requests. The \n     annual reports would be required to be made available to the \n     public, including by computer telecommunications means. If an \n     agency does not have the means established to make the report \n     available on-line, then the report should be made available \n     in some other electronic form. The Attorney General is \n     required to make each report available at a single electronic \n     access point, and advise certain Members of Congress that \n     such reports are available.\n       The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget are required to develop reporting \n     guidelines for the annual reports by October 1, 1997.\n       Section 11. Reference Materials and Guides. The bill would \n     require agencies to make publicly available, upon request, \n     reference material or a grade for requesting records or \n     information from an agency. This guide would include an index \n     and description of all major information systems of an \n     agency, and a handbook for obtaining various types and \n     categories of public information from an agency.\n       Section 12. Effective Date. To provide agencies time to \n     implement new requirements under the Act, Sections 7 and 8 of \n     the bill concerning multitrack and expedited processing, \n     unusual and exceptional circumstances, the doubling of the \n     statutory time period for responding to FOIA requests, and \n     estimating the amount of material to which access is denied, \n     will take effect 180 days after the date of enactment, and \n     the remainder of the Act will become effective one year after \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10713-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10717-S10723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMPREHENSIVE METHAMPHETAMINE CONTROL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 566, S. 1965, \nwhich was introduced earlier by Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (S. 1965) to prevent the illegal manufacturing and \n     use of methamphetamine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a number of us have spent countless hours \ntrying to devise a plan to turn back the dreadful tide of \nmethamphetamine abuse which is now beginning to flow westward across \nthe United States, threatening to engulf both cities and rural areas.\n  We have now crafted such a plan, a bipartisan plan which meets those \ngoals, we have introduced as S. 1965, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine \nControl Act of 1996.\n  I rise to ask my colleagues' support for this legislation and for the \namendments to that bill that have allowed it to win near unanimous \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have all seen the recent alarming reports \nindicating that drug abuse has increased during the tenure of the \nClinton administration.\n  Today, the Congress can take an important step to curb our nation's \nrecent backsliding on the drug issue.\n  I am proud to point out that this is a bipartisan measure--I think \nthis is how drug policy should be made--and I wish to thank all of our \ncosponsors: Senators Biden; Grassley; Feinstein; Wyden; Daschle; \nDeWine; Specter; D'Amato; Harkin; Ashcroft; Reid; Kyl; Feingold; and \nMcCain.\n  I wish to thank especially the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Biden, for his help in developing this legislation.\n  I can report to my colleagues in the Senate that the House Judiciary \nCommittee is also at hard work on this issue--they have a markup \nscheduled for tomorrow--so I think it is very possible, indeed highly \nprobable, that we will send a bill to the President before adjournment. \nThat time cannot come soon enough.\n  Two weeks ago, I testified before the House Judiciary's Subcommittee \non Crime, which held a hearing on the meth epidemic. I was encouraged \nat that hearing by the efforts of Chairman McCollum and Representatives \nHeineman, Schumer and Fazio, who are working with us to get a bill we \ncan all endorse.\n  We developed this bill in close consultation with the Department of \nJustice and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Indeed, General \nMcCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, has \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee that he supports our \nlegislation, so I am certain that the President will sign the bill once \nthe House completes it work on this measure.\n\n  Frankly, it is time for this administration to show that the war \nagainst drugs is a top national priority. A responsibility of those in \nleadership positions is to give first attention to the most important \nproblems and this is certainly one.\n  Mr. President, meth is a killer. We know that meth-related deaths are \nup dramatically from 151 in 1991 to 433 in 1994.\n  We know that methamphetamine-related hospital admissions are up about \n300 percent in the last 5 years.\n  Seizures or illegal meth labs are up all over the country and even in \nmy home State of Utah. Illicit lab seizures in Utah increased from 13 \nin 1994 to 56 in 1995. In 1996, there have already have been 40 meth \nlab seizures in my State.\n  Given this pernicious trend, the time to act is now. We must act in a \ncomprehensive fashion and that is what this bill does.\n  S. 1965 increases the penalties for illegal manufacture and \ndistribution of methamphetamine and its precursors chemicals. It also \nincreases penalties for illegal possession of and trafficking in \nillicit methamphetamine.\n  In a careful balance, S. 1965 also reduces single transaction \nreporting requirements for sales of over-the-counter pseudoephedrine \nand phenylpropanolamine products to 24 grams. At the same time, our \nproposal creates a safe harbor for legitimate cough and cold products \nsold in blister packs at the retail level at quantities of up to 3 \ngrams.\n  The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act establishes new \nreporting requirements for firms selling these products through the \nmail, since law enforcement officials have found that mail order sales \nare a significant source of diversion.\n  I believe that education and research are key to efforts to stop drug \nabuse, and our bill contains a separate title which makes them a top \npriority.\n  The bill creates an interagency task force on the methamphetamine \nepidemic which will coordinate efforts across the Government. It \nrequires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop a \npublic health monitoring program, which will collect and disseminate \ndata which can be used in policy development.\n  The bill also established a public-private education program, an \nadvisory panel of Federal, State and local law enforcement and \nregulatory agencies with experience in investigating and prosecuting \nillegal transactions of precursor chemicals.\n\n  As I have said, Mr. President, this bill is the product of long and \nhard negotiations among many parties.\n  None of us are completely comfortable with every provision, but taken \nas a whole we are confident the bill will meet our common goal.\n  An important component of the bill we introduced, as well as the \nClinton administration's proposal, were mandatory minimum sentences for \nmeth dealers. The bill we pass today does not contain those ``mandatory \nminimums,'' due to adoption of the Kennedy-Simon amendment.\n  From my perspective, the Kennedy-Simon language on sentencing will \nnot be as effective as the mandatory minimums that were contained in \nthe original version of the bill. My colleagues should note that this \nbill would not have passed without our accepting the Kennedy-Simon \namendment. The sponsors of this amendment were rather clear in \nexpressing their desire to keep this bill from passing by unanimous \nconsent without the change embodied in their amendment. In the 105th \nCongress, it is my intention to pursue enactment of these penalties. In \nthe interest of passing a bill in an expeditious fashion, I have \nreluctantly agreed to accept the Kennedy-Simon amendment.\n  Another troublesome aspect of the compromise is the manner in which \ncombination ephedrine products are treated. In the bill we are about to \nadopt, such products are treated differently than pseudoephedrine or \nphenylpropanolamine products. The chief difference is that the \ncombination ephedrine products are not permitted to take advantage of \nthe 3 gram, blister pack rule that is afforded to pseudoephedrine and \nphenylpropanolamine products.\n  I do not know of, and understand that the Drug Enforcement Agency \ndoes not know of, any public policy justification for this difference \nin treatment of products. One possible--perhaps likely--result will be \nto decrease the public's legitimate access to these products. I think \nthis is unfortunate, and I hope this provision can be revisited.\n  I would also like to comment on a few of the changes we made in the \nbill after its introduction. These changes are embodied in the Hatch-\nBiden-Wyden-Grassley-Feinstein technical correction amendment.\n  One such change, which I believe is a significant improvement, is to \nprovide guidance of what evidence the Department of Justice may use in \nexamining whether the safe harbor provisions that affect certain \nproducts--those products sold in blister packs in quantities of 3 grams \nor less--are being diverted. We have clarified that isolated or \ninfrequent use, or use of small quantities of these products, cannot be \nused to close the 3 gram, blister pack safe harbor for pseudoephedrine \nand phenylpropanolamine products.\n  As we crack down on those who make and sell illegal drugs we must \nalso balance the interests of the millions of our citizens who benefit \nfrom legitimate over-the-counter drug products. Only if there is solid \nevidence of systemic abuse of 3 gram, blister pack retail sales should \nany further steps be taken that would impede the ability of ordinary, \nlaw-abiding Americans to have access to safe and effective cold \nremedies upon which they have come to rely.\n  We must give the safe harbor provisions a fair test, and that is why \nthe revised bill requires consultation with the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and departmental reporting to Congress if the Justice \nDepartment believes the safe harbor should be breached.\n  Make no mistake about it, without the 3 gram, blister pack provision, \nmany legitimate distributors of over-the-counter products would likely \nchoose not to offer pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine products. \nThis is so because without this safe harbor language legitimate \ndistributors of these over-the-counter products risk triggering the \nreporting and record keeping provisions and criminal sanctions that are \nattendant to regulated sales.\n  At the request of the DEA, we included two important provisions. One \nmakes the effective date of the so-called ``safe harbor'' provision \neffective for products on the shelf one year after enactment. The \noriginal bill had an effective date for products initially introduced \ninto interstate commerce\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\nprior to 9 months after the date of enactment.\n  The other provision allows the DEA to begin immediately upon \nenactment to collect data used to determine if the safe harbor \nprovision should not be retained.\n  I would also like to comment on another critical provision of the \nHatch-Biden-Wyden-Grassley-Feinstein amendment, which is that it takes \nthe unusual step of legislatively overriding a regulation. This \nprovision was made necessary due to the fact that, on August 7, 1996, \nthe DEA promulgated a final rule with respect to certain \npseudoephedrine products.\n\n  The DEA had been involved, almost daily, in the negotiations over the \ndevelopment of the bill prior to promulgation of this final rule. I \ntake the unilateral action on the part of the DEA to issue that rule--\nwithout any notice to the relevant committees--to be unfortunate \nbureaucratic judgment or a snafu.\n  I have accepted the assurances of DEA Administrator Tom Constantine \nthat this was an inadvertent error and that such failure to \ncommunicate, particularly when it could jeopardize good faith work \ntoward a common goal, will not occur in the future.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I plan to continue to work \nclosely with the DEA and Department of Justice as we plan, implement, \nand oversee our Nation's battle against drug abuse. It is important \nthat we work together.\n  Finally, as a result of testimony at the House hearing, we have added \ntwo provisions to the bill. One allows the effective date to be \nextended up to 6 months at the sole discretion of the administration. \nThe second allows manufacturers to petition for reinstatement from the \nlegal drug exemption; the Attorney General may grant such an exemption \nif she finds that the product is manufactured and distributed in a \nmanner which prevents diversion.\n  On balance, I think that these provisions represent a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  We have all strived to keep in mind our topmost goal: curbing \nmethamphetamine abuse. The bill we are considering today meets that \ngoal. It is comprehensive, it is tough, and it is much needed.\n  I hope that we will approve the amended version of S. 1965 quickly, \nso that the House may consider the measure, and we can move it swiftly \ndowntown to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the story of our failure to foresee--and \nprevent--the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most significant \npublic policy mistakes in modern history. Although warning signs of an \noutbreak flared over several years, few took action until it was too \nlate.\n  We now face similar warning signs with another drug--methamphetamine. \nWithout swift action now, history may repeat itself.\n  In July, Senator Hatch and I, along with Senators Feinstein, \nFeingold, Daschle, Grassley, Specter, Harkin, Wyden, D'Amato, Kyl, \nReid, Ashcroft, McCain, and DeWine introduced legislation to address \nthis new emerging drug epidemic before it is too late.\n  Within the past few years the production and use of methamphetamine \nhave risen dramatically. Newspaper and media reports over the past few \nmonths have highlighted these increases. I have been tracking this \ndevelopment and pushing legislation to increase Federal penalties and \nstrengthen Federal laws against methamphetamine production, \ntrafficking, and use since 1990.\n  And what I and others have found is alarming:\n  From 1991 through 1994 methamphetamine related emergency room \nepisodes increased 256 percent--the increase from 1993 to 1994 alone \nwas 75 percent--with more than 17,000 people overdosing and being \nbrought to the emergency room because of methamphetamine.\n  A survey of high school seniors, which only measures the use of \n``ice''--a fraction of the methamphetamine market--found that in 1995 \n86,000 12th graders had used ice in the past year, 39,000 had used it \nin the past month, and 3,600 reported using ice daily. This same survey \nfound that only 54 percent of high school seniors perceived great risk \nin trying ice--down from 62 percent in 1990. And 27 percent of these \nchildren said it would be easy for them to get ice if they wanted it.\n  The cause for concern over a methamphetamine epidemic is further \nfueled by drug-related violence--again something we saw during the \ncrack era--that we can expect to flourish with methamphetamine as well. \nPutting the problem in perspective, drug experts claim that ``ice \nsurpasses PCP in inducing violent behavior.''\n  In addition to the violence--both random and irrational--associated \nwith methamphetamine users, there is also the enormous problem of \nviolence among methamphetamine traffickers and the environmental and \nlife-threatening conditions endemic in the clandestine labs where \nmethamphetamine is produced.\n  The bill the Senate is considering addresses all of the dangers of \nmethamphetamine and takes bold actions to stop this potential epidemic \nin its tracks. Specifically, the Hatch-Biden methamphetamine \nenforcement bill will take six major steps toward cracking down on \nmethamphetamine production, trafficking, and use, particularly use by \nthe most vulnerable population threatened by this drug--our young \npeople.\n  First and foremost, we increase penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine.\n  Second, we crack down on methamphetamine producers and traffickers by \nincreasing the penalties for the illicit possession and trafficking of \nthe precursor chemicals and equipment used to manufacture \nmethamphetamine.\n  Third, we increase the reporting requirements and restrictions on the \nlegitimate sales of products containing these precursor chemicals in \norder to prevent their diversion, and we impose even greater \nrequirements on all firms which sell these product by mail. This \nincludes the use of civil penalties and injunctions to stop \n``legitimate'' firms from recklessly providing precursor chemicals to \nmethamphetamine manufacturers.\n  Fourth, we address the international nature of methamphetamine \nmanufacture and trafficking by coordinating international enforcement \nefforts and strengthening provisions against the illegal importation of \nmethamphetamine and precursor chemicals.\n  Fifth, we ensure that methamphetamine manufacturers who endanger the \nlife on any individual or endanger the environment while making \nmethamphetamine will receive enhanced prison sentences.\n  Finally, we require Federal, State, and local law enforcement and \npublic health officials to stay ahead of any potential growth in the \nmethamphetamine epidemic by creating national working groups on \nprotecting the public from the dangers of methamphetamine production, \ntrafficking, and abuse.\n  The Hatch-Biden bill addresses all of these needs with a fair balance \nbetween the needs of manufacturers and consumers of legitimate products \nwhich contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals and the need to \nprotect the public by instituting harsh penalties for any and all \nmethamphetamine-related activities.\n  This legislation is the crucial, comprehensive tool we need to stay \nahead of the methamphetamine epidemic and to avoid the mistakes made \nduring the early stages of the crack-cocaine explosion.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch and my other colleagues who share my \ndesire to move now on the problem of methamphetamine. I also want to \nthank the Clinton administration, which also was determined to act now \non this issue and worked with us in developing several of the \nprovisions in this bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting our children and \nour society from the devastations of methamphetamine by supporting this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, S. 1965, to urge its \nswift enactment.\n  Today, the Senate is telling drug dealers that we aren't going to let \nmethamphetamine become the crack of the 1990s. By passing the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, the Senate is taking \ndecisive action to\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\nstem the tide of the methamphetamine epidemic that has sunk its claw \ninto communities in Oregon and across the Nation.\n  I do not believe we are acting a moment too soon. Last year in \nOregon, 52 deaths were tied to methamphetamine. By comparison, Oregon's \nOffice of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs reported that there was only \none meth-related death in 1991. Meth-related arrests are rising across \nmy State: Over the last 5 years in Jackson County, meth-related \nviolations rose 1,100 percent, while in Malheur County, meth-related \narrests jumped 110 percent from 1993 to 1994. In Portland, police \nseizures of meth increased 145 percent from 1994 to 1995.\n  Since this bill was introduced in June, I have met with Oregonians \nfrom across the State who have told me about the need for a tough \nFederal response to the meth crisis. In Medford, I attended a \nMethamphetamine Awareness Conference, where law enforcement officials \njoined with public health experts and other social service providers to \ndiscuss the need for a comprehensive approach to the meth problem. In \nPortland, I convened a round table so law enforcement officials from \nacross the State could focus on how Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement can come together to take on the methamphetamine crisis. \nEverywhere I go, the refrain is the same--the problem is growing, as is \nits grip on our communities.\n  The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act will aid in turning the \ntide against the methamphetamine menace by giving law enforcement much \nneeded new tools to combat this deadly drug.\n  The legislation goes after the source of the methamphetamine \nproblem--the precursor chemicals, often found in legal, over-the-\ncounter drug products, which are used to manufacture methamphetamine \nand its ugly cousin, amphetamine. While still allowing consumers access \nto many helpful and commonly used products containing the precursor \nchemicals, the bill will place significant restrictions on the bulk \nsale of the chemicals, both through the mail and over the counter. The \nlegislation will also increase the penalties for the illegal possession \nand trafficking of the precursor chemicals and the equipment used to \nmanufacture the controlled substances and will allow law enforcement \nincreased flexibility to obtain injunctions to stop the illegal \nproduction and sale of precursor chemicals.\n  This legislation addresses the international trafficking in precursor \nchemicals by imposing a maximum 10-year penalty on the manufacture \noutside the United States of precursor chemicals with the intent to \nimport the chemical into this country.\n\n  Back at home, the bill will increase penalties for those convicted of \npossessing and trafficking in methamphetamine. Penalties for \nmethamphetamine trafficking have been too low for too long, and I hope \nthe enhanced penalties will make drug dealers think twice before they \npeddle their poison. The bill will also ensure that methamphetamine \nmanufacturers who put the life of any person at risk or endanger the \nenvironment will receive longer prison sentences.\n  Finally, I think that all our efforts at enforcing penalties against \ntraffickers and users are going to be for naught unless we work to get \nat the root of the problem, which is the addiction to this deadly \nsubstance. I am pleased that this legislation will expand education, \ntreatment and research activities related to methamphetamine.\n  While the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act will make a \ndifference in the battle against this deadly drug, there should be no \ndoubt that we will all need to remain engaged so we can counter the \nchallenges posed by the methamphetamine crisis and by other illegal \ndrugs, which are eating away at our Nation's youth.\n  I commend the fine bipartisan effort that went into crafting this \nbill. My colleagues, led by Chairman Hatch and Senators Biden and \nFeinstein, deserve praise for their commitment and cooperation on this \nmatter. As we all seek to stamp out drug abuse in this country, I hope \nthe partisan spirit that permeated this bill can be a harbinger of good \nthings to come.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this important and \nmuch-needed bill. Law enforcement officers in my state of South Dakota \nknow firsthand the serious impact the use of methamphetamines or \n``meth'' has had on the State. Easily made from legally available \nchemicals--indeed, instructions for manufacturing the drug can be found \non the Internet--meth is relatively cheap because local manufacturing \neliminates the need for illegal smuggling. Highly addictive and capable \nof producing sharp personality alterations, violent episodes, and brain \ndamage in users, the drug imposes a tremendous cost on our communities, \nfamilies and law enforcement resources.\n  Methamphetamines have been linked with several violent crimes in \nSouth Dakota. In the last year, a contract-killing and a murder-suicide \nwere both attributable to use of this drug. The DEA has registered an \nincrease in the percentage of arrests due to meth in South Dakota from \naround 20 percent of the total arrest rate to 70 percent. And users \noften harm themselves as well. From 1991 through 1994, emergency room \nepisodes caused by use of this drug increased 256 percent nationwide.\n  This bill addresses this emerging drug epidemic by increasing Federal \npenalties and strengthening Federal laws against production, \ntrafficking and use of methamphetamines; increasing penalties for \nillicit possession and trafficking of precursor chemicals and equipment \nused to make the drug; increasing reporting requirements and \nrestrictions on legitimate sales of products containing these precursor \nchemicals to prevent their diversion to illegal use; and strengthening \nprovisions against illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor \nchemicals.\n  I urge my colleagues to provide needed tools to our law enforcement \nofficers by joining the fight against this dangerous drug. We should \nand we must pass this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1965, the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. I am pleased to join \nmany of my colleagues from the Judiciary Committee, including Chairman \nHatch and the ranking member, Senator Biden, as a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is an important step in attempting to halt the spread of \nmethamphetamine across this Nation. Methamphetamine is a dangerous \nsynthetic drug which stimulates the central nervous system and can lead \nto such unfortunate consequences, as death, violent and uncontrollable \nbehavior and severe depression. Methamphetamine is similar to another \nsynthetic drug which appeared in my home State of Wisconsin in the \nrecent past, methcathinone or cat as it is commonly known. Thankfully, \nthrough the hard work of law enforcement, both Federal and local, \nthroughout the upper Midwest, it appears that methcathinone remains a \nrelatively isolated problem. In contrast, however, the use of \nmethamphetamine appears to be spreading.\n  While use of methamphetamine creates responses similar to that of \ncrack cocaine, reactions to methamphetamine have been far more severe \nand longer in duration than those of crack or cocaine. Furthermore, in \nrecent years the purity of this drug has increased, thus enhancing the \npotential for violent reactions among its users. The consequences of \nthis are serious, not only for the user, but for society as well. Drug \nabuse can often lead to crime or violent behavior, possibilities which \nmay be amplified when methamphetamine is involved. A recent national \nconference of Federal, State and local law enforcement indicated that \nlaw enforcement must become prepared to deal with more violent \noffenders who have abused methamphetamine.\n  The re-emergence of this drug can be traced to the early 1990's when \nMexican drug traffickers began to increase their production and \nimportation of methamphetamine in the United States. Although \noriginally produced primarily in Mexico, the clandestine labs which \ngenerate methamphetamine have begun to appear in this nation. \nInitially, the devastating presence of this drug was largely restricted \nto the Western United States, predominately in California and Arizona. \nFor the period of 1991 through 1994, methamphetamine related deaths \nincreased by 176\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\npercent for the cities of Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, and San \nFrancisco. In the city of Phoenix the number of methamphetamine related \nemergency room incidents increased by 370 percent for that same 4-year \nperiod. Nationwide, the number of emergency room incidents increased \n350 percent from 1991 to 1994. While originally restricted to the \nwestern part of the United States, it appears that the drug has begun \nan eastward migration to parts of the Midwest. Mr. President, there can \nbe no doubt that the consequences of using this drug are serious. We \nmust take steps to address this growing problem and this legislation \ndoes just that.\n  S. 1965 includes provisions to strengthen and enhance penalties for \nthe trafficking of methamphetamine. It increases penalties for the \nillegal possession and trafficking of precursor chemicals, those \nchemicals which are used to produce this deadly drug. The bill \nincreases penalties for the illegal manufacture and possession of \nequipment used to construct the clandestine labs which generate \nmethamphetamine and other controlled substances. Another troubling \nfacet of this drug, which this bill addresses, is that the labs which \nproduce this drug often pour volatile and lethal chemicals into the \nenvironment. This bill increases the penalties for those individuals \nwho endanger the lives of innocent people and law enforcement as well \nas threaten the environment by operating these labs.\n  Because many of the components of methamphetamine are products which \nare otherwise legally available, the bill tightens restrictions on the \nsale and importation of the precursor chemicals used by methamphetamine \ntraffickers. It enhances reporting requirements for pseudoephedrine or \nphenylpropanolamine, both important components in the production of \nmethamphetamine. In short, Mr. President, in addition to punishing \nthose individuals who market in this deadly drug, the bill addresses \nthe important issue of regulating precursor chemicals which are \nessential to drug traffickers. Finally Mr. President, this legislation \nestablishes an interagency task force to visit the growing problem of \nmethamphetamine abuse and develop and implement a national strategy of \neducation, prevention, and treatment. Further, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services is charged with monitoring the level of \nmethamphetamine abuse in the United States in order to assist public \nhealth officials in developing responses to this problem.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, the problems of drug which confront this \nNation are complex and challenging. It will require a long-term \ncommitment by all of us. We must coordinate law enforcement and tough \nsanctions with effective and adequately funded education, prevention \nand treatment initiatives. This legislation is clearly just one portion \nof what must be a larger approach to the issue of drug abuse, but it \nis, in my opinion, an important and necessary step in addressing the \nconsequences of methamphetamine. I want to again thank the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and Senator Hatch for their leadership on this \nbill. I am proud to join them in this effort and pleased that the \nSenate has chosen to adopt this important legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, I am pleased that the Senate \nis acting quickly to take this important step in our fight against \ndrugs. Meth is destroying lives, families, and communities across Iowa \nand across the country. Just last week Des Moines police reported that \nmarijuana use in the city is on the rise and that the increase is being \ndriven by the popularity of methamphetamine. For Iowa, and many other \nStates, this bill passage of this legislation can't come fast enough.\n  As Iowa's new drug of choice, meth has left no part of our State \nuntouched. In a word, meth is poison. This dangerous and popular drug \nis cheap and easy to access. In Iowa, the street price for one gram of \nmeth is $100, similar to that of cocaine. However, unlike cocaine whose \neffects last about 20 minutes, one quarter of a gram of meth will last \nabout 12 to 14 hours. A leading Iowa doctor referred to meth as ``the \nmost malignant, addictive drug known to mankind.''\n  There is no doubt that the time for this legislation is now. Federal \nmethamphetamine investigations have doubled and meth arrests have more \nthan tripled over the past 2 years. The Division of Iowa Narcotics \nEnforcement reported a nearly 400 percent increase in meth seizures in \na one year period. And in our largest city, Des Moines, meth seizures \nincreased more than 4,000 percent.\n  The legislation we are passing today takes bold actions to help \nStates like Iowa fight back. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine \nEnforcement Act stiffens penalties for the possession and trafficking \nof this deadly poison and cracks down on producers and traffickers by \nincreasing penalties for the illicit possession of the chemicals and \nequipment used to manufacture methamphetamine. The bill increases \nrestrictions and reporting requirements on companies who supply the \ningredients for its production and creates national working groups \ncomprised of public health officials and local law enforcement to \ndevelop strategies to continue to fight this budding epidemic.\n  Iowans have worked hard to cultivate a good quality of life. They \nhave worked hard to make their communities a place to raise a family, a \nsafe place, a decent place. But meth producers and dealers are peddling \npoison and wreaking havoc on small towns and communities across our \nState.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senators Hatch and Biden, the chair and \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure this legislation gets to the President this \nyear.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 5365 and 5366, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered \nread, and agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5365 and 5366) en bloc were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1965), as amended, was deemed read a third time and \npassed.\n  (The text of the bill will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to say that S. 1965--\nwhat we call the meth bill--has finally passed. I want to thank all \nMembers for letting this important piece of legislation get through the \nSenate.\n  S. 1965, a bipartisan bill, takes aim at a rapidly growing problem in \nAmerica and in Iowa--the abuse of methamphetamine, known on the street \nas ``meth'' or ``crank.''\n  I am from Iowa--a rural state which most people do not associate with \nrampant crime or drug use. But in Iowa today, meth use has increased \ndramatically. According to a report prepared by the Governor's Alliance \non Substance Abuse, seizures of meth in Des Moines increased an \nastounding 4,000 percent from 1993 to 1994. I repeat: meth seizures in \nDes Moines increased by 4,000 percent. The increase statewide was 400 \npercent.\n  These numbers are scary, Mr. President.\n  And according to the Iowa Department of Public Health, 7.3 percent of \nIowans seeking help from substance abuse treatment centers in 1995 \ncited meth as their primary addiction. That's up over 5 percent from \n1994, when only 2.2 percent cited meth as their primary addition.\n  Why has meth become such a problem? I don't think anyone knows \ndefinitively, but experts have been able to identify some of the \nreasons.\n  Meth is cheap. A meth high lasts for a very, very long time, so you \nget more\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\nfor your money. And perhaps most disturbingly, meth does not have the \nstigma associated with cocaine and crack. Kids know that crack is \ndangerous. But they haven't yet learned that meth is.\n  In Waterloo, Iowa, though, people are beginning to learn this sad and \npainful lesson. According to the New York Times, a 17-year-old Iowan \nwho had been a good boy, descended into meth addiction. His behavior \nchanged for the worse. Last October, this young man checked himself \ninto the hospital because he believed that he had the flu. He died only \ndays later because meth had so destroyed his immune system that he \ndeveloped a form of meningitis. I'll never forget the words of this \nboy's mother: ``He made some wrong decisions and this drug sucked him \naway.'' I wonder how many more young Americans are going to be ``sucked \naway'' before we get a handle on the meth problem.\n\n  Mr. President, what America is facing today with the explosion in \nmeth use is nothing short of an epidemic. Meth is cheap and easily \nmanufactured from commonly available chemicals. Today, the Senate is \nstriking at the root of the problem: Chemical suppliers who sell \nchemicals to illegal meth labs. The harder it is for criminal chemists \nto get the raw material to make meth, the more difficult it will be to \nproduce. This in turn will make it more expensive. And this will reduce \nconsumption. And that will help keep our kids alive a little longer.\n  Importantly, this bill preserves the flexibility of States to enact \ntheir own laws to deal with the manufacture of meth. Some very powerful \nchemical companies have tried to weaken this bill by preempting the \nStates. I think that is just wrong-headed and I am pleased that the \nSenate has rejected this effort.\n  Some of the chemical companies also tried to create so-called safe \nharbors so large that enormous bulk purchases of meth ingredients would \nnever have to be reported to the DEA. That means criminals could go to \nthe corner drugstore, purchase legal products like pseudoephedrine in \nlarge quantities and make poison with no one the wiser. And then that \npoison is sold to our kids.\n  While the Senate has had to make some compromises I wouldn't have \nwanted to make in a perfect world--like the blister-pack exception for \npseudoephedrine--I think that this bill represents a major step \nforward.\n  This is a good, strong bill and I'm proud that it has passed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I especially want to take my hat off to \nSenator Feinstein for her work on this bill. More than any other \nSenator, Dianne Feinstein worked tirelessly to make sure that we could \nget the strongest possible meth bill. I just want the American people \nto know what a tremendous job she's done.\n  Mr. President, in the 1980's, we almost lost a generation to crack \nand powder cocaine. Let's not get that close to the edge again. I'm \nproud that the Senate today has stood up to the chemical companies, \nstood up to the drug dealers and passed this crucial piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10717-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING THE CAPITOL GUIDE SERVICE TO ACCEPT VOLUNTARY SERVICES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Res. 71\n\n       Whereas oppression and persecution of religious minorities \n     around the world has emerged as one of the most compelling \n     human rights issues of the day. In particular, the worldwide \n     persecution and martyrdom of Christians persists at alarming \n     levels. This is an affront to the international moral \n     community and to all people of conscience.\n       Whereas in many places throughout the world, Christians are \n     restricted in or forbidden from practicing their faith, \n     victimized by a ``religious apartheid'' that subjects them to \n     inhumane, humiliating treatment, and in certain cases are \n     imprisoned, tortured, enslaved, or killed;\n       Whereas severe persecution of Christians is also occurring \n     in such countries as Sudan, Cuba, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, \n     China, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Laos, Vietnam, and \n     certain countries in the former Soviet Union, to name merely \n     a few;\n       Whereas religious liberty is a universal right explicitly \n     recognized in numerous international agreements, including \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       Whereas Pope John Paul II recently sounded a call against \n     regimes that ``practice discrimination against Jews, \n     Christians, and other religious groups, going even so far as \n     to refuse them the right to meet in private for prayer,'' \n     declaring that ``this is an intolerable and unjustifiable \n     violation not only of all the norms of current international \n     law, but of the most fundamental human freedom, that of \n     practicing one's faith openly,'' stating that this is for \n     human beings ``their reason for living'';\n       Whereas the National Association of Evangelicals in January \n     1996 issued a ``Statement of Conscience and Call to Action,'' \n     subsequently commended or endorsed by the Southern Baptist \n     Convention, the Executive Council of the Episcopal Church, \n     and the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. \n     They pledged to end their ``silence in the face of the \n     suffering of all those persecuted for their religious faith'' \n     and ``to do what is in our power to the end that the \n     government of the United States will take appropriate action \n     to combat the intolerable religious persecution now \n     victimizing fellow believers and those of other faiths'';\n       Whereas the World Evangelical Fellowship has declared \n     September 29, 1996, and each annual last Sunday in September, \n     as an international day of prayer on behalf of persecuted \n     Christians. That day will be observed by numerous churches \n     and human rights groups around the world;\n       Whereas the United States of America since its founding has \n     been a harbor of refuge and freedom to worship for believers \n     from John Winthrop to Roger Williams to William Penn, and a \n     haven for the oppressed. To this day, the United States \n     continues to guarantee freedom of worship in this country for \n     people of all faiths;\n       Whereas as a part of its commitment to human rights around \n     the world, in the past the United States has used its \n     international leadership to vigorously take up the case of \n     other persecuted religious minorities. Unfortunately, the \n     United States has in many instances failed to raise \n     forcefully the issue of anti-Christian persecution at \n     international conventions and in bilateral relations with \n     offending countries; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring--\n       (1) unequivocally condemns the egregious human rights \n     abuses and denials of religious liberty to Christians around \n     the world, and calls upon the responsible regimes to cease \n     such abuses; and\n       (2) strongly recommends that the President expand and \n     invigorate the United States' international advocacy on \n     behalf of persecuted Christians, and initiate a thorough \n     examination of all United States' policies that affect \n     persecuted Christians; and\n       (3) encourages the President to proceed forward as \n     expeditiously as possible in appointing a White House Special \n     Advisor on religious persecution; and\n       (4) recognizes and applauds a day of prayer on Sunday, \n     September 29, 1996, recognizing the plight of persecuted \n     Christians worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/17/senate-section/article/S10723-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10724-S10727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THRIFT SAVINGS INVESTMENT FUNDS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
