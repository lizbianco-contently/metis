Mr. President, today, the Children's Defense Fund, a \nwonderful organization--and thank God there is such an organization \nwith a strong voice for children--has issued a report, ``The State of \nAmerica's Children.''\n  I would, for my State of Minnesota, like to release some statistics \nfrom this report on the floor of the Senate and then I would like to \ntalk about what these statistics mean in personal terms for my State \nand for the politics of the country for this Congress.\n  Minnesota's children at risk--this report was issued today by the \nChildren's Defense Fund: 60,615 children lacked health insurance in the \nyears 1989 to 1991--over 60,000 children lacking health insurance; \n27,462 reported cases of child abuse and neglect, 1992--27,462 reported \ncases; 116 young men died by violence, 1991; 48 children were killed by \nguns, 1992.\n  Only 71.4 percent of 2-year-olds were fully immunized, 1990--30 \npercent of children not fully immunized. This is my State of Minnesota \nand, in my humble opinion, that is the greatest State in the country; \n35 percent of 4th grade public school students lacked basic reading \nproficiency, 1992.\n  Those are Minnesota's children at risk.\n  Mr. President, on the back of this report released today by the \nChildren's Defense Fund, there are the following statistics, which I \nhave read on the floor of the Senate before, but this is a new report, \nnew data:\n  Every day in America, three children die from child abuse.\n  Every day in America, 15 children die from guns.\n  Every day in America, 27 children--a classroomful--die from poverty.\n  Every day in America, 95 babies die before their first birthday.\n  Every day in America, 564 babies are born to women who had late or no \nprenatal care.\n  [[Page S4676]] Every day in America, 788 babies are born at low \nbirthweight, less than 5 pounds 8 ounces.\n  Every day in America, 1,340 teenagers give birth.\n  Every day in America, 2,217 teenagers drop out of school--each day.\n  Every day in America, 2,350 children are in adult jails.\n  Every day in America, 2,699 infants are born into poverty.\n  Every day in America, 3,356 babies are born to unmarried women.\n  Every day in America, 8,189 children are reported abused or \nneglected.\n  Every day in America, 100,000 children are homeless.\n  Every day in America 135,000 children bring guns to school.\n  Every day in America, 1.2 million latchkey children come home to a \nhouse in which there is a gun.\n  Mr. President, I would like to, from this Children's Defense Fund \nreport that came out today on the state of America's children, talk \nabout what this means with Minnesota children at risk.\n\n       A Nation that would rather send someone else's child to \n     prison for $15,496 a year, or to an orphanage for over \n     $36,000 a year, then invest in $300,000 worth of immunization \n     and $100,000 worth of prenatal care to give a child a healthy \n     start, $1,800 to give that child a summer job to learn a work \n     ethic, lacks both family values and common and economic \n     sense.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just add that as long as we are going to be \ntalking about a budget deficit and addressing that budget deficit, I \nthink it is time that we also address a spiritual deficit in our \nNation. I have brought an amendment to the floor of the U.S. Senate \nfour times which has been defeated. I will bring it back on the floor \nthis week, especially with the rescissions bill over here.\n  I commend Senator Hatfield, and others, for their fine work in at \nleast restoring some of the cuts for some programs that are so \nimportant. I know that I met with citizens back in Minnesota about cuts \nto the Low Energy Assistance Program. In my State of Minnesota, over \n100,000 households, 300,000 individuals, I say to my colleagues, 30 \npercent elderly, members of household, 40 percent child, over 50 \npercent someone working; this was a grant of about $350 that enabled \nsomebody to get over a tough time, with 40 percent using it only 1 \nyear. People were terrified. I will thank Senator Hatfield and others \nfor not zeroing out that program.\n  As I look at these cuts that are before us, Mr. President, I would \nlike to raise some questions not about the budget deficit but about the \nspiritual deficit. Minnesota children at risk. I will have this \namendment on the floor and I will ask one more time for my colleagues \nto go on record that we will not pass any legislation, take any action \nthat would increase the number of hungry or homeless children in \nAmerica. That amendment has failed in four separate votes, though the \nsupport for the amendment is going up; the last time it received 47 \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, I want to ask the following question: Who decides that \nwe are going to cut child nutrition programs but not subsidies for oil \ncompanies? Who decides that we are going to cut the Headstart Program \nbut not subsidies for insurance companies? Who decides that we are \ngoing to cut child care programs but not tobacco company subsidies? Who \ndecides, Mr. President, that we are going to cut educational programs \nfor children, but not military contractors?\n  Mr. President, some people are very generous with the suffering of \nothers. And it is time that we understand that we should not be making \nbudget cuts based on the path of least political resistance, making \ncuts that affect citizens with the least amount of clout that are not \nthe heavy hitters and do not have the lobbyists.\n  There needs to be a standard of fairness. I will insist on that \nduring this debate. Mr. President, if you will allow me 15 seconds for \na conclusion, over and over again on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I \nwill, if you will, shout it from the mountain top. There will not be \nany real national security for our Nation until we invest in the health \nand the skills and the intellect and the character of our children. \nThat is what this debate is about.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues for their generosity and \ngraciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4675-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4676-S4677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OUR NATION'S STRIKING DILEMMA\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the members \nof the bipartisan commission that concluded its work last year--the \nentitlement commission and the Congressional Budget Office and the \nSenate Budget Committee, and others, who have contributed to my purpose \nand reason for speaking to the Senate this morning.\n  In perusing their work--and we do get inundated with information in \nthis Capital City--but as I was going through the material they had \nprovided, I suddenly fell upon a page for which this chart is a near \nreplica. It has been improved and modified with new information. But \nthis single page riveted my attention, and I think if known, it would \ncommand the attention of every American, every American family, and \nevery American business. It poses for our Nation a striking dilemma.\n  Mr. President, what it points to is this fact and this condition: \nWithin 10 years--maybe 8, maybe 12--the entirety of all U.S. revenues--\nall U.S. revenues--are consumed but by five outlays, five expenditures. \nYou just have to think for a moment of the thousands and thousands of \nFederal expenditures that we accrue each year. When you start saying \nthat, within a decade, I suppose most everybody within the sound of my \nvoice, with God's permission, expects to be here in 10 years. In 10 \nyears, all of our Government's revenues are consumed by just five \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. President, those expenditures are Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, Federal retirement, and the interest on the United States of \nAmerica's debt. Those five things will consume every dime the country \nhas.\n  This chart shows those five expenditures and U.S. revenues meeting in \nthe year 2006, but 10 years away. I believe it will occur sooner than \nthat.\n  But, in any event, on or about this date, we are confronted with this \ncalamity. We were just listening to the Senator from Minnesota talk \nabout a program for children in which he has great interest. The point \nis that if we allow this to happen to ourselves, within 10 years, \nanything the U.S. Government wanted to do either could not be done \nbecause there would be no revenue to do it, or we would have to borrow \nit. In short, we would be saying that to run the U.S. Government, the \nDefense Department, to build a road, a canal, to widen a port, to take \ncare of the program for children mentioned by the Senator from \nMinnesota, and the School Lunch Program which has been debated in the \nHouse, it would either have to be discontinued, or we would have to \nborrow to do it. Think of it--borrow to run the entirety of the U.S. \nGovernment, or not do it, because all the money will have been consumed \nbut by five outlays.\n  Mr. President, from time to time, in America's history, Americans \nhave been called upon to do extraordinary things--those that founded \nthe Nation, those that fought to keep it a union, the Americans that \nwent to Europe in the name of freedom in 1918, and again in 1940. Mr. \nPresident, my view is that no generation of Americans--none--will have \never been called upon to do more than the current generation of \nAmericans as they face this staggering crisis.\n  I repeat that: I do not believe there is any generation of Americans \nother than those living today that will have been asked to do more in \nthe name of saving this Union.\n  Mr. President, this is not a message of gloom. Mr. President, this is \na message of challenge. Challenge. I have never known a generation of \nAmericans that would flinch or cower from facing a crisis that had to \ndo with the saving of the Union.\n  First, Americans have to know about this problem, which I do not \nbelieve they do. I think Americans understand that we have difficulties \nand problems. But they do not know that the problem is at their back \ndoor. They have heard policymakers for years talk about the growing \ncrisis of our fiscal affairs.\n  What they do not realize is that there is not another generation to \npass \n[[Page S4677]] this problem to. We cannot pass the baton to someone \nelse. It is our problem. We are going to have to confront it now. We \nare going to have to try to prevail. That means move to a balanced \nbudget. That means it has to be done fairly and evenhandedly.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have to take steps in these Chambers \nto remove the burdens of business so that we can expand our economy.\n  I contend that when we look at this conversion of but five outlays \nthat consume all of our revenues, we are going to have to confront what \nI would characterize as generational contracts. We are going to have to \ntake these entitlements and honor our agreements to those who are at \nthe end of their work careers. But for those coming into the work \ncareer, we are going to have to entertain and shape new agreements.\n  Mr. President, this generation of Americans has a choice. It can do \nthose things I just talked about--tighten the belt, move to a balanced \nbudget, expand the economy, move to generational contracts on \nentitlements. If we do that, the American dream, which has been a part \nof this country since its inception--that life would always be better \nfor the new generation, that the new generation would have more \nopportunity, be better educated, it would be a stronger nation--is \nstill possible. If we do the tightening of the belt, if we enter into \ngenerational contracts, if we do the things to expand the economy, we \nwill create millions of new jobs for America's future. If we do these \nthings, we will create thousands of new businesses. And in forming the \nnew businesses, we will generate new ideas and better ways to live, and \nwe will elevate our standard of living in this country.\n  But what if we choose to flinch? What if we ignore what we have been \ntold--that five expenditures will consume all of our revenues in but a \ndecade. What if we ignore this, while history is full of nations in \nruins because they failed to confront this kind of crisis?\n  If we let this happen, the future generations will have to bear an \n82-percent tax rate to pay for our failure to confront this issue. Mr. \nPresident, 82 percent of earned wages would be consumed just in order \nto take care of our fiscal abuse.\n  We would be saying to the future that the present is all we are \nworried about. We do not care about those jobs in the future. We do not \ncare about the burden of the working family in the future.\n  Mr. President, I began these remarks by saying that I believe that \nthis generation of Americans will be called upon as no other. We are at \na unique crossroads in the history of this Nation.\n  The other enemies were outside our borders. They were easier to \nidentify--Hitler marching. Across America, the great divide in our \nNation, this is a battle amongst ourselves. This is an insidious, \ncreeping development that is much harder to recognize.\n  Just as sure as the Sun comes up in the morning and sets in the West, \nthis generation of Americans will have to confront this crisis or we \nwill undo our own Nation.\n  I want to add one other thing, Mr. President. There is only one world \npower today. We all acknowledge that we are still living in a very \ndangerous world. If we destabilize our currency, if we wound ourselves \nbecause we lack the discipline to manage our fiscal affairs, we will \nmake the world a very dangerous place for the future families of \nAmerica. It will not be difficult for our world adversaries to know \nthat if we do not care for our financial health, we will be unable to \ndefend our freedom here or anywhere else in the world.\n  I have but one request, Mr. President. I hope that every American \nfamily will take a look at this very simple chart that says within 10 \nyears, we will consume all U.S. revenues with but five expenditures--\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the \ninterest on debt--and put that chart on their kitchen table and \ncontemplate what that means to the planned retirement of the parents, \nto the aspirations for education and jobs of the children, and the \nfuture of their country. I believe, from around that kitchen table, \nwill come the will and the resolve to confront this great moral \nchallenge for the United States.\n  I ask them to do this for themselves, Mr. President, and for their \nfamilies, and for this Union.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my freshman \ncolleagues to discuss some of the solutions and some of the facts, the \ninterest, that go into the Nation's welfare system.\n  Before the debate on welfare reform can proceed, however, it seems to \nme that we have to make some stipulations. We have to begin with the \nbasic premise, the premise that everyone in this Chamber is \ncompassionate about helping over 26 million people climb out of \npoverty. That is not the question.\n  I think if we are really seeking some solutions to our welfare \nproblems, some solutions to help Americans advance themselves, we have \nto get away from this idea of saying that this group--because they have \na different view--wants to throw everybody out in the cold.\n  I think we do all start with that notion that every day, each person \nhas a responsibility to make this a better place to live. With that \npremise, we wanted to talk some about the fundamental question of how \nwe proceed, and what is the role of the Federal Government; how can we \nmake changes that will cause some changes in the results of the welfare \nprogram?\n  Mr. President, let me first recognize the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. The 11 \nfreshman Republican Senators have made it a point to come to the \nChamber and speak each week on an important topic because we have just \ngone through an election, have just spoken very directly with our \nconstituents, with a large segment of the block of voters who called \nfor change in this last election. The Presiding Officer experienced \nthat as well, and knows the fervor with which our constituents approach \nthe issues of reform and change.\n  No issue that they talked about in the last campaign had more \nemotional feeling to it, I think, than the issue of welfare reform. \nBecause they not only recognized that welfare reform could result in \nhuge savings of money to the Federal Government, but that we were \ndestroying generations of people, creating a cycle of dependency from \nwhich too many people were finding it impossible to extricate \nthemselves.\n  So it is a very personal challenge as well as a sound, prudent fiscal \npolicy that causes us to look to the issue of welfare reform. We do \nthat this week because we want to compliment our House colleagues for \npassing a meaningful fundamental welfare reform package, the first real \neffort to reform our failed welfare system in decades, and to say to \nour House colleagues: You got the ball rolling and now it is our \nopportunity in the Senate to take advantage of the momentum you have \ncreated, to take the legislation you have passed and to try to improve \nupon it if we can, and to get a bill to the President which he can \nsign, truly ending welfare as we know it.\n  The House bill, in most people's view, is not a perfect bill. But it \nis a very good start toward this issue of welfare reform. As I said, it \nis now our opportunity.\n  Let me just make four quick points about what I think our approach to \nthis problem ought to be.\n  Our current system, I think almost everyone has now recognized, does \nnot foster independence, and family, and responsibility--all values \nthat we know are essential, but, instead, perpetuates both material and \nbehavioral poverty. The most compassionate, responsible course of \naction that I think we can take is to find a way to free our Nation's \nchildren and families from dependency in this terribly flawed welfare \nsystem.\n  Toward that premise I think we should first admit that continued \ndramatic increases in Federal social welfare spending have failed to \nreduce the number of people in poverty in this \n[[Page S4678]]  country and that more money is simply not the answer. \nThe Federal Government has spent more than $5 trillion on social \nwelfare programs since President Johnson declared the war on poverty, \nyet, according to the Congressional Budget Office figures, total \nspending will rise to 6 percent of the gross national product by 1998. \nSince the mid-1960's, poverty has actually increased from 14.7 percent \nto 15.1 percent today. So after spending all this money we have not \neradicated poverty. It is more in our land than before.\n  Second, the Federal Government does not know best how to spend our \nhard-earned dollars. One of our colleagues gave us a test. If you \ninherit $100,000 and because you are a good citizen you want to, in \neffect, tithe a tenth of that to solve the problem of social \ndeconstruction in our country, to whom would you give that $10,000? \nWhat organization would you give it to, to best help eradicate poverty \nin your own community? I daresay none of us would invest that in the \nU.S. Government. None of us would say the Federal Government welfare \nprograms are pretty good, let us give the $10,000 to them. We would \npick the local homeless shelter or Salvation Army or some other local \ngroup that really knows how to stretch the dollars and make the \nindividual decisions in the community that we know work.\n  It is interesting, several Governors, including Tommy Thompson from \nWisconsin, whose welfare roles have declined 25 percent over the past \nfew years, have had to ask for literally hundreds of waivers from the \nU.S. Government in order to achieve welfare reform in their own States. \nSo giving States more flexibility to quickly achieve welfare reform \nwill help those in need.\n  Third is the point the Senator from Wyoming just made, and it is a \nvery important point, we must end the damaging and incorrect rhetoric \nwhich suggests that somehow by reforming welfare we are going to be \ntaking food out of the mouths of young children. This is rhetoric of \nthe worst kind. The House bill, for example, has been criticized, but \nfew point out that the House bill actually increases funding for school \nlunch programs by 4.5 percent each and every year for the next 5 years, \nan increase of $1 billion; and that the block grants to the States will \nsave money and enable them to apply those funds to the children.\n  Fourth, the Federal Government and the States must continue to search \nfor ways, whether they be difficult initial choices or not, which \nfoster self-sufficiency, encourage marriage, and work. The House bill \ncontains several such incentives. For example, we should eliminate the \nmarriage penalty created in the Tax Code. Fathers should be required to \nlive up to their financial responsibilities. Again, giving States the \nflexibility to design programs which will effectively reduce out-of-\nwedlock births and other similar conditions which create poverty are an \nimportant element of any welfare reform program.\n  There is more, but I think we make the point that there are several \nthings that need to be done here. The House was on the right track and \nwe in the Senate need to give our backing to that in the kind of bill \nwe pass out of Senate and not let this momentum flag but be able to \nsend a bill to the President.\n  I conclude with this point. There is a big difference between taking \ncare of people and caring for people. Taking care of people was the \nphilosophy of the Great Society programs. It has not worked. True \ncompassion is caring for people in a way that provides them a hand up, \nnot a handout. That should be the guiding philosophy to end the cycle \nof dependency that has been created by 40 years of misguided welfare \npolicies. That should be the guiding philosophy of true welfare reform \nthat comes out of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the Senator from Wyoming for \nagain getting the freshmen Members of the Senate here to talk about \nthis important subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator from Arizona, I think, has made one of the \nkey points in this whole discussion, and that is this is a \ncompassionate society. All of us are committed to the concept that we \nhelp people help themselves. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that \nthe war on poverty has failed, and that we have more of a problem now \nthan we did when it began. That is what this is about--how do we have a \nbetter system of helping the people help themselves.\n  One of the persons who has worked very hard and very diligently, and \nI think is most knowledgeable in this area, is the Senator from \nPennsylvania, who last year in the House was basically the author and \nprincipal architect of the proposal put together by the Ways and Means \nCommittee that would accomplish some of those things.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding the time. I appreciate the kind words in the introduction.\n  I, too, want to say the Senator from Wyoming and Senator from Arizona \nhave hit the nail on the head. I think the reason, the impetus behind \nus being here this morning is really to start this debate out on \nwelfare reform with a little different tone than it took in the House \nof Representatives. The fact of the matter is, the debate in the House, \nwith ample support from the national media, turned into a really \ndisgraceful event that turned so mean-spirited and accusatory that it \nfocused very little on what actually was going to occur and what the \nunderlying principles were in the reform effort that were underway. It \nfocused just on name-calling and, I think, outrageous allegations about \nthe mean-spiritedness of the Republican proposal.\n  We are here this morning as the freshman class to say we have \nexamined and are examining this proposal, and we see it as a very \npositive move forward in helping people get out of poverty. That is \nwhat this is all about. You will hear some say, ``The Republicans, they \njust want to cut people off.'' I would tell you that I would not be \nhere today--and I do not think any of us would be here today--if we \nthought that was the motivation behind the welfare reform proposal, \njust to hurt people.\n  I am not in the business of hurting people. I do not like hurting \npeople. I want to try to help folks. But I truly believe, as I think my \ncolleagues will also state, that you do not help people, as Senator Kyl \nsaid, by taking care of them, by making them dependent on you, by \nproviding for them instead of giving them the opportunity to provide \nfor themselves.\n That is not truly taking care of. That is not truly helping people.\n\n  So when you look at these proposals, look at it not as to how much \nare we doing for somebody, but how much are we helping them help \nthemselves. How much opportunity are we creating; not how much are we \ntaking care of. That is really the test here, because we know from our \nhistory that taking care of people destroys them, destroys communities, \ndestroys families, destroys country. That is what is brewing in our \ncommunities that are heavily laden with welfare populations today. That \ndestructive element of Government dependency is taking control and is \nnot creating better communities, families, individuals, and \nneighborhoods.\n  I have been asked, because of my background in the House on this \nissue, what the prospects are here in the Senate. The general \nconventional wisdom is the Senate will water it down and we will get \nsomething that is just sort of tinkering with the system, that they \nwill not be nearly as dramatic as the House. I say this: The more the \nSenate looks at the problem, the more we focus in and see the absolute \ndestruction that is occurring in our neighborhoods today, the morality \nbehind what we have to do--this is not an economic issue; providing for \nthe poor in our society is a moral issue. We have to look at it in that \ncontext.\n  When you look at what we are doing to children, families, \ncommunities, and our Nation, I believe the U.S. Senate will follow the \npath very similar to the House of Representatives.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee just yesterday said that the \nblock grant idea has merit and that we should move forward on that \ntrack. It does have merit. Why? Because it takes all of the power and \ncontrol out of this town that thinks it knows best for everybody, where \nwe make sure that everything is taken care of from here and \n[[Page S4679]]  that all the decisions are made here, and puts them \nback into the States and, more particularly, into the communities and \ninto the families of America. That is the right direction for us to \ntake when it comes to taking responsibility for the poor in this \ncountry. That is the right direction. I believe that is the direction \nwe all will take here in the U.S. Senate.\n  It will be a dramatic bill that comes out of this Senate. It will not \nbe a watered down version that looks very much like the system today. I \ndo not believe the Senate will stand for that. And I think we can get \nbipartisan support to do it. I am encouraged by that.\n  There will be some who stand up and defend the status quo. They will \nstand up because they were the creators of the status quo, and they \nwill defend the system and accuse anybody who wants to change it as \nbeing cruel, inhumane, and mean spirited. And they will say in many \ncases, as happened in the House, outrageous things about our intent.\n  Let me clear the air one more time about our intent. Our intent is to \nhelp people help themselves. Our intent is to get people off the \nwelfare rolls. I find it absolutely incredulous that when you have a \nprogram in place that actually gets people off the welfare rolls, that \nis bad. What? A good welfare program gets more people on the welfare \nrolls? Is that what we want? Is that our analysis? Is that our \nbenchmark as to what is good? Getting more people on welfare, making \nmore people dependent? That is good? No. What is good is solving \npoverty, not sustaining it. Moving people off the welfare rolls is \ngood. Decreasing those rolls is good. That is a good objective. That is \nwhat we hope to accomplish here.\n  Those who stand up and say so many people are going to be cut off and \nall these people are going to be leaving. That is good. People leaving \nwelfare and on to productive jobs in America is good. That is what this \nprogram is going to be all about. You will hear people say, ``Well, you \ncannot change this. You are going to harm children.'' Folks, look at \nall the welfare payments, AFDC, SSI, on down the list. How many of \nthose benefits get paid directly to the children? How many of them? The \nanswer is none. A child in this country does not get any money paid \ndirectly to them. It all goes to parents. They all go to parents.\n  So when you hear this argument we are going to cut children off, we \nare going to hurt children, think of where the money goes and think of \nwhere that money is being spent and by whom it is being spent; not the \nchildren. I wish the money could be sent directly to those children so \nthey could get the food and education that they need. But, \nunfortunately, in many cases it does not.\n  Let us focus in on the real problem. The people who are going to \ndefend the status quo have put forward a plan for the past 30 or 40 \nyears that has increased poverty, decreased hope and opportunity, has \nincreased crime and decreased the sense of community safety and \nneighborhood, has increased illegitimacy from 5 percent in the \nmidsixties--5 percent of children in this country were born out of \nwedlock--30 percent today and rising. As a result, we have seen a \ndecrease in fathers taking responsibility for their children and a \nresulting increase in gang activity because fathers bond with other \nmales instead of bonding with females to take care of children. It is a \nvicious cycle that is created by very good intentions of the people who \ncreated this system; very good intentions, but very wrong programs.\n  I challenge the national media to give us a break. Tell the truth. \nQuit printing that we are repealing the School Lunch Program when they \nknow darned well we are increasing the money. We are cutting out, as \nwas said in the House, the lunches, the free lunches, here in \nWashington by the bureaucrats who suck money from the system before it \neven gets to the kids. Tell the truth about what is going to go on here \nin the U.S. Senate with the welfare reform. Do not be afraid that your \nfriends on the other side will not like you by telling the truth about \nhelping people, that the Republicans can actually be kind, \ncompassionate, and be for a more progressive and uplifting opportunity \ntype of society for the poor. Do not be afraid of that. Stand up and \ntell the truth about what is going on here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Finally, the welfare system in this country has to change, and there \nare four principles we have to accomplish. First, work. The only true \nmeasure of success of a welfare program is how it gets people off \nwelfare and into work. Work has to be a central component.\n  Second, there has to be a system that supports families and does not \ntear families apart, that supports marriage and does not foster fathers \nwalking away from their children.\n  Third, it has to focus on flexibility to provide States and \ncommunities the opportunity to have programs that truly do tailor their \nneeds to the individual families and communities and not be \nbureaucratic and regulatory from the Federal level.\n  Finally, we have to save money. We heard so much about the people \nprogram, cutting people off. The Republican program allows welfare to \ngrow over the next 5 years 32 percent. If we did nothing, it would grow \n39 percent. I do not think cutting the program that is scheduled to \ngrow to 39 percent is mean spirited or draconian. In fact, a lot of \npeople listening would probably say, ``Why don't you do more?'' We do \nnot do more because we want to try to help and not just be handing out. \nThat costs money, but it is a good investment. We are willing to make \nthe investment of helping people get out of poverty, but we are going \nto stop throwing money at people who stay in poverty.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding the time. I appreciate \nhis indulgence in my discourse. I look forward to the rest of the day.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas].\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator from Pennsylvania has obviously given a great \ndeal of thought to this. I think it is interesting that almost everyone \nin this country, including President Clinton, says welfare is broken \nand needs to be fixed. Yet, when you begin to look at it and take the \nopportunity to seek to find a better way to deliver services, then we \nrun into all of this criticism and, as the Senator says, untruths about \nwhat is really happening. But I think there is a real opportunity this \ntime to do something.\n  One of the reasons is that there are people in this body who are new \nhere and who are bringing to the body a brandnew idea, some of it \nhaving come from the campaign, some of it having come from living \nregular lives. And one of those is the Senator from Tennessee. I would \nlike to yield time to him.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nleadership in this area and also the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \neloquent remarks and for his leadership in this area, both in the House \nof Representatives and in the U.S. Senate. He, as usual, assesses the \nproblem very precisely.\n  I would like to lend my remarks to my own assessment of the situation \nas we begin this debate because we are indeed addressing one of the \nmost fundamental problems facing the Nation at this time. I think if \none true thing can be said about the welfare system, it is that the \nAmerican people have overwhelmingly concluded that we have a mess on \nour hands and an intractable problem that we must do something about \nfor the preservation of our society as we know it.\n  Too often the program has been run by the wrong level of government, \nby the wrong people.\n  We have spent $5 trillion trying to address the welfare program in \nthis Nation, and we have created more poverty, more out-of-wedlock \nbirths, a higher crime rate, more dependency than we ever thought would \nbe possible. If the Federal Government had deliberately gone out and \ntried to wreak such havoc with $5 trillion, it would not have been able \nto do it, yet we have done by accident what could not be done by \ndesign.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate, as we address this \nproblem, that we do so with a certain amount of humility. We are not \nthe first people to address this problem. This is not the first time \nthe Senate has addressed it. This is not the first time the House of \n[[Page S4680]] Representatives has addressed this problem. It has been \nwith us for many years. It has been growing and growing. Many people \nhave come up with different ideas and different people of good faith \ncan have different ideas about this.\n  So I think as we proceed into this debate, we ought to be openminded. \nWe ought to be constructive. I think there is only one thing that we \nshould not tolerate and that is the status quo. We have a miserable \nsystem now that is in large part participating in the decline of the \nUnited States of America; a country that we have all grown up in and \nhas been the strongest, most powerful and most respected Nation not \nonly in the world but in the history of the world.\n  The time has come for change. It seems to me these problems fester \nand are debated for years on end, but finally there comes a time when \nwe really have to face up to them. I think we are beginning to do that \nin the Senate, and in the Congress of the United States with regard to \nmany areas for the first time. We are talking about changing the way we \ndo business in the Congress of the United States, and there is no more \nclear example of that than our approach to the problems in our welfare \nsystem.\n  I think that going into it we can certainly conclude there are \ncertain things that have been proven not to work. We know, for example, \nthat merely throwing money into a failed system is not the answer. We \ncould have taken all of the assets of all the Fortune 500 companies in \nAmerica and given those assets to the poor and still have saved money. \nThat alone gives us some indication of the amount of money we have \npoured into a system, and a rising poverty level indicates the results \nwe have achieved from that money.\n  I think it is also clear that large Federal programs are not the \nanswer. We are now talking about workfare. We are talking about job \ntraining as if this was the first time these ideas have come about. \nSome people think if you take a little more money out of this pot and \nput it in here or if we reduce a program a little bit and add it to \nanother, if we fine tune it enough, we are smart enough that we can \ncome up with the right solution to solve this problem from Washington, \nDC.\n  We have been trying this for 30 years to no avail. We are dealing \nwith a single problem, and that is poverty. It is a problem that has \nmany causes. We are trying with one set of overlay programs from \nWashington, DC, to cover situations where on the one hand we have a \nperson who is trying to get off welfare and trying their best to get \nout of a temporary hardship; on the other hand we have people who have \nbeen on welfare for generations and have no interest in working until \nthey are absolutely forced to do so. The same program from Washington, \nDC, cannot cover the myriad of conditions and circumstances that we \nface.\n  There are certain principles we can adhere to as we begin to address \nthis problem, and one is that we must give the States more flexibility. \nWe must get this problem down closer to the people who can see their \nneighbors, who know the person down the street or across the way, and \nwho knows who is trying and who is not trying and who legitimately \nneeds help and who should be told it is time to go to work. All of the \ninnovation that has taken place in this country with regard to the \nwelfare problem in the last decade has been at the State and local \nlevel.\n  We have to take advantage of those innovations and those remarkable \nGovernors we see all across this Nation who are coming up with \nsolutions and trying different things under heavy criticism and heavy \nbarrages of acrimonious statements but are standing tall and standing \nstrong and changing those programs and showing that certain basic \nprograms and changes of motivation of people can really work and help \nthe system.\n  We should not be embarrassed to ask local churches, local \ncommunities, private organizations to step up to the plate and do more. \nThat is the way it used to be in this country. It is not turning back \nthe clock. It is a way of moving forward. I still believe that this \ncountry is full of well-meaning, caring, big-hearted people who, if \nthey knew the nature of the problem, they knew someone down the way who \nreally was having a hard time, would be willing to jump in and lend a \nhand. If it were brought to our attention and we had the responsibility \nand felt the responsibility to do something about it, there are \nmillions of people out there who would be willing to step forward and \ndo something about it. They cannot take care of the whole problem, and \nwe cannot turn over the whole problem to them overnight, but they have \nto be brought back into the system. People have to feel a sense of \nresponsibility for their neighbors the way they used to in this \ncountry.\n  We have to have a system that pays more to work than it does not to \nwork. As I travel around the State of Tennessee and go into these \nlittle restaurants and coffee shops and see these young women working \nhard, many hours a day, some of them with a child or maybe two children \nat home, never been on welfare, you talk to them, working at low-wage \njobs trying their best, working hard, and they see someone down the \nstreet from them or across the road who does not work, who has never \nworked and are netting out more than they are in terms of take-home \npay, they see that, Mr. President. People see that. It has a \ndebilitating effect on them and our country. It has a debilitating \neffect on these people, young people especially, who are not into the \nwelfare mentality, who have worked all their lives and want to work, \nand we are delivering a message to them that really it pays more \nsometimes not to work.\n  We have to change a system like that. As the Senator from \nPennsylvania pointed out, there will be those against reform. There \nwill be those who want to stay with the status quo. A lot of people \nhave done very well on the system that we have. A lot of people in \nWashington, DC, elected representatives over the years by sending out \nmore money and getting more votes have done very well for themselves \nunder the current system. Certainly the bureaucracies that run the \ntremendous system that we have now, that siphon off most of the money \nbefore it ever gets to anybody that it can help, have done very well \nunder the system. They will come up with every horror story known to \nman to keep from having to do without a little more money for their \nagency or a few less jobs as we try to move this down to the State and \nlocal level where the problem is and where people know what to do \nbetter to solve that problem.\n  So, Mr. President, these are my observations as we go into this \ndebate. We have a problem on which we all agree. We all know that we \nhave been trying for years to do something about it, essentially \nnibbling around the edges. I think we have all concluded now that the \ntime has come for action; that we must take bold action; we must \nchange. We are better than this. We cannot go down the road to \ndestruction of this Nation. The people who genuinely need help in this \ncountry deserve a better system, and the people who work hard for a \nliving and pay for this system deserve better.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 5 minutes and 24 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we got started a little late. We would \nlike to have about 15 more minutes, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is exciting; I think it is \nexciting that Senators like the Senator from Tennessee and others are \nwilling to take a look at this program. It has been a long time since \nwe have said: Does this program work? What are the results? How do we \nmeasure the results? What is the measurement of success?\n  Instead of that, over the years, we have simply said: We have a \nprogram. It is not working. Let us put some more money in to make it \nbigger.\n  Now we have an exciting opportunity, and that opportunity is to \nevaluate it, to change it, to find better systems, to look for \nduplications, and to eliminate some of the things that do not work.\n  One of our colleagues who has had an opportunity to work with this \nvery closely at the local level as Lieutenant Governor is the Senator \nfrom Ohio. I yield to the Senator.\n   [[Page S4681]] Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nWyoming for putting this group together this morning. His comments are \ncertainly well taken, as are the comments of my colleagues from \nArizona, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\n  I think it is fitting and appropriate that the new Members of the \nSenate, who just finished the campaign, just finished talking directly \nto the American people, should be the ones who are on the floor this \nmorning talking about welfare reform, because I am sure that the \nexperience my friend from Wyoming, or my friends from Tennessee, \nPennsylvania, and Arizona, had was the same experience that I had.\n  I could not find one person--not one person--in the State of Ohio who \nthought welfare worked. And that included people who were on welfare. \nIt included taxpayers. It included the average citizens, whom I see day \nafter day after day. I could not find anybody who thought welfare \nworks. So it is appropriate that we, really, in this country engage in \nthis national debate.\n  Mr. President, the House has just concluded this debate and the \nSenate will take up this debate in a few weeks. In this debate, we seem \nto be focusing on adults, on money, on jobs. But, Mr. President, \nunderlying all these considerations is really the future of our \nchildren, because that is really what this debate is all about. It is \nabout our children. It is about breaking the cycle of poverty. It is \nabout breaking the cycle of despair.\n  We are, it is true, Mr. President, trying to rescue the adults who \nare trapped in the welfare system. But if we are brutally frank and \nhonest with ourselves, I think most of us will admit that it is our \nconcern for the children that really underlies this debate and makes it \nso imperative that we do something, that we do something different.\n  Fixing welfare will not be easy, and it will not be done overnight. \nAnd fixing welfare, frankly, is not all we have to do. We also have to \ntackle the broader problems of violence, poverty, and lack of education \nthat is posing such a threat to the well-being of our country's \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that America's children are in crisis, and \nwelfare dependency is part of the cause of that crisis.\n  The statistics in regard to our young people today are absolutely \nstaggering and frightening. In 1960, about 5 percent of the children \nborn in America were illegitimate. Today, almost one-third are. In some \nmajor cities, that figure is now at two-thirds, and in some cities, \neven higher than that.\n  Since 1972, the rate of children having children has doubled. What \nhappens to these children, Mr. President? According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, half of all teenage unwed mothers are on \npublic assistance within 1 year of having their first child, and within \n5 years, 77 percent are on public assistance. This takes a huge toll on \nthe children. The poverty rate among children is the highest of any age \ngroup in the country.\n  Our young people today are the only age group in America--listen to \nthis--the only age group in America that does not have a longer life \nexpectancy than their parents did at the same age. A recent study \nrevealed that of the children born to a married adult with a high \nschool education, only 8 percent live in poverty. But of the children \nborn to unmarried minors without a high school diploma, 80 percent live \nin poverty.\n  The children born out of wedlock are three times more likely than the \nchildren of married parents to become welfare clients when they grow \nup.\n  What kind of a life are these children being prepared for? What kind \nof values are they learning in a family where many times no one works, \nand bare subsistence income is given by, frankly, a distant and \ngrudging Federal Government?\n  Mr. President, what do we do? That is what we are going to be talking \nabout in the weeks and months ahead.\n  I think it might be tempting, particularly for those of us on this \nside of the aisle, now that Republicans control the Senate and \nRepublicans control the House, to once again do what we have done in \nthis country time and time and time again, and that is to impose a \nWashington solution on this problem. I think, however, Mr. President, \nthat would be a mistake. I think it is very tempting to do this now \nthat we are in control, but I believe it would be a grave mistake \nbecause history has simply taught us that Washington does not have all \nthe answers.\n  I do believe that there will be times, as we debate this bill and \nthis reform, when I will vote for some uniformity. I think, for \nexample, that it makes eminent sense in the area of child support \nenforcement, an area that has been a problem for many, many years, to \nhave more uniformity, to have more cooperation between the States. I \nsaw this 20 years ago as a young assistant county prosecuting attorney \nwhen we tried to enforce child support. I saw the problems we had in \ngoing from State to State to State. I think uniformity in that area \ndoes make sense.\n  But I think, in most cases, we are going to be much better off in \nallowing the Governors, the legislators, and the people of the States \nto design their own programs.\n  Too often, Mr. President, we think, here in Washington, we have all \nthe answers. Indeed, the crisis of welfare dependency in today's \nAmerica is, I believe, in large measure a consequence of Federal \npolicies written right here in this Capitol.\n  Mr. President, to be very blunt, I do not believe we should replace \nthe Democratic Party's version of Federal micromanagement with the \nRepublican version of Federal micromanagement of our welfare system. I \nthink it would be a mistake. The answers are not here in Washington, \nnot even on this side of the aisle.\n  If we are going to find answers, we need to be looking to the States \nand the local communities.\n  My colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, said it very, very well. \nWho better knows their neighbors, their friends, their communities? Who \nbetter knows the solution to this problem than the people of the local \ncommunity?\n  I believe, Mr. President, that welfare reform experiments in Ohio, \nWisconsin, Michigan, and other States do in fact show a great deal of \npromise. But we should not try to force all States into a single mold. \nWe still have a great deal to learn about what works in welfare, and we \ncertainly know already what does not work.\n  We should not standardize the Federal solution to which all States \nand communities have to conform. We need the States to continue to \nexperiment, to be the laboratories of democracy, and to lead the way \ntoward a 21st century welfare system in this country that does, in \nfact, work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we, I believe, as we approach this welfare \ndebate, must always remember that welfare is not, first and foremost, a \nmoney problem. Over the last few weeks, we have heard a great deal \nabout the money side of welfare, and that is quite natural. Some say we \nare taking money away from the needy. Others say we are saving money \nfor the taxpayers.\n  But beyond the welfare debate in regard to money is something much \nmore important, and that is human beings, and that is young children.\n  The problem, frankly, Mr. President, is the kind of culture we are \nbuilding in this country and the kind of lives America's children will \ninherit.\n  As we begin this debate, I propose a very radical solution. It is \nparticularly radical for this town and this city, this Capitol \nBuilding, this Chamber. And the radical solution is to say, ``We don't \nhave all the wisdom here. We don't know all the answers.''\n  Let us trust the States to be the laboratories of democracy. Let us \nturn back power to the States and let them try things, and let them \nfind out what will work and what will not work.\n  They cannot do a worse job than the Federal Government has done. That \nmay be a radical solution. It may be something that is foreign to \nCongress in the past. Quite frankly, Mr. President, we have tried \neverything else. I think it is time for a radical solution, a radical \nchange, and I think, quite frankly, that it will work. Thank you very \nmuch.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n   [[Page S4682]] Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to wrap up \nour focus, our effort this morning.\n  Let me just say, again, that I congratulate the House on what they \nhave done. I think they moved forward. I think they have examined and \nhave come up with new ideas. Do I support all of it? Probably not. Is \nit a perfect bill? Of course not. But it gives us an opportunity to \ntake a new look at something that needs a new look.\n  What we are seeking is the best way to deliver services, the best way \nto help people help themselves, to find a way to help people who need \nhelp back into the workplace. That is what it is all about. That is the \npurpose of this program.\n  I went into our welfare office in Casper, WY. I expected to find a \nstaff that was very defensive when we talked about change. That is not \ntrue. They felt frustrated with the program that they now have to \nadminister. The director showed me this whole shelf full of \nregulations. He said, ``God, I spend half my time working on \nregulations.'' They come from different Departments. They come from \nAgriculture, they come from Housing, they come from the welfare \nprogram. We need to put them together so that they do work.\n  We try to do something to encourage people to work, and if a mother \non AFDC does not have a job or does not look for one or does not do \nwhat is required, they seek to reduce the payments. They reduce the \npayments here and they go up in food stamps, they go up in housing. \nThey are very frustrated that they are not being able to accomplish \nwhat they want to accomplish.\n  There is a perception that more Government is needed by some, that \nmore money is needed. Since the war on poverty, the Federal Government \nhas spent nearly $5 trillion on social welfare programs. Federal, State \nand local governments combined now spend $350 billion a year, 20 \npercent more than the Government spends on national defense.\n  Separate Medicaid from food stamps and aid to families with dependent \nchildren and you find a program that costs taxpayers approximately $90 \nbillion a year, more than five times what it was in 1981.\n  Specifically, the Federal share for Medicaid spending in the State of \nWyoming has grown from $42 million to over $107 million from 1990 to \n1994. The State's share for that program has grown from $24 to $61 \nmillion in that same period of time. And we all know what the results \nhave been.\n  We have heard a great deal of criticism from the administration \nregarding the Republicans' efforts to reform welfare. On the other \nhand, that is what the President talked about when he came here. He \nsaid, ``We're going to change welfare as we know it.'' Unfortunately, \nwe have not heard much lately from the administration. The proposal \nintroduced by the President in 1994 exempted all welfare mothers born \nbefore 1972 and proposed $9.3 billion in additional spending. Exempting \n80 percent of the current caseload is not an answer, nor is the \ninfusion of more money without change.\n  So what we are talking about is a great opportunity to provide real \nhelp, to provide a system that delivers the help to the people who need \nthe help, not take it off on the way there.\n  I hope that we can start, as we said in the beginning, with a \nstipulation that everyone in this place is compassionate about \nchildren, everyone in this place wants to find a system that works and \nthat we do not polarize ourselves by saying, ``These folks want to \nthrow everybody out; these folks want to help everybody.'' That is not \nthe case.\n  Like the Senator from Pennsylvania, I call on the media to help, to \nhelp really say what the facts are, to really lay out that cuts are not \ncuts, reductions in spending proposals are not cuts, that consolidation \nof programs can end up with more benefit to recipients, and that is \nwhere we are.\n  Mr. President, we appreciate this opportunity in the morning time, \nand we look forward to participating in developing a program of \nassistance to Americans that will bring them out of poverty and into \nthe workplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4677-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last Saturday the people of Greece \ncelebrated 172 years of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. The \nGreek emancipation from the reins of tyranny brings to mind our own \nancestors' struggle for freedom. Greece and the United States share a \ncommon struggle rooted in a common philosophy of liberty and self-\ngovernance put forth by the ancient Greeks.\n  Thomas Jefferson looked to the ancient Greeks when he made the case \nfor representative democracy. Jefferson once said, `` * * *  to the \nancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for the light which led \nourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' The Declaration of Independence \nclosely mirrors the ideals of ancient Greek philosophers. Greek \nIndependence Day not only commemorates Greece's victory over \noppression, but also celebrates deeply rooted philosophical symmetry--\none honed by great statesmen from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson.\n  America's relationship with the Greeks came full circle when, on the \neve of their revolution for independence, the Greek commander in chief, \nPetros Mavomichalis implored Americans for assistance:\n\n       Having formed the resolution to live or die for freedom, we \n     are drawn toward you by a just sympathy since it is in your \n     land that liberty has fixed her abode, and by you that she is \n     prized as by our fathers. Hence, honoring her name, we invoke \n     yours at the same time, trusting that in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you . . . it is for you, citizens of \n     America, to crown this glory.\n\n  Cognizant of the familiar ideals upon which the United States was \nfounded, Greeks emigrated to the United States en masse during the \nearly 1900's. Thus, generations of Greek-Americans have been able to \ncontribute to the reaffirmation of their ancestors' political \nphilosophies.\n  Greek immigrants emulated their ancestors' drive for knowledge. By \n1970, Greek-Americans already topped other ethnic groups in median \neducational achievement. Combined with this intellectual drive, Greeks \nbrought with them a diligent work ethic. Greek Independence Day also \ngives us an opportunity to pay special tribute to the industrious \ntraditions of Greek-Americans and their outstanding contribution to our \nsociety.\n  I take this opportunity to wish all Greeks, whether they be in Greece \nor my home State of South Dakota, the very best during this 172d year \nof Greek independence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4682-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BLAIR\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the Democratic Party of Alabama lost one \nof its most ardent supporters and activists on March 12, when Madison \nCounty Chairwoman Jennie Blair passed away. She was a strong, dedicated \nwoman who contributed greatly to her State and community over the \nyears.\n  Jennie was a very eloquent spokesperson for the causes and programs \nthat help the people who are least able to help themselves. She was a \npositive force for good. Activists on the other side felt a kindred \nspirit with her, and also felt the loss.\n  She was a retired South Central Bell employee and labor activist who \nhad long been involved in local Democratic Party politics. Just last \nmonth, Jennie was elected to a 4-year term as Madison County \nchairwoman. Huntsville, Alabama's third-largest city, is located in \nMadison.\n  A native of Lincoln County, TN, she was a member of the \nCommunications Workers of America and a delegate to the Democratic \nNational Convention. She held many other leadership positions in the \nState and national party, and played a pivotal role in the 1992 \nconvention.\n  Jennie Blair's determination, energy, enthusiasm, and drive will be \nsorely missed by those who knew and worked with and against her. She \ntook her politics seriously, and truly believed in the principles of \nthe Democratic Party. She believed that Government can be a positive \nforce in people's lives and was never shy about expressing that view. \nShe was a dynamic example of the best things about politics and public \nservice.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4682-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n                    RECOGNITION OF INAH MAE ABRAMSON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, we all know those special people who just \nseem to epitomize selfless devotion and service to others. They \ncheerfully go about helping others in numerous ways that help to \nbrighten countless lives, asking for nothing in return.\n  One such woman is Inah Mae Abramson, of Florence, AL, who was the \nsubject of a recent article in her local newspaper. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the article, which appeared in the Florence \nTimesDaily, be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I want to commend and congratulate Inah Mae Abramson for \nthe hard work, love of people, generous spirit, and genuine concern she \nalways displays through service to those around her. She truly is a \nliving example of civility, dedication, affection, and love.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Florence (AL) TimesDaily]\n\n  Work That's Never Done: Abramson Believes in Putting Herself Last, \n                      Doing Good Deeds For Others\n\n                          (By Lucille Prince)\n\n       The old saying ``Man may work from sun to sun, but women's \n     work is never done'' still applies to Inah Mae Abramson, even \n     though she retired 28 years ago.\n       When she is not busy in her office at home, she's out \n     visiting the sick, the elderly or people in nursing homes \n     working at the community center or attending a church \n     meeting.\n       One of her pet projects is sending ``sunshine cards,'' and \n     she keeps an assortment of cards on hand. She has special \n     cards that are sold by the United Methodist Women of Wesley \n     Chapel, with proceeds going to missions. She is the \n     secretary-treasurer of the historic cemetery located at \n     Wesley Chapel.\n       A charter member of the Florence Business and Professional \n     Women's club, she has served the club as president, \n     secretary, treasurer, district director and member of the \n     state board. For six years, she was chairman of the BPW Santa \n     Claus, securing gifts for mental hospitals.\n       Abramson was once head of a BPW fund to secure a piano, \n     stereo and speaker stand for Mitchell-Hollingsworth Annex. \n     This was accomplished when Dr. C.F. Lucky made a memorial for \n     his mother toward purchase of a piano. The club simply \n     completed this project.\n       During World War II, she wrote regularly to all men from \n     her church and places of employment who were in service, and \n     she sent them small gifts.\n       ``I love to do things for people,'' Abramson said. ``My \n     parents, James Emmett and Annie B. Darby Young, were \n     Christians. Mama said that if you do other people good and \n     put yourself last, you'll come out on top.''\n       The various awards Abramson has received indicate that she \n     listened to her mother.\n       In 1960, the Florence Business and Professional Women's \n     Club named her Women of the Year.\n       In 1967, she received the first Special Citizen Award \n     presented by the Muscle Shoals Chamber of Commerce. The award \n     was given on Nov. 14, 1967, just 10 days before her marriage \n     to Henry Benhart Abramson. The chamber president at that time \n     was the late Dick Biddle.\n       In presenting the award, Biddle said, ``Miss Young, soon to \n     be Mrs. Abramson, gives unselfishly to others each day of her \n     life. She lives and appreciates people. Her family and \n     friends know they can call on her anytime,\n      and she is never too busy to help anyone in need. Realizing \n     this, Gov. (George) Wallace chose her to serve as chairman \n     of the Women's Division of Lauderdale County on the State \n     Traffic Commission.'' (The purpose of the commission was \n     to make motorists more aware of traffic rules.)\n       In 1987, she was named Alumnus of the Year by the Central \n     High Alumni Association.\n       Abramson was once given the title ``Miss Methodism'' by a \n     district Methodist newspaper. This honor came because she was \n     volunteer secretary for three district superintendents before \n     the Florence District opened a full-time office.\n       A history enthusiast, Abramson has been a student of \n     history all of her life. She likes to keep up with the \n     current events, which, she reminds everyone, will soon become \n     history.\n       She attended Beulah Elementary School, and was salutatorian \n     when she finished Central High School in 1936.\n       ``I decided on a business career and attended Bob Jones \n     University, then located at Cleveland, Tenn.,'' she said. \n     ``My first job was with my cousins, Murphy Brothers Store in \n     Central Heights. I later worked for one year at the county \n     agent's office, then worked another year for W.D. Peeler, \n     registrar at the courthouse.''\n       In 1939, she accepted a job at First National Bank and \n     worked there until 1945, the year that many men returned from \n     World War II. She left the bank to operate Blue Bird Ice \n     Cream and Sandwich Shop for one year.\n       ``In November 1947, I was employed by Florence Clinic as \n     secretary to a group of 11 physicians and remained there \n     until October 1967,'' she said.\n       She vividly remembers that when the Sabine Vaccine Program \n     was begun in Lauderdale County, Dr. J.G. Middleton was \n     chairman. As an employee of the Florence Clinic, she became \n     his assistant in setting up and promoting the vaccine \n     program.\n       ``My job was to help him set up places and times to give \n     out the vaccine and to let people know that it was free,'' \n     she said. ``Since I was a member of the BPW Club, I solicited \n     the club's help in promoting this cause.''\n       She recalled that during the years she was with the bank \n     and clinic, there were few electrical machines.\n       ``There were no electric typewriters, and computers were \n     unknown,'' she said.\n       ``About that time, Florence was just emerging into \n     growth,'' she added. ``Working in the bank, I knew all the \n     attorneys in Florence at that time. Being in the customer-\n     service department gave me a chance to know most of the \n     patrons of the bank. In the 1940s, bank statements had not \n     caught on, and patrons brought their passbooks in to get \n     employees to balance their bank books for them.''\n       When she married at age 49, she gave up her professional \n     career.\n       ``I just started another career,'' she said.\n       Her husband was also an ardent church and community worker. \n     As a couple, they spent much time and effort serving both the \n     church and their community. He was one of the planners and \n     board members of the Central Volunteer Fire Department, and \n     she served as secretary.\n       Abramson said that she and her husband had 19 happy years \n     before his death Oct. 24, 1986. She still lives in their home \n     at Central, and she says that she is blessed with wonderful \n     neighbors and family who are constantly with her.\n       Wesley Chapel and Central will always have special meaning \n     to Abramson. She was born in the Central Heights community \n     Feb. 16, 1918. She became a part of the church when her \n     parents took her to a service there at age three weeks. She \n     became a member in 1929, when the church was a part of the \n     Cloverdale Charge of three churches and another added later. \n     She was the charge recorder for many years. When she returned \n     from college, she became active as a teacher, youth \n     counselor, treasurer and a member of the United Methodist \n     Women, then called the Woman's Missionary Society. She was \n     district counselor of youth subdistrict events and secretary \n     of the district Christian Workers School.\n       One of her former employers once introduced Inah Mae \n     Abramson as ``a person who not only performs her work \n     efficiently, with cheerfulness and zeal, but she always has a \n     smile on her face and exemplifies a truly dedicated Christian \n     woman whose work is never done.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4683-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4683-S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          BIRMINGHAM-SOUTHERN COLLEGE: NAIA NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate and commend the \nmen's basketball team of my undergraduate alma mater, Birmingham-\nSouthern College. Birmingham-Southern won its second national title in \n6 years on the night of March 20 when it defeated Pfeiffer College of \nNorth Carolina 92 to 76 in the NAIA national tournament championship \ngame.\n  The Panthers of Birmingham-Southern rolled through the tournament \njust as they did the season, winning five games here. They ended their \nmagnificent season with 32 straight wins and a 35-2 season overall, a \nschool record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Birmingham Post-\nHerald on the Panthers' basketball championship game be printed in the \nRecord. I heartily congratulate Birmingham-Southern Coach Duane Reboul \nand all his players for their hard work, team spirit, winning attitude, \nand overall class. They are the epitome of champions.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Birmingham Post-Herald, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n              Panthers Hit Peak: NAIA Title Crowns Season\n\n                           (By Richard Scott)\n\n       Tulsa, OK.--It started with the lowest preseason \n     expectations in six seasons under Coach Duane Reboul.\n       It ended at the highest point in six years, with a national \n     championship adding the perfect ending to a season of highs \n     for the Birmingham-Southern Panthers.\n       The fifth-seeded Panthers continued their climb toward \n     their peak performance last night by reaching the pinnacie of \n     NAIA basketball, beating 11th-seeded Pfeiffer 92-76 for the \n     title.\n       ``It's hard to put into words just how we feel after what \n     we've accomplished this year and what we've overcome,'' \n     senior point guard Tommy Dalley said. ``If you ever want to \n     see what the word `team' means, this is it. we've stepped up \n     to meet every challenge.''\n       [[Page S4684]] Despite being picked to finish fourth in the \n     Southern States Conference preseason poll, the Panthers (35-\n     2) added their second James A. Naismith national championship \n     trophy in six years to a season that saw the Panthers extend \n     the nation's longest winning streak to 32 games, set a school \n     record for victories in a single season and go undefeated in \n     14 conference games.\n       But last night, the Panthers completed their seasoning ride \n     toward their peak by opening up a tight game with a 19-9 run \n     the final four minutes, 45 seconds of the game.\n       The Panthers also did it with a depth and versatility that \n     has been at the foundation of their success. While forward \n     James Cason had 27 points and 10 rebounds and earned the \n     tournament most valuable player award, the Panthers also got \n     16 points and eight rebounds from forward Paul Fleming, 14 \n     points off the bench from forward Eddie Walter (who sank six-\n     of-seven shots), 10 each from reserve guard Chris Armstrong \n     and Dalley, and seven points and 10 rebounds from Nigel \n     Coates.\n       ``Eddie Walter was everywhere with big plays, Fleming was \n     slashing to the basket and Nigel to the boards,'' Raboul \n     said. ``It was everybody. It wasn't just one player.''\n       The combination of eight quality players seeing at least 11 \n     minutes each proved to be too much for Pfeiffer (25-8), \n     especially down the stretch.\n       BSC opened the game with its most uncertain half of the \n     tournament and trailed by four, 36-32, with 3:46 left in the \n     half.\n       Despite 10 first-half turnovers, the Panthers still managed \n     to take a 45-43 lead into halftime when Walter scored on a \n     three-point play with 48.1 seconds left and hit Cason with a \n     lob for a layup with 5.4 seconds to go.\n       Walter also helped BSC get off to a good start in the \n     second half with a three-point shot that put BSC up 50-45 at \n     17:28.\n       Then the Panthers finally hit their first spurt. After a \n     Pfeiffer basket, Dalley got BSC going with two strong \n     assists, hitting Armstrong cutting to the basket for a layup \n     and then feeding Fleming under the basket for another layup. \n     When Marvin Graves' three-pointer rolled in and out for \n     Pfeiffer, Armstrong nailed a 24-footer from the top of the \n     key for a 57-47 lead and a Pfeiffer timeout at 13:28.\n       When the Falcons cut BSC's lead to 65-60, Walter came \n     through with another big play. This time, he out-leaped a \n     taller opponent for what seemed to be an impossible rebound \n     and fed Damon Wilcox for a layup on the way down. Then he \n     rebounded a Dailey miss and put it back to put the lead back \n     at 10, 71-61, at 7:24.\n       But with 5:05 left, the Falcons still trailed by just six, \n     73-67, and the Panthers needed one of those knockout punches \n     they have used to put opponents away all season.\n       ``The first half was a war,'' Reboul said, ``but we had a \n     few more players than they did and I think that took its \n     toll.''\n       Fleming drew the first blood, with a drive for a three-\n     point play and a 75-67 lead at 4:21. Then another drive by \n     Fleming led to a 78-67 lead at 4:21.\n       On Pfeiffer's next trip down the floor, Dalley came upon \n     with a loose ball and hit Walter downcourt with a long bomb. \n     Walter could have taken it in himself but he have up to Cason \n     for an uncontested dunk and BSC's largest lead, 80-67, at \n     3:49.\n       ``I thought they played with great effort, great energy and \n     great enthusiasm,'' Reboul said. ``The game was tight and we \n     realized it, but one thing we've had all year long is \n     competitors.''\n       The way the Panthers played during the final five minutes \n     brought back something Reboul said just minutes before the \n     game.\n       ``The saddest part of all this is that it ends tonight, no \n     matter what,'' he sad. ``It's been a great season.''\n       A great season that ended at the top of the peak.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4683-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID ``YES''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the enormous Federal debt, which has \nalready soared into the stratosphere, is in about the same category as \nthe weather: Everybody talks about it but almost nobody had undertaken \nto do anything about it--until, that is, immediately following the \nNovember elections.\n  When the 104th Congress convened in January, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives promptly approved a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. And in the Senate, while all but one of the 54 \nRepublicans supported the balanced budget amendment, only 13 Democrats \nsupported it. Thus, the balanced budget amendment failed by one vote--\nbut there'll be another vote on it later this year or next year.\n  This episode--the one-vote loss in the Senate--emphasizes the fact \nthat too many politicians talk a good game, when they are back home, \nabout bringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But \nthen they come back to Washington and vote in support of bloated \nspending bills rolling through the Senate.\n  As of the close of business yesterday, Monday, March 27, the Federal \ndebt stood, down to the penny, at exactly $4,847,680,358,682.01. This \ndebt, remember, was run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government must never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until authorized and appropriated by the U.S. \nCongress. The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every \nschoolboy is supposed to know.\n  So, don't be misled by politicians who falsely declare that the \nFederal debt was run up by some previous President. These passing-the-\nbuck declarations are false because, as I said earlier, the Congress of \nthe United States is the culprit. The Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have been the big spenders for the better part of 50 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, the Cuban missile crisis was \nin progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ had \noccurred a few years previously.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective--does it not?--that it was \nCongress that ran up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,847 of \nthose billions--of dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said \nearlier, stood this morning at 4 trillion, 847 billion, 680 million, \n358 thousand, 682 dollars, and 1 cent. It'll be even greater at closing \ntime today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4684-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4684-S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             SELF-EMPLOYED HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS DEDUCTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.R. \n831, a bill that will finally provide long-promised relief for farmers \nand other self-employed taxpayers who must pay for their own health \ninsurance expenses. I am very pleased that this measure passed the \nSenate on Friday. And, I congratulate my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for acting promptly on this legislation.\n  The 25-percent deduction for the health insurance costs for the self-\nemployed and farmers expired on December 31, 1993. All during the long \ndebate on health care reform last year, both Congress and the Clinton \nadministration in effect promised these taxpayers that, as part of the \nfinal bill, their deductions for health insurance costs would be \nreinstated and made permanent. When our efforts to forge a workable \nhealth care reform package broke down last year, so did our promise to \nextend the health insurance deduction.\n  Unfortunately, this congressional inaction has left over 3 million \ntaxpayers in a tight spot with respect to their 1994 tax returns. Over \n60,000 of these taxpayers are in my home State of Utah. Because of our \nrepeated promises to extend the deduction to cover 1994, many of these \ntaxpayers have held off the filing of their 1994 tax returns. This is \nbecause if the extension is enacted, they can deduct a portion of their \n1994 health insurance costs and thus lower their tax bill for the year. \nHowever, if the bill is not enacted until after the due date for filing \n1994 tax returns, April 17, 1995, all of these taxpayers will have to \nfile amended tax returns.\n  Each day that passes without final action on this bill means \nthousands of taxpayers will be subject to the extra time, expense, and \nbother of filing an amended return. This is because many self-employed \ntaxpayers do not want to wait for the last minute to file their tax \nreturn. Sometimes it seems that only Congress waits until the last \nminute to do important things.\n  Many taxpayers have already had to file their returns. We have \nalready missed the deadline for those taxpayers who are engaged in the \nbusiness of farming or ranching. Because of the estimated payment \nrules, those taxpayers face a practical deadline of March 1 for their \ntax returns. Therefore, many thousands of taxpayers are already facing \nthe prospect of filing an amended tax return, because of slow \ncongressional action.\n  In case some of our colleagues mistakenly believe that filing an \namended tax return is merely a minor inconvenience, Mr. President, let \nme mention a couple of facts that may clarify this. First off, we need \nto recognize that filing an amended tax return is no simple \n[[Page S4685]]  affair for the those who are intimidated by IRS tax\n forms, and who is not? There is a special form, called Form 1040X, \nwhich comes with its own special instructions, that is used for making \ncorrections to a previously filed tax return. Getting one of these \nforms usually requires a trip to the post office or library. This form \nis much different than the normal Form 1040. Filling it out requires \ntime and effort in reading and understanding the instructions. In \nessence, the taxpayer must recompute his or her tax after including the \ndeduction for the health care insurance. This can be complicated and \nconfusing.\n\n  As all of my colleagues know, many taxpayers do not even bother to \nfill out their own tax returns. They have concluded that our tax system \nis so complex and intimidating that they pay professionals to prepare \ntheir returns for them. These taxpayers face an additional burden \nbeyond the hassle of having to go find a Form 1040X and learning how to \nfill it in. They must go back to their tax preparer and have him or her \nfile the amended return. This means additional cost.\n  And, frankly, the processing of amended returns is not free for the \nIRS either. It just seems sensible to me that Congress get this \nlegislation passed in a timely fashion.\n  Not only does H.R. 831 take care of the deduction for 1994, it also \nmakes the deduction permanent at 30 percent. This is an important \nfeature of the bill and positive move toward better tax policy. I have \nlong been troubled by Congress' tendency toward making certain tax \nprovisions temporary. Temporary tax provisions make for poor tax \npolicy, plain and simple. They also increase taxpayer cynicism for \nCongress. By making the deduction permanent, H.R. 831 will increase \ntaxpayers' confidence in our tax system and assist them in planning.\n  I am also glad to see that the Finance Committee was able to increase \nthe percentage of the deduction from 25 to 30 percent. However, we must \nnot forget that our ultimate goal for this deduction should be to \nincrease it to 100 percent. This is a matter of fairness, Mr. \nPresident. The fact of the matter is that our tax system discriminates \nagainst the self-employed, in that individuals who work for \ncorporations as employees are allowed to totally exclude 100 percent of \ntheir employer-provided health insurance. This is equivalent to a 100-\npercent deduction. Why should a worker who takes risks by creating a \nbusiness and working for himself or herself be penalized by only being \nable to deduct a portion of his or her health care expenses? Our tax \ncode should encourage entrepreneurship, not discourage it. So, I hope \nwe can increase the percentage of deductibility up to 100 percent later \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, I am most pleased that the majority leader was able to \ngain a unanimous-consent agreement to consider this bill in an \nexpedited manner and to keep it clean of all amendments. This shows \nthat my colleagues agree that, in the midst of many important issues, \nenacting this bill as soon as possible to avoid extra time,\n hassle, and expense for these taxpayers, stands out as the most \nimportant priority today. I congratulate Senator Dole for his \nleadership and all of my colleagues for their bipartisanship and \nforbearance in attempting to amend this bill.\n\n  I especially want to thank those Senators who have expressed major \nreservations with the revenue offsets contained in the bill for \nagreeing to the unanimous-consent agreement. Like most bills considered \nby Congress, this one is far from perfect. H.R. 831 includes some \nparticularly interesting, though controversial, provisions that have \nbeen included to offset the revenue loss associated with extending and \nmaking permanent the deduction for health insurance expenses.\n  Indeed, I have my own concerns about two of these provisions. First, \nI am not pleased with the portion of the bill that retroactively \nrepeals section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code, dealing with \nminority tax certificates for the sale of broadcast or cable \nfacilities. I recognize that many of our colleagues believe that this \nprovision represented an unwarranted tax benefit, or even a huge \nloophole, that needed to be retroactively closed. However, by setting \nthe effective date of the repeal of section 1071 to a date prior to the \ndate of enactment of this bill, we will cause a handful of taxpayers \nwho had consummated or nearly consummated transactions in full reliance \non the law to suffer financial setbacks. I do not believe that this is \nfair. Nevertheless, Mr. President, because the greater need of \nimmediately taking care of the long-promised health insurance deduction \nfor millions of self-employed taxpayers outweighs the fairness concern \nfor a handful of taxpayers, I did not attempt to change this bill in \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I am also less than satisfied that the provisions dealing with taxing \nthose who renounce their U.S. citizenship are the best that we could \ndo. The Finance Subcommittee on Taxation held a hearing on this issue \nthis week, and we heard a great deal of concern from the witnesses that \nthis provision should be changed to ensure fairness and consistency \nwith sound tax policy. Again, because of the necessity of moving this \nbill toward final passage in the fastest possible manner, I have \nwithheld from offering any amendments to improve this provision. As \nthis bill goes to conference with the House, I would urge the conferees \nto see if improvements can be made, so long as those improvements do \nnot delay enactment of the bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I again want to thank the leaders and \nour colleagues for showing a great deal of leadership and restraint in \nbringing this matter to the floor under an agreement that lets us move \nthis bill quickly. This is what our constituents want and this is what \nmakes the most sense from a tax policy point of view.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4684-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4685-S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  INDIAN SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, S. 285 would bring some fairness to our \nFederal social services program by setting aside 3 percent of the \nFederal title 20 social services block grant funds to be used solely by \nnative American tribes and tribal organizations. This change would \nprovide tribes with a badly needed $84 million annually for social \nservices; including special education, rehabilitation, aid to \ndisadvantaged children, legal support, and developmental disabilities.\n  Mr. President, this change must be made. There is ample evidence that \nmany States are not treating native Americans fairly when allocating \ntitle 20 funds. A recent report by the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services found unfair treatment of \nnative Americans by the States to be pervasive, with 15 of the 24 \nStates with large native American populations allocating no title 20 \nfunds to tribes from 1989 to 1993.\n  Why have native Americans been denied funds that we have \nappropriated? In part, this is because the Federal Government gives all \ntitle 20 funds directly to State governments instead of awarding part \nof the funds to tribes. Moreover, States are neither required nor \nencouraged to share funds with tribes as a condition of receiving title \n20 funding. This is one case where ``giving money to the States'' adds \nanother step of bureaucracy.\n  There are few places in America where the need for social services is \ngreater then in Indian country. Yet these needs are obviously not being \nmet. The tribal counsels of the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, \nFort Belknap, Rocky Boy, Blackfeet, and Flathead Indian Reservations in \nMontana have expressed their frustrations to me. We have a trust \nresponsibility to see that the needs of our first Americans are met; \nthat the men, women, and children living too often in poverty on Indian \nreservations are given an opportunity to help themselves.\n  In recent years, Federal funding for tribes has fallen significantly. \nIn 1993, 471 of the 542 federally recognized tribes received no child \nwelfare funding under title IV-B because the eligibility criteria and \naward formulas effectively exclude many tribes. Furthermore, although \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior provides \nthe largest amount of Federal funding for tribal child welfare \nservices, the Indian Child Welfare Act, for example, does not assign to \nany Federal agency the responsibility for assuring State compliance \nwith its requirements.\n  [[Page S4686]] It is time to change our policy and provide direct \nfunding to tribes under title 20.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4685-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF GLENN T. CARBERRY, NORWICH CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to extend my warm congratulations to \nattorney Glenn T. Carberry, of Norwich, CT, who was recently named \nCitizen of the Year by the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce.\n  A long-time community and political activist in Norwich, Glenn has \nserved as vice chairman and economic development chairman of the \nchamber, fundraising chairman of the American Cancer Society, and \ndirector of the Norwich Lion's Club. Glenn, managing partner of the New \nLondon law firm Tobin, Levin, Carberry & O'Malley, has also served on \nnumerous civic committees and boards, including the Mohegan Park \nAdvisory Committee, the Eastern Connecticut Housing Opportunities \nCommission, and the United Community Services Commission.\n  The best example of Glenn's commitment to the community was his \nleadership of a successful community-wide effort to bring the minor \nleague Albany Yankees to Norwich. As an avid baseball fan, Glenn \nstudied the history of minor league baseball and envisioned enormous \npotential for a new Connecticut team. For months, he worked tirelessly \nto turn his dream into reality. Securing permits and garnering \nfinancial support from State and community leaders, Glenn was the key \nto the project's success. The team, now known as the Norwich \nNavigators, will officially open its first season in Connecticut on \nApril 17 at the Thomas Dodd Memorial Stadium.\n  As a result of Glenn's efforts, thousands of families will have the \nopportunity to see the Norwich Navigators in action. In addition to its \nentertainment value, the Navigators and the team's new stadium have \nalready had a tremendous and long-lasting impact on the regional \neconomy. Hundreds of construction jobs have been filled, and hundreds \nmore service-related positions will be created in the coming months. \nEastern Connecticut also expects the tourism industry and local small \nbusinesses to expand and prosper because of the team.\n  In keeping with the tradition of the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of \nCommerce, Glenn has wholeheartedly championed the economic interests of \neastern Connecticut. Through his advocacy of economic growth and \ncommerce, he has provided a wonderful example of citizenship and \ncommunity responsibility. He is a tremendous asset to Norwich and the \nentire State of Connecticut. Without question, Glenn Carberry is the \nCitizen of the Year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New London Day on \nGlenn Carberry be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editional was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Glenn Carberry's Talents--This Norwich Attorney Has Developed a Clear \n Vision of How Social, Economic Progress Depend on Regional Cooperation\n\n       The Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce recognized a \n     real go-getter in choosing attorney Glenn Carberry as citizen \n     of the year. The award speaks most directly to his \n     championing the successful effort to attract the Norwich \n     Navigators' Yankee baseball team, but Mr. Carberry deserves \n     the award for more important reasons.\n       He has committed his considerable talents as a lawyer, \n     politician and economic-development specialist to shape a \n     regional sense of community.\n       He understood early on what others only recently have \n     learned and what still others have yet to understand; that \n     economic development is regional. More than that point, \n     however, Mr. Carberry knows that the benefits of an orderly \n     society that prospers and offers opportunity to a broad range \n     of citizens happen only when people understate their \n     differences and recognize their similarities.\n       Mr. Carberry, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the \n     2nd District, has served as an adviser to the Rowland \n     campaign and administration, on the Otis Library Board, in \n     efforts to provide housing through several agencies, and as \n     an active member of the chamber in Norwich.\n       The Eastern Connecticut Chamber will honor him at a dinner \n     April 7 at the Ramada Hotel in Norwich. Perhaps the most \n     fitting tribute to this impressive young man, however, would \n     be continued efforts to form a regional organization that \n     merges the Eastern Chamber with the Southeastern Connecticut \n     Chamber of Commerce in New London.\n       Such a chamber would exemplify the progressive thinking and \n     regional outlook that has made Mr. Carberry a leader for \n     progress in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4686-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATING RICO TYLER AND CYNTHIA HILL-LAWSON\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Both Rico, in his \nwork with the astronomy program at Franklin-Simpson High School, and \nCynthia, who teaches math at Beaumont Middle School in Lexington, have \ndemonstrated that they are committed to providing a quality education \nto their students. I am very proud of them--as I am sure their friends, \ncolleagues and family are--for they represent the triumphs in our \neducational system that often go unheralded.\n  Again, Mr. President, I congratulate Rico and Cynthia for this \ntremendous achievement and wish them many more years of success in the \nclassroom.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4686-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDING.\n\n       The Congress finds that effective steps for improving the \n     efficiency and proper management of Government operations \n     will be promoted if a moratorium on the effectiveness of \n     certain significant final rules is imposed \n     [[Page S4688]]  in order to provide Congress an opportunity \n     for review.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON REGULATIONS; CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Reporting and Review of Regulations.--\n       (1) Reporting to congress.--\n       (A) Before a rule can take effect as a final rule, the \n     Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each \n     House of the Congress a report containing--\n       (i) a copy of the rule;\n       (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule;\n       (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule; and\n       (iv) a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the \n     rule, if any.\n       (B) Upon receipt, each House shall provide copies to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of each committee with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) Effective date of significant rules.--A significant \n     rule relating to a report submitted under paragraph (1) shall \n     take effect as a final rule, the latest of--\n       (A) the later of the date occurring 45 days after the date \n     on which--\n       (i) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     paragraph (1); or\n       (ii) the rule is published in the Federal Register;\n       (B) if the Congress passes a joint resolution of \n     disapproval described under section 4 relating to the rule, \n     and the President signs a veto of such resolution, the \n     earlier date--\n       (i) on which either House of Congress votes and fails to \n     override the veto of the President; or\n       (ii) occurring 30 session days after the date on which the \n     Congress received the veto and objections of the President; \n     or\n       (C) the date the rule would have otherwise taken effect, if \n     not for this section (unless a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 4 is enacted).\n       (3) Effective date for other rules.--Except for a \n     significant rule, a rule shall take effect as otherwise \n     provided by law after submission to Congress under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (b) Termination of Disapproved Rulemaking.--A rule shall \n     not take effect (or continue) as a final rule, if the \n     Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval described \n     under section 4.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--\n       (1) Presidential determinations.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section (except subject to paragraph (3)), \n     a rule that would not take effect by reason of this Act may \n     take effect, if the President makes a determination under \n     paragraph (2) and submits written notice of such \n     determination to the Congress.\n       (2) Grounds for determinations.--Paragraph (1) applies to a \n     determination made by the President by Executive order that \n     the rule should take effect because such rule is--\n       (A) necessary because of an imminent threat to health or \n     safety or other emergency;\n       (B) necessary for the enforcement of criminal laws; or\n       (C) necessary for national security.\n       (3) Waiver not to affect congressional disapprovals.--An \n     exercise by the President of the authority under this \n     subsection shall have no effect on the procedures under \n     section 4 or the effect of a joint resolution of disapproval \n     under this section. --\n       (d) Treatment of Rules Issued at End of Congress.--\n       (1) Additional opportunity for review.--In addition to the \n     opportunity for review otherwise provided under this Act, in \n     the case of any rule that is published in the Federal \n     Register (as a rule that shall take effect as a final rule) \n     during the period beginning on the date occurring 60 days \n     before the date the Congress adjourns sine die through the \n     date on which the succeeding Congress first convenes, section \n     4 shall apply to such rule in the succeeding Congress.\n       (2) Treatment under section 4.--\n       (A) In applying section 4 for purposes of such additional \n     review, a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be treated \n     as though--\n       (i) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the 15th \n     session day after the succeeding Congress first convenes; and\n       (ii) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect \n     the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that a report must be \n     submitted to Congress before a final rule can take effect.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--A rule described \n     under paragraph (1) shall take effect as a final rule as \n     otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of \n     this section).\n       (e) Treatment of Rules Issued Before This Act.--\n       (1) Opportunity for congressional review.--The provisions \n     of section 4 shall apply to any significant rule that is \n     published in the Federal Register (as a rule that shall take \n     effect as a final rule) during the period beginning on \n     November 20, 1994, through the date on which this Act takes \n     effect.\n       (2) Treatment under section 4.--In applying section 4 for \n     purposes of Congressional review, a rule described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated as though--\n       (A) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--The effectiveness \n     of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise \n     provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or \n     effect under section 4.\n       (f) Nullification of Rules Disapproved by Congress.--Any \n     rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or \n     effect by the enactment of a joint resolution under section 4 \n     shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect.\n       (g) No Inference to be Drawn Where Rules Not Disapproved.--\n     If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 4, no court or agency may infer any \n     intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the \n     Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term \"joint resolution\" means only a joint \n     resolution introduced after the date on which the report \n     referred to in section 3(a) is received by Congress the \n     matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: \n     ``That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the ____ \n     relating to ____, and such rule shall have no force or \n     effect.'' (The blank spaces being appropriately filled in.)\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) In general.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be referred to the committees in each House of Congress \n     with jurisdiction. Such a resolution may not be reported \n     before the eighth day after its submission or publication \n     date.\n       (2) Submission date.--For purposes of this subsection the \n     term ``submission or publication date'' means the later of \n     the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 3(a)(1); or\n       (B) the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n       (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which is referred a \n     resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported such \n     resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 20 \n     calendar days after the submission or publication date \n     defined under subsection (b)(2), such committee may be \n     discharged by the Majority Leader of the Senate or the \n     Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, as the case \n     may be, from further consideration of such resolution and \n     such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (d) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged \n     (under subsection (c)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution, and all points of order \n     against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the \n     resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order.\n       (3) Final passage.--Immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a resolution described in subsection (a), and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall \n     occur.\n       (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n     relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to a resolution described in subsection \n     (a) shall be decided without debate.\n       (e) Treatment if Other House Has Acted.--If, before the \n     passage by one House of a resolution of that House described \n     in subsection (a), that House receives from the other House a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), then the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The resolution of the other House shall \n     not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Final passage.--With respect to a resolution described \n     in subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (f) Constitutional Authority.--This section is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, \n     [[Page S4689]]  respectively, and as such it is deemed a part \n     of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only \n     with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in \n     the case of a resolution described in subsection (a), and it \n     supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n     inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 5. SPECIAL RULE ON STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL \n                   DEADLINES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any deadline for, relating \n     to, or involving any significant rule which does not take \n     effect (or the effectiveness of which is terminated) because \n     of the enactment of a joint resolution under section 4, that \n     deadline is extended until the date 12 months after the date \n     of the joint resolution. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect a deadline merely by reason of the \n     postponement of a rule's effective date under section 3(a).\n       (b) Deadline Defined.--The term ``deadline'' means any date \n     certain for fulfilling any obligation or exercising any \n     authority established by or under any Federal statute or \n     regulation, or by or under any court order implementing any \n     Federal statute or regulation.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any \n     ``agency'' as that term is defined in section 551(1) of title \n     5, United States Code (relating to administrative procedure).\n       (2) Significant rule.--The term ``significant rule'' means \n     any final rule, issued after November 9, 1994, that the \n     Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget finds--\n       (A) has an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \n     more or adversely affects in a material way the economy, a \n     sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \n     environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or \n     tribal governments or communities;\n       (B) creates a serious inconsistency or otherwise interferes \n     with an action taken or planned by another agency;\n       (C) materially alters the budgetary impact of entitlement, \n     grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and \n     obligations of recipients thereof; or\n       (D) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of \n     legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles \n     set forth in Executive Order 12866.\n       (3) Final rule.--The term ``final rule'' means any final \n     rule or interim final rule. As used in this paragraph, \n     ``rule'' has the meaning given such term by section 551 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 7. CIVIL ACTION.\n\n       An Executive order issued by the President under section \n     3(c), and any determination under section 3(a)(2), shall not \n     be subject to judicial review by a court of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY; SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--This Act shall apply notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law.\n       (b) Severability.--If any provision of this Act, or the \n     application of any provision of this Act to any person or \n     circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such \n     provision to other persons or circumstances, and the \n     remainder of this Act, shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 9. EXEMPTION FOR MONETARY POLICY.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall apply to rules that concern \n     monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open \n     Market Committee.\n\n     SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and shall apply to any significant rule that takes \n     effect as a final rule on or after such effective date.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator Reid \nand myself and several other Senators discussed at length yesterday, so \nI do not think I have to go into too much detail.\n  But just to summarize what this amendment would do, this amendment \nwould provide for a 45-day congressional review of regulations--all \nregulations. Significant regulation would have a moratorium. They would \nbe suspended for 45 days.\n  This would give Congress an expedited procedure to where we could \nrepeal or reject those regulations if we deem it necessary. We could \nreject any of the regulations, whether they be significant or whether \nthey be smaller regulations.\n  We also have a look back. We can look back at the significant \nregulations that were enacted since November 20, 1994, and have a \nchance to reject or repeal those. Those regulations would not be \nsuspended. They would still be in effect, but if Congress so desired, \nif we were successful in passing a resolution of disapproval through \nboth Houses and if that resolution is signed by the President, then \nthose regulations would be repealed.\n  Likewise, on any of the prospective regulations that might come out, \nwe would have 45 days for an expedited procedure, and if Congress \npassed a resolution of disapproval, then those regulations would be \nstopped. Of course, again, the President would have the opportunity to \nveto that resolution and we would have the opportunity to override that \nveto.\n  Mr. President, I think this is good reform. It is a substitute to the \nbill as reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I think, \nfrankly, in my opinion, it is a significant improvement. I was a \nsponsor of the bill that came out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We had 36 cosponsors. That is the so-called reg moratorium.\n  Some of my colleagues have labeled that bill draconian, they say it \nwill be a disaster, so on. My final analysis was that bill would not do \nvery much because the bill, as reported to the House, pertained to all \nregulations with lots of exceptions. When it was reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, it applied to significant regulations.\n  To put this in a framework, the administration on November 14 \npublished in the Federal Register that they were reviewing and working \non 4,500 rules and regulations that would be effective for the years \n1995, 1996, and 1997--4,500. Many of those had significant economic \nimpact. I thought we should have a review of those or stop those. But \nthe bill that passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee applied \nonly to significant. That would be several hundred, maybe 800 or 900 \nout of the 4,500, and then the Governmental Affairs Committee had \nseveral exceptions.\n  We had several exceptions when we introduced the bill. I believe we \nhad eight exceptions: For imminent public health and safety; exceptions \nfor actions that would streamline the process and make Government work \nmore efficiently and effectively; exceptions dealing with criminal \nstatutes.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee had a lot more exceptions. The net \nresult was, in my opinion, the bill passed out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee was a temporary moratorium. It would only last until \nCongress passed a comprehensive reform bill. My guess is we will \nprobably do that in 2 or 3 months. So instead of having a year \nmoratorium as people anticipated, the bill said it would last until the \nend of the year or until Congress passed a comprehensive regulatory \nreform bill. I think we will do that in a couple of months. I hope we \ndo. I think it is important to do with cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment. So my guess is the temporary moratorium would only last a \ncouple months.\n And then, like I said, it would apply not only to significant \nregulations. The bill before us gives Congress an expedited procedure \nto reject all regulations, whether significant or not. I think it is \nmore permanent, because we are talking about permanent statutory \nchange. So not only this Congress--not just for the next 100 days or \nfor this year--but this Congress and future Congresses will have the \nright and the responsibility, in my opinion, to not only review, but to \nanalyze these regulations and to reject those that we find are too \nexpensive, reject those we find do not make sense. Again, it applies to \nall regulations, not just to the significant ones.\n\n  I think it is an improvement on the bill as reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I thank Senator Roth and other \ncolleagues for their work on that. I know it was not an easy markup in \nconference.\n  I think the substitute we have today, which is supported by Senators \nDole, Roth, and several others, is a better substitute for another \nreason. It is bipartisan. I want to compliment Senator Reid for his \ncosponsoring this approach, as well as several other colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle that have mentioned to me they think this is a \ngood approach. This should actually pass regardless of whether you have \na Republican-controlled Congress or a Democrat-controlled Congress. \nThis says Congress should be making the decision. Congress should use \ntheir oversight and should have the responsibility to make sure the \nbureaucrats, the regulators, actually follow through \n[[Page S4690]]  with our intentions and desires on legislation. This \nwill give us that responsibility.\n  I am optimistic. I think this is a good substitute, one that deserves \nvery strong bipartisan support. I hope we have a very strong vote in \nthe Senate later today and one that I hope my colleagues in the House \nwould concur is an improvement over the House-passed bill and, \nhopefully, they will recede to the Senate when we go to conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, might I inquire, what is the parliamentary \nprocedure now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma offered an amendment \nto the committee substitute for S. 219.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The substitute is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 411 to Amendment No. 410\n\n(Purpose: To condemn the conviction and sentencing of American citizens \n                             held in Iraq)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 411 to amendment No. 410.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING AMERICAN CITIZENS HELD IN \n                   IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Saturday, March 25, 1995, an Iraqi court sentenced \n     two Americans, William Barloon and David Daliberti, to eight \n     years imprisonment for allegedly entering Iraq without \n     permission.\n       (2) The two men were tried, convicted, and sentenced in \n     what was reported to be a very brief period during that day \n     with no other Americans present and with their only legal \n     counsel having been appointed by the Government of Iraq.\n       (3) The Department of State has stated that the two \n     Americans have committed no offense justifying imprisonment \n     and has demanded that they be released immediately.\n       (4) This injustice worsens already strained relations \n     between the United States and Iraq and makes resolution of \n     differences with Iraq more difficult.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--The Senate strongly condemns the \n     unjustified actions taken by the Government of Iraq against \n     American citizens William Barloon and David Daliberti and \n     urges their immediate release from prison and safe exit from \n     Iraq. Further, the Senate urges the President of the United \n     States to take all appropriate action to assure their prompt \n     release and safe exit from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution and not really related to the bill at hand. But it responds \nto an urgent matter.\n  On Saturday morning, March 25, an Iraqi judge sentenced two American \ncitizens, David Daliberti and William Barloon, to 8 years in prison for \nillegal entry into Iraq, under paragraph 24 of Iraq's residence law.\n  Apparently, the men had innocently and mistakenly entered Iraqi \nterritory last March 13 while attempt to go visit friends at the U.N. \nobserver mission in the demilitarized zone.\n  According to the State Department, no American official was present \nat the trial, which lasted about 1\\1/2\\ hours. Both Americans were \nrepresented by a court-appointed Iraqi attorney. The Polish \nauthorities, who are representing us in Iraq, were given less than an \nhour's notification before the trial was to begin.\n  One of those Americans sentenced, William Barloon, is from New \nHampton, IA. He is an engineer for the McDonnell Douglas Corp. He has \nlived, for the past 2 years, in Kuwait with his wife, Linda, and their \nthree children. His family and friends are rightfully shocked, angered, \nand frustrated by the sentence. I share the concerns of Mr. Barloon's \nfamily and friends in Iowa and offer this amendment to publicly support \nthem to do whatever I can to ensure the prompt and swift return of \ntheir loved one.\n  I have been, and my staff has been, closely monitoring the diplomatic \nefforts underway and have expressed my concern to the Secretary of \nState, Warren Christopher.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no justification for these \nsentences. These two Americans, who work for private contractors in \nKuwait, inadvertently crossed over into Iraq when attempting to visit \nfriends in the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait. They \ncommitted no offense justifying jail sentences. Allegations of \nespionage to the contrary, these men were not in Iraq for any nefarious \npurpose. They did not commit any criminal actions.\n  In addition, Mr. President, their stay in Iraq was very brief. They \nhad then attempted to return back into Kuwait, probably when they \ndiscovered that they had crossed over. According to the State \nDepartment, they were merely charged with being in Iraq illegally, \nwithout proper documents, in violation of that country's residence law.\n  Mr. President, I have long been a defender of human rights throughout \nthe world. And today I rise to speak out in defense of the human rights \nof two Americans unjustly sentenced to 8 years in prison for what \nessentially amounts to an honest mistake of not knowing where they \nwere.\n  Imprisonment in this case is unconscionable. Both Mr. Daliberti and \nMr. Barloon, on the basis of their fundamental human rights and \nhumanitarian considerations, should be immediately and unconditionally \nreleased.\n  Finally, it has been suggested that Iraq may be seeking to take \nadvantage of this incident as leverage in whatever real or perceived \ngrievances Iraq has with the United States, or to gain some advantage \ninternationally. I do not know if that is the case. I do not wish to \ncomment on that. I just hope it is not the case. But if that is the \ncase, then I urge them to reconsider using this incident in such a \nmanner, because I can tell you one thing--any attempt to use this \nincident in such a manner can only be counterproductive, there is \nnothing for Iraq to gain by using this incident in the hopes of gaining \nleverage in bilateral or international relations.\n  I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this amendment. It will \nput the United States Senate on record as condemning Iraq's actions in \nthis case and urges the President to take all appropriate measures to \nsecure the immediate release of Mr. Daliberti and Mr. Barloon so they \nmay be reunited with their family and friends.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record \ntwo articles from The New York Times of this morning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           In Hometowns, Spy Charges by Baghdad Are Dismissed\n\n                           (By Dirk Johnson)\n\n       New Hampton, IA, March 27.--This Iowa town was draped in \n     yellow ribbons today in a gesture of support for its native \n     son, William Barloon, who with another American, David \n     Daliberti, has been sentenced to an eight-year prison term in \n     Iraq after their puzzling foray into that country two weeks \n     ago.\n       Nobody here could imagine any good reason for the two men \n     to cross the Kuwaiti border, which is marked with a 10-foot-\n     deep, 16-foot-wide trench. Even so, friends and family of the \n     two men, civilian workers for American defense contractors in \n     Kuwait, scoff at the accusation by Iraq that the men were \n     involved in underhanded activity.\n       ``From what I know of Billy, I don't think he'd make a very \n     good spy,'' said Kevin Kennedy, a lawyer in this town of \n     4,000, adding that Mr. Barloon was ``better at telling a \n     story than keeping a secret.''\n       Mr. Daliberti's father, Raymond Daliberti, said it was \n     ridiculous to believe that his soon was a spy. ``If he is, he \n     must be the dumbest spy in the world,'' the elder Mr. \n     Daliberti said in Jacksonville, Fla.\n       State Department officials, who have denounced the prison \n     sentences, say the two men mistakenly crossed into Iraqi \n     territory while trying to visit friends in the demilitarized \n     zone between Kuwait and Iraq.\n       Mr. Barloon, 39, worked for the McDonnell Douglas \n     Corporation in Kuwait on support crews for F-18 fighter jets. \n     Mr. Daliberti, 41, worked for Kay and Associates, a \n     subcontractor for McDonnell Douglas.\n       A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, Tom Williams, said the \n     men ``wound up in Iraq by accident--an honest mistake.'' He \n     said he had no details to add to the reports of officials in \n     Washington.\n       Mr. Barloon, who moved away from here in 1973, grew up in a \n     brick-and-frame house on Hamilton Street, where his mother, \n     Mary Rethamel, still lives. His father, Ed Barloon, a tavern \n     owner, drowned in a quarry here when the son was about 5. As \n     a teen-ager, he worked summers at a truck stop, and joined \n     the Navy after his junior year in high school.\n       The Rev. Carl Schmitt, pastor of St. Joseph's Roman \n     Catholic Church, whose elementary school Mr. Barloon \n     attended, said townspeople here were indignant over the \n     severity of the punishment imposed by Iraq.\n       [[Page S4691]] ``We feel devastated and frustrated,'' \n     Father Schmitt said. ``People are trying to deal with the \n     anger. I tell people we aren't going to gain anything by \n     spreading more hatred in the world.''\n       Mr. Daliberti was born in Tennessee, but spent most of his \n     childhood in Jacksonville, where his father worked as an \n     aviator machinist at Cecil Field Naval Air Station, and where \n     he would develop a passion for jets. After four years in the \n     Navy and a string of civilian jobs near Jacksonville, Mr. \n     Daliberti took a job in Kuwait three years ago as a trainer \n     of mechanics on F-18 jets.\n       ``He loved the people over there and was getting along \n     great,'' his father said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n      United States Denies Two Americans Entered Iraq as Saboteurs\n\n                         (By Steven Greenhouse)\n\n       Washington, March 27.--The Clinton Administration today \n     rejected assertions from Baghdad that two Americans being \n     held prisoner there had crossed into Iraq as saboteurs or \n     spies.\n       White House and State Department officials said again today \n     that the two had strayed mistakenly and innocently into Iraq \n     while trying to visit a friend south of the border in Kuwait \n     and did not deserve the eight-year prison sentences an Iraqi \n     court imposed on them on Saturday.\n       ``It was an innocent mistake,'' said Michael D. McCurry, \n     the White House spokesman. ``These two crossed across the \n     border and had no intention to conduct any kind of sabotage \n     at all.'' He also denied their motive was espionage.\n       Saddi Mehdi Saleh, the Speaker of Iraq's Parliament, told \n     The Associated Press today: ``We have no aggressive \n     intentions toward these two Americans. But we have just \n     applied Iraqi law according to the manner we do to all the \n     foreigners who are coming for sabotage or other political \n     reasons.''\n       He added: ``Sending spies or saboteurs, we reject this \n     equation and don't agree with it. The United States of \n     America must understand this fact.''\n       Mr. Saleh later denied that he had said the two Americans \n     planned acts of sabotage. Instead, he asserted that their aim \n     was to create an incident that would prolong United Nations \n     sanctions against Iraq.\n       United States officials said today that the two men--David \n     Daliberti, 41, of Jacksonville, Fla., and William Barloon, \n     39, of New Hampton, Iowa--had apparently made a wrong turn \n     and strayed into Iraq when they were seeking to visit a \n     Danish friend at a United Nations compound in Kuwait, a half-\n     mile south of the Iraqi border.\n       According to interviews with American and United Nations \n     officials, the two Americans drove north from Kuwait City on \n     March 13 to visit their friend, who was in a Danish \n     engineering unit that is part of the 1,142-member United \n     Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission.\n       It is well known that many Westerners who live in Kuwait \n     visit acquaintances who are part of the United Nations \n     mission because alcoholic beverages are readily available in \n     its compounds, unlike elsewhere in Kuwait.\n       The two, who worked on a McDonnell Douglas contract to \n     maintain Kuwaiti military aircraft, were apparently allowed \n     to pass into Iraq by both a United Nations border patrol and \n     an Iraqi border patrol. Iraqi police arrested them a few \n     minutes later when they sought to cross back into Kuwait.\n       One American official said ``we're as baffled as everyone \n     else'' how they could have mistakenly entered Iraq.\n       Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters: ``The \n     sentences were unjustified. These men strayed into Iraq and \n     we certainly think they should be promptly released. There's \n     no basis for the kind of sentences that were imposed.''\n       Mr. Christopher specifically denied suggestions that the \n     two men were working for the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     telling reporters, ``There is no basis for those reports.'' \n     He said such rumors would complicate efforts to win their \n     release ``only if'' the Iraqis ``let it complicate it.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for letting me speak \nand propose this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague, \nSenator Harkin from Iowa, for this amendment. I am sympathetic to it \nand I will support it.\n  I might tell my colleagues we do not expect to vote now, and probably \nwe will ask for the vote. We will check and see on the Democrat side if \nit is OK to vote at 12 noon. If not, we will announce the vote shortly.\n  I am sympathetic for a lot of reasons. Certainly it is an injustice \nwhen we have two American citizens who are working for a company, \nMcDonnell, to be taken hostage and be sentenced for 8 years for \nmistakenly crossing the border.\n  I am sympathetic for another reason, because I found out the hard \nway. We had an Oklahoman that also was taken captive and held in Iraq \nfor some time in 1993, Ken Beaty, an Oklahoman from Mustang, OK. He \nworked for an oil company. He was jailed for 205 days, I tell my \ncolleague, in April 1993 through November 1993. He is 45 years old. \nEventually we were successful. My colleague, Senator Boren, Members \nmight recall, went to Iraq to obtain his release. I hope we will have \neven a speedier resolution for these two individuals. Certainly it is \nan outrage that this type of a sentence was given for an innocent \ntrespass. Eight years is certainly outrageous.\n  I concur with my colleague. The Senate should speak out in this \namendment. I have no objection, and I suspect we will be voting on it \naround 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  I know the managers of the bill--we do not want to load the bill with \namendments and resolutions, but this is important. I appreciate his \nwillingness to go away and get this up and get the Senate to express \nitself on this amendment. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this weekend, the Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission comes to Great Falls for a hearing on the future \nof Malmstrom Air Force Base. And as both the Great Falls community and \nthe BRAC Commissioners prepare for the hearing, I would like to recall \na piece of history many have forgotten.\n  In 1942, as the United States entered the Second World War, President \nRoosevelt and Gen. George Marshall selected Malmstrom Air Force Base \nfor a critically important mission. They chose this to be the main base \nfor Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviet Army.\n  Over the next 3 years, 1942 to 1945, Malmstrom pilots made over \n10,000 flights to the Soviet Union. They gave the Soviet Army trucks, \ntank parts, and other supplies crucial to the defense of Leningrad, the \nBattle of Kursk, and other watershed events in the European theater.\n  Now, you may ask, why Malmstrom?\n  The answer is simple. This air base is practically at the geographic \ncenter of North America. Thus it is the one place that is most secure \nmilitary locations anywhere. At the same time, because flights to \nEurope and Northern Asia fly over the North Pole, there is no \ncontinental airbase closer to Japan and Russia than Malmstrom.\n  So, paradoxically, Malmstrom Air Force Base is among two very \nimportant groups: First, the bases most secure against foreign attack, \nand second, the bases most strategically important in wartime.\n  I am pleased to say that the Air Force recognizes this. In their \nreport to the President last March 1, they said Malmstrom should remain \na principal site for our land-based strategic nuclear forces.\n  But they also made a more puzzling recommendation. They asked the \nPresident to reverse two previous BRAC decisions, and move \nMalmstrom's squadron of KC-135 tanker aircraft to Florida.\n  Though I do not believe this would make much military sense. So I \nhope the BRAC Commissioners look closely at Malmstrom, listen to the \ncommunity, and make the right decision to keep the tankers where they \nare now.\n  As the 1992 BRAC found, Malmstrom is a good place for the tanker \nsquadron, and can support an expanded rather than a contracted flying \nmission.\n  That is no accident. Since the days of Roosevelt and Marshall, the \nAir Force has put a great deal of money into making Malmstrom a top-\nlevel base for our nuclear missiles and for the flying missile. They \nhave done a good job; and they had good reasons to do it.\n  First of all, we may again need Malmstrom's service in wartime.\n  Everything human--whether it is technology, relations between \ngovernments, or anything else--is subject to change. But geography is \nnot. We will \n[[Page S4692]]  never have a better location for a strategic airbase \nthan Malmstrom, which is both invulnerable to naval attack and as close \nas a continental airbase can be to Eurasia.\n  Second, Malmstrom is ideal for peacetime operations. The Great Falls \narea is perfect for Air Force training missions, because they do not \ncall Montana the Big Sky State for nothing.\n  The airspace around Malmstrom is wide open. Visibility is excellent. \nThere are no big mountains or even buildings for that matter nearby. \nAnd the weather is almost always sunny and dry. In fact, Malmstrom has \nthe best flying weather in the area, and is already an alternative \nlanding site for the other bases in the region. And, as the prairie is \nthinly populated, there are very few big metropolitan areas where \nfrequent training missions could annoy local residents.\n  Third, Malmstrom will remain an ideal location for the foreseeable \nfuture. The Cascade County and Great Falls municipal governments work \nclosely with base commanders to keep plenty of open ground between \nMalmstrom and the town.\n  Because we are a thinly populated State, the Air Force can be \nconfident that even if there is substantial local growth, no property \ndeveloper will build right up to the wire.\n  So disruption to the local community will always be minimal. \nComplaints by local citizens will be few or nonexistent. And, perhaps \nmost important, the open ground ensures that base security will always \nbe protected much more effectively than it could be in a heavily urban \narea like MacDill.\n  Finally, of course, Malmstrom has top-quality facilities for flying.\n  It has an airstrip good enough to support 10,000 Lend-Lease flights. \nAnd it has first-class maintenance capability to protect today's high-\nperformance aircraft. In fact, Malmstrom is the only airbase in the \nPacific Northwest with an anticorrosion facility.\n  Mr. President, we are very confident, that a careful, unbiased review \nwill show that Malmstrom Air Force Base is an unequalled national \nsecurity resource. Its strategic location, excellent flying and \nmaintenance facilities, and multiple-mission capability make it a \nperfect site for this tanker squadron.\n  So Great Falls welcomes Commissioners Cox, Davis and Kling to the \ncommunity. They can expect a warm, hospitable Montana reception. And we \nlook forward to the chance to make our case this weekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened to the recent proposals of \nseveral Republican Senators for deep cuts in our foreign assistance \nprogram. Some of these proposals do not mention cuts specifically, but \nthat is the thinly veiled consequence of what they propose. We pride \nourselves for our generosity, but our foreign assistance accounts for \nless than 1 percent of the total Federal budget. These proposals would \ncut that even further, with the deepest cuts in the funds that go to \nhelp the neediest people in the world.\n  I will speak at length on this subject in the coming weeks, but I \nwanted to talk briefly about what are talking about if these proposals \ngain support.\n  At the same time that Republicans are pushing for drastic reductions \nin aid to needy American children and families, they would have us turn \nour backs on people around the world who are even more desperate. Let \nme mention one example, that was described in the Washington Post on \nMarch 17.\n  Uganda, once a prosperous, peaceful country, was destroyed by Idi \nAmin in the 1970's. Today, the average yearly income is $170 per \nperson, and as Uganda struggles to rebuild from civil war it is being \ndestroyed from within again. One of every fifteen Ugandans is HIV \npositive. Half a million Ugandan children have lost a parent to AIDS. \nBy 1998, 10,000 Ugandan children will have died from AIDS, and another \n300,000 children will be infected.\n  In towns like Kakuuto with 70,000 residents, 30 percent of the people \nare either infected with HIV or already suffering from AIDS. There are \n17,000 orphans in that town alone.\n  The article describes a typical girl who became the head of her \nfamily at the age of 13, when her mother died from AIDS. AIDS had \nalready killed her father. She now cares for her four younger brothers \nand sisters.\n  In 1990 I went to Uganda, and I saw the devastation caused by AIDS. I \nsaw the heroic efforts of people there, everyday people, trying to \nfight the epidemic, a battle they could not possibly win without the \nhelp of countries like ours.\n  The article goes on to describe similar stories in Kenya, where \nFather Angelo D'Agostino, a Jesuit priest and a personal friend of \nmine, founded a home in Nairobi for AIDS orphans. He gets calls seeking \na home for 100 AIDS babies every month. He has room for only 80 \nchildren, many of whom watched their parents die.\n  Mr. President, there are more rescissions coming from the House, and \nthere are proposals to cut the foreign assistance program. Meanwhile, \nin Africa there are 10 million people infected with HIV, and the number \ncontinues to climb. Close to a million and a half are children. Many of \nthe HIV infections were spread by sexually transmitted diseases that \nare common wherever there is poverty. These diseases are common in our \nown country, but here we have the vaccines or medicines to cure them. \nThere they do not, and they become HIV positive, and they die.\n  There is no cure for AIDS. Would those who would cut the meager funds \nwe spend to fight AIDS in places like Uganda, or India where it is \nspreading like wildfire among a population of a billion people, have us \nseal our borders? Tell future generations of Americans that if they \nleave our shores they cannot return?\n  Mr. President, this is one of a dozen examples I could mention of \nwhat will happen if we cut these foreign assistance programs. It makes \na great press release today. We might just as well be sentencing our \nchildren and grandchildren to death.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 1995]\n\n   African AIDS Epidemic Creating a Society of Orphans--Hundreds of \n Thousands of Children Left Parentless as Scourge Sweeps the Continent\n\n                          (By Stephen Buckley)\n\n       Kakuuto, Uganda.--Elizabeth Nakaweesi, 17, became head of \n     her household at 13.\n       In 1989, her mother died of AIDS. In 1991, AIDS killed her \n     father. That left Elizabeth to care for her four brothers and \n     sisters, now aged 10 to 15.\n       Instead of spending her days in school, she spends them \n     making straw mats and cultivating her family's half-acre of \n     banana trees. She makes $40 a year.\n       ``It is painful to have no parents,'' Elizabeth said \n     recently, sitting in her family's battered clay hut. ``If \n     they were here, they \n     [[Page S4693]]  would take care of us: we would have the \n     things we do not have.''\n       Nakaweesi's plight has become a familiar one in Africa, \n     where AIDS has left millions of children without parents and \n     has afflicted thousands of others who contracted the AIDS \n     virus through their mothers.\n       Statistics on the impact of AIDS among African children are \n     sketchy but nonetheless grim. UNICEF predicts that by 1999, \n     up to 5 million African children will have lost their mothers \n     to AIDS. Of the 9.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who \n     either have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--which \n     causes AIDS--or the disease itself, an estimated 1.3 million \n     are children.\n       AIDS has ravaged the continent in part because of cultural \n     mores that assent to men having simultaneous sexual \n     partnerships with more than one woman. Researchers also have \n     found that a high rate of nonfatal sexually transmitted \n     diseases among both genders has made Africans more vulnerable \n     to HIV.\n       AIDS specialists fear that the impact of the disease on \n     children will slash school enrollments, roll back gains in \n     infant morality rates and further tax family structures \n     already shattered by political and economic crises in many \n     African countries.\n       Uganda's AIDS crisis is among the most urgent in Africa, as \n     1.5 million of the nation's population of 17 million are HIV-\n     positive. An estimated 519,000 Ugandan children have lost at \n     least one parent to AIDS, and the government reports that by \n     1998 about 150,000 children will have died of it and another \n     300,000 will be infected.\n       ``What we have seen is staggering,'' said Omwony Ojwok, \n     director of the Uganda AIDS Commission. ``The families in \n     particular are simply at a breaking point. You have some \n     adults with 10 orphans in their house, plus their own \n     children. Eventually, you run out of adults to take care of \n     the children.''\n       The town of Kakuuto, three hours west of Kampala, has been \n     hit especially hard. An estimated 30 percent of its 70,000 \n     residents are either HIV-positive or have AIDS. Relief \n     workers estimate that there are 17,000 orphans. Some are left \n     on their own, but many more live with grandparents who often \n     are too old to provide the economic '' and emotional security \n     of a mother and father.\n       Alandrena Nakabiito, 62, was left with six orphans, ages 5 \n     to 13, when two relatives died of AIDS in the early 1990s. \n     Nakabiito, who reared four of her own children, said that she \n     never expected to be cast in this role.\n       ``I never thought of it,'' she said, waving her arms in her \n     dark, narrow, two-room hut. ``I built this small house for \n     myself.'' Now eight people, including Nakabiito's 72-year-old \n     sister, live there.\n       Nakabiito said she makes about $60 a year, adding that she \n     would work harder on her acre of land but age has drained her \n     strength. She digs only in the morning, resting in the \n     afternoon. The slight woman, whose hands bear scars of a hard \n     farm life, said she is especially sad that she cannot help \n     Lucky Nakkazi, the 13-year-old, with her studies. Lucy can go \n     to school only because the World Vision relief organization \n     pays fees for her and about 2,500 other orphans in Kakuuto.\n       ``I would try to help, but I have poor sight at night,'' \n     Nakabiito said, referring to Lucy's school work.\n       Lucy attends Kakuuto Central Primary School, where \n     headmaster Kyeyune Gelazius said that 220 of his 450 students \n     have lost parents to AIDS. he predicts that within five \n     years, 75 percent of his students will be orphans. He said \n     that generally their attendance is sporadic and their \n     behavior disruptive and that they lag academically.\n       ``They don't get the attention they need at home,'' said \n     Gelazius, who has seen 11 relatives die of AIDS. ``Their \n     grandparents are usually too old, and the children don't \n     respect them.''\n       A study in neighboring Tanzania found that children who \n     have lost their mothers to AIDS ``have markedly lower \n     enrollment rates and, once enrolled, spend fewer hours in \n     school'' than youngsters with two parents, the World Bank \n     Research Observer reported. The same study concluded that by \n     2020 the AIDS death rate among children in Tanzania will have \n     cut primary and secondary-school enrollments by 14 and 22 \n     percent, respectively.\n       Doctors also fear that AIDS will wipe out improvements in \n     infant mortality rates over the past decade. For now, the \n     rate remains stable, but a 1994 World Bank report on AIDS in \n     Uganda warned: ``Because of the large numbers of women \n     carrying the virus, there are increasing numbers of infants \n     and children infected. This together with the loss of mothers \n     due to AIDS will increase infant and child mortality \n     significantly.'' At the Kakuuto offices of Doctors of the \n     World, a medical relief group, AIDS program coordinator Fred \n     Sekyewa said babies born to mothers with AIDS have a 25 to 50 \n     percent chance of being infected and that one in three \n     pregnant women examined here tests HIV-positive.\n       Sekyewa added that many women with AIDS have babies because \n     of cultural pressures. ``In African societies it is an \n     abomination for a woman to die without a child,'' he said. \n     ``A woman in her twenties who has AIDS will say, `I must have \n     a child now because I may die before I get the \n     opportunity.'''\n       In Nairobi, Kenya, hundreds of HIV-positive children die in \n     hospitals annually after being abandoned by their mothers. \n     Three years ago, the Rev. Angelo D'Agostino, a Jesuit priest, \n     founded a home in Nairobi for such children. A surgeon and \n     psychiatrist who taught at George Washington University for \n     14 years, D'Agostino said he gets calls from hospitals and \n     social workers seeking homes for 100 AIDS babies every month.\n       D'Agostino, 69, has taken in about 80 children. He said \n     that some have become healthy after receiving a steady diet \n     of nutritious meals and attention.\n       ``They were born with their mother's HIV antibodies, so \n     they initially tested positive. But they never got \n     infected,'' D'Agostino said. ``So after a while, they're \n     fine. But usually these kids die of malnutrition or something \n     else in a hospital; because they once tested positive, \n     everybody gives up on them.''\n       The priest said that his children, most of whom are under \n     5, often show the strains of losing their parents. They cry \n     for hours. They have nightmares. They stare into space.\n       ``They talk about seeing their parents die,'' D'Agostino \n     said. ``They talk about being alone with their 10- or 12-\n     year-old sibling.''\n       Elizabeth Nakaweesi understands their pain. The teenager \n     said she quit school in the sixth grade to care for her young \n     siblings after her parents' deaths because ``there was nobody \n     else to do it.''\n       Elizabeth's father, who died at 51, had collected taxes at \n     the local market. Her mother, who was 39, had cultivated \n     their plot of bananas, sweet potatoes and cassavas.\n       Sometimes, when crops are poor and her straw mats are not \n     selling, Nakaweesi must beg neighbors for help. She said that \n     without assistance from neighbors and World Vision--which \n     pays school fees, bought her a bicycle and provides other \n     necessities--she and brothers and sisters would not survive.\n       Elizabeth works hard to foster a spirit of family teamwork. \n     After her siblings return from school, everyone works in the \n     field before dinner. At supper time, one child fetches water. \n     Another finds firewood. Another picks bananas. Another puts \n     out bowls and eating utensils. Another does the cooking.\n       But the teenager knows that she cannot replace her parents. \n     When she tries to speak of them, tears will in her eyes. She \n     turns her face to the wall.\n       ``They must be mother and father now,'' said Grace Mayanja, \n     a staff worker with World Vision, referring to children in \n     Kakuuto left to raise siblings. ``But in their hearts, \n     they're still little girls.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4692-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4693-S4696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            STOP HIDDEN KILLERS: THE GLOBAL LANDMINE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the years, I have spoken often about \nthe problem of landmines. I have done so on this floor and as a member \nof the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, where I addressed the \nDisarmament Committee of the United Nations. I have been urging the \nU.S. Government and the United Nations to do whatever they can to stop \nthe proliferation and use of antipersonnel landmines.\n  Sometimes when we think of landmines, we think of these huge floating \nmines in a shipping lane, but in fact, what we usually mean is a weapon \nabout the size of a can of shoe polish. Antipersonnel landmines are \ntiny, and in some of them the only metal part is about the size of a \nthumb tack, so it is virtually impossible to detect. They cost about $2 \nor $3, and can be concealed beneath the surface of the ground. They are \nstrewn by the thousands and they explode when somebody steps on them, \nno matter whether that person is a civilian or combatant. They kill an \nestimated 70 people each day. In the 2 hours since the Senate opened \nsession this morning, at least eight people have been killed or maimed \nin the world from landmines. We are talking about 70 people each day, \n26,000 people each year. There are an estimated 85 to 110 million \nlandmines in 60 to 65 countries waiting to explode.\n  To give you some idea of this, parts of the Netherlands, and Denmark, \nare still too dangerous to go into, because of landmines left from \nWorld War II. But the vast majority of these hidden killers have been \nspread in just the past few years. In fact, even though the Russians \nfollowed our lead and declared that it would stop exporting \nantipersonnel landmines, that policy apparently does not apply to \nChechnya. The Russians have been spreading landmines in Chechnya and \ndoing it in such a way that nobody is ever going to know where they \nare--they are being dropped by the thousands out of airplanes--and \nthere will be people, years from now, still dying and being maimed from \nthem.\n  This January, at a press conference attended by representatives of \nsome 40 countries, Secretary of State Christopher announced the release \nof the State Department's report ``Hidden Killers: The Global Landmine \nCrisis.'' \n[[Page S4694]]  It tells the gruesome story of the carnage caused by \nlandmines.\n  Last year alone, on top of that 100 million or so unexploded \nlandmines, we now have another several million that were laid, mostly \nin the former Yugoslavia. Estimates of the cost to locate and remove \nthem are in the tens of billions of dollars. That does not even count \nthe millions of mines that will be laid in the future.\n  Three years ago, almost nobody was paying attention to what has aptly \nbeen called a ``weapon of mass destruction in slow motion.'' Far more \ncivilians have died and been injured by landmines than by nuclear \nweapons.\n  They are a weapon of mass destruction, they just claim their victims \nslowly. Then the Senate passed, by 100-0, an amendment I sponsored to \nhalt U.S. exports of antipersonnel landmines. That is the only time I \nknow of when the U.S. Senate acted with unanimity on an issue of this \nkind.\n  The purpose of that amendment was to focus attention of the landmine \ncrisis and to urge other countries to join us in trying to solve it. \nBecause the Senate acted with such unanimity--Republicans and \nDemocrats, across the political spectrum-- and spurred on by the \nPresident of the United States, Secretary of State Christopher, and \nU.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, 18 other countries have declared \nexport moratoria. Last September, at the United Nations, President \nClinton announced a U.S. goal of the eventual elimination of \nantipersonnel landmines. On December 15, 1994, the U.N. General \nAssembly adopted a U.S. resolution calling on all countries to stop \nexports, and for further efforts toward the goal of the eventual \nelimination of antipersonnel landmines.\n  This is the first time, Mr. President, in recent history, since the \nbanning of chemical weapons, that the world community has singled out a \ntype of weapon for total elimination. It reflects a growing consensus \nthat these weapons are unacceptable because they are indiscriminate, \nand because they are used routinely to terrorize civilian populations.\n  Imagine if the area from the Capitol Building to the Washington \nMonument were seeded with antipersonnel landmines, each one buried in \nthe ground and waiting to explode. Who is going to go there? What if \nall of New England, or all of California, were strewn with mines? That \nis the reality for dozens of countries where millions of people go \nabout their daily lives in fear of losing a leg or an arm, or their \nchildren's lives, from landmines.\n  I remember being in Uganda several years ago. From legislation of \nmine, we started a program to make artificial arms and legs for people \nwho have lost limbs from landmines. My wife, who is a registered nurse, \nwas with me and she saw a young boy, 10 or 12 years old, hopelessly \ncrippled from polio. She could not believe that there was someone who \nwas crippled from polio, when there are such low-cost vaccines.\n  It turned out that UNICEF had sent polio vaccine to Uganda, but that \nlittle boy had not got the vaccine. The medical personnel could not go \nto his part of Uganda, to his village, because of the landmines strewn \naround there. So in a country where to survive it is necessary to be \nable bodied, this little boy is hopelessly crippled.\n  Here is a photograph of a young boy in Mozambique, Mr. President. \nLook at him from the waist down. There is nothing there. Those are two \nwooden legs. Artificial legs in a very poor country, a growing boy who \nwill outgrow them and probably did outgrow them months after this \npicture was taken.\n  Look at this Kurdish boy. Can anyone, as human beings, as parents, \nlook at this and not be horrified? I think of my children, when they \nwere this age. One badly damaged leg. An arm missing at the shoulder. \nThe other leg torn off at the knee. And these children are considered \nthe lucky ones because they were close enough to medical care to get \nhelp. They did not die, as many do, just from the loss of blood.\n  These are not combatants, but these are typical of what I have seen \nevery place I have gone in the world where they have landmines. I am \ntold that you cannot walk down the street of Phnom-Penh without seeing \npeople an arm or leg gone. They say that in Cambodia they are clearing \nthe landmines an arm and a leg at a time.\n  Not only do these weapons endanger civilians most of all--and that is \nwhy they are terrorist weapons--but they kill and maim American \nsoldiers, whether in combat or peacekeeping missions. They threaten our \nPeace Corps volunteers and other Americans who are involved in \nhumanitarian work.\n  Ken Rutherford of Colorado testified here last year. He told about \nbeing in Somalia driving in his jeep, while he was working for the \nInternational Rescue Committee. He heard the blast and the bang, and \nthe next thing he knew he was sitting in shock, holding his foot in his \nhand trying to reattach it to his shattered leg. Of course, that could \nnever be. Ken has courageously gone through painful surgery after \nsurgery, to be able to walk again.\n  Hidden killers is an indictment of a weapon that even Civil War \nGeneral Sherman, who is not remembered as a great humanitarian, called \na violation of civilized warfare over a century ago. A violation of \ncivilized warfare. That is when a tiny number of them were used. Now \nthere are millions.\n  During the month of January, officials of governments, including the \nUnited States, met in Geneva to discuss proposals for strengthening the \nConventional Weapons Convention, the one existing international \nagreement covering the use of landmines. Signed in 1980, the Senate \nfinally ratified it last Friday.\n  I want to praise the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and others, Senator \nHelms, Senator Pell, and Senator Lugar, for bringing the convention \nbefore the Senate for ratification.\n  The fact that the talks are going on in preparation for a U.N. \nconference next September to strengthen the 1980 convention is \nimportant by itself. The convention is universally regarded as woefully \ninadequate, and John Molander, the Swedish chairman of the talks, \ndeserves credit for his efforts.\n  But these negotiations have shown how reluctant governments are to \nturn rhetoric into reality. I mentioned that Russia had said it had \nstopped exports of landmines. I praise President Yeltsin for that. I \nhad talked to him about it personally, as I did Foreign Minister \nKozyrev. Russia is obviously a country that has one of the largest \nstockpiles of landmines and they have the ability to manufacture them.\n  But now we see that they have no reluctance to sow them from \nairplanes over Chechnya. What army is being deterred by that? What \narmy? It is the armies of old women and old men going out to find \nfirewood to make a fire so they do not die from the cold. What army? It \nis an army of little children trying to go to school. Those are the \narmies that are terrified and maimed and killed by the indiscriminate \nuse of landmines.\n  It is a blight, Mr. President, it is a blight. It is a moral blight. \nIt is an evil blight. They should be treated the same way as we treat \npoison gas and chemical warfare. They do not distinguish between \ncivilians and combatants. And yet we there are some who would have us \ngive a Good Housekeeping seal of approval to a certain types of \nlandmines.\n  Balderdash. What difference does it make? A landmine is a landmine. \nCheap, deadly, long-life mines can blow the leg off the best trained, \nbest equipped America soldier. If we treat some antipersonnel mines as \nacceptable, we run the risk of making the goal of eliminating them more \nelusive. Thousands of innocent people will continue to die. Every 15 \nminutes of every day of every year someone--usually an innocent \ncivilian, often a child, or civilian--loses a leg or an arm.\n  Large areas of countries like Bosnia, Angola, and Cambodia have been \ncontaminated with mines. The people cannot return to their fields to \ngrow food, collect water, or firewood without risking their lives. \nTheir children are being blown to pieces when they play outside or walk \nto school.\n  Refugees cannot go home. The Pakistani Ambassador to the United \nNations tells me that over 1 million Afghan refugees are stranded in \nhis country. Why? They cannot go home to Afghanistan; it is littered \nwith landmines. And so they are in an area where they are devastating \nthe forest, causing all kinds of problems and they \n[[Page S4695]]  are an enormous drain on Pakistan because they cannot \ngo back to Afghanistan.\n  It is a global catastrophe. People everywhere are calling for an end \nto this madness. Three weeks ago the Belgium Parliament voted a 5-year \ntotal ban on antipersonnel mines. Mexico, Sweden, Ireland, Estonia, \nColombia, and Cambodia have already announced a total ban.\n  Only a year or two ago that seemed inconceivable. The United States \nhas led the way, and we should continue to lead. We are the only \nsuperpower, and we can afford to set an example. We do not need these \nweapons for our security. What army is going to march against the \nUnited States? We have the most secure borders in the world.\n  Mr. President, we are blessed as no democracy in history has been \nblessed, not only with the resources of our own land and the resource \nof our own people, but with the security we have as a nation. But let \nus think what happens when we set foot outside of our country, when we \nsend humanitarian missions, or send the men and women from our military \nto help in peacekeeping. We find this terrorist weapon used against us. \nAnd we are only the tip of the iceberg, because it is a terrorist \nweapon used most often against those who are most defenseless.\n  We should treat antipersonnel landmines with the same stigma as \npoison gas and other indiscriminate, inhumane weapons. Only when the \nprice of using them is to be branded a war criminal and am \ninternational pariah will this mayhem stop. There are always going to \nbe Saddam Husseins, who would commit any outrage against their own \npeople. But they will become more and more the exception.\n  Last week we did take the next step. We ratified the Conventional \nWeapons Convention, including the landmine protocol. The United States \ncan now participate fully in the conference to amend the convention \nthis September. I intend to go to that conference. I think it is an \nimportant opportunity to try to give the convention the teeth it \ncurrently lacks. Between now and then I will be speaking with the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of State, and others, \nabout ways to strengthen it.\n  Mr. President, there are some weapons that are so inhumane that they \ndo not belong on this Earth. They do not fit in our natural law right \nof self-preservation and defense. Even within that natural law, and \neven with our right of self-defense, we do not have the right to use \nany kind of weapon under any circumstances. Antipersonnel landmines are \nso inhumane that they fall into that category. They have ruined far too \nmany innocent lives already.\n  Anyone who doubts that need only look at these photographs. See what \nhappens. I started speaking 15 minutes ago. During that time this has \nhappened to at least one person on this Earth since I started speaking, \npossibly another child like these. When the Senate recesses this noon--\nand we all in the security of our caucuses and the security of this \nbeautiful building, the symbol of democracy, eat our lunches--a half-\ndozen more people will be killed and maimed somewhere in the world. And \nfor what? Do these children threaten anybody? These children had a life \nhard enough already. Now they have one leg or one arm, or, as in this \ncase, no legs. Can you imagine what their lives are like?\n  I am going to speak again as I have, many, many times before, Mr. \nPresident, about this subject. I will continue to speak about it. I \napplaud and compliment those of my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, who have joined me in this crusade.\n  We should tell the world that we will treat the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines the same way that we treat poison gas and other \nindiscriminate, inhumane weapons, and ban them altogether.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand the pending business is the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct; the Harkin amendment numbered \n411.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 25, an Iraqi court \nsentenced two Americans, David Daliberti of Jacksonville, FL, and \nWilliam Barloon of Iowa, to 8 years in prison. Their crime was an \ninnocent and inadvertent crossing into Iraq from Kuwait.\n  These two men, both of whom were employed by United States \ncontractors working in Kuwait, have been converted from free citizens \nworking in an important area of national responsibility for Kuwait on \nbehalf of United States contractors to prisoners in an Iraqi cell.\n  David Daliberti and his partner have done nothing to deserve this \nsentence. As the observers at the trial last Saturday stated, these men \nare innocent of the charges levied against them. The crossing was an \nhonest mistake. This mistake has been admitted, but it is not a \ncriminal offense.\n  The Iraqis must understand several things. First, that we will not \nallow them to utilize this inadvertent crossing of the border for \npolitical purposes. They must understand that their outrageous action \ntoward these two men is the equal of the outrageous action that they \nhave taken when they refuse to abide by the international standards \nthat would be necessary for a lifting of the economic embargo against \ntheir country; that their use of these two men for political purposes \nwill in no way lead to a lifting of the embargo or a modification of \nthe U.N. resolutions regarding sanctions.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton should be commended for the action \nthat he has taken in this regard. He has been steadfast, he has been \npersonally involved and committed to see that the United States takes \nall efforts within its power and by organizing international forces in \norder to accomplish the objective of the release of these two men.\n  I would also like to thank the representatives of the Polish \nGovernment who represent United States interests in Baghdad. They have, \nas they have done in previous cases, performed a great service for this \ncountry. They have represented our interests well in the past, and I am \nconfident that they will do so on behalf of these two Americans.\n  I have written to the United Nations and received assurance from Mr. \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali that the United Nations will do everything within \nits power to ensure the release of these individuals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter dated March 24, from the Secretary General, relative to the \ncommitment of the United Nations, at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there have been a variety of voices raised \non this matter. The most compelling have been those of the voices of \nthe families directly involved. The family of Mr. David Daliberti live \nin Jacksonville, FL. I have had the opportunity to talk with his \nmother, father, and last Friday with his wife, Kathy. They are, \nobviously, extremely distressed and anxious about the future of their \nson and husband.\n  We must convey to them that it is the commitment of the United States \nof America to do everything within its power to gain the safe and \nexpeditious release of their loved ones. The same commitment will be \nmade to the Barloon family who, I am certain, is experiencing the same \nlevel of anxiety.\n  The Iraqis must understand that we will hold them fully responsible \nfor the treatment that they are according these two innocent men; that \nthey will be held accountable in the court of international opinion and \nlaw for any adverse actions taken against these two Americans.\n  There have been a variety of proposals made, Mr. President, as to \nwhat we should do, ranging from diplomatic to economic to military. I \npersonally believe that we should not take any option off the table. We \nshould not give to Saddam Hussein the confidence that would come by his \nknowing what we will not do.\n   [[Page S4696]] However, affirmatively, I believe that we should \nplace our confidence and place our faith in the individual who has the \nconstitutional responsibility to lead United States efforts in a matter \nof this type, and that is the President of the United States.\n  On Friday, I met with the President at the White House, and I was \nimpressed with the degree to which he was personally knowledgeable of \nthe minute details of this issue; that he had been in personal contact \nwith key figures who have the capability of bringing maximum pressure \nupon the Iraqis, and his commitment to see that these two men are \nreleased as expeditiously and in the best possible circumstances.\n  So, Mr. President, I support the resolution that is before us today. \nI think it is important that the United States Senate send a strong \nsignal to Baghdad as to our outrage at their action and that their \naction will not secure any steps which will be beneficial to the \ncountry of Iraq.\n  The irony is that the control of the future of Iraq and its people, \nthe ability to lift the economic sanctions and to begin a process of \nrestoring Iraq to a membership in an international community of law-\nabiding nations lies totally within the Government of Iraq itself and \nparticularly its leader, Saddam Hussein.\n  For months, that regime has rejected its opportunity and \nresponsibility to take those actions. Now they are potentially \nattempting to use these two innocent Americans as a lever to achieve \nthat result.\n  They shall not succeed. The United States, with our international \nallies and with the coalition that is being organized by President \nClinton, will bring both maximum force, maximum diplomatic, economic \nand, if necessary, other initiatives in order to achieve the release of \nthese men, while at the same time standing firm behind the sanctions \nwhich Iraq imposed upon itself by its lawless activities.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution and \nsend the signals that have the best opportunity to achieve the release \nof these two men to the regime in Baghdad and to reinforce the \nleadership which is being provided by our President in Washington.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 24, 1995.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for your letter of 23 March \n     1995 expressing your grave concern for the two United States \n     citizens who have been detained by the Government of Iraq \n     since 13 March after accidentally crossing the border between \n     Kuwait and Iraq. Please be assured that I share your concern.\n       Since the incident occurred, General Krishna Thapa, the \n     Force Commander of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation \n     Mission (UNIKOM), which is situated along the international \n     border between the two countries, has been repeatedly in \n     contact with Iraqi authorities to ascertain the whereabouts \n     of the two individuals, obtain assurances of their well-\n     being, and urge the Government to release them immediately.\n       Mr. Kofi Annan, Under-Secretary-General for Peace-keeping, \n     has also been in touch with the Permanent Representative of \n     Iraq to the United Nations to protest the incident and to \n     urge the Government of Iraq to take immediate steps to obtain \n     release of the detainees. Mr. Annan is also keeping the \n     Permanent Representative of the United States informed of any \n     developments in this regard as they occur.\n       You may be assured that the United Nations will continue to \n     do everything we can to bring about the rapid release of the \n     detainees. Please convey to their families my deep concern, \n     together with my personal wishes that their families will \n     soon be reunited.\n       Please accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest \n     consideration.\n                                            Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, for his leadership on this issue. The virtual kidnaping of two \ninnocent American businessmen by Iraq is a very serious matter.\n  Obviously, I will vote for this amendment because it strongly \ncondemns the Government of Iraq for its unjustified action. I also \nthink it empowers the President as he strives to assure the prompt \nrelease and safe exit of our two citizens from Iraq.\n  At the same time, though, I want to explain for the Record that in \nvoting for a resolution which urges the President to ``take all \nappropriate action'' in this matter, I do not believe that Congress is \nauthorizing any broad use of military action. While the President may \ninitiate an emergency operation to rescue American citizens, any \nmilitary action beyond that into Iraq would have to be specifically \nauthorized by Congress.\n  I make this point, Mr. President, because I have seen in the past how \nsometimes we quickly and quite appropriately pass some foreign policy \nresolutions to express a sense of the Senate, only to have them \nreinterpreted as a broad authority for some unforeseen or even \nuncontemplated military action later. I hardly expect that to be the \ncase with this amendment, but I wanted to set the record straight from \nthe outset.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the matter before this body?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 410\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 410, \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and I, \namong others, have offered this substitute to S. 219 because we believe \nit is a good solution to the problem of excessive bureaucratic \nregulation.\n  Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor, I outlined in some \ndetail the merits of this substitute amendment. During that period of \ntime, the Senator from Oklahoma and I, in a number of exchanges, laid \nthe foundation for this legislation. What this is all about is the fact \nthat we have too many regulations that, in effect, are given to us--and \nwhen I say ``us,'' I mean the American public--without the Congress \nhaving any ability whatsoever to review these regulations.\n  In fact, Mr. President, since the Chadha decision, the bureaucrats \nhave, in effect, laughed at the Congress. When we were concerned about \nan area in which they were going to promulgate regulations, there was \nnot a thing we could do about it because they, in effect, said you \ntried once to put up a legislative framework to review regulations and \nyou were told by the Supreme Court you could not do it. So, as a result \nof that, I believe personally that we have had a lot of regulations \nthat were unnecessary and, in effect, the bureaucrats have told the \nCongress: We will do what we want.\n  It is estimated by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that complying with \nFederal regulations costs over $500 billion a year. The amount of time \nfilling out paperwork for these same procedures is about 7 billion \nhours--not million, but billion hours. Multiply that times the minimum \nwage, and it is a lot of money. But, of course, it is more than minimum \nwage.\n  Mr. President, we all know that regulations serve a valid purpose if \nthey are implemented properly and they serve the intent, what the \nlegislature intended, in allowing them to go forward with the \nregulations. We all know that the workplace is a lot safer today than \nit was 50 years ago. We know that there are people today who are not \npermanently disfigured as a result of the workplace rules that are in \nplace.\n  We have an airline industry that has the finest safety record of any \nairline industry in the world. We know that we have problems that have \ndeveloped, but, generally speaking, our food regulations allow the \nAmerican public to clearly eat food that is given to them.\n  Some good things have happened. Twenty years ago, Mr. President, 80 \npercent of the rivers were polluted. Now it is 20 percent. It has just \nreversed. It used to be, 20 years ago, that 20 percent of the rivers \nwere unpolluted; now 80 percent of the rivers are not polluted. So we \nhave made progress and a lot of this is because of meaningful \nlegislation and the meaningful implementation of regulations.\n  The problem is, though, that too often Congress passes a law with \ngood intentions and sound policy, only to have the agencies turn these \nsimple laws into complex regulations that even the regulators do not \nunderstand. And certainly they go beyond the intent of Congress.\n  There are a myriad of stories that each of us have in our offices of \nhow businesses, large and small, have to hire large legal departments. \nAnd if that is not enough, they have to have people who specialize in \nother areas, dealing with regulations that have been promulgated.\n  The reality is that Americans have become frustrated and skeptical \nabout our Government. One reason, I believe, is because of the myriad \nof regulations over which they feel and we as a Congress feel we have \nno control.\n  As an example, a survey was conducted by Times Mirror, which found \nthat since 1987, the number of Americans who believe regulations \naffecting business usually do more harm than good has jumped from 55 to \n63 percent. In just these few short years, people feel worse about \ngovernment rather than better. So we should get the message.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I pointed out to the Members of this body \nthe number of regulations that have been placed in effect just since \nthe last election. It is a large number of regulations, about 15 pages \nof very fine print that we have of new regulations.\n  I talked, Mr. President, about some of the--for lack of a better \ndescription--ridiculous things that have happened because of some \nregulations. I talked yesterday about a number of companies. One that I \ntalked about was a New York company which was told to get benzene out \nof its water supply. They said, ``Fine,'' because they knew how much \nbenzene was in their water that they could remove. The manufacturer \nsaid, ``But we will make you a better deal. We have other processes in \nthis plant where we can get rid of significantly more benzene and it \nwill only cost us a fraction more of the $31 million that it would take \nto remove the benzene in the water.''\n  The regulators said, ``No deal.'' So, in effect, they spent $31 \nmillion and removed a little bit of benzene, where they could have \nspent a few dollars more and removed a lot of benzene. But, no; that is \nhow far into space some of these regulations go.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I believe that we need to eliminate \nmany of the problems. To do that, we need to establish a safety \nmechanism that will enable Congress to look at the regulations that are \nbeing promulgated and decide whether they achieve the purpose they are \nsupposed to achieve in a rational, economic, and less burdensome way. \nThe substitute does just that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I have worked for many years in a \nbipartisan fashion to do something about Government regulations. We \napproached this in the past. In fact, last year, this body passed \nlegislation that we introduced which would have put a dollar number on \nregulations that were promulgated.\n  Well, I believe this is a more realistic way to approach the problem. \nThe legislation that we introduced last year that passed was knocked \nout in a conference committee. So this is a bipartisan approach to \naccomplishing the goal of making Government more meaningful.\n  I would like to just mention briefly, Mr. President, that this bill \nprovides a 45-day period where Congress can review new regulations. We \ncan enact a joint resolution of disapproval and we would do it on a \nfast-track basis. If the rule would have an economic impact of over \n$100 million, it is deemed to be significant and the regulation will \nnot go into effect until the 45-day period has expired. This 45-day \nreview will allow Congress to hold Federal agencies accountable before \nthe regulations become, in effect, law and start impacting the \nregulated community.\n  If the rule does not meet the $100 million threshold, the regulation \nwill go into effect but will still be subjected to fast-track review.\n  Even significant regulations may go into effect immediately if the \nPresident, by Executive order, determines that the regulations are \nnecessary for health, safety, national security or are necessary for \nthe enforcement of criminal law. This is not subject to judicial \nreview.\n  On issuing a rule, the Federal agency must forward a report to \nCongress containing a copy of the rule.\n  Mr. President, this 45-day review process will begin when the rule is \nsent to Congress or is published in the Federal Register, whichever is \nsooner.\n  I want to spend just a very brief time talking about the Chadha case. \nIn that case, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had no right to \nveto a regulation unless the President was involved \n[[Page S4698]]  in it; in effect, unless we treated this like regular \nlegislation.\n  In the Chadha instance, the President had no power to do anything. It \nwould just be the Congress would overturn the regulation.\n  No matter whether you agree with the reasoning of the Court or not, \nthat is the rule of the land, and so to meet the problems that were \nencompassed in that decision, the Senator from Oklahoma and I drafted \nthis substitute so that the President would have the right to veto our \nlegislative veto.\n  If a regulation is submitted to us and we do not like it, both Houses \nturn it down, and the President does not like it, he can veto it. The \nonly way we can override his veto is by a two-thirds vote. That is \nfair. I am sorry we have to take it to the President, but that is what \nthe Supreme Court said we have to do.\n  I think this procedure meets all the constitutional requirements that \npeople raised in the past.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can have a strong bipartisan vote on \nthis bill. It is time that we worked together on issues. There is not a \nMember of this body, on either side of the aisle, who does not \nrecognize, I hope, that we have all kinds of problems with regulations. \nIf one goes home to a townhall meeting and there is a businessman \nthere, big or small, that is what they complain about more than \nanything else, the paperwork that is burying them. And in the process \nof burying them, people are losing jobs, and it is just not good for \nthe American process.\n  So I hope that we will respond with a strong vote. This bill sets \nforth procedures that are designed to make sure the process of \nevaluating new regulations does not give an advantage to either the \nPresident or to the Congress. So I hope that we can move forward on \nthis bill at the earliest possible date.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I, too, share the concerns about \nregulations that the Senator from Nevada just talked about. We all have \nheard from our people back home, our constituents, our businessmen, our \nindustry, our farmers, our average citizens about the impact of Federal \nregulations. How we deal with that is something else again. That is \nwhat we are grappling with.\n  We have had a couple things happen here. One, over in the House there \nis H.R. 450, which we view as rather draconian. It would stop \neverything from just a few days after the election on for a year, stop \nall rules and regulations from going into effect.\n  That is draconian in that it throws out the good with the bad. We \nhave a lot of rules. Many of them are final rules and some of them are \nproposed rules that have taken effect since the election last year. \nMany had been in preparation for a year, a year and a half, some of \nthem maybe even a little bit longer than that.\n  But the rules on health and safety, for instance, would be thrown out \nby that House legislation. They would be held up. In other words, the \nprotections against E. coli bacteria, which killed children, or \ncryptosporidium, which killed 100 people in Wisconsin and some 400,000 \nill, were not in effect.\n  Airline safety is another one where we have rules and regulations \nthat would be held up now even though they should be in there.\n  Those are some examples of things that would be held up if we passed \nthat House bill. That is not what we are dealing with today. But the \ncompanion bill in the Senate is S. 219, which was introduced by the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma. S. 219 drew a lot of amendments, a \nlot of fire in committee, enough so that when it was finally voted out \nof committee, over our objections on the minority side, this substitute \nfor it was brought forward.\n  This substitute is a legal veto or legal reconsideration which is a \nlong ways from the original S. 219 that it replaces.\n  If we then sent this legislative veto to the conference with approval \ntoday, and it is goes to conference with the original bill in the \nHouse, H.R. 450, they are poles apart in what they provide; what our \nconcern has been all along is that if we go to conference with the \nHouse and then give in to the House, we could come back with something \ncompletely unacceptable, and it will not be amendable by our rules for \nconsideration of conference reports.\n  There is another situation we have. In the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, we already considered and voted out a regulatory reform \nbill, of which a similar legislative veto like this is a part. I have \nwished, if things had been different, that we would be working on that \nbill on the floor instead of on this measure that only encompasses part \nof the regulatory reform problem.\n  That is not what we are voting on, though, today. I think most of us \nwill probably vote for the legislative veto provision that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has proposed. We do have some perfecting amendments. \nSenator Levin, who is not on the floor at the moment but I understand \nwill be here very shortly, has two or three amendments. I have one I \nmay propose later this afternoon. I think there are a couple on the \nother side of the aisle to be proposed.\n  Regulatory reform is a very, very complex matter. It is not easy. I \nthink we should be taking it up in its entirety and not just piecemeal \nwith things like this where we drag out parts of it for consideration \nand do not consider the other parts of it.\n  Our regulatory reform that we voted out of committee, for instance, \nhad provisions in it for risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for \nrules above $100 million. It had a requirement that all the regulations \nbe reviewed at least once every 10 years. If they were not reviewed, \nthey would be sunset. We had the 45-day legislative veto in that \nlegislation, which this substitute amendment to S. 219 provides, and we \nhad judicial review only on the final rule.\n  That is a good, tough bill. Let me say that Senator Roth, our \ncommittee chairman now on the majority side, moved that bill through \ncommittee, and I think it is an excellent bill.\n  We supported that bill. We voted it out of committee 15 to 0, our \ncommittee membership being a total of 15. All Democrats, all \nRepublicans got together. It is a good, tough, workable regulatory \nreform bill. I hope that we could consider it shortly.\n  But meanwhile, just a part of that bill--in effect, the 45-day \nlegislative veto--is what we are considering now as a substitute for S. \n219. Yesterday we held the floor for several hours talking about our \nconcerns and what could happen under the original moratorium bill, \nwhich is H.R. 450, or the S. 219 as voted on the floor. What we are \ndoing today is substituting this legislative veto for S. 219.\n  I have gone through this a couple of times because it is a little bit \ncomplex, and in talking to some of our Members, they do not understand \nexactly where we stand with regard to the legislative veto or the \nmoratorium bill.\n  So the legislative veto substitute, in effect, replaces the Senate \nversion of the moratorium bill, S. 219.\n So the examples I gave on the floor for a couple of hours yesterday \nwere things that would occur if we went to conference and came back \nbasically with the House bill, which we think goes way, way, way too \nfar.\n\n  So I think Senator Levin will be on the floor shortly with some \namendments to be proposed first, and then I hope we can move along and \ncomplete action on this bill today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, Chick Reynolds, chief reporter of the \nOfficial Reporters of Debates, will retire from the Senate effective \nJuly 7, 1995.\n  Mr. Reynolds' career in stenotype reporting began in 1949, when he \nwas employed by the Department of Defense. In 1950, he went to work for \nthe Alderson Reporting Co. in Washington, DC, where he stayed until \n1971, at which time he opened his own stenographic reporting firm. In \n1974, he was appointed an official reporter with the Senate Official \nReporters of Debates and became chief reporter in 1988.\n  During his working career as a stenotype reporter, Chick was \nconsidered one of the fastest and most accurate writers in the country.\n  His assignments covered every aspect of his profession, some of which \nput him in the center of the headlines of the day. He reported Federal \nagency hearings and various committees in both the House and the \nSenate. He reported the Joseph McCarthy and Jimmy Hoffa hearings on \nCapitol Hill. He was assigned to cover the White House during the \nKennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. During his assignment with \nthe Kennedy administration, he reported President Kennedy's famous \nBerlin speech and was also in the Presidential motorcade on that tragic \nday in Dallas, TX, when President Kennedy was assassinated.\n  Mr. Reynolds has served the Senate and the Nation with distinction \nand loyalty for the past 21 years.\n  I know all Senators will join me in thanking Chick for his long and \ndedicated service, and extending our prayerful wishes to him and his \nwife, Lucille, in the coming days.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, this is the first chapter of one of the \nmost significant debates that will occur during the 104th Congress: the \ndebate about regulatory reform.\n  If we take the right approach to regulatory reform, we can provide \nmore protection for public health. At the same time, we can cut costs \nand cut red tape.\n  But if we take the wrong approach, we may jeopardize public health. \nAnd we may create more redtape, litigation, and delay.\n  So the stakes are high. Fortunately, it looks like we are getting off \nto a good start.\n  Last week, I was not so sure. We faced a short term moratorium that \nwould have blocked some urgently needed rules. We also faced a long-\nterm reform bill that would repeal some of the laws that protect our \nair, our water, and our neighborhoods.\n  In both cases, we seem to be coming to our senses. The moratorium is \nabout to be replaced with the Nickles-Reid amendment. And the \nGovernment Affairs Committee declined to adopt radical versions of \nlong-term regulatory reform. Instead, it reported a solid, bipartisan \nbill.\n\n\n                     concerns about the moratorium\n\n  Today we are considering the bill to impose a short-term moratorium. \nLet me briefly explain why such a flat, broad-based moratorium is a bad \nidea.\n  In a nutshell, it does not distinguish good rules from bad.\n  All too many rules fall into the second category: stupid, unnecessary \nrules that impose high costs and just plain make people angry.\n  For example, OSHA recently proposed new rules that would require \nloggers to wear steel-toed boots.\n  Seems to make sense. Unless you are working in western Montana in \nwinter, on a steep slope and frozen ground. In that case, steel-toed \nboots may be slippery and unsafe. Especially if you are carrying a live \nchain saw.\n  For that reason, western Montana loggers thought that the\n   rules made no sense at all. So we convinced OSHA to back off, talk \nto Montana loggers, and reconsider. But there are other rules that do \nmake sense. That protect public health. That protect the environment. \nAnd that are urgently needed.\n\n  Yesterday, Senator Glenn gave some very compelling examples: E. coli; \nairline safety; radioactive waste; and others.\n  Let me mention one such rule, which is of particular concern to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It is the rule, or cluster of \nrules, for cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium is a deadly pathogen. It \noccurs in drinking water. As we all know, it was responsible for the \ndeaths of hundreds of people, and the illness of hundreds of thousands \nmore, in Milwaukee.\n  EPA has been working with public water suppliers to develop an \ninformation collection rule. This rule will provide EPA, States, and \npublic water suppliers with critical information about the occurrence \nof cryptosporidium and other pathogens. It also will provide \ninformation about the effectiveness of various treatment methods. It \nwill be the cornerstone of our efforts to prevent further poisoning.\n  However, if the moratorium is enacted, the information collection \nrule cannot be issued. If that happens, water suppliers will not be \nable to monitor for cryptosporidium during spring runoff, when it is \nthought to be more prevalent. That will prevent us from gathering data \nfor at least another year. And that, in turn, will further delay the \ndevelopment of an effective treatment method. As a result, we will run \nthe risk that another outbreak will occur, and that hundreds more \npeople will die.\n\n\n                       The Nickles-Reid Amendment\n\n  Fortunately, the moratorium is being withdrawn, at least for now. \nInstead, we are considering the Nickles-Reid amendment.\n  To my mind, this amendment is much closer to the mark. It requires \nthat Government agencies submit their new rules to Congress. And it \nsets up a fast-track process for reviewing those rules. That way, \nCongress can distinguish good rules from bad. If an agency goes \nhaywire, like OSHA did with its logging rule, Congress can reject the \nrule. But if an agency is doing a good job, the rule will go into \neffect, and public health will not be jeopardized.\n  Of course, the amendment is not perfect. In particular, I hope that \nwe can improve some of the fast-track procedures. But, on balance, the \nNickles-Reid amendment improves the process for reviewing agency rules.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I also believe that the Nickles-Reid amendment does \nsomething more. It sets the right tone for the upcoming debate about \nregulatory reform. We must get past the slogans, and get down to the \nhard work of making Government rules more effective and understandable.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the members of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee and with all Senators to accomplish this \nimportant objective.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I might mention to our colleagues that we \nhave made significant progress in the last couple of hours in \nnegotiations on a few amendments. I appreciate the cooperation of \nSenator Reid, and also Senator Levin, Senator Glenn, and Senator \nDomenici, who have had some amendments, and we are working those out. \nHopefully, we will be able to agree to some of those.\n  I might mention to my colleagues, I discussed this with the majority \nleader, and he very much would like to pass this bill tonight. It is \nour expectation to finish this bill tonight, partly because we need to \ngo to the supplemental appropriations or the rescissions bill that was \nreported out of the Appropriations Committee last Friday. That may take \nsome time.\n  So the majority leader has let it be known that he plans to go to \nthat bill tomorrow. So we need to finish this bill.\n   [[Page S4700]] I want to thank my colleagues who have been \ncooperative in working with us in trying to come to a resolution of \nsome of the items in dispute on this package. I am optimistic that we \nwill be successful.\n  I am ready to consider an amendment by the Senator from Michigan, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his work on this substitute. It is a very important \nsubstitute. It embodies a principle which is a very important \nprinciple, and that is that the Congress should be responsible and \naccountable for these major regulations that are imposed on people. We \nshould not just simply pass laws and then go on to the next law without \nkeeping a very sharp focus on what the agencies do through the \nregulatory process.\n  So what we used to call legislative veto--something I supported even \nbefore I came to the Senate and have continued to do so--we now are \ngoing to call legislative review because it is slightly different from \nthe veto mechanism which was adopted about a decade ago.\n  This legislative review process of the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Oklahoma is a very, very significant improvement, I \nbelieve, on what the current process is of regulatory review. Of \ncourse, it is a major change in approach from the moratorium which is \nbefore us.\n  Before I offer my amendment, I want to commend my friend from \nOklahoma and the Senator from Nevada for the work that they have done \non this legislative review substitute.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 412 to Amendment No. 410\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered 412 to amendment No. \n     410.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 2, strike everything after ``discharged'' \n     through the period of line 6 and insert the following: ``from \n     further consideration of such resolution in the Senate upon a \n     petition supported in writing by 30 Members of the Senate or \n     by motion of the Majority Leader supported by the Minority \n     Leader, and in the House upon a petition supported in writing \n     by one-fourth of the Members duly sworn and chosen or by \n     motion of the Speaker supported by the Minority Leader, and \n     such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is sent to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Glenn and myself. It is something which we have \nworked out with the floor managers. I thank them for their efforts.\n  This amendment modifies the procedure for discharging a joint \nresolution of disapproval from committee. By amending the substitute \nthis way, this will conform much more closely to the legislative review \nprovision which was passed in the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nweek by a vote of 15-0 on the regulatory reform bill.\n  This amendment would continue to allow for a committee to vote by \nmajority to discharge a joint resolution of disapproval of a \nregulation. That would continue as it is in the substitute. The \nmajority of a committee could discharge a resolution of disapproval of \na regulation.\n  What this would add is that where a petition is filed by 30 Members \nof the Senate, or by the consent of the majority and minority leaders, \nthat we also then would have the discharge of a resolution of \ndisapproval of a regulation. The intent is to protect rights of a \nsignificant minority of the Senate to obtain the discharge of a \nresolution of disapproval.\n  Since the discharge triggers these expedited procedures, it is \nimportant that it be a balanced and a fair process and that a \nsignificant minority of Senators have the opportunity to accomplish \nthat.\n  This amendment, we think, does accomplish that. I want to thank my \ncosponsor, as well as the managers, for their willingness to work this \nout.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I fully support the amendment by the \nSenator from Michigan. I think it does several things. It protects the \nrights of the minority. It provides a dual method of getting rules and \nregulations considered. It can be initiated not only by the majority \nand minority leaders, but also by a petition of 30 Members.\n  And this does something else. It means that we will not just have \nfrivolous actions brought up. If you have to get 30 Members of the \nSenate of the United States to agree on anything on a petition, it is \ngoing to be something significant; it is not going to be a frivolous \nmatter. You are not going to be able to get a couple of friends and be \nable to call a rule up, or get a buddy-buddy vote out of somebody and \ncall a rule up on that basis.\n  When you have to get 30 Members to do it, it has to be something \nsubstantive, and I agree with that. That is why I am very glad to \nsupport the proposal by the Senator from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friends and colleagues \nfrom Michigan and Ohio, as well as Senator Reid and Senator Bond. All \nfour Senators have been involved in this issue in trying to make sure \nthat we protect minority rights, and that is what this amendment does. \nI think it is an improvement.\n  We have no objection on this side, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 412) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to compliment \nSenators Nickles and Reid on their amendment. Very shortly, hopefully, \nI will have an amendment that I will talk about. But let me just speak \nto the substitute amendment that was offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, and the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid.\n  First, there is no question that there is plenty, plenty of blame to \ngo around for the unreasonable, irrational regulatory maze that exists \nin this country. There is plenty of blame to go around, because \nCongress passes laws that require regulations.\n  Bureaucrats decide that they have to write regulations, and many \ntimes we tell them they must. The courts of this land are very prone to \nget involved in the adequacy of regulations. And so between the \nagencies of Government and those who write regulations, and courts who \ninterpret them, it is really obvious to millions of Americans that we \nhave a very unworkable regulatory system.\n  Many of the ultimate regulations, as implemented, in particular \nagainst small business people, are sufficiently unreasonable and \nunworkable that they are causing millions of Americans--men and women--\nto be very angry at their country. As a matter of fact, one of the \nsingle most reasons for Americans being angry at their country is \nregulations that do not make sense, or are unintelligible or cost too \nmuch for what the entity regulates knows they are being asked to do. \nAnd there is no easy way to fix it. As a matter of fact, I have spent \nwell on a year trying to figure out some generic ways to address this \nmaze of regulatory, burdensome regulations causing great anxiety among \nmen and women, in particular, small business people. I am sure as we \nmove through our next step beyond that bill to try to get regulatory \nreform, there will be some more good ideas.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the Chair)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But for now, an approach that will say new regulations, \nbefore they become effective, must go to the committees of jurisdiction \non the Hill for their perusal to see whether or not the committees that \npass the \n[[Page S4701]] laws think that the regulations passed by the regulators \nare beyond the law and unreasonable and unworkable and will have a \nchance to look at them. And, yes, under this 45-day moratorium, prior \nto the final adoption, Congress occasionally can pick one of those and \ndo it in an expedited manner, deny its efficacy, and say it is not \ngoing to be carried out.\n  So in a very real sense, we have set upon the committees of the \nCongress--that is, Senate and House and the staff that works for us--a \nvery difficult job, because now we are saying in a couple of years we \nwill have looked at the new regulations in this process, and if we let \nthem get by, shame on us. If we have this overview process thrust upon \nus by this amendment and we let the regulations get by, and 2 years \nafter they are in place, we go to a hearing in Maine, New Mexico, \nIdaho, or Ohio--or we might even have a hearing in Oklahoma, but that \nwould be very difficult--the people would say, ``Look at this \nregulation; it does not have any common sense and it is too expensive. \nThere is no cost benefit ratio that is meaningful.'' Shame on us, \nbecause this bill, which I hope becomes law, is going to say: Congress, \nyou had a shot at it because these significant regulations which we \nestimate based on past performance may be 900 a year, and we are going \nto have a chance to look at them.\n  Madam President, shortly, an amendment is going to be offered that I \nhave authored. It has been worked on by both sides to try to make sure \nthat we all understand it. But it came to me that there is a \ngovernmental entity that works for us called the GAO. And they have \nbeen, in the past, asked by committees, asked by individual Members of \nCongress, to go check on something, go audit something, go review \nsomething. And I will admit that, in the past, they were subject to \nsome very, very proper criticism. I do believe they got very cozy with \ncertain Members. I do believe many of their reports were not clear peer \nreview because they were doing them for a certain purpose. But I \nbelieve, nonetheless, that they have a great quality of expertise and a \ndesire to be helpful to the Congress.\n  So, essentially, what I suggested to my friends, Senator Nickles, \nSenator Reid, and others from the Government Operations Committee, \nincluding the ranking member, Senator Glenn, I suggested that we ought \nto use the GAO in this process, so that as our committees have to do \nthese reviews, we will have the benefit of a pool of resources to go \ncheck on the agencies and to advise us as to whether or not they have \ndone their job regarding the significant regulations they are going to \nbe issuing.\n  I, frankly, believe the GAO is perfectly fit for this job. We still \nhave a very significant GAO. Some will say it is going to be cut. Some \nhere want to cut it in half. I guess some would want to do away with \nit. But I do not believe any of those things are going to happen. It \nmay get a good reduction in amount, but it is going to be here because \nit does some very positive things. When we had the S crisis, it was \nimportant that they did a lot of auditing. We would have to go out and \nhire independents to do that, and would they be at Congress' beck and \ncall and have real professionalism? I do not know.\n  We are going to offer an amendment that is going to essentially say \nthat the General Accounting Office gets into this new process of \nreview, by being our arm in looking carefully at what the regulators \nhave put together to make sure that they have complied with the legal \nrequirements. And, yes, upon request, they can look at the cost-benefit \nratio. Essentially, they are going to be there before we ever get these \nregulations to the committee; they are going to be seeing whether the \nagencies did it right. I think that is invaluable. I think we will, 3 \nor 4 years from now, thank the Lord that we put them in this process, \nbecause it is so tough to review these regulations, especially the \nsignificant ones, that I am not sure the committees and our staffs \nwould get it done, or they would constantly, most probably, be in a \ncatch-up state because it is so tough.\n  You have to do it timely if you are going to kill any of these \nbecause they are infective, because after 45 days, you cannot do \nanything to them; they are final. That is our own law that we are about \nto adopt here. To make that period any longer probably prejudices the \nregulatory process. So I think we will have to live with that. I \ncompliment those who put it together, and I urge the Senate to adopt an \namendment which puts the GAO in this with their resources to advise and \nhelp the committees as we attempt to review the process of reviewing \nthe significant regulations affecting our lifestyles, businesses, and \nmany individual Americans that are regulated by our Government.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the comments of my \ncolleague from New Mexico. I know he has considered this very \ncarefully. As to his initial comments about the bill and the need for \nit, the need for regulatory reform, I could not agree more. I think we \nare long overdue in addressing this issue. We have dealt with \nregulatory reform in the Governmental Affairs Committee. In fact, we \nhave voted out a bill.\n  Let me compliment my chairman, Senator Bill Roth, on this. We have \nvoted a bill out that does all of the things that the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico just enumerated. The regulatory reform bill \nthat we voted out requires risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses. \nCost-benefit analysis now, under current law, is done by Executive \norder. But under the regulatory reform bill, we would lock that in and \nsay that all major regulations have to have a risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis done. And then in that legislation we voted out, also, \nwe required that there be a review of those regulations not less than \nonce every 10 years. In other words, there is a sunset provision in \nthere that says that no matter how good the regulations are, they \nshould be looked at for adequacy and for improvement and for sunsetting \nat least once every 10 years. `\n  Now, in that legislation we also have a 45-day legislative veto, \nwhich is about the same as what we have here. That legislative veto \nwould apply to all significant rules.\n  Once it is modified, the committee could call it up the same as this \nlegislation now. We also provided that when a final rule is written, we \nwould allow judicial review.\n  That is not the legislation that is before Congress today. That is \nthe regulatory reform bill we voted out, and I think that is the one we \nshould be considering because it includes not only the 45-day \nlegislative veto that we are talking about here today as a substitute \nfor S. 219, but it would add the whole package of regulatory reform--\nrisk assessment, cost-benefit analysis--not just by Executive order of \nthe President, as it is now, but require it in law.\n  We would also require a review of all major rules on a 10-year basis; \nwe would have a 45-day legislative veto similar to the one we have \nhere; and we would provide for judicial review on the final rule. That \nis a complete package and one I hope we have up very shortly.\n  Now, specifically, as to the comments of the Senator from New Mexico \non the GAO, I agree on the excellence of GAO's capability and the \nexcellent work that they do. They are an ideal group to look at these \nmatters.\n  My only concern is whether we might be overloading GAO. When we are \ntalking about requiring GAO to do a complete analytical analysis of \neverything that comes up, that is one thing. If we are requiring them \nto make sure that the procedures required by law have been met by each \nagency and department in putting their risk assessment or cost-benefit \ntogether, if it is a procedural analysis to make sure everything is \ndone, that is quite a different thing.\n  GAO is ideally situated to do the second of those, to make sure that \nall the boxes have been checked, to make sure that all the procedures \nhave been followed. If we are to ask GAO to do their own complete risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis, completely separate from any that \nthe agencies have done, that is something else entirely, of course.\n  I point out that just the significant rules number some 800 or 900 a \nyear; some years, probably 1,000. With the average number of work days \na year here being somewhere between 250 and 270, that means that GAO \nwould have to crank out about three to four of \n[[Page S4702]]  these analyses every single working day. That is an \nenormous job.\n  To require GAO to do these new tasks when there have been proposals \nin the budget to cut GAO by 25 percent does not make much sense. But I \nagree that this is a good thing for GAO to be looking at. They are \nideally situated to do it.\n  In the other bill, the regulatory reform bill that we have voted out \nof committee, there are provisions for peer review for cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments. We did that because we thought the job \nwas going to be sufficiently large that we would not be able to just \nask GAO or someone else to do all that analytical and assessment work. \nYet, we wanted somebody to say that the agencies and departments were \ndoing a reasonable job. So we set up a peer review process.\n  I am sure when that legislation comes to the floor, we will be \ndebating that provision to see its adequacy compared to just having GAO \ndo it. So there are two different procedures here that we are looking \nat.\n  On the regulatory reform bill that I hope we consider within the next \nmonth or so, we provided for peer review as a way of doing the same \nthing that the Senator from New Mexico is talking about doing with GAO.\n  I certainly do not object to the GAO proposal so long as we \nunderstand, when the Senator proposes it, that it will be on the basis \nof making sure that the processes have all been gone through that are \nrequested. That would be what GAO would be certifying. GAO would not be \nrequired to do their own complete, independent, cost analysis, cost-\nbenefit ratio and risk assessment, as a completely independent action, \nwhich would tie up several times the number of people we have in GAO.\n  I think that is what the Senator from New Mexico intended that it \nbe--a review to make sure that all the proper procedures have been gone \nthrough.\n  I know he has not formally submitted the amendment yet, but I made \nthose comments on it anyway, in advance. I wanted to point out the \ndetails of the regulatory reform bill that I hope we have on the floor \nwithin the next 30 or 45 days.\n  It would require risk assessment/cost-benefit not just by Executive \norder, but in law. No future President could just take that off, out of \neffect, by just taking out the Executive order. These would be required \nby law, risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses.\n  Each one of those regulations would be reviewed on not less than a \n10-year basis or it would sunset. We have the same 45-day legislative \nveto that would be in this legislation here now. All significant rules \nwould come back to the committee and they would be asked to see whether \nthey want to be notified for judicial review on each rule.\n  That is a complete regulatory reform package. We did a lot of work \nfor which Senator Roth deserves a lot of credit. We stuck with this \ncomplete reform package and molded it. It was a bipartisan effort. We \nvoted it out, on a unanimous basis, of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, 15 to 0.\n  I think it is a very powerful, tough bill. I hope we consider it, \nbecause what we are considering today is just part of that bill. It is \na separate 45-day legislative veto.\n  I look forward to having that bill out on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his kind \nremarks.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 413 to Amendment No. 410\n\n (Purpose: To provide reports to Congress from the Comptroller General)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Nickles, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for himself and \n     Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 413 to amendment \n     No. 410.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 6 through 20, and insert in lieu \n     thereof and renumber accordingly:\n       ``(1) Reporting to congress and the comptroller general.--\n       (A) Before a rule can take effect as a final rule, the \n     Federal agency promulgating such rule submit to each House of \n     the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report \n     containing--\n       (i) a copy of the rule;\n       (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule; and\n       (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule.\n       (B) The Federal agency promulgating the rule shall make \n     available to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General, upon request:\n       (i) a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the \n     rule, if any;\n       (ii) the agency's actions relevant to section 603, section \n     604 section 605 section 607, and section 609 of P.L. 96-354;\n       (iii) the agency's actions relevant to title II, section \n     202, section 203, section 204, and section 205 of P.L. 104-4; \n     and\n       (iv) any other relevant information or requirements under \n     any other Act and any relevant Executive Orders, such as \n     Executive Order 12866.\n       (C) Upon receipt, each House shall provide copies to the \n     chairman and Ranking Member of each committee with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) Reporting by the comptroller general.--\n       (A) The Comptroller General shall provide a report on each \n     significant rule to the committees of jurisdiction to each \n     House of the Congress by the end of 12 calendar days after \n     the submission or publication date as provided in section \n     4(b)(2). The report of the Comptroller General shall include \n     an assessment of the agency's compliance with procedural \n     steps required with subsection (A)(iv) through (vii).\n       (B) Federal agencies shall cooperate with the Comptroller \n     General by providing information relevant to the Comptroller \n     General's report under subsection (2)(A) of this section.''\n       On page 14, at the beginning of line 5, insert, ``section \n     3(a)(1)-(2) and'', and on line 5 strike ``3(a)(2)'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``3(a)(3)''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this is the amendment that I allude to \nin my brief remarks about the 45-day holdover or moratorium while \nCongress is given an opportunity to review regulations and processes.\n  We have changed it in two or three ways since I first submitted a \ndraft of this amendment. I think it is very workable now. Essentially, \nwe are now talking, as I understand it, about the significant--\nsignificant--regulations. My friend from Oklahoma says that that is \nabout 900 a year.\n  We have made the Federal agencies promulgating the rule responsible \nto make available to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \nGeneral, upon request, information that is necessary so we can see if \nthey have done a good job. That means the GAO will not have to be \ninvolved in any one of those, nor will they have to give every cost-\nbenefit analysis, but rather the ones they request.\n  I believe we will be very pleased we adopted this in a few years, \nwhen we find out what a resource GAO will be, and how much more \neffective they will make our committees and our committee staff, both \nhere and in the House.\n  I do not think I have to say any more. I hope the amendment is \nadopted soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to congratulate and compliment \nmy friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his \namendment.\n  I think it is an amendment which improves this bill. It basically \nsays the Federal agency, when they promulgate the rule, shall make it \navailable to each House of Congress. That was in our bill.\n  But he also says it needs to be made available to the Comptroller \nGeneral. This is for them to analyze it, for them to make sure that the \ncost-benefit analysis has been made, that they are complying with the \nunfunded mandates legislation.\n  I just compliment the Senator. I think this improves it. I think this \nenables Congress to be able to rely on GAO and the Comptroller General \nto make sure that some of these regulations are not excessive in cost.\n So, this is a compliment to the bill.\n\n  I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Reid, for his \nhelp on this, as well as Senator Levin and Senator Glenn, as we were \nnegotiating on this amendment and actually combining this amendment \nwith an amendment that Senator Levin and also Senator Bond were working \non.\n  So, we have had several Senators trying to make some improvements in \nthis section. I think this has made our \n[[Page S4703]]  legislation better, so I urge my colleagues on both \nsides to agree to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I extend my appreciation to the senior \nSenator from New Mexico for improving this substitute. I say that \nbecause I look at this legislation a little differently than some in \nthis Chamber. I know there are some who are saying we are going to have \na bill later on that is going to be a lot better. Having served here \nand in the other body for a while, I recognize we have to do the best \nwe can with what we have at a given time. The better we make this bill, \nthe better it is going to be for the American people in case something \nbetter does not come along later.\n  So I appreciate very much the work of the Senator from New Mexico. He \nand I go back 6 or 8 years working on the General Accounting Office. I \nthink this is a responsibility they should have. They are equipped to \ndo a good job on this assignment they will be given. I think it is a \ngood amendment and I hope it is adopted very quickly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senators from Nevada and Ohio. I do believe \nthis will help the bill. Senator Nickles and I are pleased to be \nhelpful. I think in a few years the process you were recommending will \nbe working very well and we will know a lot more about bad regulations \nbefore they get placed in effect and then find out later they are \nhurting our people.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I wanted to clarify a couple of matters \nhere. We have in the reporting by the Comptroller General, as I \nunderstand it--we say he will--\n\n       . . . provide a report on each significant rule to the \n     committees of jurisdiction to each House of Congress by the \n     end of 12 calendar days after the submission or publication \n     date as provided in section 4(b)(2). The report of the \n     Comptroller General shall include an assessment of the \n     agency's compliance with procedural steps required with \n     subsection (A)(iv) through (vii).\n\n  I think those words were added. I presume they were. I just wanted to \ncheck and make sure that is the wording that was in the legislation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are in the legislation. And after discussing the \nissue with all four Senators and their staffs, I think those are \nappropriate words, because I do not think in 12 to 15 days the GAO can \ndo a thorough substantive review, but they can do a procedural review \nas prescribed.\n  Mr. GLENN. I agree with my colleague. That clarifies it and makes \nsure what we are not expecting from the GAO is their own complete risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis as original work. That would \noverburden them on the 800 or 900 significant regulations that are \nissued each year and leaves it open that once one of these regulations \nor rules is reported back, if a committee wishes to get into it more, \nthen they can. Or they could possibly even ask for a complete GAO \noriginal study as we do now of different pieces of legislation. That \nwould still be possible. But this limits it to the GAO reviewing \nwhether the agency has complied with procedural steps required in law. \nI am glad to have that clarified.\n  With that understanding I believe we would be happy to accept this on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we have no objection to this amendment \non this side and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 413) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask that I may use just a minute or two \nof my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4699-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4703-S4704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET CUTS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, President Clinton won big headlines today \nwith his proposal to cut $13 billion from four Government agencies over \nthe next 5 years. I have learned recently maybe $8 billion of that is \nalready in the President's budget, so I am not certain what the figure \nreally is. But we certainly welcome the President's interest in \ntrimming Government spending. The Washington Post even suggested today \nthat the President's interest may be related to last November's \nelection results. Certainly we hope he is hearing the message.\n  The President now has a real opportunity to get on the spending-cuts \nbandwagon tomorrow because the Senate will consider more than $13 \nbillion in spending cuts and the American people will not have to wait \n5 years to see the savings. These are cuts in this fiscal year. This is \n$13 billion the Government will not be able to spend during the next 6 \nmonths, not the next 5 years.\n  The American people want more than tinkering around the edges; they \nwant dramatic results and want better use of their tax dollars, \nstarting now.\n  The American people sent a loud and clear message to Washington last \nNovember: Rein in the Federal Government, reduce the size of Government \nand cut spending. We are prepared to provide the leadership once again \nto turn that message into action. We hope the President will join us in \nthis effort to give the American people real spending cuts.\n  I hope the President will take a look at the supplemental \nappropriation bill, send us a letter supporting those cuts, and then he \nwill really be on record for real cuts this year, not 5 years down the \nroad, particularly if $8 billion of the $13 billion he talks about is \nalready in the President's budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield 1 minute?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield 2 or 3 or 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, first, I want to compliment the \nRepublican leader for his adroitness here. He quickly caught the fact \nthat the President is making a big to-do about almost nothing today. \nFirst of all, it is my understanding that of this $13 billion, $8 \nbillion of it is in the President's budget.\n  Everybody knows that budget does not cut anything. So what really \nhappened is he cuts a little bit there and increases things elsewhere. \nSo, of this big package, alleged big package of $13 billion, $8 billion \nis in the President's budget. It was already there and we knew about \nit. What did we say about that budget? We said that budget put up the \nwhite flag of surrender against deficits. So, certainly, this activity \nof cutting $13 billion is no big victory. It is still a white flag of \nsurrender.\n  I would go beyond our distinguished leader and say we are going to \nlook forward to the President's support when we produce a budget \nresolution that gets us a balanced budget by the year 2002, in 7 years. \nThat is what the American people want. They do not want an announcement \nthat a little piece of Federal Government is being changed and \neverybody in America is supposed to think we are really getting the \ndeficit under control. We are not getting the deficit under control. It \nwill be with us at $200 to $250 billion a year for as far as the eye \ncan see and our children will be burdened with it beyond anything we \never imagined. This announcement will not do very much to alleviate \nthat burden on them or on this country.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I say to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, as I understand it, my quick calculation is that the $13 \nbillion of cuts which the President is proposing over 5 years \nrepresents one-twentieth of 1 percent of the spending that is going to \noccur over that 5-year period. Whereas the bill that we are bringing \nforward tomorrow, under Senator Dole's leadership and under Senator \nPackwood's leadership, represents a real $13 billion in cuts--\nironically, the same number. It is going to occur this year, \nimmediately. Is that correct?\n   [[Page S4704]] Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. As a matter of fact, \nthe $13 billion is about 3 percent of the appropriated accounts, \nwhereas the dollar number the President has in his of just the \nappropriated accounts over the next 5 to 7 years is far less than half \na percent --of just the appropriated accounts--perhaps as low as a \nquarter of a percent. I have not done the arithmetic, but almost \nunnoticeable in the cuts and restraints and reductions that we are \ngoing to have to make.\n  Mr. GREGG. So, if the Senator will yield for an additional question, \nMadam President, if you wish to undertake real budget savings, what you \nshould be doing is supporting the rescission package that is coming \nforward and then work with the President to take the $13 billion of \nadditional cuts and maybe raise it up to a level that is a real \nreduction in spending so we move toward a balanced budget over 5 years?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely correct. Let \nme be precise. The President is trying to make a case for deficit \nreduction. He is talking about $13 billion in reductions over the next \n5 years.\n  What the President really ought to be doing is to be saying loud and \nclear: ``I compliment the House and Senate for a rescission package, \nand I hope you send it to me quickly.'' And he ought to be saying, ``I \nwill sign it,'' because it will accomplish in 6 months as much savings \nas he pledges in 5 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I certainly do not intend to get into a \ndebate with the very learned chairman of the Budget Committee, but I \nthink, in fairness to the White House, you have to give him credit for \nwhat he is doing. It may not be all that everyone wants, but I think \nthe fact that the Federal payroll has been cut by some 150,000 people \nsince he has been President, and this will be the third year in a row \nthat we have had a decline in the deficit, the first time in some 50 \nyears this has happened--we all know he has significant problems with \nthe deficit.\n  In the balanced budget amendment that they established were three \nthings. They established, No. 1, that we have a problem with the \ndeficit; No. 2, we have to do something about it; and, No. 3, we need \nto do it and not burden Social Security.\n  I am not going to get into a long debate with my friend from New \nMexico other than to say I think we have to give the President credit \nfor having taken a number of steps that are important in the overall \nneed to balance the budget. It is not going to be done in one fell \nswoop. It is going to be a series of small things that add up to \nsomething big. And the work that the President and the Vice President \ndid yesterday--and the Vice President was given another 60-odd days to \nreport to the President on some other things --needs to be done. Let us \ngive them credit for making good-faith efforts to solve the crisis and \nthe problems that face this country.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4703-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4704-S4705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REGULATORY TRANSITION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 414 to Amendment No. 410\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new term \n    permits for grazing on National Forest System lands to replace \n  previously issued term grazing permits that have expired, soon will \n    expire, or are waived to the Secretary, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. REID.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre \n     National Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with \n     Federal law;\n       (2) where suitable, 1 of the recognized multiple uses for \n     National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n       (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n     of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n     years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n     proper administration of National Forest System land and \n     resources;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits \n     authorizing grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of \n     National Forest System land;\n       (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n     by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n     expire by the end of 1996;\n       (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n     complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n     remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n     to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n     the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains \n     an appropriate use of the affected National Forest System \n     land;\n       (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n     permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n     as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n     to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit \n     holder's permitted livestock or base property by the end of \n     1996;\n       (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n       (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n     expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n     Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in \n     compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     and other applicable laws (including regulations) in a timely \n     and efficient manner and enable the Secretary to issue new \n     term grazing permits, where appropriate;\n       (10) for a small percentage of the grazing permits that \n     will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n     the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n     term grazing permits; and\n       (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n     of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n     essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a \n     timely manner for financial and other reasons.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that \n     grazing continues without interruption on National Forest \n     System land in a manner that provides long-term protection of \n     the environment and improvement of National Forest System \n     rangeland resources while also providing short-term certainty \n     to holders of expiring term grazing permits and purchasers of \n     a permit holder's permitted livestock or base property.\n\n     SEC. ____02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Expiring term grazing permit.--The term ``expiring term \n     grazing permit'' means a term grazing permit--\n       (A) that expires in 1995 or 1996; or\n       (B) that expired in 1994 and was not replaced with a new \n     term grazing permit solely because the analysis required by \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 \n     et seq.) and other applicable laws has not been completed.\n       (2) Final agency action.--The term ``final agency action'' \n     means agency action with respect to which all available \n     administrative remedies have been exhausted.\n       (3) Term grazing permit.--The term ``term grazing permit \n     means a term grazing permit or grazing agreement issued by \n     the Secretary under section 402 of the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1752), section 19 of \n     the Act entitled ``An Act to facilitate and simplify the work \n     of the Forest Service, and for other purposes'', approved \n     April 24, 1950 (commonly known as the ``Granger-Thye Act'') \n     (16 U.S.C. 580l), or other law.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

We would be glad to accept it on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this time, I rise to offer an amendment \nwith my friend, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and also Senator Pressler, \nSenator Wellstone, and Senator Cochran. This amendment would ensure \nthat the 45-day suspension of a significant rule does not include the \nregulations opening duck hunting season. The amendment I am offering at \nthis time was adopted by the Governmental Affairs Committee when it \nconsidered S. 219, but it was not included in the Nickles-Reid \nsubstitute.\n  The substitute would suspend for 45 days any significant rule to give \nCongress time to review the regulation. The annual rule regulating duck \nhunting, which has a direct effect on the economy of $686 million \nannually, would be considered a significant rule. The effect of this \n45-day suspension on the duck hunting season would be most severe. The \nFish and Wildlife Service is required by law to issue regulations each \nyear to open and close the duck hunting season. Each year, in late \nJuly, after the young birds are large enough to be counted, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service then gathers information about the various duck \npopulations. They then have roughly 2 months to draft and finalize the \nduck hunting regulations, which are typically issued 2 or 3 days before \nthe hunting season begins.\n  Because these regulations are significant regulations, they would be \nsuspended for 45 days, which would cut a month and a half from the duck \nhunting season. I do not believe this effect on duck hunting is \nnecessary or useful. It is counterproductive, and it may be a classic \ncase of unintended consequences.\n  Our amendment today simply says that for the purposes of the Nickles-\nReid substitute, duck hunting regulations would not be considered \nsignificant and, therefore, would not be suspended for 45 days. The \nduck hunting rule, like all other rules under the Nickles-Reid \nsubstitute, would still be reported to Congress.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that in the name of regulatory reform, \nwe should eliminate 45 days of the duck hunting season. I believe our \namendment is simple and it is straightforward. I thank my colleagues \nfor cosponsoring this amendment with me.\n  I sincerely appreciate the help and the strong support of my good \nfriend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who has worked with \nus very carefully to develop this amendment as it is.\n  Mr. President, I have not actually sent my amendment to the desk. I \nsend the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Cochran, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 415 to amendment No. 410.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, beginning on line 12, strike all through line 8 \n     on page 14 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(2) Significant Rule.--The term ``significant rule''--\n       (A) means any final rule, issued after November 9, 1994, \n     that the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs within the office of Management and Budget \n     finds--\n       (i) has an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \n     more or adversely affects in a material way the economy, a \n     sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \n     environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or \n     tribal governments or communities;\n       [[Page S4706]] (ii) creates a serious inconsistency or \n     otherwise interferes with an action taken or planned by \n     another agency;\n       (iii) materially alters the budgetary impact of \n     entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the \n     rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or\n       (iv) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of \n     legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles \n     set forth in Executive Order 12866.\n       (B) does not include any agency action that establishes, \n     modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for \n     a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity relating \n     to hunting, fishing, or camping.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator Pryor. \nWe are delighted Senator Pressler and several others on the committee \nhave joined now.\n  The amendment, I think, addresses concerns many others have had \nconcerning the potential impact this amendment would have on hunting, \ncamping, or fishing activities. In Alaska, those activities are of \nmajor importance to our daily life.\n  The amendment will make it clear now that regulatory actions to open, \nclose, or manage commercial, recreational, and subsistence hunting, \nfishing, and camping activities will not be included under the \ndefinition of ``significant rule.''\n  As an example, let me point out to the Senate that over 54 percent of \nall the fish that are caught commercially in waters off the United \nStates are caught off my State of Alaska. These fisheries are some of \nthe world's largest and they certainly are the healthiest in all the \nworld because of our proper fisheries management concepts.\n  In some cases, the delay of even 24 hours in closing a fishery could \nhave tremendously detrimental impacts on the health of the fish \nresource. Yet the action to close the fishery could be found to have an \nadverse effect on a sector of the economy, namely the fishing vessels \nthat might have to stop fishing.\n  We cannot afford to risk the long-term health of our fisheries if \nsomeone could successfully argue that closing of a fishery or \nrestriction on the use of certain gear in an area is a significant rule \nthat must be delayed for 45 days under this bill.\n  This is not hypothetical. There are people that will do just that. \nJust last month, the Secretary of Commerce, based on a recommendation \nfrom our North Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, issued an \nemergency order to shut down scallop fishing in Federal waters off \nAlaska.\n  That is a major fishery, but it had to be done. The emergency order \nwas necessary because one boat, just one boat--it was called Mr. Big, \nincidentally--found a loophole in the law that allowed it to take more \nscallops than the State of Alaska had allowed all boats of the fleet to \ntake for the whole season.\n  I do hope Members here will join in supporting this amendment \nunanimously. It is essential to duck hunters. I hope we are all duck \nhunters--up our way, we are all duck hunters. And I do hope people \nunderstand it means a great deal to some of the people who rely on \nsubsistence hunting and fishing in my State.\n  It is an essential amendment. It is one I tried to offer in \ncommittee, and some people did not understand it. I am happy to see \nthat now they do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to clarify a couple of things. We \nhave been through this. I think it is satisfactory.\n  I want to be sure the definition that was made in the committee on \nthe previous amendment was something that could not be expanded into \nthings never intended as far as the hunting and routine rules and \nregulations and others that are done on an annual basis. I think this \njust changes the definition of what is considered a significant rule. \nIn effect, what it does by changing the designation a little bit, as I \nunderstand it, is permit all the previous rules, regulations, and \nprocedures to continue as they have in the past so they will not be cut \nout.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it really, \nfrom my perspective, looks at the management tools of the State, and \nFederal fish and game management agencies in particular--there are \nothers involved also--and says that they can continue their management \npractices that are designed to protect the resource base. Some open, \nsome close, some limit, some alter, some add, and some subtract. But \nthey are done on a basis of public knowledge. But the public knowledge \nis of the regulations that give them the opportunity to step in and \nissue an emergency regulation to take care of a situation or to change \na pattern of, say, hunting in order to protect the species. I think \nthat is in the public interest. That is what we intended all along. \nThis is excepted from the 45 days.\n  The Senator referred to the prior bill--not Senator Pryor's bill but \nthe former bill. I think the Senator may be referring to an amendment \nthat I offered because of the form of that bill to deal with specific \ncircumstances in Alaska. I do not have to offer that amendment because \nthis is a 45-day general moratorium now, and those amendments that I \ntalked about in committee are in fact covered under this type of \ngeneral regulation now in terms of the significant-rule concept.\n  Mr. GLENN. As I understood it from the explanation given earlier this \nafternoon, I understood that this does not provide any new exemptions \nfor additional hunting or additional opening up of tracts or anything \nthat is not there right now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It could. I just gave an example of one. Just this last \nmonth the Secretary of Commerce issued a regulation closing the scallop \nfishery because an emergency developed. That is the kind of thing that \ncannot wait 45 days. That is a type of action that has been taken care \nof in the process of protecting our migratory waterfowl. Ducks \nUnlimited comes in with a study and says, ``Look, you should change \nthis anyway. You should open that flyway. You should change that \nseason.'' They will come in for some emergency modifications during the \nperiod for hunting season. This says that the Fish and Wildlife Service \nare to know to go ahead. That is what you are supposed to do; no delay \non those items of the kind we have mentioned. Subsection B and \nsubsection A carry some specific concepts about what has to be \naffected.\n  Mr. GLENN. I certainly have no objection to that because that \nprovides regulations in the same way it has been done for a long time. \nIt does not really provide any new escape hatch for anybody, as I \nunderstand it. So I think that would be acceptable on our side.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on this floor and in the Senate as a \nwhole, there have been a lot of attacks on environmental regulations. \nThat seems to be the way to go these days. But I think the Senator from \nAlaska gave a very powerful talk on illustrating why these regulations \nare necessary. Indeed, he felt so strongly that he did not want--I \nagree with him--these regulations that apply to fishing, hunting, and \ncamping to be held up for 45 days. In his powerful statement, the \nSenator from Alaska illustrated that in some cases these regulations \nhave to go into effect immediately.\n  So I hope that rebuts some of the feeling around this floor that all \nenvironmental regulations are useless and that we ought to attack them, \nwhich is, unfortunately, too often said around here. I am not saying \nnecessarily right here on the floor. I am talking about in the \ncommittees, in the conversations. Thank goodness we have some of these \nenvironmental regulations.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Alaska. Somebody can \ncontradict me, but there are certain regulations under this bill we are \ndealing with that are held up for 45 days. Under this category they \nfall under ``significant regulations.'' But what the Senator from \nAlaska has done is he has said that significant regulations or delay \nfor 45 days does not apply to this category of regulation that he has \ndefined; namely, those that establish, modify, open, close, or conduct \nregulatory programs for commercial, recreational, or subsistence \nactivities relating to hunting, fishing, or camping.\n  So I think it makes sense. I congratulate the Senator from Alaska and \nhope he will be a strong fighter for environmental regulations here on \nthe floor in the future.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I seldom get personal on the floor, but I \nrecall standing behind my friend 45 years \n[[Page S4707]]  ago when we entered law school. And we signed into the \nsame law school, but I do not think we have agreed in the 45 years \nsince. I am delighted we have once, despite our prior disagreements. It \nis nice to have one time for agreement. There are some environmental \nregulations that are useless. We should burn the paper they are on. But \nthis is not one of them.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am happy to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Is there further debate?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have reviewed this amendment. I \ncompliment my friends and colleagues, Senator Pryor from Arkansas and \nSenator Stevens, and I compliment Senator Stevens for his leadership. I \nthink it is a good amendment. It further clarifies that what we are \ndoing in this bill in no way would have any harmful impact whatsoever \non hunting and fishing and delay those activities in any way \nwhatsoever.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just one \nmoment, I failed to thank my good friend John Roots on our behalf, who \nhas worked so hard on this staff and Senator Pryor's staff. I thank him \nvery much.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may, I do not want to spoil the \nopportunity to pass this amendment because I think it is going to be \naccepted by everyone. So I will sit down. I could not help but catch it \nwhen my good friend and colleague from Alaska was talking about his \ngood friend and our colleague from Rhode Island when he referred to \ntheir ``prior disagreements.'' I am very hopeful that they will just \nuse ``former disagreements.'' I think that would be a little more \nhelpful here. [Laughter.]\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers. I thank them for the support for \nthis amendment. I hope it will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The amendment (No. 415) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 413, As Modified\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send to the desk technical amendments. \nThis changes a couple of letters and numerals. They are technical \ncorrections to amendment No. 413 that were made earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 413), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 6 through 20, and insert in lieu \n     thereof and renumber accordingly:\n       ``(1) Reporting to Congress and the Comptroller General.--\n       (A) Before a rule can take effect as a final rule, the \n     Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each \n     House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report \n     containing--\n       (i) a copy of the rule;\n       (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule; and\n       (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule.\n       (B) The Federal agency promulgating the rule shall make \n     available to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General, upon request:\n       (i) a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the \n     rule, if any;\n       (ii) the agency's actions relevant to section 603, section \n     604, section 605, section 607, and section 609 of P.L. 96-\n     354;\n       (iii) the agency's actions relevant to Title II, section \n     202, section 203, section 204, and section 205 of P.L. 104-4; \n     and\n       (iv) any other relevant information or requirements under \n     any other Act and any relevant Executive Orders, such as \n     Executive Order 12866.\n       (C) Upon receipt, each House shall provide copies to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of each committee with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) Reporting by the comptroller general.--\n       (A) The Comptroller General shall provide a report on each \n     significant rule to the committees of jurisdiction to each \n     House of the Congress by the end of 12 calendar days after \n     the submission or publication date as provided in section \n     4(b)(2). The report of the Comptroller General shall include \n     an assessment of the agency's compliance with procedural \n     steps required by subsection B(i) through (iv).\n       (B) Federal agencies shall cooperate with the Comptroller \n     General by providing information relevant to the Comptroller \n     General's report under subsection (2)(A) of this section.''\n       On page 14, at the beginning of line 5, insert ``section \n     3(a)(1)-(2) and '', and on line 5 strike ``3(a)(2)'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``3(a)(3)''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs Committee's \nunanimous bipartisan regulatory reform bill has a legislative veto of \nmajor rules in it. Major rules. I believe this is a good proposal, \nbecause there are anywhere from between 700 to 900, some estimates have \ngone as high as 1,000, ``major'' or ``significant'' rules issued each \nyear. And that word ``significant'' means something special, because \nthese are the rules that have an annual impact on the economy of $100 \nmillion per year or more, or otherwise have a significant impact on the \neconomy or a region of the country, or other important effect.\n  These 700 to 900 major rules or regulations are the big rules out of \nthe approximately 4,000 rules that are issued every year--4,000. One \nestimate today when we were discussing another bill was that these \nrules in some years run as high as 4,800 to 5,000.\n  Let us say an average of 4,000 rules are issued each year by Federal \nagencies. A legislative veto, where we call rules back up or have the \npotential for calling them back up for review, for all 4,000 rules, I \nthink, is just too much. What kind of regulatory overload are we \nputting on the Congress? Will we be so overloaded in these rules that \nwe will not be able to adequately consider ones that we should \nconsider?\n  It is the major rules that we care about, the ones that are \nsignificant. These are the big rules that implement the primary \npolicies and requirements of our laws on public health and safety, on \nenvironmental protection, economic policy, communications, farm policy, \nand all the rest.\n  We have a hard enough time getting our work done the way things are. \nI do not think we should create an almost automatic process to bring up \nevery rule under the Sun.\n  Let me give some examples. Just from yesterday's Federal Register, I \nsee rules on drawbridge closings, rules on safety zones in New Jersey's \nMetedeconk River, Federal prison work compensation program rules, \nJustice Department claims settlement rules, FAA--the Federal Aviation \nAdministration--class D airspace rules.\n  And I would say from some personal experience, FAA just a short time \nago redid all the airspace designations, A, B, C, D, and F, right on \ndown the line, to show what areas planes can fly into and out of \nwithout radios, being on instrument control, visual flight rules, and \nso on. These kind of rules are still being flushed out and changed a \nbit. So one of the things in the Federal Register is for class D \nairspace rules.\n  There is the postsecondary education ``borrower defenses'' \nregulations.\n  Let us not forget that the reason we have agencies and an open \n``notice and comment'' administrative process is so that Government can \nget its work done in a fair and orderly and semiefficient process. At \nleast, that is the goal.\n  We need regulatory reform. And I am first to support regulatory \nreform. We worked on it for several years in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. So we know we need regulatory reform, and I am all for it. I \nhave been saying that for some time. But we do not need to create more \ngridlock by trying to run, or have the potential of running, 4,000 \nrules through Congress each year. That is a bottleneck that we just do \nnot need.\n  We are trying to make Government work better, not grind to a complete \nhalt.\n  So I think we need to keep the legislative veto focused on the big \nrules that really matter, that really mean something, ones that we \nshould be addressing.\n  The amendment I was going to submit limits the legislative veto to \nsignificant rules--just significant rules, \n[[Page S4708]]  not all the smaller rules, the significant ones--that \nfit the definition that I gave a moment ago. Again, this matches the \nscope of the provision we passed in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nby a vote of 15 to 0--eight Republicans and seven Democrats.\n  The amendment that I was planning to submit would make the following \nchanges to the Nickles-Reid substitute:\n  One, the amendment would insert the word ``significant'' into the \nsubstitute at three places--in sections 3(a)(1)(A), 3(b), and 3(d)(1). \nWith this change, the congressional hold-over and process covers \n``significant rules'' instead of all ``rules.''\n  No. 2, the amendment would have stricken one subsection, section \n3(a)(3). This would have deleted the paragraph relating to effective \ndate for other rules which refers to the submission of nonsignificant \nrules to Congress for review.\n  Again, the single purpose of this amendment would have been making \nthe legislative veto process apply to significant rules. This is what \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee supports unanimously, and I think it \nmakes good sense.\n  The alternative, congressional review of potentially all 4,000 rules \nissued each year, makes little sense to me at all.\n  Mr. President, I will not submit this amendment. I did want to \naddress it, but I will not submit it because I know from discussions \nwith the floor leaders that we are not going to get this adopted. The \nvotes are there to defeat this.\n  So I would rather not have a vote on it now. I think the best thing \nto do is not submit it, but talk a little bit about it and let people \nknow how important I think it is and, hopefully, out of the conference \nprocess with the House, we might be able to address this problem.\n  But let me just say a couple more things. Four thousand rules could \nbe sent to Congress and parceled out to appropriate committees--just \nthink of that--4,000 rules. That would be the potential. I am not \nsaying all 4,000 rules are going to be called up every time. But let me \nsay this: For each rule, you sure are going to have some lobbyists out \nthere interested in that rule. We are going to have lobbyists coming \nout of the woodwork to lobby one or more Members to move a resolution \nof disapproval through the appropriate committee. That can be done \nthrough committee. So these lobbyists would be trying to get Members to \nmove that resolution of disapproval.\n  If the committee does not act within 20 days, the lobbyists will work \nto get 30 Members to sign a petition of discharge or will pressure the \nmajority and minority leaders to discharge the committee.\n  So the lobbyists and special interests will have special ways of \ndoing this, first with committee members. If that does not work, then \nthey will try for the majority or minority leaders, or within 20 days \nthey can do the 30-Members approach of signing a petition to have that \nparticular rule brought up for reconsideration.\n  If the committee reports out a resolution of disapproval or the \ncommittee is discharged, the disapproval of the rule will be the \nsubject of lobbying by those parties affected. All this could happen; \nthe potential is there for it to happen up to 4,000 times a year.\n  If we think the demands for lobby reform have been great before, you \njust wait until the public sees the lobbying feeding frenzy, like \npiranhas, looking at this legislation, and the potential for redoing \nlegislation that they may have just lost a point on in the recent past \nwhen the original legislation was passed.\n  So that kind of a lobbying feeding frenzy could take place after we \nprovide expedited procedures for congressional review of all these \nrules.\n  That might just be for starters. Consider what will happen if we pass \na controversial bill that produces significant political argument. All \nthese things are not bound up just in money. Significant rules can have \na basis other than money.\n  Think of this one: We pass a controversial bill that produces \nsignificant political argument--let us take a hot button item like \nabortion. We know what happens every time that issue comes up in the \nCongress. When we have to debate abortion legislation, every \nregulation, every rule, no matter how minor, will have a whole string \nof Senators and lobbyists and outside groups who will want to bring \nthat regulation back to the floor, not necessarily because they think \nthe regulation does not reflect congressional intent--it may be perfect \nand may have passed with a majority and have expressed congressional \nintent perfectly. Because what they want under our expedited procedures \nis to spend 10 hours in political and ideological argument, regardless \nof the original bill that might have just passed. So we are opening all \nof that up.\n  I had hoped to close some of that up by designating just the \nsignificant rules for reconsideration.\n  When we open up this additional time under our expedited procedures \nto spend extra hours, the 10 hours in political or ideological \nargument, about something that just passed--and I used the example of \nabortion because we all know how impassioned the pleas get around here \nand how emotional that issue is, think of what happens if we pass \nsomething in that regard and we are out here with the agencies doing \nrules and regulations to back up what the Congress just passed. Then we \nfind that once the rules and regulations are written, do we think that \nthe lobbying groups will not immediately come back up and do everything \nthey possibly can do to get that back on the floor again for additional \ndiscussion? You can bet they will.\n  Is that what we want? Do we want to provide a forum for continually \nrevisiting issues that have been settled by a vote because a vocal and \ndetermined minority will now have the review of regulation by Congress \nas a convenient trigger for such debate?\n  Well, I know when to put amendments in, I hope, and I know when the \namendments are not worthy to be put in because they are just going to \nbe voted down. I think the second is the situation I find myself in \nright now.\n  I think this would be better legislation if we had in there the \namendment I was going to propose. But since we will not have it in \nthere, I just want everyone to know that I will be voting for the \nlegislative veto, but with my fingers crossed that we do not wind up \ncreating a real gridlock in legislative reconsideration of legislation \njust passed for which the rules and regulations are being written.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 412, as Modified, to Amendment No. 410\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a copy of amendment No. \n412, which has already been adopted, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be modified as indicated on this document that I am \nsending to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have been working with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Levin, as well as Senator Byrd from West Virginia. \nWe have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, with its modification, is as follows:\n       On page 9, line 2, strike everything after ``discharged'' \n     through the period on line 6 and insert the following: ``from \n     further consideration of such resolution in the Senate upon a \n     petition supported in writing by 30 Members of the Senate, \n     and in the House upon a petition supported in writing by one-\n     fourth of the Members duly sworn and chosen or by motion of \n     the Speaker supported by the Minority Leader, and such \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House involved.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and I particularly thank Senator Byrd for pointing out \nto us the problem which could have been raised unintentionally by that \namendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 416 to Amendment No. 410\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 416 to amendment No. 410.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n   [[Page S4709]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, strike lines 3 through 7, and insert in lieu \n     thereof:\n\n     ``SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       No determinationa, finding, action, or omission under this \n     Act shall be subject to judicial review.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the issue of \njudicial review. It has been agreed to by the managers of the bill, and \nI thank them for their cooperation and support.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Ohio also for the tremendous work \nthat he has put in on this amendment and also on the entire bill. I \nwill have something more to say about his comments relative to which \nrules should be subject to legislative review, because I happen to \nagree with his comments a few moments ago.\n  The purpose of this amendment, which I understand has been agreed to \nby the managers of the bill, is to be more precise on the question of \njudicial review. The substitute that is before us in two sections \nspecifies that they are not subject to judicial review, and the problem \nis that there could be an ambiguity raised unintentionally about the \nreviewability then of other sections which do not have that language.\n  So the concern that some of us have is the implication relative to \nother sections of the bill by the specific language in two sections of \nthe bill.\n  My amendment states that no determination, finding, action or \nomission under this act shall be subject to judicial review, which \nclarifies the judicial nonreviewability of this act. I understand that \nthis has been cleared by the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Is there further debate on the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMichigan. We have no objection to this amendment. This amendment \nprecludes judicial review of determinations, findings, actions, or \nomissions with respect to this act. However, judicial review of \nregulations not disproved by Congress is not affected by this act. Of \ncourse, it is expected that the courts will give affect to any \ndisapproval of the regulation.\n  Moreover, instructions to the courts contained in the act, such as \nsection 3(g) regarding inferences not to be drawn from this inaction \nare neither determinations, findings, actions or omissions, within the \nmeaning of the amendment; and therefore courts are expected to accept \nsuch direction from the Congress. Therefore, we have no objection to \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 416) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 414, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as to amendment No. 414, which was \npreviously accepted, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Page 5 of amendment No. 414 is modified as follows:\n       (2) Final agency action.--The term ``final agency action'' \n     means agency action with respect to which all available \n     administrative remedies have been exhausted.\n       (3) Term grazing permit.--The term ``term grazing permit'' \n     means a term grazing permit or grazing agreement issued by \n     the Secretary under section 402 of the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1752), section 19 of \n     the Act entitled ``An Act to facilitate and simplify the work \n     of the Forest Service, and for other purposes'', approved \n     April 24, 1950 (commonly known as the ``Granger-Thye Act'') \n     (16 U.S.C. 580l), or other law.\n\n     SEC.  03. ISSUANCE OF NEW TERM GRAZING PERMITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, regulation, policy, court order, or court sanctioned \n     settlement agreement, the Secretary shall issue a new term \n     grazing permit without regard to whether the analysis \n     required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other applicable laws has been \n     completed, or final agency action respecting the analysis has \n     been taken--\n       (1) to the holder of an expiring term grazing permit; or\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest of the Senator from Iowa?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4705-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4709-S4711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak for the fifth and \nprobably final time--at least for a few days--on this subject of \nDepartment of Defense appropriations and the continuing program budget \nmismatch.\n  If Congress rolled back DOD's spending plans at the height of the \ncold war in the mid-1980's--and we did that on May 2, 1985--then why \nwould Congress now move to pump up the defense budget when the cold war \nis over and the Soviet threat is gone? It makes no sense to me.\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has prepared an \ninteresting set of tables that portray the evolution of the future \nyears defense program for the Defense Department and the budget \nmismatch with that future years plain. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthis printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Mr. President, I hope that we can see through all the \nfog. I hope that the gap between the future years defense plan and the \nbudget does not mean the military has unfunded needs.\n  A superficial examination shows that the future years defense plan \ntopline matches exactly the topline in the President's budget.\n  In theory, then, that means that all military requirements are met. \nThat does not happen to be the real world, however.\n  History teaches us that the cost of the Department of Defense future \nyears defense plan, which is 6 years out, almost always exceeds money \nin the budget. That is called overprogramming.\n  The projected cost of the future years defense plan exceeds what \nCongress finally appropriates.\n  If the Budget Committee sent a resolution to the floor with a \nDepartment of Defense-style overprogramming, I feel the Parliamentarian \nwould rule it out of order.\n  So what we are faced with is a lack of truth in budgeting.\n  First, the leaders in the Pentagon keep us, and perhaps themselves, \nin the dark with bad information--bad numbers.\n  Second, the leaders at the Pentagon fail to manage. They avoid the \ntough decisions. They finance the programs, and they use maneuvers \ncalled the ``buy in'' and ``front loading'' to get the camel's nose \nunder the tent for a specific program. The tent happens to be the \nfuture years' defense plan, 6 years of planning. To get the whole camel \nin the tent, the tent either has to be made bigger or the camel gets \nsmaller.\n  DOD knows this, but they will not tell us. They really will not admit \nit. When Congress balks, the Department of Defense buys half a camel \nand then blames Congress for the mess, what eventually becomes a \nstretch out. It is kind of a process of extortion. The camel, which \ncould be any of these defense programs, has to be reconfigured to fit \nunder the tent of the future years' defense plan. So instead of buying \na whole camel like we thought and need, we end up buying half a camel.\n  This is the downside of the plans/reality mismatch, which is all too \nevident in every defense budget.\n  This process undermines our force structure. Pretty soon, the \nmilitary cannot do its assigned missions. The force is just too small.\n  There is yet another way to look at the problem and that is, once a \nprogram gains a solid foothold in the future years' defense program and \nthat plan gets rolling, its true costs start to ooze out.\n  As its costs rise, overly optimistic funding levels do not \nmaterialize. The topline, then, is pressed downward by us in the \nCongress because we only have so much money to spend, including \nborrowing money, including for defense.\n  Congress is faced with fiscal realities and is forced to lower the \ntopline. Costs are underestimated and available funding is \noverestimated. That is why the camel will not fit into the tent. The \nmoney squeeze keeps making the tent smaller.\n  The Seawolf submarine is an excellent case in point. When it was sold \nto the Congress, the Navy promised that it would cost no more than $1 \nbillion a copy. Now the costs are all the way up to $3 billion, and \nperhaps even more.\n  The F-22 fighter is another perfect example of the front-loading \noperation, where a particular plan will not fit into the budget with \nthe available money that we have to appropriate.\n  When the Seawolf and the F-22 front-loading operations are repeated \nhundreds or even thousands of times in each future years' defense plan \nfor each separate program, we are staring down the throat of a ravenous \nmonster.\n  This produces what I call a future years' defense plan blivet. Costs \ngo up, \n[[Page S4711]]  projected funding comes down, and it is like trying to \nstuff 10 pounds of manure into a 5-pound bag.\n  Front loading is a wasteful and destructive practice.\n  The worst part about it is that the military does not get what it \nneeds to do its job.\n  With the Seawolf and the F-22, the military will never get enough \nsubs and fighters to modernize the force as we know it.\n  The GAO's ongoing historical studies of procurement programs show \nthat the Department of Defense pays more but gets less.\n  For example, 130 percent is paid for 80 percent of a program. We must \nfind a way to control this monster. Leadership, integrity, courage, and \ngood information--that is what is needed. With leadership and good \ninformation, Pentagon managers might have the courage to make the hard \nchoices needed to squeeze all of the programs into the money sack that \nwe finally approve.\n  More money cannot be the answer because we all know that the Pentagon \nhas an insatiable appetite for more money and, quite frankly, we cannot \nappropriate enough money to satisfy the appetite of the Defense to \nspend. Caspar Weinberger taught us that lesson the hard way.\n  Mr. President, that famous budget analyst over there at DOD, Chuck \nSpinney, whom I spoke about a couple speeches ago, the man who got his \npicture on the front cover of Time magazine, is still cranking out his \nspaghetti diagrams. He is doing it over there in the bowels of the \nPentagon. His new briefing is called ``Anatomy in Decline.''\n  Like before, his data is derived from the future year defense plans. \nIt sounds like the same old story to me, but we need to be sure. I \nbelieve that Chuck Spinney has a great deal of credibility, but I \nsuppose since so many people in this body might not agree, then we have \nto do other work to make sure that it is backed up.\n  Senator Roth and I have asked the General Accounting Office to \nconduct an independent analysis and validation of the data and \nmethodology used in this new Spinney study. Hopefully, the General \nAccounting Office will help put the problem in a very much \nunderstandable perspective.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to wrap up my thoughts on the \nintegrity of the Department of Defense budget. In a nutshell, Mr. \nPresident, we have financial chaos at the Pentagon.\n  We have meaningless accounting numbers. We have meaningless budget \nnumbers. We have meaningless cost estimates. To make matters worse, the \nnumbers are not just meaningless; they are also misleading and they are \ndeceptive. Bad financial information leads to bad decisions. And there \nis no accountability for fiscal mismanagement.\n  The top leadership in the building has been aware of the problems for \na long time. Even former Secretary Les Aspin talked about his fiscal \nhorror show. Secretary Perry has also talked about his.\n  Despite all the hand wringing in the Pentagon, despite all the \nmisleading accounting and the misleading budget information, it still \nall continues to be tolerated at the top levels.\n  It is almost a joke. Officials openly laugh about it. The chief \nfinancial officer of any company would be fired on the spot for \npresenting such inaccurate and misleading fiscal data. He or she might \neven be jailed.\n  Now I know that the new comptroller over there, Mr. Hamre, is trying \nto fix the problem. But trying is not enough, although I do give him \ngood marks, marks for being well intentioned and trying to overcome all \nthe obstacles that are over there for the comptroller to do the job \nthat he is charged with doing.\n  I say ``trying is not enough'' because he has to do it, and heads \nwill have to roll because this job is done. Bad accounting and budget \nnumbers keep Congress and the American people in the dark. That is an \nundemocratic process of our constitutional responsibility of control. \nIt is undemocratic because it is unaccountable to the people.\n  We have a duty and a responsibility to the citizens of this country \nto give them a complete and a very accurate accounting of how we are \nspending their money.\n  Today, we are unable to do that as far as the Defense budget is \nconcerned. We do not know how the money was used last year, and we do \nnot know how the money will be used next year.\n  My message, Mr. President, is quite simple: If we do not know where \nwe are and we do not know where we have been, we cannot possibly figure \nout where we are going. In regard to this defense issue, we could be \nlost. We cannot make good budget decisions until we get some good \nnumbers.\n  Until the Department of Defense budget shambles is cleaned up, I do \nnot think anyone knows for sure how much is needed for national defense \nright now.\n  Yet the President wants to put $25 billion more in, and people in \nthis body want to put still, on top of that, another $55 billion. Why \nwould we want to throw more good money after bad? It is beyond me, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I hope some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle will join me \nin being a frugal hog. That means opposing any increase in the defense \nbudget. Instead, we should work hard for better management, more \naccurate information, and for sure, accountability. Otherwise, we are \nall doomed to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, as I have concluded my statements \non the integrity, or lack thereof, of the Defense Department budget.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may modify \namendment No. 415, which was previously agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, No. 415, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, beginning on line 1, strike all through line 22 \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(2) Significant rule.--The term ``significant rule''--\n       (A) means any final rule, issued after November 9, 1994, \n     that the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget \n     finds--\n       (i) has an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \n     more or adversely affects in a material way the economy, a \n     sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \n     environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or \n     tribal governments or communities;\n       (ii) creates a serious inconsistency or otherwise \n     interferes with an action taken or planned by another agency;\n       (iii) materially alters the budgetary impact of \n     entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the \n     rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or\n       (iv) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of \n     legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles \n     set forth in Executive Order 12866.\n       (B) does not include any agency action that establishes, \n     modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for \n     a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity relating \n     to hunting, fishing, or camping.''\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I might mention, this modification is \njust changing paragraph and page in the amendment that has already been \nagreed upon.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have a question about the effect of the Nickles-Reid \nsubstitute on a regulation by the Department of Transportation to \nreduce the liability limit of deepwater ports like the Louisiana \nOffshore Oil Port [LOOP]. As the Senator may be aware, the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990 established a new Federal regime governing \nliability for oilspill damages and cleanup. As part of that regime, \nliability limits were established for different types of vessels and \nfacilities and, in the case of deepwater ports, the liability limit was \nestablished at $350 million. Recognizing that this limit might \n[[Page S4712]] be inordinately high, however, the Oil Pollution Act \nrequired that the Department of Transportation undertake a study and \npropose a lower limit if appropriate. The Coast Guard study was \ncompleted in October 1993. It concluded that the use of deepwater ports \nis the least risky means of importing crude oil to the United States \nand that a lower liability limit is appropriate. The rulemaking to \nlower LOOP's liability limit was initiated on February 8, 1995. It \ncould reduce the liability limit from its present level at $350 million \nto $50 million--a $300 million difference. yet the economic impact of \nthis change, as I think the committee intended it to be measured, will \nbe much more limited, consisting primarily of the lower annual \ninsurance costs LOOP will incur which reflect the lower risk associated \nwith deepwater ports such as LOOP. Am I correct in understanding that \nthe proposed rule to lower LOOP's liability limit would not be \nconsidered a significant rule under the substitute, and therefore would \ntake effect without a 45-day delay?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator has an excellent point. Although our \nsubstitute provides that the administrator of the Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs makes the determinations of what will qualify as \n``significant rules,'' it appears clear on its face that in this case, \nthe measurement of the economic impact of the regulation would be the \ncost savings to LOOP, not the dollar amount by which its liability \nlimit is reduced, and therefore in my opinion, it probably would not be \nconsidered a significant rule by OIRA for purposes of this legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator for his interpretation of the \nstandard of measurement for economic impact and its application to the \nrule reducing LOOP's liability limit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 417 to Amendment No. 410\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered 417 to amendment No. \n     410.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14 of the amendment, line 2, strike the period and \n     insert: ``, except that such term does not include any rule \n     of particular applicability including a rule that approves or \n     prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or \n     allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, \n     reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or \n     accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the \n     foregoing or any rule of agency organization, personnel, \n     procedure, practice or any routine matters.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, agencies issue probably thousands of rules \neach year that pertain only to one person or business. These are rules \nthat are issued on a routine basis--opening a bridge, changing a flight \npath, exempting a person from meeting general standards that do not \napply to that person's particular situations. I do not think these \nrules are included in that 4,000 count that we sometimes use as the \nrules that would be covered by this legislative review provision.\n  These are the rules of specific, particular applicability that have \nno general applicability, and that it is not our intent, I believe--I \nshould not say that, but I do not believe it is the intent of the \nmakers of the substitute here--to cover by the substitute.\n  So this amendment makes it clear that these rules of particular \napplicability and these routine rules are not covered by this \nlegislative review substitute.\n  I believe the amendment has been cleared by the managers of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's amendment. We \nhave worked with him and his staff on this amendment. We have no \nobjections and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Michigan for \nhis work on this. He has worked long and hard on rules and regulations \nin the Governmental Affairs Committee. This is one example of how \nthorough he is in these areas.\n  Even though we can pass laws--we can pass rules and regulations--\nthere are coincidences that apply in particular cases or places, or \nthings are found to be unfair with the local people. And, where that \ncan be corrected, it should be corrected.\n  This provides for that kind of a correction where otherwise people \nwould be dealt with very unfairly by their government. We are trying to \nmake this as fair as possible for everybody.\n  That is what the Senator from Michigan is doing. I compliment him and \nam glad to cosponsor his amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of any further debate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment (No. 417) is \nagreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a little while ago the majority leader \nspoke on the floor regarding the administration's Reinventing \nGovernment proposal.\n  The majority leader suggested that the President has jumped on the \nbudget-cutting bandwagon and that he has done so in response to the \nNovember 1994 election.\n  Mr. President, the President and the Vice President, since before the \nNovember 1992 election, have stated and proven their commitment to the \nprocess of streamlining government. The proposal announced yesterday \nhas been labeled ``REGO II,'' because it is the second phase in a \nReinventing Government process that began over 2 years ago.\n  Through that process headed by Vice President Gore, we have already \ntaken steps to cut back the Federal Government. The Federal work force \nis today the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was in the White \nHouse. The proposal announced yesterday would cut $13.1 billion and \neliminate 4,805 Government positions over the next 5 years.\n  Reinventing Government has been an ongoing, thoughtful process based \non careful analysis of the ways with which to cut the bureaucracy while \nensuring the Government's ability to meet our policy goals.\n  To suggest that the President or the Vice President have jumped on \nthe bandwagon is off base.\n  The majority leader also suggested that the rescissions bill the \nSenate is about to consider will provide immediate savings and is, \ntherefore, superior to the President's Reinventing Government proposal.\n  First, Mr. President, the administration's Reinventing Government \nproposal and the rescissions package are not in competition. It is not \nan either/or. We can and should cut waste and streamline Government \nwhenever and wherever it makes sense and fits within our national \npriorities.\n  But if the comparison is going to be made, it should be accurate. I \nwould hate for anyone to be left with the impression that the \nRepublican rescissions package provides over $13 billion in cash \nsavings in fiscal year 1995, because it does not.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposal would cut \n$13.2 billion in budget authority in fiscal year 1995, but the outlay \nsavings would be $11.48 billion spread over the next 5 years. The \nanalysis from CBO shows that, while $13.2 billion in budget authority \nwould be cut in fiscal year 1995, \n[[Page S4713]]  the Republican proposal would cut only $1.138 billion \nin outlays in fiscal year 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a CBO analysis issued today on the \nrescissions package be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SUMMARY: SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT, 1995 (S. 617), STATUS: SENATE REPORTED    \n           [Note: estimates based on April 1, 1995 enactment; by fiscal year, in millions of dollars]           \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Outlays--                        \n                                            Budget   -----------------------------------------------------------\n                                           authority     1995        1996        1997        1998        1999   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Emergencies                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                \nFiscal year 1995........................      1,900         335          67       1,498           0           0 \n                                                                                                                \n         Contingent Emergencies                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                \nFiscal year 1996........................      4,800           0           0         346       1,981       2,474 \n                                                                                                                \n              Supplementals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                \n      Fiscal year 1995..................          2         (15)         20         304          99           0 \n                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary...........................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to the pending substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the substitute. I have supported \nwhat we call legislative review--the earlier form being called \nlegislative veto--not only when I got to the U.S. Senate but before I \ngot to the U.S. Senate. It was actually, believe it or not, part of my \nelection platform when I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978, because \nI believed that elected officials should have the responsibility to \nreview important regulations of the bureaucracy.\n  I found, as a local official, that I was too often confronted with \nregulations which had major impacts on my community, and I was told, if \nyou want to go and complain about those regulations, go to the agencies \nsomewhere out in the yonder somewhere, see if you can find that agency \nor the regional office of that agency somewhere. I was shunted around \nfrom unelected official to unelected official. I wanted very much to \nhave an elected person accountable to me for major regulations, be it \nan elected President or be it an elected Member of Congress.\n  So I very much supported legislative veto starting in 1979 when I \nworked with Elliott Levitas in the House and Harrison Schmitt in the \nSenate on Government-wide legislative veto, as well as a specific \nprovision for the Federal Trade Commission.\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Ribicoff, who was then chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, held a series of hearings on regulatory \nreform, did a major study which was the basis for an omnibus regulatory \nreform bill called S. 1080 that passed the Senate in 1982 but died in \nthe House.\n  I sponsored the legislative veto provision that was added to the FTC. \nThe reason we did that was because of some major controversial rulings \nof the FTC relative to used-car dealers and funeral directors and other \nmajor industries and segments of our economy.\n  Senator Schmitt and I, in March 1982, offered a Government-wide \nlegislative review amendment to the regulatory reform bill that I have \nmade reference to. And some of the same key players who are active \nnow--Senators Nickles, Grassley, and Cochran--were all cosponsors of \nthat legislative veto provision. That amendment was adopted by an \noverwhelming vote. We would be in a lot better shape today had that \nprovision been enacted into law.\n  That provision, like Nickles-Reid, required a joint resolution of \ndisapproval as distinguished from just a concurrent resolution or a \nsimple resolution. The Supreme Court in Chadha had ruled that the \nconcurrent resolution form of legislative veto was unconstitutional.\n  After the defeat of that omnibus regulatory reform bill, S. 1080, in \nthe House, Senator Grassley tried to resurrect it in the 98th Congress. \nI supported that effort. But, again, we did not make it.\n  So, Mr. President, with that kind of long history of support for \nlegislative \n[[Page S4714]]  veto, here called legislative review because it is \nsomewhat different from those original forms, I am happy to cosponsor \nthe substitute that is before us. And I am particularly pleased because \nI think this has a good chance of becoming law. This is real reform.\n  I believe it is the most significant reform that we can make in this \narea, because regulation is legislative in nature. Except for these \nrules of specific applicability or individual applicability which we \nhave now exempted, when rules are adopted by agencies, they are \nsignificantly legislative in effect. They apply to large numbers of \npeople, usually prospectively. And it is because of that legislative \nnature of these major rules that we should keep some political \naccountability. We should be politically responsible for the actions of \nthe agencies to make sure that what they are doing carries out our \nintent and to make sure that what they are doing in fact is cost \neffective.\n  Mr. President, the delay that is involved in this form of legislative \nreview is insignificant. The Administrative Procedures Act already has \na mandatory 30-day delay before a rule can become effective. There may \nbe a little problem when Congress is out of session, but we are just \ngoing to have to live with that. But this 45-day period of delay to \ngive Congress an opportunity to use an expedited process to review a \nrule that it chooses to on an individual basis makes us accountable for \nthe rules that affect large numbers of people's lives in this country. \nWe should accept that responsibility. We should be accountable for this \nkind of agency activity.\n  This legislative review approach will do just that, and it does it in \na very reasonable way. It is not a lumping of all rules together like \nthat moratorium was and say freeze everything. This, to the contrary, \ntakes a look at individual rules by the Congress, and the only delay \nthat is involved, that 45-day delay, makes it possible for us \nlegislatively to look individually at rules to make sure again that, \nbefore a rule goes into effect, it is cost effective and carries out \nour intent.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I am pleased to cosponsor this substitute. \nI congratulate Senator Nickles and Senator Reid on this substitute. The \nSenator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada are to be \ncongratulated on this substitute and I think it has been improved by a \nseries of amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate began debate on \noverhauling how the Federal Government imposes regulatory regulations. \nThis legislation is the first of several bills the Senate may consider \nthat have far-reaching implications for every policy that we consider \non the floor.\n  In the last 20 years, this Congress has passed many laws to protect \nthe public health and safety. The regulations to implement these laws \nwere largely written by Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush.\n  The theory behind this legislation is that regulators have been \nrunning amok.\n  If that is so, they have been running very slowly. Today, every car \nad brags about airbags, but it took 20 years to get the regulations in \nplace to protect us from accidents.\n  In 1987, I started trying to get meat inspection reformed. It has \ntaken 8 years to get those regulations issued--they are not final--even \nthough they will save 4,000 lives a year.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee will soon consider a bill that will \ndelay them at least 2 years more.\n  This proposed legislation is not an antidote to regulators run amok. \nIt is regulatory reform run amok. I believe in regulatory reform. The \nLaxalt-Leahy regulatory reform bill passed the Senate unanimously in \n1982--13 years ago.\n  I believe that first, Congress should decide what responsibility we \nhave to avoid harming our neighbors--what values it wants to protect. \nThen the agencies should use cost-benefit analysis--and whatever other \ntools are available to make the best decision.\n  This bill takes a fundamentally different approach to regulatory \nreform.\n  This bill is hypocritical.\n  Under this legislation USDA will continue to give a ``grade A'' label \nto unsafe meat.\n  This bill is so unworkable that the corporate lawyers insist on being \nexempted from it. Permits to put a product on the market are exempt \nfrom all reform. To protect the public, however, you have to do a \njudicially reviewable, peer reviewed, cost-benefit analysis and a peer \nreviewed, judicially reviewable, risk assessment.\n  This bill is unworkable. My regulatory reform bill used cost-benefit \nanalysis as a tool to make sure regulation is done right. This bill \ntakes a useful tool, and turns it into a rigid rule.\n  My bill made sure that rules were based on a cost-benefit analysis. \nThis bill is a recipe for paralysis.\n  Instead of making sure there are good decisions, it makes sure that \nthere will be no decisions.\n  This bill is antidemocratic. Even the Reagan Department of Justice \nrejected putting the courts in charge of cost-benefit analysis because \nit was antidemocratic.\n  An elite group of economists using formulas we do not understand, and \nvalues we do not share, will veto laws passed by Congress designed to \nprotect the health and safety of the American people.\n  Perhaps this legislation can be fixed. If not, President Clinton \nshould veto it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise with great ambivalence about the \nlegislation that we are considering today. I have expressed grave \nreservations about efforts to impose a regulatory moratorium, similar \nto that reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I believe \nsuch legislation to be extreme, because it assumes all regulations are \nbad, and does not allow for distinctions between necessary regulations \nand superfluous regulations.\n  While I agree that we should scrutinize regulations to assure that \nthey are justified and reasonable, I believe a straight moratorium to \nbe irresponsible. In that context, I am pleased that a bipartisan \nsubstitute has been offered to change the focus of this bill toward a \nlegislative veto, which allows Congress to formally review major \nregulations.\n  However, even though the substitute we are considering today is \nreasonable, I am concerned that the regulatory moratorium concept is \nnot dead. The House has passed moratorium legislation, and will be \npushing to have that version enacted.\n  Foremost among my concerns with a moratorium is the status of pending \ndrinking water regulations addressing cryptosporidium. Just under 2 \nyears ago, the residents of Milwaukee experienced a debilitating \noutbreak of the parasite cryptosporidium in the drinking water. Buy the \ntime the parasite infestation had fully run its course, 104 Milwaukee \nresidents had died, and over 400,000 had suffered from a debilitating \nillness.\n  And it turns out that this problem was nothing new to this Nation. In \nreality, while the Milwaukee incident is the largest reported \ncryptosporidium outbreak in U.S. history, it is just one of many \noutbreaks nationwide. Other major outbreaks in recent years include a \n1987 cryptosporidium outbreak in Carrollton, GA, that sickened 13,000 \npeople, and a 1992 incident in Jackson County, OR, that caused 15,000 \npeople to become ill. There are numerous other examples of parasite \ncontamination nationwide.\n  But despite these outbreaks, no regulatory actions had been taken to \nprotect consumers against future outbreaks. With the Milwaukee \ndisaster, the Nation finally woke up to the problem. In the aftermath \nof Milwaukee, EPA is now in the process of promulgating a package of \nregulations to require communities to test for cryptosporidium in their \ndrinking water, and ultimately to treat the water to remove \ncryptosporidium threats. These regulations are long overdue and must \nnot be delayed any further.\n  Mr. President, I offer the cryptosporidium example to remind my \ncolleagues that there are instances in which the Federal Government has \nnot done enough. Much of the rhetoric of recent months has been focused \non the extreme horror stories of overregulation. While some of these \nconcerns are valid, we must also remember the horror stories of \nunderregulation. I believe that the 104 deaths and 400,000 illnesses in \nMilwaukee are a testimony to the dangers of government inaction.\n  I certainly believe that the cryptosporidium threat in this Nation \n[[Page S4715]]  constitutes an imminent threat to human health and \nsafety, and should, therefore, be theoretically exempted from any \nregulatory moratorium bill. However, I am concerned that the \nbureaucratic process necessary to make a declaration of imminent threat \nwill cause unnecessary delay and place the people of this Nation at \nfuture risk.\n  So while I will support this substitute to establish a legislative \nveto, I do so with reservations about the potential of a resurrected \nregulatory moratorium. If such an effort is renewed in this body, I \nwill strongly oppose such legislation.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) \nof the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) \nof the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect \nto Angola, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United \nNations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with the \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, \n1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than \nthrough designated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale \nor supply to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola \n(``UNITA''). United States persons are prohibited from activities that \npromote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from \nattempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that \nhave the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. \nThe order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the \npromulgation of rules and regulations, as might be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (``FAC'') issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. 64904)\n to implement the President's declaration of a national emergency and \nimposition of sanctions against Angola (UNITA). There have been no \namendments to the Regulations since my report of September 20, 1994.\n\n  The Regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola \nother than through designated points. United States persons are also \nprohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote \nsuch sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by \nany United States persons that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of \nevading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions \nset forth in the Executive order. Also prohibited are transactions by \nUnited States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels \nor aircraft, relating to transportation to Angola or UNITA of goods the \nexportation of which is prohibited.\n  The Government of Angola has designated the following points of entry \nas points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the \nRegulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela \nProvince; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benguela Province; and Namibe, \nNamibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although \nno specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for \nshipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is \ndestined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing \nrequirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.\n  2. FAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to assure \na heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA--through the \ndissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic \nbulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls \nfrom banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of \nthese prohibitions. United States exporters have also been notified of \nthe sanctions through a variety of media, including special fliers and \ncomputer bulletin board information initiated by FAC and posted through \nthe Department of Commerce and the Government Printing Office. There \nhave been no license applications under the program.\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from September 26, 1994, through March 25, 1995, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nAngola (UNITA) are reported at about $50,000, most of which represents \nwage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were \nlargely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, the Customs Service, the Office of \nthe Under Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General \nCounsel) and the Department of State (particularly the Office of \nSouthern African Affairs).\n  I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I am this morning going to introduce a \nbill that I am hopeful the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate will \ntake into consideration rather quickly and report something to the U.S. \nSenate akin to what I am going to talk about for the next few minutes.\n  There is much talk about seeing to it that we insist that parents be \nresponsible and that, where there are custody situations in a split \nhousehold, divorce or otherwise, the obligations to pay child support \nget enforced across the land. The President speaks of it, everyone \nspeaks of it, in more or less the notion of the need for parental \nresponsibility and the fact that responsible parents alleviate some of \nthe Government's expenditures if they were paying their legally \nobligated payments to their children.\n  And so today I want to discuss briefly where we are with reference to \nthat and what we ought to do.\n  Let me talk now about the bill itself.\n  Over the past few months, we in Congress have spoken a great deal \nabout the need to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. Although we \nmay disagree on exactly how we should get there, the debate on this \nmatter has demonstrated at least one matter on which we all agree. This \ncentral point of agreement is about the future, and what \nresponsibilities and burdens we will be handing to generations yet to \ncome. Concern for the future of our children and grandchildren must be \nthe defining issue. I believe this our foremost responsibility, and I \nknow there are many women and men in this body who share this \ncommitment.\n  The need to provide for the future of our children and, indeed, the \nNation, however, does not hinge solely on fiscal policy. The \nresponsibilities we hold for the children of America span all aspects \nof life and incorporate many elements of the law. Children hold a \nspecial status under the law. We recognize that without a responsible \nparent or guardian, children are at the mercy of society. In the \nabsence of measures to protect them, they are our most vulnerable and \nneedy citizens. In such a case, the law becomes their primary protector \nand provider, and often their last source of relief in many instances \nin this country. I am addressing these issues today because I rise to \nintroduce a bill that seeks to further support children in this \ncountry, and which will assist in protecting them when their best \ninterests are not being served.\n\n\n                  The Child Custody Reform Act of 1995\n\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act--the \nPKPA. This bill sought to end the common situation where feuding \nparents, whether divorced, separated, estranged, or otherwise, used \ntheir children as pawns in their personal vendettas against each other. \nOften, this would take the form of one parent kidnapping the child and \nmoving to another State. Once in the other State, the parent could \npetition that State court in order to obtain a new custody ruling. In \nthe event that a different ruling was handed down, the legal battles \nbegan, with the child being used as leverage in a vicious parental \nbattle that often played out over many years. The children thrown into \nthe middle of these situations obviously suffered, some think they \nsuffered irreparable harm, and congress had to step in to bring this \npractice to a halt. The PKPA did much to alleviate this situation, and \nsolidified the statutes that protect children involved in custody \ndisputes. Several years of this law in actual practice, however, have \ndemonstrated that some gaps exist in this legislation, and there remain \na few loopholes through which this situation can continue.\n  So today I rise to introduce the Child Custody Reform Act of 1995. We \nhave worked diligently on this with various entities in our country and \nwith the American Bar Association because we have one of these typical \nsituations in the law that is spoken of when you go to law school as \nconflicts of interest, or conflict law. So this bill is going to put a \ncap on some of these inconsistencies and to further help resolve a \ntroubling situation that continues to this day.\n  The Child Custody Reform Act that I am introducing amends the PKPA in \ntwo ways: First, this act would clarify the language of the PKPA so \nthat future jurisdictional disputes are eliminated altogether. And \nsecond, this act would establish a national child custody registry so \nthat the courts and officers of the court would have quick and accurate \naccess to information regarding the status of any child in the Nation \nfor whom a custody decree has been issued.\n  It would not pry into anyone's life. It would just take a matter of \ncourt record and produce that in a manner that would be available \ninterstate, so that in a legal battle in State X with two children \ninvolved, the court can immediately find out whether those two children \nare already involved in a legal situation in another State.\n  So, what we are going to do in this law is as follows.\n  Current PKPA provisions still allow a second State to issue a \nseparate and oftentimes conflicting child custody ruling. This flaw \nallows a second State to modify a custody ruling made by a first State \nby determining on its own that the first State no longer had \njurisdiction under its own law.\n  That is kind of legal jargon, but essentially if there is a valid \ndecree affecting children in State A and one of the parents moves to \nState B, State B has found a way to avoid State A's decree which was \nmade and is valid by finding that the first court did not have \njurisdiction, and so they would take it all over in the second court.\n  [[Page S4718]] We have worked long and hard with experts in the bar \nassociation on the law of conflicts and the law of custody.\n  This flaw allows the second State to modify the ruling where only one \nof the parents or one of the contending parties is present.\n  So under these proposed changes, the court of the second State would \nnot be allowed to issue a ruling modifying the initial custody decree \nas long as one of the contestants still remained in the State that \nissued the original ruling.\n  This will say, as a matter of law nationally, the second State \nattempting to change the ruling in a State that already ruled, that \nthat court has no jurisdiction as a matter of law in America, and the \ncase must be returned to the first State. That means that a contestant \nwill enter a motion in court setting this statute up as a defense and \nthe judge will have clearly before him or her a national statute that \nsays they must defer this back to the State of original jurisdiction.\n  If the original issuing State declines to exercise continuing \njurisdiction, the second State would then be free to modify the ruling \nas it sees fit. This, I believe and many in the legal profession \nbelieve, will go a long way to stop jurisdictional disputes between \nStates and their courts over contesting parties where there is a child \nor children in the middle of this battle from ever occurring.\n  We are, obviously, open to better language. We are, obviously, open \nto the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate with its good legal \ncounsel and Members of the Senate who have worked on this issue long \nand hard, to see if they can do better by language than we have, but we \nthink this will go a long way.\n  Currently, States are required to keep a listing of existing child \ncustody decrees. I repeat, that is not new. What exists right now is \nthat States are required to keep a listing. No way of exchanging this \nbetween States is currently in the law of the land or being \naccomplished by any kind of standardization.\n  So what we decided to do in this bill--myself and cosponsors and I am \nsure there will be others--we have decided that we should encourage the \nestablishment of a national registry in conjunction with the already \nexisting Federal parent locater service where information on these \nchildren or their legal status could be entered. Thus, it would be \navailable between States, and States would not get hoodwinked where a \nparent could take the children to another State, leave one parent \nbehind, and want to start anew, ignoring what has already happened.\n  Obviously, the second court would know that those children were the \nsubject of a custody decree in another State, and unless the original \nState declines to exercise jurisdiction, that would be returned to the \noriginal State that entered the decree, thus, not permitting parents to \nuse their children as pawns and decide they will move to another State \nto change custody or change the obligation to pay child support.\n  So when a proceeding is commenced anywhere in the country, an officer \nof the court could immediately check with the registry of each State, \nwhich would be available to them, to see if a standing custody order \ncurrently exists or if a custody proceeding is currently pending in \nanother court.\n  In the event that another ruling on the same child or children \nexists, the second court, in compliance with the PKPA, would \nimmediately know not to proceed any further. If the adult guardian or \nparent still wished to move for a modification of the decree, they \nwould have to petition the State in which the original custody decree \nwas issued.\n  Thus, we can see that the registry would help immensely in \neliminating jurisdictional fights that occur these days that are not in \nthe interest of the children of the adult contestants.\n\n\n    Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution for Supervised Visitation Centers\n\n  In addition to the changes in the PKPA, this bill would express the \nsense of the Senate that local governments should take full advantage \nof the funds allocated in last year's crime bill, under the provisions \nfor local crime prevention block grants, to establish supervised \nvisitation centers for children involved in custody disputes. These \ncenters would be used for the visitation of children when one or both \nof the parents are believed to put the children at risk of physical, \nemotional, or sexual abuse.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I believe this bill is a valuable and needed step to ensure that the \nchildren of America are looked after in a responsible and caring \nmanner. It is unfortunate that we need to pass laws of this nature. One \nwould think that good sense and responsible adult behavior would \nresolve this problem on its own. This presently is not the case, \nhowever. As a result, the law must step in and serve the public \ninterest, and the best interests of children enduring these hardships. \nI am greatly encouraged that my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, \nBingaman, Biden, and Wellstone have joined me in support of this bill, \nand I look forward to further consideration by the entire Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Custody Reform Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) parents who do not find a child custody ruling to their \n     liking in one State will often start a custody proceeding in \n     another State in the hope of obtaining a more favorable \n     ruling;\n       (2) although Federal and State child custody jurisdictional \n     laws were established to prevent this situation, gaps still \n     exist that allow for confusion and differing interpretations \n     by various State courts, and which lead to separate and \n     inconsistent custody rulings between States;\n       (3) in the event that a different ruling is handed down in \n     the second State's court, the problem then arises of which \n     court has jurisdiction, and which ruling should be granted \n     full faith and credit under the Parental Kidnapping \n     Prevention Act of 1980;\n       (4) changes in the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of \n     1980 must be made that will provide a remedy for cases where \n     conflicting State rulings exist--\n       (A) to prevent different rulings from occurring in the \n     first instance by clarifying provisions with regard to \n     continuing State jurisdiction to modify a child custody \n     order; and\n       (B) to assist the courts in this task by establishing a \n     centralized, nationwide child custody database; and\n       (5) in the absence of such changes, parents will continue \n     to engage in the destructive practice of moving children \n     across State borders to escape a previous custody ruling or \n     arrangement, and will continue to use their helpless children \n     as pawns in their efforts at personal retribution.\n\n     SEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR COURT JURISDICTION.\n\n       Section 1738A of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:\n       ``(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the jurisdiction of a \n     court of a State that has made a child custody determination \n     in accordance with this section continues as long as such \n     State remains the residence of the child or of any \n     contestant.\n       ``(2) Continuing jurisdiction under paragraph (1) shall be \n     subject to any applicable provision of law of the State that \n     issued the initial custody determination in accordance with \n     this section, when such State law establishes limitations on \n     continuing jurisdiction when a child is absent from such \n     State.'';\n       (2) in subsection (f)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as paragraphs \n     (2) and (1), respectively; and\n       (B) in paragraph (1), as so redesignated, by inserting \n     ``pursuant to subsection (d),'' after ``the court of the \n     other State no longer has jurisdiction,''; and\n       (3) in subsection (g), by inserting ``or continuing \n     jurisdiction'' after ``exercising jurisdiction''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CHILD CUSTODY REGISTRY.\n\n       Section 453 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 653) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g)(1) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with \n     the Attorney General, shall expand the Federal Parent Locator \n     Service established under this section, to establish a \n     national network to allow State courts to identify every \n     proceeding relating to child custody jurisdiction filed \n     before any court of the United States or of any State. \n     Information identifying custody determinations from other \n     countries will also be accepted for filing in the registry.\n       ``(2) As used in this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `information' includes--\n       ``(i) the court or jurisdiction where a custody \n     determination is filed;\n     [[Page S4719]]   ``(ii) the name of the presiding officer of \n     the issuing court;\n       ``(iii) the names and social security numbers of the \n     parties;\n       ``(iv) the name, date of birth, and social security numbers \n     of each child; and\n       ``(v) the status of the case;\n       ``(B) the term `custody determination' has the same meaning \n     given such term in section 1738A of title 28, United States \n     Code;\n       ``(C) the term `custody proceeding'--\n       ``(i) means a proceeding in which a custody determination \n     is one of several issues, such as a proceeding for divorce or \n     separation, as well as neglect, abuse, dependency, wardship, \n     guardianship, termination of parental rights, adoption, \n     protection from domestic violence, and Hague Child Abduction \n     Convention proceedings; and\n       ``(ii) does not include a judgment, decree, or other order \n     of a court regarding paternity or relating to child support \n     or any other monetary obligation of any person, or a decision \n     made in a juvenile delinquency, status offender, or \n     emancipation proceeding.\n       ``(3) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n     cooperation with Attorney General, shall promulgate \n     regulations to implement this section.\n       ``(4) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     are necessary to carry out this subsection.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING SUPERVISED VISITATION \n                   CENTERS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that local governments should \n     take full advantage of the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant \n     Program established under subtitle B of title III of the \n     Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, to \n     establish supervised visitation centers for children who have \n     been removed from their parents and placed outside the home \n     as a result of abuse or neglect or other risk of harm to \n     them, and for children whose parents are separated or \n     divorced and the children are at risk because of physical or \n     mental abuse or domestic violence.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no greater legacy we leave on this \nEarth than our children. Keeping our children safe and helping them \ngrow into productive adults is our greatest challenge and \nresponsibility--as individuals and as a society.\n  For the most part, parents assume this responsibility willingly. But \nwith more than 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce, some of our \nchildren face special risks.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that many divorced parents are sensitive to \ntheir children's needs and act in their best interests, in some cases, \ncustody battles become prolonged wars. When this occurs, children can \nsuffer severe emotional damage.\n  More seriously, when conflict escalates, it can place children at \nrisk physically through parental kidnapping; in 1988 alone, an \nestimated 354,000 children were abducted by parents or family members \nnationwide.\n  In extreme cases, disputes between parents can even become fatal \nconflicts. Consider two recent chilling events in my State of Delaware:\n  In one incident, the father picked up his three children in Delaware \nfor a visit, but then drove them to North Carolina--where he shot them \nin the head, set the van they were in on fire, and then killed himself \nin a nearby field.\n  In a second case, a father killed his two young children as they \nslept, then turned the gun on himself.\n  The result of these incidents, which occurred in the space of 2 weeks \ntime--five children dead, all innocent victims of divorce and custody \ndisputes. Of course, these are extreme cases, but they illustrate what \ncan happen when custody disputes escalate.\n  That is why over the years, we have worked to ensure that the justice \nsystem works as smoothly and effectively as possible at handling \ncustody matters, and in particular at making sure that interstate \nconflicts in custody orders are resolved quickly and appropriately.\n  Between 1969 and 1983, all 50 States adopted the Uniform Child \nCustody Jurisdiction Act, reducing the incentive for parents to abduct \ntheir children to another State in an attempt to obtain a favorable \ncustody order.\n  The act spelled out when a State has jurisdiction to issue a custody \norder and when it has to enforce the order of another State.\n  We also addressed a second problem, because States had different \nviews of when custody orders--which are subject to modification--were \nadequately final so as to trigger the full faith and credit \nrequirements of the Constitution.\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act to \nimpose a Federal duty on the States to enforce and not modify the \ncustody orders of sister States that issued orders consistent with the \nact.\n  This act gives priority to States with home State jurisdiction over \nStates that have what is called significant connections jurisdiction.\n  It also provides that the State that issued the first custody order \nhas continuing jurisdiction as long as the child or any contestant \nresides in that State.\n  Unfortunately, over the years, cracks have surfaced in the \napplication of this law, and contrary to congressional intent, many \nState courts have continued to modify the custody orders of States that \nretain continuing jurisdiction.\n  Take for example a case in which a married couple obtained a divorce \nin Michigan in 1988. Custody of their child was awarded to the mother, \nwith visitation rights to the father. The decree specifically set-out \nthat Michigan would maintain jurisdiction over the parents and the \nchild.\n  But 6 months later, the mother, who had moved with the child to \nIllinois,\n petitioned an Illinois court to modify the father's visitation rights \nunder the Michigan order. The Illinois trial court denied her motion, \nruling that it had no jurisdiction.\n\n  Yet the Illinois Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case, \nholding in part that Illinois could ``* * * modify a foreign custody \njudgment even if the other State has jurisdiction so long as the \nIllinois court has jurisdiction * * *''\n  The Child Custody Reform Act of 1995 that we introduce today makes it \nclear that in the case I just described, Illinois could not modify the \nMichigan court's grant of visitation rights because the father \ncontinued to reside in Michigan--and thus, Michigan maintained \ncontinuing jurisdiction to protect his interests.\n  The Child Custody Reform Act of 1995 will help prevent conflicting \ncustody orders and jurisdictional deadlock. I would like to commend \nSenator Domenici for his leadership on this issue.\n  The act clarifies that a sister State may not enter a new custody \norder nor may it modify an existing custody order, as long as the \noriginal court acted pursuant to the Parental Kidnapping Prevention \nAct.\n  It also clarifies that continuing jurisdiction exists as long as the \nchild or one of the contestants continues to reside in the State.\n  There are two exceptions to this rule:\n  If the State that issued the initial custody order declines to \nexercise jurisdiction to modify such determination; or\n  If the laws of the State that issued the initial custody order \notherwise limit continuing jurisdiction when a child is absent from \nsuch a State.\n  Thus, the act we proposed today does not tread on a State's ability \nto formulate child custody policy. Instead, it merely provides a \nFederal obligation to give full faith and credit to the custody orders \nof sister States.\n  The importance of this legislation is that it sets a clear line to \nguide State decisions by requiring that a State cannot modify and must \nenforce a custody order issued by a sister State that retains \njurisdiction under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act.\n  A second problem the legislation that we are introducing addresses is \nthat judges do not now have a reliable, efficient way to know that a \njudge in another State may have already issued a custody order relating \nto a particular child.\n  In our age of advanced computer capabilities, we have the technology \nat our fingertips. So, let's put cyberspace to good use for our \nchildren. And we don't need to reinvent the wheel here--we can build on \nwhat we know works.\n  The Federal Parent Locator Service, which has operated effectively \nand efficiently under the Social Security Administration for the last \ndecade, already works to enforce State child support obligations. This \nlegislation will expand this service to establish a child custody \nregistry.\n  We must give judges in different States the ability to communicate \nabout custody cases, and computers are the tools to do that. State \ncourts already are automated.\n  With modest additional effort, we can link this information and put \nit to work for our children to prevent interstate custody battles.\n  Finally, this legislation encourages local governments to take \nadvantage of \n[[Page S4720]]  visitation centers funded under the 1994 crime law. We \ncan never be 100 percent certain when, how, and even if children will \nreturn safely from visits with noncustodial parents.\n  But visitation centers can provide a safe haven where parents can \ntransfer their children for visitation, or leave their children for \ncourt-ordered, supervised visits.\n  Such centers, which Senator Wellstone advocated successfully last \nyear, should be established in communities in existing facilities, such \nas schools, neighborhood centers, in public housing complexes, and \nother convenient locations.\n  So, by clarifying and strengthening the Parental Kidnapping \nPrevention Act, by putting critical child custody information at the \nfingertips of judges, and by providing State and local governments with \nthe funding to open visitation centers, Mr. President, we can go a long \nway toward protecting our children from being caught in the middle of \npainful, sometimes violent custody battles.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague, \nsomeone whom I consider to be a good friend and someone I admire as a \nlegislator and a Senator. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 633. A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide \ncertain consumer protections if a depository institution engages in the \nsale of nondeposit investment products, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n      the bank customer confidentiality and protection act of 1995\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Bank Customer \nConfidentiality and Protection Act of 1995. This legislation has been \ncrafted to address problems in the area of bank sales of uninsured \nproducts, such as mutual funds, identified during a continuing \ninvestigation conducted by my staff on the U.S. Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging.\n  After hearing the stories of numerous older Americans who claim they \ndid not know what they were buying when they purchased an uninsured \nproduct through their bank and then lost much of their life savings, I \nam convinced that more stringent protections are needed to ensure that \nfinancially inexperienced bank customers fully understand what they are \nbuying when they invest in uninsured products.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is intended to help those who really \nneed its protections, such as the 72-year-old widow in Florida who had \nalways put her savings into FDIC-insured certificates of deposit until \nshe was contacted by telephone by an employee of her bank offering a \nproduct with a higher rate of return. This woman then went into her \nbank, listened to the advice of a man whom she thought was a banker, \nand then transferred all her savings into an uninsured government bond \nfund. Even though she did not exactly understand the risks associated \nwith the product, she trusted the bank to do her right.\n  Two years later, the value of the fund declined and she lost about a \nquarter of her life savings, savings that she had intended to use in \nthe years ahead to avoid being a burden to her children. It is this \nsort of tragedy, Mr. President, that this legislation is intended to \nprevent.\n  Mr. President, under our present banking system financially \ninexperienced customers have reason to be concerned about the safety of \ntheir deposits. During our investigation, my Senate Aging Committee \nstaff found that some banks were, for example, routinely:\n  Sharing detailed customer financial information with people selling \nsecurities, without customers' explicit knowledge;\n  Avoiding full and clear disclosure about the risks associated with \nuninsured products;\n  Discouraging bank customers from investing in certificates of deposit \n[CD's], savings accounts, and other similar FDIC-insured investments;\n  Establishing commission structures that provide incentives for \nsecurities salespeople to offer the bank's in-house investment \nproducts, regardless of the products' suitability for a particular \ncustomer; and\n  Operating in a manner that leads some customers to not fully \nunderstand the relationship between the securities salesperson and the \ndepository institution.\n  I and a number of my colleagues consider these to be questionable \nmarketing practices and find them especially troubling because of the \nspecial place banks have in our communities.\n  Mr. President, many older bank customers hold their bank and the \npeople who work there in high regard and feel comfortable about taking \nadvice from them about where to put their money.\n  In addition, when some customers see the FDIC emblem--something \nanalogous to the Good Housekeeping seal of approval for many--they may \nbelieve that the FDIC coverage applies to all products offered in the \ninstitution. As customers who have seen their principals drop have \nrealized, this is not the case.\n  While all bank customers need to exercise caution, older customers \nneed to be particularly vigilant when it comes to uninsured investments \nsuch as mutual funds, principally because the savings of the elderly do \nnot represent a renewable resource and the loss of such savings cannot \nbe written off as lessons learned for the future.\n  Mr. President, to explore the impact on older Americans further, in \nSeptember 1994 I chaired a U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging \nhearing entitled ``Uninsured Bank\n Products: Risky Business for Seniors?'' At this hearing, we had older \nbank customers, former bank-based brokers, and industry experts come \nand discuss how some banks' brokerage businesses are selling \ninappropriate products to older customers.\n\n  It is clear that something must be done about these questionable \npractices. While I would prefer to avoid legislation, it appears that \nthere may be no other option. Although some banks recently have taken \nsteps to clean up their practices, many are continuing business as \nusual. In addition, the banking regulators' joint guidelines and the \nindustry's voluntary guidelines, while well-intended, do not appear to \nhave been totally effective in addressing marketing abuses.\n  Mr. President, let me address one part of these guidelines, the \nprovision that banks have their customers sign ``disclosure'' documents \nbefore they make a purchase. One concern I have is that the format of \nthese disclosure forms vary from bank to bank. Some banks or their \ninvestment subsidiaries do a fine job putting in plain English required \ndisclosure information, such as the fact that uninsured investment \nproducts are not backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \nOther banks, however, present the information in such a way that you \nwould have to be an attorney or an experienced investor and have great \neyesight in order to understand what they mean.\n  Then there is the even more problematic issue of oral disclosure--\nwhat bank customers are told. More than a few financially inexperienced \nbank customers have told me that when they looked over the disclosure \nforms they did not understand what they meant. These customers \ntypically would then ask the investment salespeople to interpret the \nforms for them. In these cases, the salespeople told their customers \nthat the documents were just a formality to open the account or that \nthe forms simply restated what the salespeople had told the customers. \nThe problem is that in some cases the salespeople had made misleading \nor false statements about the nature of the uninsured products when \nthey described them, such as that they were ``as safe as the money in \nyour pocket and will only lose money if the Federal Government goes \nbankrupt'' or ``backed by something better than the FDIC.''\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing, which has been \ncrafted after numerous meetings with industry and consumer groups, \nwould provide needed consumer protections for financially inexperienced \ncustomers.\n  The legislation would provide protections by:\n  Requiring full and clear disclosure about the risks associated with \nuninsured products;\n  [[Page S4721]] Limiting the compensation that institution employees \nreceive for making referrals to securities salespeople;\n  Establishing guidelines for uninsured products' promotional \nmaterials;\n  Requiring common-sense physical separation of deposit and nondeposit \nsales products;\n  Prohibiting the sharing of bank customers' personal financial \ninformation without customers' explicit consent; and\n  Improving the coordination of enforcement-related activities between \nthe Federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission.\n  These protections will be especially important if the remaining legal \nbarriers that currently restrict banks' involvement in the securities \nand insurance industries are broken down, as called for by Treasury \nSecretary Robert E. Rubin and several congressional proposals. These \nchanges to our banking system that Secretary Rubin and others are \nadvocating are not necessarily bad ones, and I will consider them with \nan open mind if they come to the floor of the Senate.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a financial incentive for States to reduce expenditures under \nthe Medicaid Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            the state medicaid savings incentive act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the State Medicaid \nSavings Incentive Act of 1995. This bill will reward States that act \ndecisively to contain Medicaid spending by allowing such States to keep \n20 percent of the resulting savings to the Federal Government.\n  This legislation is based on an idea put forward by New York's \nGovernor, George Pataki, when he testified recently before the House \nWays and Means Committee. New York is one of several States moving to \ntrim the cost of their Medicaid programs through greater use of managed \ncare. As a result of New York's efforts, the Federal Government stands \nto save nearly $2 billion. Governor Pataki is right in suggesting that \nif States like New York can save the Federal Government money through \ncost-saving initiatives such as Medicaid managed care, then the States \nshould be allowed to share in that savings as a reward. This creates a \nstrong incentive for States to put in place programs that can both \nimprove the care of Medicaid beneficiaries and lower the bill for \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Federal Medicaid spending will cost American taxpayers an estimated \n$90 billion in 1995. Over the past 5 years it has grown at a rate of \nover 18 percent a year. And since 1984 it has grown from 18 percent of \nall Federal health spending to over 28 percent in 1993.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's current estimates are that the cost \nof Medicaid will nearly double by the year 2000. That should serve as a \nwake up call to all of us.\n  With Medicaid representing the largest portion of many State budgets, \nour Nation's Governors are increasingly beginning to employ strategies \nsuch as increased use of managed care in an effort to keep rising \nMedicaid costs in check. Forty-four States already use \n[[Page S4723]]  managed care plans to serve some portion of their \nMedicaid population. According to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, about 23 percent of the nearly 34 million people enrolled in \nMedicaid now receive their medical care through managed care delivery \nsystems--up from 14 percent in 1993.\n  These efforts not only hold the potential to lower costs, they also \nprovide an opportunity to improve the quality of care for many Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. This is a point on which there is bipartisan agreement. \nIt is a view shared by HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck, who has said \nthat managed care programs can, in his view, meet the needs of Medicaid \nrecipients especially well, particularly because they emphasize \npreventive and primary care. That means better health care for Medicaid \nrecipients, and a reduction in the inappropriate use of hospital \nemergency rooms as a source of primary care services.\n  We need to do more to encourage States to make their Medicaid \nprograms more efficient. That is what our bill would do.\n  Our proposal would give States a strong incentive to restrain their \nMedicaid spending by allowing them to keep a share of any Federal \nsavings that are achieved as a result. Under our bill, the Secretary of \nHHS would establish a spending baseline for each State. States that are \nsuccessful in holding Medicaid below the baseline would receive a \npayment equal to 20 percent of the resulting savings to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  No State would be penalized for spending above the baseline, but \nthose that spend below the baseline would be rewarded. And rewarding \nStates that save the Federal Government money makes sense.\n  Containing the growth of Medicaid can only be accomplished with the \nhelp and cooperation of our Nation's Governors. This bill sends the \nmessage that the Federal Government stands ready to work in partnership \nwith those States that have the determination to do what must be done \nto bring Medicaid costs under control.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of the majority leader; I \nbelieve it deserves the strong support of each of my colleagues, and \nshould be enacted without delay to encourage our Nation's Governors to \ncarry out the important and difficult work of reforming Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide \nuniformity in the criteria and procedures for retiring general and flag \nofficers of the Armed Forces of the United States in the highest grade \nin which served, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                    military retirement legislation\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill that we are introducing today \nwill streamline the process for retirement of military officers who \nhold 3- or 4-star rank.\n  Under present law, the highest permanent rank that an officer may \nhold is that of two stars. All active duty appointments to 3- and 4-\nstar rank are temporary appointments made by the President of the \nUnited States and must be approved by the Senate.\n  The President must also nominate every 3- and 4-star office for \nretirement in his highest grade, and the Senate must approve of that \npromotion again, or, under the law, the officer retires with two-star \nrank.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware of the historical precedents for the \ncurrent law, but I feel that it is time that we conformed retirements \nfor officers in the highest flag and general officer grades to those \nfor general and flag officers in one and two star grades.\n  The bill we are introducing today will accomplish that. Once officers \nin 3- and 4-star grades have served 3 years in grade, they will be \nallowed to retire in grade without further action by the Senate. This \nwill reduce the administrative work load of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Department of Defense.\n  Our proposed bill will not, however, curtail Senate prerogative over \nthe confirmation of senior military officers for active duty \nassignments. The President will still be required to nominate each 3- \nand 4-star officer for any new assignments. The Senate will have to \nreview those nominations and approve each and every assignment while on \nactive duty. We simply seek to expedite the ability of the Department \nof Defense to retire officers in grade who have completed a statutorily \nimposed period of honorable service and bring more equity into the \nsystem. In no other area of life does a person retire at a lower level \nthan his or her highest rank.\n  The president of a business does not retire at vice president unless \nrepromoted by the board.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hutchison \nin introducing legislation to establish equity in military retirement \nprocedures. This legislation will provide that the retirement of 3- and \n4-star officers will be considered under the same standards and \nprocedures as other general and flag officers at the 1- and 2-star \nlevel. It will also ensure that 3- and 4-star officers facing \nretirement are not subjected to confirmation procedures that do not \napply to their civilian superiors or other civilian government \nofficials. In other words, this legislaion would apply the same \nprocedures to 3- and 4-star officer retirements that apply to other \nmilitary and civilian officials seeking retirement.\n  By way of background, promotions to 3- and 4-star positions are \ntreated as temporary, rather than permanent promotions. This means that \nthe individual holds the 3- or 4-star grade only while serving in the \n3- or 4-star position. The member also may hold the grade for brief \ntransitional periods to cover transfers between assignments, \nhospitalization, and before retirement.\n  Because these grades are temporary, an individual who is in a 3- or \n4-star grade retains his or her permanent grade, which is typically a \n2-star grade. This means that if the individual is not nominated, \nconfirmed, or appointed to another 3- or 4-star position, the \nindividual will revert to his or her permanent--for example, 2-star \ngrade.\n  Under current law, these considerations apply to retirements as well \nas promotions. As a result, if a 3- or 4-star officer who retires is \nnot nominated, confirmed, or appointed to retire in a permanent 3- or \n4-star grade, the individual will revert to his or her permanent--for \nexample, 2-star grade upon retirement--with the attendant loss of \nretired pay and status.\n  This situation applies uniquely to 3- and 4-star officers. Other flag \nand general officers, as well as other commissioned officers, retire in \nthe highest grade held, subject to minimum time-in-grade requirements, \nwithout a requirement for nomination, Senate confirmation, and \nappointment to a retired grade.\n  Similarly, civilian officials who retire from the civil service are \nnot required to face Senate confirmation, no matter how high their \ngrade. Thus, a cabinet or subcabinent official, as well as career civil \nservice officials, who qualify for civil service retirement will \nreceive their full retired pay--based on years of service and high-3 \nyears rate of pay--without action by the President or the Senate.\n  The effect is that 3- and 4-star officers are the only Government \nofficials who are subject to losing retired pay and status as a result \nof a requirement that they be confirmed in a retired grade. Neither \ntheir civilian superiors nor any other Government officials can have \ntheir retired pay and status reduced through the confirmation process.\n  The proposal we are introducing today would end the requirement for \nretiring 3- and 4-star officers to be nominated, confirmed, and \nappointed in a permanent 3- and 4-star grade. The result would be that \n3- and 4-star officers would retire under the same conditions as other \nofficers--for example, 2-star officers. That is, they will retire in \nthe highest grade they held, subject to minimum time in grade \nrequirements.\n  The proposal would not change the current requirement for nomination \nand Senate confirmation of all 3- and 4-star active duty promotions, \nassignments, and reassignments.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] for preparing this proposal. I believe the concept warrants \nfavorable consideration, but the details should receive careful review \nand study. The Committee on Armed Service will obtain the views of the \nDepartment of Defense, and the proposal will be considered by the \nPersonnel Subcommittee. I look forward to working on this issue with \nChairman Thurmond, and with Senator Coats, the chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee, and Senator Byrd, the ranking minority member \nof the subcommittee.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Pressler):\n  S. 636. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new \nterm permits for grazing on National Forest System lands to replace \npreviously issued term grazing permits that have expired, soon will \nexpire, or are waived to the Secretary, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      grazing permits legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as part of its management of the national \ngrasslands, the U.S. Forest Service issues permits to ranchers so that \nthey might graze livestock on those lands. Through these permits, the \nForest Service ensures that ranchers who utilize these public lands \nobey basic stewardship requirements and other important standards. \nTypically, permits are issued for 10 years and therefore must be \nreviewed and reissued at the end of that period.\n  In many cases, the ability of ranchers to graze on national \ngrasslands means the difference between success and failure of their \noperations. Understandably, they are concerned, therefore, about \nreports that the Forest Service is facing shortfalls in funding needed \nto perform the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] analysis \nrequired to reissue grazing permits. Through no fault of their own, \nthese ranchers may face the loss of their grazing privileges simply \nbecause the Federal bureaucracy is unable to fulfill its statutory \nresponsibilities in a timely fashion.\n  As the Forest Service looks for funds to perform the required \nanalysis, the resulting uncertainty leaves South Dakota ranchers, and \nindeed ranchers throughout the Nation, in an untenable economic \nsituation. Moreover, this unfortunate predicament is compounded by the \npossibility that the Forest Service may divert funding allocated to \nother important activities, such as the timber program, research or \nrecreation, for the permit renewal process. This prospect is akin to \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. At a time when there are insufficient \nresources to carry out basic management activities; diverting funds to \nperform the NEPA work on grazing allotments in a rushed manner could \nseriously jeopardize other priority programs.\n  In light of these concerns, I have drafted legislation to require the \nForest Service to issue new permits for grazing on National Forest \nSystem lands where existing grazing permits have expired or will \nexpire. This bill would assure ranchers that they could continue to \ngraze livestock, even if the Forest Service is unable to complete the \nnecessary NEPA analysis this year. Moreover, it would relieve pressure \non the Forest Service to take funds away from other important \nactivities such as timber sale preparation in the rush to complete this \nNEPA work.\n  My legislation would require the Forest Service to reissue permits to \nranchers who are in compliance with the terms of their permits even if \nthe NEPA work has not been completed. The terms of the new permits \nwould be 3 years or until the necessary NEPA work is completed, \nwhichever is sooner. It would not cover ranchers whose permits have \nbeen revoked for violations of the rules or new applications. These, I \nbelieve, are fair and reasonable conditions.\n  It is not my intention to overturn the requirements of NEPA. I \nbelieve that NEPA assessments provide valuable insight into the effects \nof range management, insights that in turn can be used to strengthen \nthe entire grazing program. But it has become clear that in this time \nof funding constraints, some permits may not be reissued on time for \nprocedural rather than substantive reasons. That is not acceptable.\n  Penalizing ranchers for a failure of the Federal Government to \nperform the necessary NEPA analysis is neither fair nor defensible. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort to \nensure the unbroken use of the range by ranchers who have complied with \nthe terms of their permits and thus deserve to have them renewed. I ask \nunanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\n                                 S. 636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre \n     National Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with \n     Federal law;\n       (2) where suitable, 1 of the recognized multiple uses for \n     National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n       (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n     of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n     years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n     proper administration of National Forest System land and \n     resources;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits \n     authorizing grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of \n     National Forest System land;\n       (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n     by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n     expire by the end of 1996;\n       (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n     complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n     remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n     to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n     the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains \n     an appropriate use of the affected National Forest System \n     land;\n       (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n     permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n     as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n     to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit \n     holder's permitted livestock or base property by the end of \n     1996;\n       (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n       (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n     expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n     Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in \n     compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     and other applicable laws (including regulations) in a timely \n     and efficient manner and enable the Secretary to issue new \n     term grazing permits, where appropriate;\n       (10) for a small percentage of the grazing permits that \n     will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n     the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n     term grazing permits; and\n       (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n     of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n     essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a \n     timely manner for financial and other reasons.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that \n     grazing continues without interruption on National Forest \n     System land in a manner that provides long-term protection of \n     the environment and improvement of National Forest System \n     rangeland resources while also providing short-term certainty \n     to holders of expiring term grazing permits and purchasers of \n     a permit holder's permitted livestock or base property.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to remove barriers to interracial and interethnic \nadoptions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the adoption antidiscrimination act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nAdoption Antidiscrimination Act of 1995, a bill that will prevent \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in the \nplacement of children with adoptive families.\n  There are few situations in this world more tragic than a child \nwithout a family. Such children do not have the basic security of \nparents and a permanent home environment that most of us take for \ngranted, and that is so important to social development. Consequently, \nthere is little that a society could do that is more cruel to a child \nthan to deny or delay his or her adoption by a loving family, \nparticularly if the reason for the denial or delay is that the child \nand family are of different races. Yet, this is precisely what our \npublic policy does.\n  In the late 1960's and early 1970's, over 10,000 children were \nadopted by families of a different race. This was before many adoption \nofficials decided, without any empirical evidence, that it is essential \nfor children to be matched with families of the same race, even if they \nhave to wait for long periods for such a family to come along. The \nforces of political correctness declared interracial adoptions the \nequivalent of cultural genocide. This was, and continues to be, \nnonsense.\n  Sound social science research has found that interracial adoptions do \nnot hurt the children or deprive them of their culture. According to \nDr. Howard Alstein, who has studied 204 interracial adoptions since \n1972, ``We categorically have not found that white parents cannot \nprepare black kids culturally.'' He further concluded that ``there are \nbumps along the way, but the transracial adoptees in our study are not \nangry, racially confused people'' and that ``They're happy and content \nadults.''\n  [[Page S4726]] Since the mid-1970's, there have been very few \ninterracial adoptions. For example, African-American children who \nconstitute about 14 percent of the child population currently comprise \nover 40 percent of the 100,000 children waiting in foster care. This is \ndespite 20 years of Federal efforts to recruit African-American \nadoptive families and substantial efforts by the African-American \ncommunity. As stated by Harvard Law Prof. Randall Kennedy concerning \nthe situation in Massachusetts, ``Even if you do a super job of \nrecruiting, in a State where only 5 percent of the population is black \nand nearly half the kids in need of homes are black, you are going to \nhave a problem.''\n  The bottom line is that African-American children wait twice as long \nas other children to be adopted. Our discriminatory adoption policies \ndiscouraging interracial adoptions are hurting these children, and this \nis entirely unacceptable.\n  Last year, Senator Metzenbaum attempted to remedy this problem by \nintroducing the Multi-Cultural Placement Act of 1994. That bill was \nconceived and introduced with the best of intentions. Its stated \npurpose was to promote the best interests of children by decreasing the \ntime that they wait to be adopted, preventing discrimination in their \nplacement on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and \nfacilitating the identification and recruitment of foster and adoptive \nfamilies that can meet children's needs.\n  Unfortunately, the Metzenbaum bill was weakened throughout the \nlegislative process and eviscerated by the Clinton administration \nDepartment and HHS in conference. After the original bill was hijacked, \na letter was sent from over 50 of the most prominent law professors in \nthe country, including Randall Kennedy, imploring Congress to reject \nthe bill. They warned that it ``would give congressional backing to \npractices that have the effect of condemning large numbers of \nchildren--particularly children of color--to unnecessarily long stays \nin institutions or foster care.'' Their admonition was not heeded, and \nthe bill was passed as part of the Goals 200 legislation last year.\n  As Senator Metzenbaum concluded, ``HHS intervened and did the bill \ngreat harm.'' The legislation that was finally signed by the President \ndoes precisely the opposite of what was originally intended. It allows \nrace to continue to be used as a major consideration and effectively \nreinforces the current practice of racial matching. Consequently, \nadoption agencies receiving Federal funds continue to discourage \ninterracial adoptions, increasing the time children must wait to be \nadopted and permitting discrimination in the adoption process. I am \ninformed that 43 States have laws that in some way keep children in \nfoster care due to race.\n  The bill that I am introducing today repeals the Metzenbaum law and \nreplaces it with a clear unambiguous requirement that adoption agencies \nwhich receive Federal funds may not discriminate on the basis of race, \ncolor, or national origin. By far the most important consideration \nconcerning adoptions must be that children are placed without delay in \nhomes with loving parents, irrespective of their particular racial or \nethnic characteristics. This overriding goal must take precedence over \nany unproven social theories or notions of political correctness.\n  Mr. President, if we owe children without families anything, we owe \nthem the right to be adopted by families that want them without being \nimpeded by our social prejudices and preconceptions. Denying adoption \non the basis of race is no less discrimination than denying employment \non the basis of race. And the consequences are certainly no less \nsevere. Let us, finally get beyond race and allow people who need each \nother--children and familes--to get together.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill, \nand a letter of support from the National Council for Adoption, be \nincluded in the Record. As a result of the efforts of Congressman \nBunning, similar legislative language has been incorporated into the \nPersonal Responsibility Act, H.R. 4.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 637\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Council For Adoption is \n     very supportive of your proposed legislation to end racism in \n     our child welfare system. The research on transracial \n     adoptions shows that:\n       Children of color wait twice as long as white children for \n     permanent loving homes simply because of the color of their \n     skin.\n       While African-Americans make up to 12-14 percent of the \n     population an overwhelming 40 percent of the estimated \n     100,000 children waiting for homes are black. The numbers \n     don't match.\n       Children of color raised in white homes are not ``lost'' to \n     their ethnic heritage, they do well academically, feel good \n     about themselves and become productive citizens.\n       The Multi-Ethnic Placement Act of 1994 ought to be repealed \n     as the legislative language and its purposes were hopelessly \n     hijacked by amendments insisted upon by the Administration.\n        [[Page S4727]] We applaud your interest and your proposed \n     legislation which is aimed at reducing the time children of \n     color spend without homes. We stand ready to work closely \n     with you to ensure timely passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                   Carol Statuto Bevan, Ed.D.,\n\n                                                Vice President for\n\n                               Research and Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request):\n  S. 638. A bill to authorize appropriations for United States insular \nareas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                      the insular development act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. At the request of the \nadministration, I am today introducing legislation ``to authorize \nappropriations for United States insular areas, and for other \npurposes''. The legislation was transmitted by the Assistant Secretary \nof the Interior for Territorial and International Affairs to implement \nthe funding recommendations contained in the President's proposed \nbudget for fiscal year 1996. The legislation, if enacted, would replace \nthe current annual guaranteed funding for the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands with a new program. The new program would \ncomplete the infrastructure funding contemplated under the agreement \nnegotiated by the administration with the Commonwealth and redirect the \nbalance of the funds to other territorial needs.\n  For the current fiscal year, Congress redirected a portion of the \nCommonwealth funding to support of efforts by the Departments of \nJustice, Labor, and the Treasury to work with the Commonwealth \ngovernment to address a variety of concerns that have arisen in the \nCommonwealth. A report on that effort is due from the Department of the \nInterior shortly, and we will want to consider the findings and \nrecommendations in that report to determine whether some of these funds \nmight be better spent in support of those activities. I am also \nconcerned with that provision of the proposed legislation that would \nprovide operational grants to Guam and the Commonwealth for compact \nimpact assistance. I do not have any particular objections to providing \nthat assistance if it is justified, if the budget limitations allow \nfunding, and if that assistance is a higher priority than other needs. \nMy concern is providing that assistance through an entitlement rather \nthan through discretionary appropriations. The central objective of the \ncurrent 7 year agreement with the Commonwealth is to eliminate \noperational assistance and focus on necessary infrastructure needs. \nReplacing one type of operational assistance with another seems to me \nto be a step back.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the Insular Development Act of \n     1995.\n\n     SEC. 2. NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     the Interior for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands $6,140,000, backed by the full faith and credit of \n     the United States, for each of fiscal years 1996 through \n     2001, for capital improvement projects in the environmental, \n     health, and public safety areas, administration and \n     enforcement of immigration and labor laws, and contribution \n     toward costs of the compacts of free association (for the \n     same duration and purposes as are applied to Guam in Public \n     Law 99-239 as amended by section 3 of this Act).\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPACT OF THE COMPACT.\n\n       (a) Paragraph (6) of subsection (e) of section 104 of \n     Public Law 99-239 (99 Stat. 1770, 48 U.S.C. 1681 note), is \n     amended by striking everything after the word ``after'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following language: ``September \n     30, 1995 and ending September 30, 2001, $4,580,000 annually, \n     backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, for \n     Guam, as a contribution toward costs that result from \n     increased demands for education and social program benefits \n     by immigrants from the Marshall Islands, the Federated States \n     of Micronesia, and Palau.''\n\n     SEC. 4. CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     the Interior $17,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning after \n     September 30, 1995 and ending September 30, 2001, backed by \n     the full faith and credit of the United States, for grants \n     for capital infrastructure construction in American Samoa, \n     Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands, Provided, That \n     the annual grant to American Samoa shall not exceed \n     $15,000,000 and the annual grants for Guam and the United \n     States Virgin Islands shall not exceed $3,000,000 each.\n\n     SEC. 5. CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) No funds shall be granted under this Act for capital \n     improvement projects without the submission by the respective \n     government of a master plan of capital needs that (1) ranks \n     proposed projects in order of priority, and (2) has been \n     reviewed and approved by the Department of the Interior and \n     the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The insular areas' \n     individual master plans, with comments, shall be presented in \n     the Department of the Interior's annual report on the State \n     of the Islands, and shall be the basis for any requests for \n     capital improvement funding through the Department of the \n     Interior or the Congress.\n       (b) Each grant by the Department of the Interior shall \n     include a five percent payment into a trust fund, to be \n     administered by the Governor (as trustee) of the territory in \n     which the project is located, solely for the maintenance of \n     such project. No funds shall be paid pursuant to a grant \n     under subsection (a) of this section without the prior \n     appropriation and payment by the respective territorial \n     government to the trustee, of an amount equal to the federal \n     contribution for maintenance of the project. A maintenance \n     plan covering the anticipated life of each project shall be \n     adopted by the Governor of the respective insular area and \n     approved by the Department of the Interior before any grant \n     payment for construction is released by the Department of the \n     Interior.\n       (c) The capital infrastructure funding authorized under \n     this Act is authorized to be extended for an additional \n     three-year phase-out period: Provided, That each grant during \n     the additional period contains a dollar sharing by each \n     grantee and the grantor in the following ratios: twenty-five/\n     seventy-five percent for the first year, fifty/fifty percent \n     for the second year, seventy-five/twenty-five percent for the \n     third year; Provided further, That funding for capital \n     infrastructure for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands shall not exceed $3,000,000 annually during the \n     period of such extension.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPEAL.\n\n       Effective after September 30, 1995, no additional funds \n     shall be made available under subsection (b) of section 4 of \n     Public Law 94-241 (90 Stat. 263, 48 U.S.C. 1681 note), and \n     such subsection is repealed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 states the short title of the Act to be the \n     ``Insular Development Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2 authorizes a full faith and credit appropriation \n     in an annual amount of $6.14 million for fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2001 to the Secretary of the Interior for \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) devoted \n     to the following purposes: (1) capital improvement projects \n     in environmental, health, and public safety areas, (2) \n     administration and enforcement of immigration and labor laws, \n     and (3) contribution toward costs of the compacts of free \n     association incurred by the CNMI.\n       Section 3 amends the law authorizing payments to United \n     States Pacific jurisdictions for costs associated with the \n     compacts of free association to provide a specific $4.58 \n     million annual full faith and credit payment to Guam as a \n     contribution toward such costs incurred by Guam.\n       Section 4 authorizes a full faith and credit appropriation \n     in the annual amount of $17 million for fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2001 to the Secretary of the Interior for capital \n     infrastructure construction in American Samoa, Guam, and the \n     Virgin Islands. The insular area with the greatest need, \n     American Samoa, would receive annual grants of between $11 \n     million and $15 million; Guam and the Virgin Islands would \n     each receive annual grants of up to $3 million.\n       Section 5(a) provides that capital infrastructure funds \n     granted under sections 2, 4, and 5 of the bill would be \n     subject to master plans developed by the respective \n     government that rank projects in priority order. The plans \n     would be subject to review and approval by the Department of \n     the Interior and United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n       Section 5(b) provides that five percent of each Interior \n     grant for capital infrastructure and a matching amount by the \n     respective insular government be paid into trust funds solely \n     for expenditure on maintenance of each project, according to \n     a maintenance plan approved by Interior. The respective \n     insular governor would be the trustee.\n       Section 5(c) provides for extension of only the capital \n     infrastructure program, authorized in section 4, for an \n     additional three-year phase-out period. The federal share of \n     construction grants would decrease to seventy-five percent in \n     the first year, fifty percent in the second year, and twenty-\n     five percent in the third year, before termination of the \n     program.\n       Section 6, repeals subsection (b) of section 4 of Public \n     Law 94-241 (which mandates continuing payments of $27.7 \n     million to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     until otherwise provided by law). The provision explicitly \n     states that no additional funds shall be made available under \n     this subsection of the 1976 law after fiscal year 1995.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\n                              U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill ``(t)o \n     authorize appropriations for United States insular areas, and \n     for other purposes.''\n       The Department of the Interior recommends that the bill be \n     introduced, referred to the appropriate committee, and \n     enacted.\n       The bill would terminate the mandatory financial assistance \n     paid to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     (CNMI) and shift such mandatory assistance to more pressing \n     territorial needs, i.e., contribution to Guam and the CNMI \n     for impact of immigration caused by the Compacts of Free \n     Association, and capital infrastructure construction. The \n     bill would follow-through on a commitment by the Congress to \n     contribute to the defraying of impact costs incurred by Guam \n     and the CNMI, and would represent a commitment to the \n     territories by President Clinton and the Congress to address \n     the territories' most pressing capital infrastructure needs. \n     The draft bill is consistent with the budgetary requirements \n     under ``Paygo.''\n       The Covenant to Establish the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of \n     America (Covenant) committed the federal government to \n     mandatory funding for the CNMI for a period of seven years--\n     1979 through 1985. A total of $228 million in full faith and \n     credit funding for a subsequent seven-year period was \n     approved by the Congress in legislation (Pub. L. 99-396, 100 \n     Stat. 840) that provided--\n       ``(u)pon the expiration of the period of Federal financial \n     assistance . . ., payments of direct grant assistance shall \n     continue at the annual level provided for the last fiscal \n     year of the additional period of seven fiscal years until \n     Congress otherwise provides by law.''\n       Congress has not over the last two years approved a third \n     and final financial assistance agreement, nor acted on \n     Administration proposals transmitted with the 1994 and 1995 \n     budgets.\n       With no additional provisions of law by the Congress, \n     however, the CNMI continues to receive $27.7 million annually \n     as it did in fiscal year 1992, the final year of the second \n     seven-year period.\n\n\n                      provisions of the draft bill\n\n       The draft bill addresses specific concerns shared by the \n     Congress, the Administration and the insular areas.\n     CNMI\n       The bill would authorize $6,140,000 a year for the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands through the year \n     2001 for the purposes of capital improvement projects, \n     administration and enforcement of immigration and labor laws, \n     and contribution to costs of the compacts of free \n     association. Flexibility would be accorded the CNMI in \n     allocating the funding among such purposes. If authorized, \n     the CNMI will have received a total of $120 million during \n     the period of fiscal years 1993 through 2001--the equivalent \n     of the 1992 agreement reached with the CNMI representatives.\n       The bill would shift remaining mandatory funding to other \n     priority insular needs, i.e., territorial infrastructure \n     needs, and the congressional commitment to reimburse United \n     States jurisdictions for the impact of the compacts of free \n     association.\n     Guam\n       When the Compact of Free Association for the Marshall \n     Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia was approved \n     by the Congress, section 104(e)(6) of the Public Law 99-239 \n     authorized the payment of impact of the Compact costs \n     incurred by United States Pacific island jurisdictions due to \n     the extension of education and social services to immigrants \n     from the freely associated states. The Palau Compact \n     legislation (Public Law 99-658) included Palau by reference. \n     The Governments of Guam and the CNMI contend that they have \n     incurred costs in excess of $75 million. While definitions of \n     eligible costs and the magnitude of the costs may be in \n     question, all agree that Guam and the CNMI have sustained \n     substantial expenses due to the Compact. With the \n     implementation of the Palau Compact, which occurred on \n     October 1, 1994, we anticipate that the problem will be \n     compounded. Under the draft bill, funds to defray costs for \n     the CNMI would be a part of the CNMI authorization contained \n     in section 2 of the draft bill. Annual payments of $4.58 \n     million for Guam would help defray Guam's expenses. The \n     contributions would cease at the end of the Compact period, \n     September 30, 2001.\n     Capital infrastructure\n       The remaining $17 million in mandatory funding would be \n     redirected to pressing capital infrastructure needs in \n     American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands for a minimum \n     period of six years. American Samoa has unfunded capital \n     infrastructure needs well in excess of $100 million. Guam and \n     the Virgin Islands have substantial needs in the \n     environmental, health, and public safety areas.\n       The draft bill would give recognition to the fact that of \n     the four small United States territories, American Samoa has \n     the greatest need for capital infrastructure, but lacks \n     resources for financing construction.\n       The bill would allow American Samoa to receive up to $15 \n     million annually for capital infrastructure projects. Guam \n     and the United States Virgin Islands would receive up to $3 \n     million annually for capital infrastructure projects related \n     to the environment, health, and public safety.\n       Capital infrastructure funds would be released only after \n     an insular area--\n       Develops a capital infrastructure master plan approved by \n     the Department of the Interior and the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers, and\n       Contributes five percent of the project cost to a \n     maintenance fund for the project to be expended according to \n     the project's maintenance plan.\n     Phase out\n       After the initial six years of mandatory funding, the \n     program may be extended for an additional three-year, phase-\n     out period, with grantee/federal sharing as follows: 25/75 \n     percent in the first year, 50/50 percent in the second year, \n     and 75/25 percent in the third year. Because section 2 of the \n     draft bill which includes capital infrastructure funding for \n     the Northern Mariana Islands will terminate at the end of the \n     fiscal year 2001, the Northern Mariana Islands would \n     participate in the phase-out years of the capital \n     infrastructure program in annual amounts up to $3 million, \n     like Guam and the Virgin Islands.\n       The proposed bill would have no negative effect on the \n     Federal budget and meets ``Paygo'' requirements by shifting \n     the purpose of existing mandatory funding. Discretionary \n     savings would result by shifting existing discretionary \n     infrastructure funding for the purposes identified in the \n     bill to this proposed replacement program.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to presentation of this draft bill from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Leslie M. Turner,\n               Assistant Secretary, Territorial and International \n                                                  Affairs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Johnston):\n  S. 639. A bill to provide for the disposition of locatable minerals \non Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n            the locatable mineral mining reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Senator Campbell, as a cosponsor of this legislation and \nI commend him for his leadership in this area. As a member of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator has been very \nactive in working for a mining law reform bill that will make needed \nreforms, get this issue behind us, and give the mining industry some \ncertainty.\n  The bill we are introducing today, with one exception, is very \nsimilar to the so-called 8-2 chairman's mark which we crafted last \nsummer during the House-Senate conference on mining law reform. While \nwe were not able to enact this proposal, I think it embodied a balanced \nand middle ground approach to most of the key issues involved in this \ncontroversy. Frankly, I believe this bill represents a better starting \npoint for our deliberations this year than either of the other \nproposals currently before the committee. Some may feel this bill goes \ntoo far in some areas; others may think it does not go far enough in \naddressing certain issues. While I am certain that this bill will \nundergo some changes, I think the measure Senator Campbell and I are \nproposing will provide a vehicle which will facilitate the enactment of \na mining law reform bill this year.\n  The one significant difference between this bill and last year's \nchairman's mark is in the area of State water rights. Senator Campbell \nhas replaced the water provisions of last summer's bill with language \nwhich protects the ability of the States to make decisions regarding \nwater quality and quantity consistent with existing State and Federal \nlaw. Certainly the water issue was one of the most contentious issues \nwe dealt with last year, and I am sure it will be again.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Campbell, as \nwell as Senator Craig and Senator Bumpers, to confect a bill that can \npass both the Senate and the House and that the President will \nsign.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Graham, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 640. A bill to provide for the conservation and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct \n[[Page S4729]] various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors \nof the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the water resources development act of 1995\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleagues, Senator Chafee, Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, \nSenator Bond, and Senator Graham, the Water Resources Development Act \nof 1995.\n  This legislation authorizes civil works programs for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers which preserves the navigation of our harbors and \nchannels so critical to the shipping of agricultural products and \nindustrial goods. It also provides for flood control and storm damage \nreduction essential to protecting lives and property.\n  Mr. President, since 1986, when the Congress established the landmark \nprinciples for non-Federal cost-sharing of water resource projects, the \nauthorization of the Corps of Engineers civil works programs has \noccurred on a biennial basis.\n  This 2-year authorization cycle has provided our local partners in \nwater resources development a level of continuity which has aided their \nplanning and budgeting needs.\n  Unfortunately, this 2-year cycle was broken by Congress last year \nwhen we failed to enact this legislation.\n  I believe my colleagues will find this bill to be a modest \nreauthorization proposal that maintains the uniform requirements of \ncost-sharing between the Federal Government and non-Federal project \nsponsors.\n  This legislation responds to water resource needs that are in the \nFederal interest and meet the benefit to cost ratio of 1 to 1. This \nmeans that for every Federal dollar invested in a project, the taxpayer \nreceives more than a dollar in benefits in return.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also funds projects consistent with \nthe requirements of current law. I must state that I do not support the \nrecommendations contained in the President's fiscal year 1996 budget \nsubmittal to terminate Federal participation in local flood control and \nhurricane protection because I believe that there is significant \njustification for continuing an appropriate level of Federal funding \nfor these projects.\n  Yes, the Corps of Engineers, like all Federal agencies, must achieve \nsignificant reductions in its budget. In Congress, we must give close \nscrutiny to water resource needs to determine if Federal funding is \nwarranted under severe budget constraints. We must not, however, \nunwisely and abruptly abandon the corps' central mission: to protect \nlives and property.\n  Such a policy may only serve to shift costs to other Federal agencies \nand departments. We must recognize that there will always be unforeseen \ncircumstances, times of national emergency, or situations too costly \nfor economically strapped communities to handle expensive projects by \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, since I was first elected to the Senate in 1979, and \nfor the following 7 years, I sponsored legislation in each Congress to \nprovide for the deepening and maintenance of our deep-draft ports. \nDeveloping a strong partnership with our non-Federal sponsors through \ncost-sharing was the cornerstone of my legislation.\n  During the years, since 1976, the Congress and the executive branch \nhad been gridlocked over the financing of water resource projects. Also \nat that time, global demand for steam coal skyrocketed. But, our ports \ncould not respond to this world demand. In Hampton Roads Harbor, \ncolliers were lined up in the Chesapeake Bay to enter the coal \nterminals. Upon loading, they would wait for high tide to leave the \nharbor.\n  The 1986 Water Resources Development Act [WRDA] was the culmination \nof our efforts to resolve many contentious issues--including cost-\nsharing.\n  I remain committed to the principle of cost-sharing which has become \nthe cornerstone of a successful corps program. As intended, it has \nensured that only those projects with strong local support are funded \nand it has leveraged substantial non-Federal money. Since the enactment \nof WRDA 1986, funding for Virginia projects has totalled $590 million \nin Federal funds which has stimulated more than $343 million in non-\nFederal money.\n  It was no easy task to devise reasonably fair cost-sharing formulas \nwhich were mindful of the difficulty of small communities to contribute \nto the costs of constructing flood control projects, of our coastal \ncommunities to receive credit for the value of property to be protected \nfrom hurricanes and of our commercial ports and inland waterways to \nremain competitive in a shrinking global marketplace.\n  WRDA 1986 has worked well in three major respects. First, by \nrequiring our local partners to share these costs, it has succeeded in \nensuring that the most worthy projects receive Federal funding. Second, \nit has ensured that our commercial ports and inland waterways remain \nopen for commercial traffic and are now able to serve the larger bulk \ncargo ships, including the super coal colliers. Third, it has allowed \nthe United States to meet our national security commitments abroad.\n  Mr. President, these principles remain valid today as we judge those \nprojects which will provide the greatest return for our investment of \nlimited Federal dollars. For these reasons, it is appropriate that \nCongress continue the Corps' fundamental missions of navigation, flood \ncontrol, floodplain management, and storm damage reduction.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator John \nWarner and others in cosponsoring legislation to reauthorize the civil \nworks program at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. With the exception \nof 1994, the Congress has authorized this necessary infrastructure \nprogram on a biennial basis since 1986.\n\n\n                               WRDA 1986\n\n  As many in the Senate are aware, the 1970's and early 1980's brought \na departure from the previous practice of approving omnibus \nauthorization bills and predictable appropriations for the construction \nof water resources projects. In 1986, however, we broke the logjam. \nAfter years of legislative and executive policy confrontations over the \nrole of the Federal Government in water policy, Congress approved the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1986. The legislation is often \nreferred to as WRDA.\n  The 1986 Act was landmark legislation because we finally instituted a \nreasonable framework for local cost-sharing of Army Corps' projects and \nfeasibility studies. This was a huge step in the right direction. I \nhelped author those cost-sharing provisions because there was a real \nneed to recognize our limited Federal resources and the financial \nresponsibility of local project sponsors.\n\n\n                              cost sharing\n\n  In establishing cost-sharing formulas for these projects and studies, \nthe Congress accomplished at least two important objectives. First, by \nreducing the Federal contribution toward individual projects, we have \nbeen able to use roughly the same level of total Federal funding for \nmany additional proposals which, despite their particular merit, had \npreviously gone by the wayside without full Federal funding.\n  Second, by requiring a local match, we have brought the locally \naffected parties into the decisionmaking process. Even though \nimprovements are still necessary on that score, I think it is fair to \nsay that our State and local partners have much greater input than they \nonce did.\n\n\n                            Budget reduction\n\n  Now we face a period of even greater fiscal austerity. In an effort \nto find spending reductions in the out years, the administration has \nproposed to significantly reduce Federal involvement in the \nconstruction of new flood control and coastal storm protection \nprojects. Also being discussed are plans to phase out the Federal \nmaintenance of harbors and ports which do not contribute to the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund.\n  Perhaps such dramatic change is necessary if we are to reverse the \ntrend of debt spending in Washington. Perhaps this sort of reduction in \nFederal involvement is exactly what the voters called for last \nNovember. I happen to believe that a need still exists for Federal \ninvolvement in some of these areas. The interstate nature of flooding \nwarrants Federal coordination and assistance.\n  [[Page S4730]] Yet, spending reductions must be made. As in 1986, we \nare being called upon to make tough choices in the effort to define the \nappropriate Federal role for construction and management of water-\nrelated resources.\n\n\n                               wrda 1995\n\n  I believe that Senator Warner has struck a careful balance in the \nlegislation he is proposing today. This bill is cost conscious. \nPreliminary estimates conducted by the Congressional Budget Office \nscore the authorization level of this measure at less than 50 percent \nof the nearly $3 billion authorized by WRDA 1992. Even though \nsignificant cost and scope reductions are made here--we still authorize \na broad mix of navigation, flood control, shoreline protection, and \nenvironmental restoration projects and studies.\n  While the administration has every right to propose long-term savings \nthrough broad, overarching policy shifts and program phase-outs, I am \nconvinced that we can achieve more significant and equitable spending \nreductions through the authorization process.\n  I am grateful that Senator Warner has taken the lead this year on \nwater resources reauthorization. Mr. President, with his direction and \nwith the cooperation of colleagues, I am confident that we will see \npassage of this bill this year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Frist, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Coats, and Mr. \n        Simon):\n  S. 641. A bill to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the ryan white care reauthorization act of 1995\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Kennedy, Hatch, Pell, Jeffords, Frist, Dodd, Coats, and Simon, \nI introduce the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995.\n  The CARE Act has played a critical role in improving the quality and \navailability of medical and support services for individuals with HIV \ndisease and AIDS. The most significant assistance under this act is \nprovided through titles I and II. Title I provides emergency relief \ngrants to cities disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Title \nII provides formula grants to States and territories to improve the \nquality, availability, and organization of health care and support \nservices.\n  As the HIV epidemic continues, the need for this important \nlegislation remains. There is a need as well to modify its provisions \nto take into account the changing face of the HIV epidemic since the \nCARE Act was first enacted in 1990. Once primarily a coastal urban area \nproblem, the HIV epidemic now reaches the smallest and most rural areas \nof this country. In addition, minorities, women, and children are \nincreasingly affected.\n  This reauthorization bill builds on the successful four-title \nstructure of the current CARE Act and includes many important \nimprovements. Chief among these are changes in the funding formulas \nwhich would ensure greater funding equity and which provide a single \nappropriation for titles I and II.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has identified large disparities \nand inequities in the current distribution of CARE Act funding. This \nlegislation, developed with GAO input, authorizes equity formulas for \ntitles I and II based on an estimation of the number of individuals \ncurrently living with AIDS and the costs of providing services. In \naddition, the new title II formula includes an adjustment to offset the \ndouble-counting of individuals by States, when such States also include \ntitle I cities.\n  The purpose of these changes is to assure a more equitable allocation \nof funding, based on where people with the illness are currently \nliving. With any formula change, there is always the concern about the \npotential for disruption of services to individuals now receiving them. \nTo address this concern, the bill maintains home-harmless floors \ndesigned to assure that no entity receives less than 92.5 percent of \nits 1995 allocation over the next 5 years.\n  In an effort to target resources to the areas in greatest need of \nassistance, the bill also limits the addition of new title I cities to \nthe program. Beginning in fiscal year 1998, current provisions which \nestablish eligibility for areas with a cumulative AIDS caseload in \nexcess of 2,000 will be replaced with provisions offering eligibility \nonly when over 2,000 cases emerge within a 5-year period.\n  The legislation makes a number of other important modifications:\n  First, it moves the Special Projects of National Significance Program \nto a new title V, funded by a 3-percent set-aside from each of the \nother four titles. In addition, it adds Native American communities to \nthe current list of entities eligible for projects of national \nsignificance.\n  Second, it creates a statewide coordination and planning process to \nimprove coordination of services, including services in title I cities \nand title II States.\n  Third, it extends the administrative expense caps for title I and II \nto subcontractors.\n  Fourth, it authorizes guidelines for a minimum State drug formulary.\n  Fifth, it modifies representation on the title I planning councils to \nmore accurately reflect the demographics of the HIV epidemic in the \neligible area.\n  Sixth, for the title I supplemental grants, a priority is established \nfor eligible areas with the greatest prevalence of comorbid conditions, \nsuch as tuberculosis, which indicate a more severe need.\n  I believe that the changes proposed by this legislation will assure \nthe continued effectiveness of the Ryan White CARE Act by maintaining \nits successful components and by strengthening its ability to meet \nemerging challenges. Putting together this legislation has involved the \ntime and commitment of a wide variety of individuals and organizations. \nI want to acknowledge all of their efforts, and I particularly \nappreciate the constructive and cooperative approach which Senator \nKennedy has lent to the development of this legislation. It is my hope \nthat the Senate can act promptly in approving this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent a summary of this bill be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                   Summary of the Reauthorization Act\n\n       1. The current four-title structure of the Ryan White CARE \n     Act is maintained.\n       Title I: Provides emergency relief grants to eligible \n     metropolitan areas (EMAs) disproportionately affected by the \n     HIV epidemic. One-half of the Title I funds are distributed \n     by formula; the remaining one-half is distributed \n     competitively.\n       Title II: Provides grants to states and territories to \n     improve the quality, availability, and organization of health \n     care and support services for individuals with HIV disease \n     and their families. The funds are used: to provide medical \n     support services for individuals who are not included in the \n     Title I areas; to continue insurance payments; to provide \n     home care services; and to purchase medications necessary for \n     the care of these individuals. Funding for Title II is \n     distributed by formula.\n       Title III(b): Supports early intervention services on an \n     out-patient basis--including counseling, testing, referrals, \n     and clinical, diagnostic, and other therapeutic services. \n     This funding is distributed by competitive grants.\n       Title IV: Provides grants for research and services for \n     pediatric patients.\n       2. A single appropriation for Title I grants to eligible \n     metropolitan areas and Title II grants to states is \n     authorized for fiscal year 1996.\n       A single appropriation should help unify the interest of \n     grantees in assuring funding for all individuals living with \n     AIDS, regardless of whether they live in EMAs or states.\n       The appropriation is divided between the two titles based \n     on the ratio of fiscal year 1995 appropriations for each \n     title. Sixty-four percent is designated for Title I. The \n     Secretary is authorized to develop and implement a method to \n     adjust the distribution of funding for Title I and Title II \n     to account for new Title I cities and other relevant factors \n     for fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000. If the \n     Secretary does not implement such a method, separate \n     appropriations for titles I and II are authorized, beginning \n     in fiscal year 1997 and extending through fiscal year 2000.\n       3. Equity formulas are authorized for Titles I and II based \n     on an estimation of the number of individuals living with \n     AIDS and the costs of providing services.\n       The present distribution formulas have led to disparity in \n     funding for individuals living with AIDS based on where they \n     live. This is due to: a caseload measure which is cumulative, \n     the absence of any measure of service costs, and the counting \n     of EMA cases by both the Titles I and II formulas.\n       The equity formulas will include an estimate of living \n     cases of AIDS. This estimate is calculated by applying a \n     different weight \n     [[Page S4731]] to each year of cases reported to the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention over the most recent ten-\n     year period. A cost index is determined by using the average \n     Medicare hospital wage index for the three-year period \n     immediately preceding the grant award. Over a five-year \n     period, hold-harmless floors for the formulas are provided in \n     order to assure that no entity receives less than 92.5 \n     percent of its 1995 allocation. The phase-in is provided to \n     avoid disruption of services to beneficiaries, while still \n     allowing for the redistribution of funds.\n       4. The addition of new Title I cities will be limited.\n       The current designation criteria for Title I cities was \n     developed to target emergency areas. Five years after the \n     initial enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act, the epidemic \n     persists. However, the needs have changed from emergency \n     relief to maintenance of existing efforts. In addition, Title \n     II funding has been used to develop infrastructure in large \n     metropolitan areas, decreasing the relative need for \n     emergency Title I funding.\n       However, to allow for true future emergencies, the Title I \n     definition is refined to include only those areas which have \n     a population of at least 500,000 individuals and a cumulative \n     total of more than 2,000 cases of AIDS in the preceding five \n     years. This requirement will not apply to any area that is \n     deemed eligible before fiscal year 1998.\n       5. A priority for the Title I supplementary grants is \n     established.\n       The severity of illness has a major impact on the delivery \n     of services. The reauthorization establishes a priority for \n     the distribution of funds which accounts for co-morbid \n     conditions as indicators of more severe HIV-disease. Such \n     conditions include sexually transmitted diseases, substance \n     abuse, tuberculosis, severe mental illness, and homelessness.\n       6. The Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) and \n     the AIDS Education and Training Centers are included in a new \n     Title V.\n       Currently, SPNS is part of Title II and is funded by a 10 \n     percent Title II set-aside. The reauthorization bill provides \n     that the SPNS program will receive a 3 percent set-aside from \n     each of the other four titles. The SPNS project will address \n     the needs of special populations, assist in the development \n     of essential community-based service infrastructure, and \n     ensure the availability of services for Native American \n     communities.\n       The AIDS Education and Training Centers program is \n     transferred from federal health professions education \n     legislation. This program provides funding for the training \n     of health personnel in the diagnosis, treatment, and \n     prevention of HIV disease. Its purpose is to assure the \n     availability of a cadre of trained individuals for the CARE \n     Act programs.\n       7. A statewide coordination and planning process is created \n     to improve coordination of services, including services in \n     Title I cities and Title II states.\n       8. Representation on the Title I planning councils is \n     changed to more accurately reflect the demographics of the \n     HIV epidemic.\n       9. Guidelines for a minimum state drug formulary are \n     authorized.\n       Therapeutics improve the quality of life of patients with \n     HIV disease and minimize the need for costly inpatient \n     medical care. The medical state of the art is constantly \n     changing. The guidelines will help states to keep abreast of \n     these changes and to develop a drug formulary which is \n     composed of available Food and Drug Administration approved \n     therapies.\n       10. Administrative caps for Titles I and II are extended to \n     contractors and subcontractors.\n       Administrative costs for grantees and subcontractors are \n     tightly defined and limited. This limitation will ensure \n     monies are utilized to provide services for people living \n     with AIDS rather than subsidizing excessive administrative \n     expenses.\n                    background on the aids epidemic\n\n       1. The HIV epidemic continues to be a national problem:\n       The number of AIDS cases has increased to 441,000; one-\n     fifth of the new cases occurred in 1994.\n       AIDS is now the leading cause of death for all Americans \n     between the ages of 25 to 44.\n       Cases are distributed across the United States--with only \n     relative sparing of a few Northern Plains and Mountain \n     states.\n       2. Trends:\n       The Northeast incidence is higher for the injecting drug \n     user than for other populations.\n       The Southern region cases remain primarily among the gay \n     male population.\n       The proportion of the epidemic among gay males in the \n     Midwest and the West has stabilized.\n       The heterosexual AIDS epidemic is increasing dramatically.\n       Heterosexual transmission is now the leading cause of AIDS \n     in women.\n       The highest concentration of infected women is in the \n     coastal Northeast, the mid-atlantic, and the Southeast.\n       Cases in the Northeast remain primarily within urban \n     centers, while cases in the Southeast are more likely to be \n     located in small towns and cities.\n       3. Minorities:\n       Blacks and latinos comprise nearly 75 percent of all women \n     infected.\n       The rates of infection for black women range from 7 to 27 \n     times higher than the rates for caucasian women.\n       4. Adolescents:\n       Adolescents have the fastest growing rate of infection.\n       The rates of infection among adolescents are similar among \n     women and men, but the rates are the highest among \n     blacks.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nKassebaum in introducing the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of \n1995.\n  For 15 years, America has been struggling with the devastating \neffects of AIDS. More than a million citizens are infected with the \nAIDS virus. AIDS itself has now become the leading killer of young \nAmericans ages 25 to 44. AIDS is killing brothers and sisters, children \nand parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives.\n  More than 400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Over half \nhave already died--and yet the epidemic marches on unabated.\n  As the crisis continues year after year, it has become more and more \ndifficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem.\n  The epidemic has cost the Nation immeasurable talent and energy in \nyoung and promising lives struck down long before their time. We must \ndo better to provide care and support for those caught in the \nepidemic's path. And with this legislation, we will.\n  Five years ago, in the name of Ryan White and all the other Americans \nwho had lost their battle against AIDS, Congress passed and President \nBush signed into law the Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act.\n  Since then, the CARE Act has been a model of bipartisan cooperation \nand effective Federal leadership. Today that bipartisan tradition \ncontinues.\n  The CARE Act provides emergency relief for cities hardest hit by the \nAIDS epidemic, and additional funding for all States to provide health \ncare, early intervention, and support services for individuals and \nfamilies with HIV disease in both urban and rural areas.\n  In Boston, the CARE Act has led to dramatically increased access to \nessential services. This year, because of Ryan White, 15,000 \nindividuals are receiving primary care, 8,000 are receiving dental \ncare, and 9,000 are receiving mental health services. An additional 700 \nare receiving case management services and nutrition supplements. This \nassistance is reducing hospitalizations, and is making an extraordinary \ndifference in people's lives.\n  While much has changed since 1990, the brutality of the epidemic \nremains the same. When the act first took effect, only 16 cities \nqualified for ``emergency relief.'' In the past 5 years, that number \nhas more than tripled--and by next year it will have quadrupled.\n  This crisis is not limited to major urban centers. Caseloads are now \ngrowing in small towns and rural communities, along the coasts and in \nAmerica's heartland. From Weymouth to Wichita, no community will avoid \nthe epidemic's reach.\n  We are literally fighting for the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nour fellow citizens. These realities challenge us to move forward \ntogether in the best interest of all people living with HIV. And that \nis what Senator Kassebaum and I have attempted to do.\n  The compromise in this legislation acknowledges that the HIV epidemic \nhas expanded its reach but we have not forgotten its roots. While new \nfaces and new places are now affected, the epidemic rages on in the \nareas of the country hit hardest and longest.\n  The pain and suffering of individuals and families with HIV is real, \nwidespread, and growing. All community-based organizations, cities, and \nStates need additional support from the Federal Government to meet the \nneeds of those they serve.\n  The revised formulas in this legislation will make these desperately \nneeded resources available based on the relative number of people \nliving with HIV disease--and the relative cost of providing these \nessential services.\n  The new formula will increase the medical care and the support \nservices available to individuals with HIV in many cities, including \nBoston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Seattle, and in many States.\n  Equally important, the compromise will ensure the ongoing stability \nof the existing AIDS care system in areas of the country with the \ngreatest incidence of AIDS. The HIV epidemic in New York, San \nFrancisco, Miami, and Newark is far from over--and in many ways, the \nworst is yet to come.\n  [[Page S4732]] This legislation represents a compromise, and like \nmost compromises, it is not perfect and it will not please everyone. \nBut on balance--it is a good bill--and its enactment will benefit all \npeople living with HIV everywhere in the Nation. We have sought common \nground. We have listened to those on the frontlines. We have attempted \nto support their efforts, not tie their hands.\n  Congress and the AIDS community must put aside political, geographic, \nand institutional differences to face this important challenge squarely \nand successfully. The structure of the CARE Act--affirmed in this \nreauthorization--provides a sound and solid foundation on which to \nbuild that unity.\n  Hundreds of health, social service, labor, and religious \norganizations helped to shape the act's provisions and have made its \npromise a reality. The act has been praised by Governors, mayors, \ncounty executives, and local and State AIDS directors and health \nofficers. It has required all levels of government to join together in \nproviding services and resources. And success stories of this \ncoordination are now plentiful.\n  Community-based AIDS service organizations and people living with HIV \nhave had critically important roles in the development and \nimplementation of humane and cost-effective service delivery networks \nresponsive to local needs.\n  Although the resources fall far short of meeting the growing need, \nthe act is working. It has provided life-saving care and support for \nhundreds of thousands of individuals and families affected by HIV and \nAIDS. Through its unique structure, it has quickly and efficiently \ndirected assistance to those who need it most.\n  The Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, however, is about more than \nFederal funds and health care services. It is also about caring and the \nAmerican tradition of reaching out to people who are suffering and in \nneed of help. Ryan White would be proud of what has happened in his \nname. His example, and the hard work of so many others, are bringing \nhelp and hope to our American family with AIDS. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this vital initiative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 642. A bill to provide for demonstration projects in six States to \nestablish or improve a system of assured minimum child support \npayments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the child support assurance act of 1995\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I reintroduce a piece of legislation \nwhose subject should be central to our debate over welfare reform. I \nsay this because the Child Support Assurance Act of 1995 promotes work, \nfamily, self-sufficiency, and personal responsibility. At the same \ntime, it seeks to put a stop to one of the principal causes of child \npoverty in this country, lack of financial support from absent parents. \nI am delighted to be joined in this effort by my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, who has long been a champion of \nchildren's causes and this concept in particular.\n\n\n                   welfare reform, welfare prevention\n\n  I firmly believe we will not succeed in reforming welfare until we \nsucceed in reforming child support. Of course, we need welfare reform \nthat will encourage people to become self-sufficient and leave \nGovernment assistance. But just as important, we need welfare \nprevention policies to allow people to avoid welfare in the first \nplace. We need to seriously ask ourselves, what can we as a nation do \nto support families in danger of sliding into poverty?\n  At or near the top of our list of answers should be putting some \nteeth and some assurances into our child support system. Lack of child \nsupport is one of the principal causes of poverty for one-parent \nfamilies. The Census Bureau illustrated this fact when it estimated \nthat between 1984 and 1986 approximately half a million children fell \ninto poverty after their father left home.\n  In 1989 alone, the children and single parents of America were owed \n$5.1 billion in unpaid child support. If every single-parent family had \nan award and the awards were paid in full, it would mean $30 billion a \nyear for the children of America. Can you imagine the difference it \nwould make if our kids received the sums they are being cheated out of \nannually?\n  Connecticut is no different from any other State. Despite a child \nsupport enforcement system that ranks among the best in the Nation, its \nchild support delinquencies now total nearly half a billion dollars. \nThat is half a billion dollars in a State of only 3\\1/2\\ million \npeople.\n  The clear connection between child support and welfare was \nillustrated during a hearing of the Subcommittee on Children I chaired \nin the last Congress. Geraldine Jensen testified about struggling as a \nsingle mother and receiving no help from her exhusband. She had to work \n60 hours a week just to make ends meet. One day she realized her kids \nhad gone from two parents to one parent when her husband left, and then \nfrom one parent to none when she had to take her second job. She was \nworking so much that she had no time for her children.\n  So Ms. Jensen quit her jobs and went on AFDC. She finally collected \nthe child support owed her 7 years later, and she was able to get back \non her feet.\n\n\n                       child support and poverty\n\n  Unfortunately, the reality today is that there are far too many \nfamilies out there like Ms. Jensen's. And far too many children are \nplunged into poverty when their parents do not live up to their \nresponsibilities. The poverty rate for single-parent families headed by \nwomen is nearly 33 percent. This compares to a poverty rate of under 8 \npercent for two-parent families.\n  Why is the poverty rate so high for households led by single women? \nThe primary reason is a lack of support from absent fathers--42 percent \nof single mothers do not even have child support orders for their \nchildren. For poor women, this figure is 57 percent. And even a child \nsupport order is no guarantee of support. In 1989, half of all mother-\nled families with child support orders received no support at all or \nless than the amount due.\n  We have known for some time now that our child support system needs a \nmajor overhaul. The Child Support Amendments of 1984 and the Family \nSupport Act of 1988 made modest improvements. For every 100 child \nsupport cases in 1983, there were 15 in which there was a collection. \nIn 1990, there were 18. Out of 100, 15 to 18 is a step in the right \ndirection, but we clearly have a long, long way to go.\n\n\n                   enforcement and assurance critical\n\n  As the Senate considers proposals for welfare reform, I suggest that \nputting teeth into our child support enforcement system is absolutely \ncritical to the goal of moving people off welfare and into self-\nsufficiency.\n  It is time for us to stop this slide toward public assistance by \ninsisting that parents meet the responsibilities they have for the \nchildren they bring into the world. The children of America will be the \ntrue winners of such a policy, but the taxpayers will also come out \nahead because of reduced welfare expenditures. Toward this end, Senator \nBradley, myself, and others have introduced a tough enforcement bill, \nsupported by Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The bill I am introducing today would take us further down the road \ntoward an effective child support system. It would create incentives \nfor responsible behavior: incentives for custodial parents to seek \nchild support orders, incentives for noncustodial parents to follow \nthose orders, and incentives for States to make sure this whole process \nworks. As a last resort, it would provide a minimum level of support \nfor all children not living with both parents.\n  Right now, the poor children of America are the ones paying for the \nfailings of our families and the failings of our child support system. \nIt is my view that the welfare reform bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last week takes us further in the direction of \npunishing children. I strongly believe that welfare reform that does \nnot try to prevent families from slipping into welfare dependency is \ndoomed to failure.\n\n\n                         rigorous requirements\n\n  The child support assurance bill would authorize demonstration grants \nto six States for use in guaranteeing child support benefits. \nParticipating States would have to meet a rigorous set of requirements. \nTo qualify, States \n[[Page S4733]] would already have to be doing a good job of collecting \nchild support and would have to be at, or above, the national median \nfor paternity establishment. And during the course of the grant, the \nState would have to show real, measurable improvement in paternity \nestablishment, child support orders, and collections.\n  Just as the Child Support Assurance Act calls on participating States \nto meet their obligations, it would do the same for participating \nfamilies. To qualify, the custodial parent would have to possess, or be \nseeking, a child support award or have a good reason not to.\n  We hope that this approach will serve as a model for the country. To \ntest this proposition, the Department of Health and Human Services \nwould conduct 3- and 5-year evaluations of the demonstration programs \nto gauge the effectiveness of the approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Rockefeller and me in \nsupporting this legislation and demanding that we all meet our \nresponsibilities to America's children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Assurance Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the number of single-parent households has increased \n     significantly;\n       (2) there is a high correlation between childhood poverty \n     and growing up in a single-parent household;\n       (3) family dissolution often brings the economic \n     consequence of a lower standard of living for the custodian \n     and children;\n       (4) children are nearly twice as likely to be in poverty \n     after a family dissolution as before a family dissolution;\n       (5) one-fourth of the single mothers who are owed child \n     support receive none and another one-fourth of such mothers \n     receive only partial child support payments;\n       (6) single mothers above and below the poverty line are \n     equally likely to receive none of the child support they are \n     owed; and\n       (7) the failure of children to receive an adequate level of \n     child support limits the ability of such children to thrive \n     and to develop their potential and leads to long-term \n     societal costs in terms of health care, welfare, and loss in \n     labor force productivity.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable \n     participating States to establish child support assurance \n     systems in order to improve the economic circumstances of \n     children who do not receive a minimum level of child support \n     from the noncustodial parents of such children and to \n     strengthen the establishment and enforcement of child support \n     awards. The child support assurance approach is structured on \n     a demonstration basis in order to implement and evaluate \n     different options with respect to the provision of intensive \n     support services and mechanisms for administering the program \n     on a national basis.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT ASSURANCE \n                   DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to encourage States to provide a \n     guaranteed minimum level of child support for every eligible \n     child not receiving such support, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall make grants to not more than 6 States to \n     conduct demonstration projects for the purpose of \n     establishing or improving a system of assured minimum child \n     support payments in accordance with this section.\n       (b) Contents of Application.--An application for a grant \n     under this section shall be submitted by the Chief Executive \n     Officer of a State and shall--\n       (1) contain a description of the proposed child support \n     assurance project to be established, implemented, or improved \n     using amounts provided under this section, including the \n     level of the assured benefit to be provided, the specific \n     activities to be undertaken, and the agencies that will be \n     involved;\n       (2) specify whether the project will be carried out \n     throughout the State or in limited areas of the State;\n       (3) estimate the number of children who will be eligible \n     for assured minimum child support payments under the project, \n     and the amounts to which they will be entitled on average as \n     individuals and in the aggregate;\n       (4) describe the child support guidelines and review \n     procedures which are in use in the State and any expected \n     modifications;\n       (5) contain a commitment by the State to carry out the \n     project during a period of not less than 3 and not more than \n     5 consecutive fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1997;\n       (6) contain assurances that the State--\n       (A) is currently at or above the national median paternity \n     establishment percentage (as defined in section 452(g)(2) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 652(g)(2));\n       (B) will improve the performance of the agency designated \n     by the State to carry out the requirements under part D of \n     title IV of the Social Security Act by at least 4 percent \n     each year in which the State operates a child support \n     assurance project under this section in--\n       (i) the number of cases in which paternity is established \n     when required;\n       (ii) the number of cases in which child support orders are \n     obtained; and\n       (iii) the number of cases with child support orders in \n     which collections are made; and\n       (C) to the maximum extent possible under current law, will \n     use Federal, State, and local job training assistance to \n     assist individuals who have been determined to be unable to \n     meet such individuals' child support obligations;\n       (7) describe the extent to which multiple agencies, \n     including those responsible for administering the Aid to \n     Families With Dependent Children Program under part A of \n     title IV of the Social Security Act and child support \n     collection, enforcement, and payment under part D of such \n     title, will be involved in the design and operation of the \n     child support assurance project; and\n       (8) contain such other information as the Secretary may \n     require by regulation.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--A State shall use amounts provided under \n     a grant awarded under this section to carry out a child \n     support assurance project designed to provide a minimum \n     monthly child support benefit for each eligible child in the \n     State to the extent that such minimum child support is not \n     paid in a month by the noncustodial parent.\n       (d) Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--A child support assurance project funded \n     under this section shall provide that--\n       (A) any child (as defined in paragraph (2)) with a living \n     noncustodial parent for whom a child support order has been \n     sought (as defined in paragraph (3)) or obtained and any \n     child who meets ``good cause'' criteria for not seeking or \n     enforcing a support order is eligible for the assured child \n     support benefit;\n       (B) the assured child support benefit shall be paid \n     promptly to the custodial parent at least once a month and \n     shall be--\n       (i) an amount determined by the State which is--\n\n       (I) not less than $1,500 per year for the first child, \n     $1,000 per year for the second child, and $500 per year for \n     the third and each subsequent child; and\n       (II) not more than $3,000 per year for the first child and \n     $1,000 per year for the second and each subsequent child;\n\n       (ii) offset and reduced to the extent that the custodial \n     parent receives child support in a month from the \n     noncustodial parent;\n       (iii) indexed and adjusted for inflation; and\n       (iv) in the case of a family of children with multiple \n     noncustodial parents, calculated in the same manner as if all \n     such children were full siblings, but any child support \n     payment from a particular noncustodial parent shall only be \n     applied against the assured child support benefit for the \n     child or children of that particular noncustodial parent;\n       (C) for purposes of determining the need of a child or \n     relative and the level of assistance, one-half of the amount \n     received as a child support payment shall be disregarded from \n     income until the total amount of child support and Aid to \n     Families With Dependent Children benefit received under part \n     A of title IV of the Social Security Act equals the income \n     official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management \n     and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section \n     673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981) that \n     is applicable to a family of the size involved;\n       (D) in the event that the family as a whole becomes \n     ineligible for aid to families with dependent children under \n     part A of title IV of the Social Security Act due to \n     consideration of assured child support benefits, the \n     continuing eligibility of the caretaker for aid to families \n     with dependent children under such title shall be calculated \n     without consideration of the assured child support benefit; \n     and\n       (E) in order to participate in the child support assurance \n     project, the child's caretaker shall apply for services of \n     the State's child support enforcement program under part D of \n     title IV of the Social Security Act.\n       (2) Definition of child.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``child'' means an individual who is of such an age, \n     disability, or educational status as to be eligible for child \n     support as provided for by the law of the State in which such \n     individual resides.\n       (3) Determination of seeking a child support order.--For \n     purposes of this section, a child support order shall be \n     deemed to have been ``sought'' where an individual has \n     applied for services from the State agency designated by the \n     State to carry out the requirements of part D of title IV of \n     the Social Security Act or has sought a child support order \n     through representation by private or public counsel or pro \n     se.\n       (e) Consideration and Priority of Applications.--\n       (1) Selection criteria.--The Secretary shall consider all \n     applications received from States desiring to conduct \n     demonstration projects under this section and shall approve \n     not more than 6 applications which appear likely to \n     contribute significantly to the achievement of the purpose of \n     this section. In selecting States to conduct demonstration \n     projects under this section, the Secretary shall--\n     [[Page S4734]]   (A) ensure that the applications selected \n     represent a diversity of minimum benefits distributed \n     throughout the range specified in subsection (d)(1)(B)(i);\n       (B) consider the geographic dispersion and variation in \n     population of the applicants;\n       (C) give priority to States with applications that \n     demonstrate--\n       (i) significant recent improvements in--\n\n       (I) establishing paternity and child support awards;\n       (II) enforcement of child support awards; and\n       (III) collection of child support payments;\n\n       (ii) a record of effective automation; and\n       (iii) that efforts will be made to link child support \n     systems with other service delivery systems;\n       (D) ensure that the proposed projects will be of a size \n     sufficient to obtain a meaningful measure of the effects of \n     child support assurance;\n       (E) give priority, first, to States intending to operate a \n     child support assurance project on a statewide basis, and, \n     second, to States that are committed to phasing in an \n     expansion of such project to the entire State, if interim \n     evaluations suggest such expansion is warranted; and\n       (F) ensure that, if feasible, the States selected use a \n     variety of approaches for child support guidelines.\n       (2) Requirements for grantees.--Of the States selected to \n     participate in the demonstration projects conducted under \n     this section, the Secretary shall require, if feasible--\n       (A) that at least 2 provide intensive integrated social \n     services for low-income participants in the child support \n     assurance project, for the purpose of assisting such \n     participants in improving their employment, housing, health, \n     and educational status; and\n       (B) that at least 2 have adopted the Uniform Interstate \n     Family Support Act.\n       (f) Duration.--During fiscal year 1996, the Secretary shall \n     develop criteria, select the States to participate in the \n     demonstration, and plan for the evaluation required under \n     subsection (h). The demonstration projects conducted under \n     this section shall commence on October 1, 1996, and shall be \n     conducted for not less than 3 and not more than 5 consecutive \n     fiscal years, except that the Secretary may terminate a \n     project before the end of such period if the Secretary \n     determines that the State conducting the project is not in \n     substantial compliance with the terms of the application \n     approved by the Secretary under this section.\n       (g) Cost Savings Recovery.--The Secretary shall develop a \n     methodology to identify any State cost savings realized in \n     connection with the implementation of a child support \n     assurance project conducted under this Act. Any such savings \n     realized as a result of the implementation of a child support \n     assurance project shall be utilized for child support \n     enforcement improvements or expansions and improvements in \n     the Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program conducted \n     under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act within \n     the participating State.\n       (h) Evaluation and Report to Congress.--\n       (1) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall conduct an evaluation \n     of the effectiveness of the demonstration projects funded \n     under this section. The evaluation shall include an \n     assessment of the effect of an assured benefit on--\n       (A) income from nongovernment sources and the number of \n     hours worked;\n       (B) the use and amount of government supports;\n       (C) the ability to accumulate resources;\n       (D) the well-being of the children, including educational \n     attainment and school behavior; and\n       (E) the State's rates of establishing paternity and support \n     orders and of collecting support.\n       (2) Reports.--Three and 5 years after commencement of the \n     demonstration projects, the Secretary shall submit an interim \n     and final report based on the evaluation to the Committee on \n     Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the \n     Senate, and the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee \n     on Economic and Educational Opportunities of the House of \n     Representatives concerning the effectiveness of the child \n     support assurance projects funded under this section.\n       (i) State Reports.--The Secretary shall require each State \n     that conducts a demonstration project under this section to \n     annually report such information on the project's operation \n     as the Secretary may require, except that all such \n     information shall be reported according to a uniform format \n     prescribed by the Secretary.\n       (j) Restrictions on Matching and Use of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--A State conducting a demonstration project \n     under this section shall be required--\n       (A) except as provided in paragraph (2), to provide not \n     less than 20 percent of the total amounts expended in each \n     calendar year of the project to pay the costs associated with \n     the project funded under this section;\n       (B) to maintain its level of expenditures for child support \n     collection, enforcement, and payment at the same level, or at \n     a higher level, than such expenditures were prior to such \n     State's participation in a demonstration project provided by \n     this section; and\n       (C) to maintain the Aid to Families With Dependent Children \n     benefits provided under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act at the same level, or at a higher level, as the \n     level of such benefits on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (2) Exception.--A State participating in a demonstration \n     project under this section may provide not less than 10 \n     percent of the total amounts expended to pay the costs \n     associated with the project funded under this section in \n     years after the first year such project is conducted in a \n     State if the State meets the improvements specified in \n     subsection (b)(6)(B).\n       (k) Coordination With Certain Means-Tested Programs.--For \n     purposes of--\n       (1) the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 \n     et seq.);\n       (2) title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et \n     seq.);\n       (3) section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of \n     1965 (12 U.S.C. 1701s);\n       (4) sections 221(d)(3), 235, and 236 of the National \n     Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(3), 1715z, 1715z-1);\n       (5) the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (6) title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et \n     seq.); and\n       (7) child care assistance provided through--\n       (A) part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n       (B) the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.); or\n       (C) title XX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et \n     seq.),\n     any payment made to an individual within the demonstration \n     project area for child support up to the amount which an \n     assured child support benefit would provide shall not be \n     treated as income and shall not be taken into account in \n     determining resources for the month of its receipt and the \n     following month.\n       (l) Treatment of Child Support Benefit.--Any assured child \n     support benefit received by an individual under this Act \n     shall be considered child support for purposes of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (m) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary in each of \n     fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 to carry \n     out the purposes of this Act.\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as we focus on the issues of \nwelfare reform and child support enforcement, I am proud to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, in \nintroducing a demonstration project to explore the merits of child \nsupport assurance. This is a bipartisan idea to ensure minimum support \nto single parents as a way to promote work and responsibility.\n  I first became interested in the innovative idea of child support \nassurance as Chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on Children \nwhich endorsed a demonstration of child support assurance in its \nunanimous 1991 report, ``Beyond Rhetoric, a New American Agenda for \nChildren and Families.''\n  The Commission urged the Federal Government, in partnership with \nseveral States, to undertake a demonstration to design and test the \neffects of an assured child support plan that combines enhanced child \nsupport enforcement with a Government-insured minimum benefit for \nchildren.\n  Under our demonstration, eligible parents would have to have a child \nsupport award in place or be fully cooperating in establishing \npaternity which would create a real incentive for parents to get a \nchild support award. Once such an award is established, the Federal and \nState Government can aggressively seek to collect the payments from \nabsent parents. But the minimum assured benefit will protect the \ninnocent child from hardship and economic uncertainty when one parent \nis shirking his/her obligation.\n  Such stable, consistent support is vital for children. A 1994 study \nby the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development noted \nthat children of single-parent families are at increased risk. It notes \nthat the single most important factor in accounting for the lower \nachievement of children in single-parent families is poverty and \neconomic insecurity. Income differences account for half of the \nincreased risk for disadvantages. The researchers noted that because \nincome is such an important factor in the increased risk for \ndisadvantages among children in single-parent families, policies that \nserve to minimize the negative economic impact on children may help \nreduce their difficulties.\n  The National Child Support Assurance Consortium issued a compelling \nreport called ``Childhood's End'' in January 1993 that outlined what \nhappens to children when child support\n payments are missing, or just plain late. Let me share just a few of \nthe report's significant findings about what \n[[Page S4735]] happens to children when child support is not paid.\n  Fifty-five percent of mothers reported that their children missed \nregular health check-ups;\n  Thirty-six percent of mothers reported that their children did not \nget medical care when they became ill; and\n  Fifty-seven percent of the mothers reported that their children lost \ntheir regular child care.\n  The list goes and on, and it is tragic that absent parents are not \nliving up to their financial obligations and placing their own children \nat risk. President Clinton estimates that 800,000 people could leave \nthe welfare system and dependency if they were paid the child support \nthat they are owed. It is wrong to penalize these families and push \nthem into dependency. Rather we must aggressively move on child support \nenforcement and explore the benefits of providing a minimum Government \nbenefit in cases where our State enforcement efforts fail to timely \ncollect child support owed to children.\n  As Chairman of the National Commission on Children, I want to put \nthis child support assurance demonstration project into perspective. \nOur bipartisan commission report clearly stated that children do best \nin stable, two-percent families. I wish that every child could grow up \nin a caring home with both parents and financial security.\n  But in reality, over 15.7 million children are living in a single-\nparent household and in need of child support. Demographers warn us \nthat 1 out of every 2 children growing up today will spend some time \nliving with only one parent; and, therefore, half of children today \nwill depend on child support at some point.\n  I strongly believe that both parents--mothers and fathers--have a \nmoral obligation to financially and emotionally support their children.\n  The Government has a role to play in ensuring that parents accept \ntheir financial obligations to support their children. This does not \nignore or discount the importance of emotional support from both \nparents. But realistically, the Federal Government is limited in its \nability to address parental involvement and emotional support. I \nsupport other legislation to encourage demonstrations projects to \nimprove meditation and visitation issues among parents as way to \nrespond to this other key facet.\n  But the Federal Government can have a major effect on child support \nenforcement and child support assurance. It must be involved because \nfamilies that do not get the child support payments they deserve, often \nturn to Federal assistance programs including Aid to Families with \nDependent Children [AFDC] and food stamps to make ends meet. Instead of \nallowing families to slip into dependency, I believe it would be better \nto invest in systems and incentives to collect the more than $30 \nbillion in unpaid child support.\n  I want to emphasize that this is a bipartisan idea intended to \npromote work and independence. In its 1991 report, ``Moving Ahead: \nInitiatives for Expanding Opportunity in America,'' the House Wednesday \nGroup recommended Federal funding for large-scale demonstrations of \nchild support assurance and time-limited welfare. The report notes \nthat:\n\n       Child support assurance has several attractive features. \n     First it is not welfare. The benefit would be universal; all \n     single-parent families would be eligible for the assured \n     benefit. For most families, the absent parent would pay more \n     than the assured benefit; the government would then recapture \n     its expenditure and the rest would be forwarded to the child. \n     For families in which the absent parent did not pay at least \n     the amount of the assured benefit, the government would pay \n     the amount guaranteed to the child and then attempt to recoup \n     its outlays by vigorous child support enforcement. One way to \n     think of the assured benefit, then, is government's \n     commitment to guarantee at least a given level of cash \n     support to all custodial parents.\n       The assured benefit can also be seen as a program that \n     encourages independence . . . The assured benefit is a \n     blanket of insulation between a single mother and dependency \n     on welfare. Equally important, unlike welfare payments, the \n     assured benefit may have the attractive feature of minimizing \n     work disincentive.\n\n  While noting some questions about child support assurance, the House \nWednesday Group did support a demonstration project to test the \npotential of this innovative concept. Other groups supporting our \nproposal include: the Center for Law and Social Policy, the Women's \nLegal Defense Fund, and the Children's Defense Fund.\n  Mr. President, as we consider dramatic reform of our welfare system, \nwe also should focus on child support enforcement and child support \nassurance as promising alternatives to promote responsibility and work \nover welfare and dependence.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 643. A bill to assist in implementing the plan of action adopted \nby the World Summit for Children; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n              WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Murray, the James P. Grant World Summit for Children \nImplementation Act of 1995.\n  This is a bill designed to help the United States implement its \ncommitment to our children and to children at risk throughout the \nworld.\n  In 1990, the United States and 158 other nations participated in the \nWorld Summit for Children at which they signed a plan of action setting \ngoals to be reached by the year 2000. Those goals were: To reduce child \ndeath rates by at least one-third; to reduce maternal deaths and child \nmalnutrition by one-half; to provide all children access to basic \neducation; to provide all families access to clean water, safe \nsanitation, and family planning information; and to reduce medical \ncosts for children.\n  Our legislation also urges full funding by the year 2001 for Head \nStart, a program that dramatically improves the performance of children \nin their early years in school.\n  Internationally, this bill would shift funds within the U.S. foreign \nassistance budget to meet the urgent needs of children. Specifically, \nit would increase allocations in foreign assistance for a few cost-\neffective programs: Child survival, basic education, nutrition \nprograms, UNICEF, AIDS prevention, CARE, refugee assistance, and family \nplanning.\n  If we are truly concerned about the kind of future we leave for our \nchildren, we must look beyond our borders to the world they will \ninherit as they come of age. If we want our Nation to be prosperous, we \nmust invest in our future. In times of fiscal restraint, it is more \nimportant than ever we clearly focus on our top priorities. Children, \nboth here and throughout the world, are the top priority.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, in introducing the James P. Grant World \nSummit for Children Implementation Act of 1995. I take this opportunity \nto commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue, and I am \nproud to be associated with this effort.\n  Because the nations of the world have become so interdependent, there \ncan be no doubt that the well-being of children around the globe \naffects us here in the United States. Children are the foundation of \nour society, of our economy, of our future.\n  It seems obvious, then, that we would provide adequately for the \nworld's children, but sadly we do not.\n  According to UNICEF, every week, more than 250,000 children die of \neasily preventable illness and malnutrition.\n  Every day, measles, whooping cough, and tetanus--all of which can be \nprevented by an inexpensive course of vaccines--kill nearly 8,000 \nchildren.\n  Every day, diarrheal dehydration--preventable at almost no cost--\nkills almost 7,000 children.\n  Every day, pneumonia--fully treatable by low-cost antibiotics--kills \nmore than 6,000 children.\n  And for every child that dies, several more live on with poor growth, \nill health, and diminished potential.\n  The world's political leadership can ill-afford to ignore these \nstatistics. We are all in this together. The success or failure of \neconomies thousands of miles away can directly affect us here at home. \nThis is especially true in my trade-dependent home State of Washington.\n  As the old saying goes, we are only as strong as our weakest link. If \nour trading partners in Asia or Latin America cannot provide the \nnecessary education or health care for their children, we will not have \nstrong partners to trade \n[[Page S4736]] with in the next generation. And in the end, alleviating \npoverty promotes economic development, which serves us all.\n  So it is extremely important that we continue to work to implement \nthe plan of action adopted at the 1990 U.N. World Summit for Children, \nwhich rightly placed the needs of children at the top of the world's \ndevelopment agenda.\n  That is why Senator Jeffords and I are introducing the James P. Grant \nWorld Summit for Children Implementation Act of 1995, legislation that \nsupports life-saving, cost-effective programs to protect the health and \nwell-being of children worldwide.\n  The world's children have a right to adequate nutrition, full \nimmunization, education, and health care. The United States must \ncontinue to lead the world in promoting that message.\n  To reach children, of course, we must reach out to the world's \nwomen--who are often overlooked in traditional development programs. \nFortunately, the World Summit for Children recognized that to improve \nthe lot of the world's children, the status of the world's women also \nhad to improve.\n  For example, recognizing the important link between child survival \nand family planning, the world summit for children called for universal \naccess to family planning education and services by the end of this \ndecade.\n  Family planning saves the lives of both women and children. We know \nthat babies born in quick succession, to a mother whose body has not \nyet recovered from a previous birth, are the least likely to survive. \nIncreasing funds in this area has been a top priority for me in my work \nin the U.S. Senate, and is addressed in the legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  I realize that in this current political climate, foreign aid is \noften under attack and misunderstood. While foreign aid has never been \npopular, it has always served our Nation well. The money needed to \nsupport the kinds of programs we are concerned about in this bill is \nnot large in the scope of our budget--indeed, our total foreign aid \nprogram represents less than 1 percent of our entire Federal budget. In \nmy view, our foreign aid dollars are best spent when we are investing \nin programs that strengthen families around the globe, and give a \nspecial helping hand to women and children.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and \nme in support of this important legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4717-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 5\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] and the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 5, a bill to clarify the war powers of Congress and \nthe President in the post-cold war period.\n\n\n                                 S. 254\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 254, a bill to extend \neligibility for veterans' burial benefits, funeral benefits, and \nrelated benefits for veterans of certain service in the United States \nmerchant marine during World War II.\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. Ford] and the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 256, a bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to \nestablish procedures for determining the status of certain missing \nmembers of the Armed Forces and certain civilians, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 442, a bill to improve and \nstrengthen the child support collection system, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 530\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 530, a bill to amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit State and local government \nworkers to perform volunteer services for their employer without \nrequiring the employer to pay overtime compensation, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the names of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott], the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], \nthe Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] were added as cosponsors of S. 539, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax exemption for \nhealth risk pools.\n\n\n                                 S. 565\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the names of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 565, a bill to regulate interstate commerce by \nproviding for a uniform product liability law, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 578\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] was added as a cosponsor of S. 578, a bill to limit \nassistance for Turkey under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the \nArms Export Control Act until that country complies with certain human \nrights standards.\n\n\n                                 S. 631\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, his name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 631, a bill to prevent handgun violence and illegal commerce in \nfirearms.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4736-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 95--RELATIVE TO COMMITTEE APPOINTMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.

MORATORIUM ON REGULATIONS; CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Reporting and Review of Regulations.--\n       (1) Reporting to congress.--\n       (A) Before a rule can take effect as a final rule, the \n     Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each \n     House of the Congress a report containing--\n       (i) a copy of the rule;\n       (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule;\n       (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule; and\n       (iv) a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the \n     rule, if any.\n       (B) Upon receipt, each House shall provide copies to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of each committee with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) Effective date of significant rules.--A significant \n     rule relating to a report submitted under paragraph (1) shall \n     take effect as a final rule, the latest of--\n       (A) the later of the date occurring 45 days after the date \n     on which--\n       (i) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     paragraph (1); or\n       (ii) the rule is published in the Federal Register;\n     [[Page S4737]]   (B) if the Congress passes a joint \n     resolution of disapproval described under section 4 relating \n     to the rule, and the President signs a veto of such \n     resolution, the earlier date--\n       (i) on which either House of Congress votes and fails to \n     override the veto of the President; or\n       (ii) occurring 30 session days after the date on which the \n     Congress received the veto and objections of the President; \n     or\n       (C) the date the rule would have otherwise taken effect, if \n     not for this section (unless a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 4 is enacted).\n       (3) Effective date for other rules.--Except for a \n     significant rule, a rule shall take effect as otherwise \n     provided by law after submission to Congress under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (b) Termination of Disapproved Rulemaking.--A rule shall \n     not take effect (or continue) as a final rule, if the \n     Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval described \n     under section 4.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--\n       (1) Presidential determinations.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section (except subject to paragraph (3)), \n     a rule that would not take effect by reason of this Act may \n     take effect, if the President makes a determination under \n     paragraph (2) and submits written notice of such \n     determination to the Congress.\n       (2) Grounds for determinations.--Paragraph (1) applies to a \n     determination made by the President by Executive order that \n     the rule should take effect because such rule is--\n       (A) necessary because of an imminent threat to health or \n     safety or other emergency;\n       (B) necessary for the enforcement of criminal laws; or\n       (C) necessary for national security.\n       (3) Waiver not to affect congressional disapprovals.--An \n     exercise by the President of the authority under this \n     subsection shall have no effect on the procedures under \n     section 4 or the effect of a joint resolution of disapproval \n     under this section. --\n       (d) Treatment of Rules Issued at End of Congress.--\n       (1) Additional opportunity for review.--In addition to the \n     opportunity for review otherwise provided under this Act, in \n     the case of any rule that is published in the Federal \n     Register (as a rule that shall take effect as a final rule) \n     during the period beginning on the date occurring 60 days \n     before the date the Congress adjourns sine die through the \n     date on which the succeeding Congress first convenes, section \n     4 shall apply to such rule in the succeeding Congress.\n       (2) Treatment under section 4.--\n       (A) In applying section 4 for purposes of such additional \n     review, a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be treated \n     as though--\n       (i) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the 15th \n     session day after the succeeding Congress first convenes; and\n       (ii) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect \n     the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that a report must be \n     submitted to Congress before a final rule can take effect.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--A rule described \n     under paragraph (1) shall take effect as a final rule as \n     otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of \n     this section).\n       (e) Treatment of Rules Issued Before This Act.--\n       (1) Opportunity for congressional review.--The provisions \n     of section 4 shall apply to any significant rule that is \n     published in the Federal Register (as a rule that shall take \n     effect as a final rule) during the period beginning on \n     November 20, 1994, through the date on which this Act takes \n     effect.\n       (2) Treatment under section 4.--In applying section 4 for \n     purposes of Congressional review, a rule described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated as though--\n       (A) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--The effectiveness \n     of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise \n     provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or \n     effect under section 4.\n       (f) Nullification of Rules Disapproved by Congress.--Any \n     rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or \n     effect by the enactment of a joint resolution under section 4 \n     shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect.\n       (g) No Inference to be Drawn Where Rules Not Disapproved.--\n     If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 4, no court or agency may infer any \n     intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the \n     Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term \"joint resolution\" means only a joint \n     resolution introduced after the date on which the report \n     referred to in section 3(a) is received by Congress the \n     matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: \n     ``That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the ____ \n     relating to ____, and such rule shall have no force or \n     effect.'' (The blank spaces being appropriately filled in.)\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) In general.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be referred to the committees in each House of Congress \n     with jurisdiction. Such a resolution may not be reported \n     before the eighth day after its submission or publication \n     date.\n       (2) Submission date.--For purposes of this subsection the \n     term ``submission or publication date'' means the later of \n     the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 3(a)(1); or\n       (B) the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n       (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which is referred a \n     resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported such \n     resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 20 \n     calendar days after the submission or publication date \n     defined under subsection (b)(2), such committee may be \n     discharged by the Majority Leader of the Senate or the \n     Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, as the case \n     may be, from further consideration of such resolution and \n     such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (d) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged \n     (under subsection (c)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the resolution, and all points of order \n     against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre \n     National Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with \n     Federal law;\n       (2) where suitable, 1 of the recognized multiple uses for \n     National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n       (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n     of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n     years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n     proper administration of National Forest System land and \n     resources;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits \n     authorizing grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of \n     National Forest System land;\n       (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n     by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n     expire by the end of 1996;\n       (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n     complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n     remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n     to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n     the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains \n     an appropriate use of the affected National Forest System \n     land;\n       (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n     permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n     as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n     to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit \n     holder's permitted livestock or base property by the end of \n     1996;\n       (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n       (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n     expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n     Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in \n     [[Page S4739]] compliance with the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 and other applicable laws (including \n     regulations) in a timely and efficient manner and enable the \n     Secretary to issue new term grazing permits, where \n     appropriate;\n       (10) for a small percentage of the grazing permits that \n     will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n     the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n     term grazing permits; and\n       (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n     of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n     essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a \n     timely manner for financial and other reasons.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that \n     grazing continues without interruption on National Forest \n     System land in a manner that provides long-term protection of \n     the environment and improvement of National Forest System \n     rangeland resources while also providing short-term certainty \n     to holders of expiring term grazing permits and purchasers of \n     a permit holder's permitted livestock or base property.\n\n     SEC. ____02.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $2.3 billion in budget authority and $0.4 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.8 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $8.2 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$238.7 billion. $2.3 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated March 13, 1995, there has been no action \nthat affects the current level of budget authority, outlays, or \nrevenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his principled stand on this issue and am pleased to join \nhim as an original cosponsor of Senate Resolution No. 91, which \ncondemns Turkey's invasion of Iraq.\n  On March 20, an estimated 35,000 Turkish troops poured across Iraq's \nnorthern border in a massive assault on the Kurdish guerrilla group \nknown as the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Although Turkish Prime \nMinister Tansu Ciller defended the invasion as a legitimate act of \nself-defense, the nature and extent of Turkey's invasion of northern \nIraq belie this assertion. Accordingly, this resolution calls on \nPresident Clinton to express strong opposition to Turkey's invasion and \nto request that the United Nations Security Council condemn the \ninvasion and seek an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Turkey's \nforces back to Turkey.\n  Turkey's invasion contradicts its obligations under the United \nNations Charter and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope which oblige Turkey to respect the territorial integrity of \nother states, and to support the human rights, fundamental freedoms, \nand the self-determination of all peoples.\n  I and many of my colleagues sympathize with Turkey's struggle to \ndefeat the Marxist PKK which has been engaged in a struggle for over a \ndecade to establish an independent Kurkish state and has adopted \nterrorism as the principle means toward that end. However, the nature \nand brutality of the tactics Prime Minister Ciller and the military \nhave adopted to combat the PKK are unacceptable, counterproductive, and \nunlikely to succeed.\n  The invasion, besides violating the fundamentals of international \nlaw, is likely to exacerbate the conflict rather than calm it. \nMoreover, Turkey's action seriously detracts from its standing in the \ninternational community. For a nation seeking to convince the world--\nand the European Union in particular--that it is committed to \ndemocracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, the invasion \nof Iraq and the ongoing military campaign to eliminate the PKK \nundermine Turkey's commitment to these principles and raises legitimate \nquestions about the nature and extent of our relationship with Turkey.\n  Turkey, I fear, has fallen victim to the temptation to combat \nterrorism with reciprocal and punitive acts of violence more \ndestructive than PKK acts of terrorism. The Turkish military has \nsystematically emptied Kurdish villages and uprooted many Kurdish \ncitizens from their homes. Human rights organizations have documented \nextensive human rights abuses, including torture and political \nassassination. The military's actions often wreak havoc and destruction \non innocent Kurds and provide an incentive for Kurds to support the \nPKK.\n  I fear that relations between our two nations will deteriorate unless \nTurkey takes demonstrable steps to improve its human rights record, \nabandon the military campaign, and seek alternative solutions to the \nKurdish problem. Turkey's recognition, that its Kurdish civilians have \ncivil, cultural, political, and human rights is an essential first \nstep. Failure to recognize these rights would be folly, for it is \nsimply inconceivable for Turkey, if it is to remain committed to the \nfundamentals of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human \nrights, to seek a military solution where one-fifth of the Turkish \npopulation--15 million--is Kurdish.\n  Turkey has long been a loyal and trusted allay and a valuable member \nof NATO. Like all nations, Turkey is struggling with the difficult task \nof defining its diplomatic, security, and economic roles in the post-\ncold-war era. This task is compounded by the need to combat PKK \nterrorism and the expansion of violent Islamic fundamentalism. However, \nthese challenges, difficult though they may be, in no way legitimize \nTurkey's invasion of northern Iraq, and the United States must make it \nclear to Turkey that such behavior is damaging to our relationship and \ninconsistent with the announced goals of democracy, human rights, and \nthe rule of law.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4741-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4741-S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS NOT IMMUNE FOREVER\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the interests of all Members \nof the House and Senate, I am sure, is to preserve Social Security. We \nmay differ on the avenue to achieve that, but we share that concern.\n  What should be clear to anyone who looks at the Social Security \nmatter with any serious concern is that the national debt is the threat \nto Social Security.\n  I have just finished reading an editorial column in Congressional \nQuarterly written by David S. Cloud, titled ``Social Security Funds Not \nImmune Forever.''\n  In that article he says what is the simple reality: ``The longer \nCongress and the White House delay dealing with the deficit, the \ngreater the threat to Social Security's long-term existence.''\n  No one can seriously question the validity of that statement.\n  I hope that sometime between now and the time this Congress adjourns, \nwe can get one more vote for the balanced budget amendment.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to print the complete David \nCloud editorial column in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n [[Page S4742]] CQ Roundtable--Social Security Funds Not Immune Forever\n\n                          (By David S. Cloud)\n\n       If Republicans and Democrats in Congress are as dedicated \n     to eliminating the federal deficit as they profess, someday \n     soon they will have to answer serious questions about the \n     future of Social Security. Otherwise, neither party's promise \n     to preserve Social Security--or to balance the budget--can be \n     considered altogether credible.\n        Congressional debates about Social Security center almost \n     entirely on charges that one party or the other is plotting \n     to deny benefits to retirees or is looting the trust funds of \n     payroll tax revenue. While deep cuts in Social Security are \n     certainly possible in coming years, it won't happen because \n     of some secret desire by elected officials; it will happen \n     because Congress is left with no other choice.\n       The relationship between Social Security and the deficit is \n     not obvious. Thanks to big payroll tax increases enacted in \n     1977 and 1983, Social Security recovered from near-bankruptcy \n     and is now taking in more revenue from workers' paychecks \n     than it pays out in benefits every year. The result is a \n     growing trust fund balance, expected to be about $900 billion \n     by 2000, that many view as a nest egg to pay benefits for \n     baby boomer retirees next century. The surplus is often used \n     as justification for leaving Social Security alone.\n       There are indeed good reasons to view Social Security as \n     unique. No other program has such a broad base or such a \n     strongly implied contract: Workers sacrifice now in the form \n     of payroll deductions for the security of benefits after they \n     retire. And the program has an uncontested record of sharply \n     reducing poverty among the elderly.\n       But defending Social Security in isolation from the rest of \n     the federal budget is as misleading as it is enticing. \n     Politicians are especially prone to try.\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has singled out Social \n     Security as the only program immune from cuts as Republicans \n     work to balance the budget by 2002. Senate Democrats recently \n     killed the constitutional amendment to require a balanced \n     budget after they failed to win special protections for \n     Social Security.\n       But all this ignores a central fact: It is unlikely that \n     the budget can be balanced without affecting a program that \n     now constitutes more than a fifth of federal spending.\n       Why can't Social Security be left alone as long as it is \n     self-financing? For openers, a program of Social Security's \n     immenity--$330 billion in fiscal 1994--consumes tax revenue \n     that could otherwise go toward reducing the deficit, if \n     Congress didn't have to keep payroll taxes at such high \n     levels to finance the Social Security system. Some of those \n     benefits are going to retirees who, by any definition, are \n     well-off. In 1990, families with income above $100,000 \n     received more than $8 billion in Social Security benefits.\n       The logic of capturing some of that money for deficit \n     reduction proved inescapable in 1993, when Congress raised \n     taxes on some upper-income retirees by taxing more of their \n     Social Security benefits. (House Republicans now want to \n     repeal that tax increase.) There seems to be no appetite for \n     undertaking a bolder attempt at scaling back Social Security \n     benefits among recipients further down the income scale. The \n     other option--increasing payroll taxes--does not seem likely.\n       Yet the longer Congress and the White House delay dealing \n     with the deficit, the greater the threat to Social Security's \n     long-term existence.\n       The reason rests with what is happening to all those \n     surplus dollars Social Security is now accumulating. The \n     trust funds are being invested in U.S. Treasury bonds, with \n     the promise that the money plus interest will be paid back \n     next century. In other words, the government is borrowing \n     from the Social Security trust funds and eventually will have \n     to repay those funds.\n       But continuation of massive borrowing from now until then \n     will only make it harder to repay the obligations when the \n     baby boomers retire.\n       When will this demongraphic crunch hit? Baby boomers will \n     begin to retire around 2010. According to the 1994 Social \n     Security Board of Trustees report, the trust funds will not \n     run dry until 2036, absent further congressional action. But \n     the fiscal strain will actually arrive much sooner--beginning \n     around 2013, when the Social Security system starts drawing \n     heavily on interest payments from the Treasury to pay for \n     benefits.\n       If the federal government is still running a deficit, \n     making those interest payments to the Social Security trust \n     funds will necessitate a massive addition to government \n     borrowing, or a big income tax increase.\n       All of the choices will be unappetizing--a mountain of \n     additional debt, angry workers asked to more heavily \n     subsidize retirees, or sharp cuts in Social Security \n     benefits. And any effort by today's politicians to segregate \n     Social Security from the rest of the budget will matter not a \n     whit.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4741-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                STEWART L. BELL: A NEW FACE IN POLITICS\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to rise today \nto congratulate a good friend of mine and of the State of Nevada for a \nlifetime of outstanding achievement, Clark County District Attorney \nStewart Bell.\n  Stew Bell has been a resident of southern Nevada since 1954. He \ngraduated from Western High School with honors in 1963 while also \ndistinguishing himself as the Nevada State High School Mathematics \nChampion. In 1967, he graduated with distinction from the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas and, 3 years later, was awarded a Juris Doctorate \nfrom UCLA.\n  He returned to Las Vegas to work in the Clark County Public \nDefender's Office and, in 1973, he went into private practice and \nbecame a senior partner of one of the State's most prestigious firms.\n  Throughout his entire legal career, Stew Bell has distinguished \nhimself as an outstanding trial attorney, defending thousands of \ncriminal, civil, business, and domestic cases. He is one of the few \nattorneys to receive the Martindale-Hubbell A V Rating, the highest \npossible attorney rating for professional competence and ethics.\n  In addition to professional achievements, Stew Bell has also been a \ncommitted leader in the legal and civic community of Nevada. He has \nserved as president and vice president of both the Nevada bar and the \nClark County Bar Associations, on numerous State legal panels, as a \ncourt appointed special prosecutor, and as an alternate municipal judge \nand juvenile court referee.\n  Stew has also contributed hundreds of hours to youth programs such as \nthe Variety Club for Handicapped Children, the Boys and Girls Club, and \nthe Vegas Girls Soccer League. His list of civic achievements is too \nlengthy to enumerate, and I have always been amazed at his ability to \njuggle his civic, church, family, and professional responsibilities. \nYet he has always done so with energy, enthusiasm, and zest.\n  A dedicated family man, Stew is married to Jeanne Bell and together, \nthey have raised four wonderful children: Linda, a recent graduate of \nthe University of San Diego School of Law; Kristen, who is currently \nattending the University of Nevada, Reno; Stephen, a student at Bonanza \nHigh School, and Greg, who is attending Cashman Junior High.\n  Last year, Stew Bell entered into his first political campaign, for \nthe prestigious position of district attorney for Clark County. Because \nof his ernest reputation and his commitment to hard work, Stew was able \nto win the election handily.\n  On Sunday, April 2, the Paradise Democratic Club will be honoring \nStewart Bell with the ``Outstanding Democrat of the Year Award.'' I can \nthink of no one more deserving of this award. Stew Bell represents all \nthat is good about public service, and he is an excellent role model \nfor the children and adults of our State.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4742-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4742-S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            PERSPECTIVE: BACKS DR. HENRY FOSTER'S NOMINATION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the President of the United States \nhas nominated Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  I have had the chance to visit with him and see him at one public \nmeeting in action, and I have been favorably impressed.\n  I believe there has been great distortion of who he is and what he \nstands for.\n  I was interested in seeing in the Chicago Defender the other day, a \nstatement by the president of Fisk University on the Henry Foster \nnomination.\n  Because of its insights, I ask that the statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The statement follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Defender, Mar. 13, 1995]\n\n                  Backs Dr. Henry Foster's Nomination\n\n                         (By Dr. Henry Ponder)\n\n       I support Dr. Henry Foster's nomination to become the next \n     surgeon general of the United States.\n       I would speak against the three most-mentioned reasons why \n     he should not be confirmed. They are: (1) the number of \n     abortion procedures he has performed over the last 30 years; \n     (2) his integrity; and (3) the bungling of his nomination by \n     the White House.\n       Regarding the first point, it is yet to be proven that \n     Foster committee any crime or illegalities in the years that \n     he has practiced medicine as one of America's premier board-\n     certified obstetrician/gynecologists.\n       It must be reiterated that abortion is not considered \n     illegal in America for, under Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court \n     has ruled that abortion procedures performed by a doctor, \n     [[Page S4743]] however abhorrent and immoral it is to a \n     sizable portion of Americans, is still constitutionally \n     acceptable. Until that ruling is reversed, Foster and any \n     number of other doctors will not be in violation of the law.\n       Ironically, Foster pointed out recently on ``Nightline'' \n     with Ted Koppel, that he ``abhors abortion.'' In cases which \n     he had to perform abortion procedures, he said they were only \n     ``for rape, incest and saving the life of the mother.'' \n     Should a man be castigated for something his society allows \n     or permits as lawful, or should his society confer good \n     behavior upon him for being law-abiding? I think rational men \n     and women would agree with the latter rather than the former.\n       It can be clearly shown that Foster has done nothing wrong, \n     illegal or unconstitutional. He has stayed within the \n     confines of his professional ethical code and parameters and \n     societal jurisprudence. He should be commended and not \n     assailed.\n       The second issue being used to stop Foster's nomination is \n     integrity. It is said that, at different times. Foster said \n     he performed about 12, 39 or some 700 abortions over the last \n     30 years. Foster said that he misspoke about the number of \n     abortion procedures he has performed in his career. How many \n     of us have not misspoken and corrected ourselves when we \n     learned the facts?\n       I think the worst kind of man is the one who refuses upon \n     learning he is mistaken to correct himself. Foster, before \n     the nation and on ``Nightline,'' stated that upon reflection \n     and in hindsight, he should have consulted his records more \n     thoroughly about it. When Foster had the chance to reexamine \n     his files, he, as any man with integrity will do, correct \n     himself and apologized for the error.\n       This should not taint one's character. It should rather \n     brighten it. But, unfortunately, in today's America, \n     contrition on the part of anyone is a sign of ``a damaged \n     good'' that is irreparable.\n       Even the good book, the Holy Bible, says that one should be \n     forgiven in their contrition. Integrity to me is being able \n     to say you are wrong when you discover that you are.\n       Foster should not be raked over the coals for admitting \n     error, if in the process, he sets his records straight.\n       Thirdly, there is no question that the White House bungled \n     this nomination. They have said as much. this whole affair \n     could have been handled better in a straight and clearer \n     manner by presenting Foster as a nationally renowned medical \n     practitioner who, over 30 years, has performed abortion \n     procedures to save the life of the mother, or due to rape or \n     incest. It would also have been communicated that he abhors \n     abortions and only performed them under the rarest of such \n     cases.\n       I accept the statements by the president's staff that they \n     made a mistake in handling the nomination and concur with \n     them that the strong credentials Foster brings to the \n     position of surgeon general outweighs presidential staff \n     bungling and error or at worst misjudgment.\n       I wholeheartedly support foster's nomination and I ask the \n     Senate to confirm him and for the country to stand by the \n     president's excellent choice. He shouldn't be punished or \n     scapegoated for the controversy and the tensions that \n     abortion brings to the political arena for there are rational \n     people on both sides of the battle.\n       Better yet, there are some who are working to eliminate at \n     the root, the instances that lead to teenage pregnancy. \n     Foster is a general in this army and he deserves to be \n     confirmed as surgeon general.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4742-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4743-S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently returned from a short \nvisit to Ireland, Northern Ireland, and London, England, where I met \nwith government officials and representatives of the political parties \nin Northern Ireland, on developments in the peace process there. This \nis an exciting time in Northern Ireland, where a ceasefire is holding \nfor the first time in a quarter century. I ask that the report of my \ntrip be printed in the Record.\n  The report follows:\n\n   Codel Leahy--Trip Report, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, \n                        England, February 17-21\n\n       From February 17-21, I traveled to the Republic of Ireland, \n     Northern Ireland, and London, England, to meet with leaders \n     of Irish and British Governments and representatives of the \n     political parties in Northern Ireland, and to observe the use \n     of funds administered by the International Fund for Ireland \n     (IFI). In London, in addition to meeting with British and \n     American officials on developments in Northern Ireland, I \n     also discussed efforts to limit the proliferation and use of \n     antipersonnel landmines. I was accompanied by Tim Rieser and \n     Kevin McDonald of my personal staff. Travel was by commercial \n     air and rental car.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       I have closely followed the situation in Northern Ireland \n     for many years. I was among those who last year urged \n     President Clinton to grant Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, \n     the political arm of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a visa \n     to travel to the US. That decision is widely credited with \n     having led to the IRA ceasefire and the peace process that is \n     now unfolding.\n       The timing of this trip was important because of \n     developments in Northern Ireland since the December 1993 \n     Joint Declaration between former Irish Prime Minister \n     Reynolds and British Prime Minister Majors. That Declaration \n     initiated the latest attempt to resolve the Northern Ireland \n     conflict which has claimed over 3,200 lives in the past 25 \n     years. Most importantly, the two leaders agreed that any \n     change in the status of the North could only occur with the \n     consent of a majority of the people there.\n       In August 1994, shortly after Gerry Adams received a visa \n     to visit the US, the IRA announced a unilateral cease-fire \n     which led to October cease-fires by Protestant paramilitary \n     groups. Since then, informal talks have been conducted \n     between the Irish Government and Sinn Fein. I arrived in the \n     Republic just six days before the publication of a \n     controversial ``Framework Document,'' which contains \n     proposals put forth jointly by Irish and British Governments \n     aimed at bringing about a permanent settlement of the \n     conflict.\n\n\n                                 dublin\n\n       Meeting with Tainiste Dick Spring: I arrived in Dublin on \n     February 17. Senator George Mitchell, who last December was \n     appointed the President's Special Advisor on Economic \n     Initiatives in Ireland, was also in Dublin that day \n     accompanied by a delegation of officials from the White House \n     and Commerce Department, and our two delegations met over \n     lunch with Tainiste Dick Spring. Our discussions focused on \n     the Framework Document, which Tainiste Spring has had a \n     central role in negotiating, and plans for the May 1995 Trade \n     and Investment Conference.\n       Representatives of the Irish and American business \n     communities, and the political parties, will meet in \n     Washington over a three day period to discuss potential \n     American-Irish joint ventures and other investment \n     opportunities in the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n       There is universal agreement among all factions that \n     economic development, especially in areas of high \n     unemployment in the North, is key to any lasting peace since \n     there is a direct correlation between high levels of \n     unemployment and violence. There is also widespread \n     recognition of the crucial role that the United States can \n     play in promoting economic investment. Four areas with high \n     potential have already been identified: tourism, food \n     processing; pharmaceuticals; and telecommunications.\n       Senator Mitchell, after quoting President Franklin \n     Roosevelt that ``the best social program is a job,'' stressed \n     that this is to be an economic conference, not a political \n     conference, although it is inevitable that politics will play \n     a part. Ireland has much to recommend it, including its \n     highly trained, English-speaking workforce and location at \n     the gateway to 350 million European consumers. Setting up \n     follow-up mechanisms to assist potential investors will be \n     particularly important. Senator Mitchell and I stressed that \n     while the U.S. can help facilitate investment in Northern \n     Ireland, this is a long-term endeavor which depends on the \n     sustained efforts of all the people on the island.\n       There was also a general discussion about the important \n     role the International Fund for Ireland has played in \n     bringing economic development to disadvantaged areas during a \n     period when the Northern Ireland violence caused many \n     potential investors to go elsewhere.\n       Address to peace and Reconciliation Forum: Shortly after \n     the IRA cease-fire, the Irish Government initiated a ``Peace \n     and Reconciliation Forum'' as a way to quickly bring Sinn \n     Fein into informal discussions with the government and other \n     political parties. Although the Unionist parties complained \n     that the Forum was an Irish Government affair and declined to \n     participate, the Forum has provided a bridge between the \n     cease-fire and formal all-party talks which are anticipated \n     in the future.\n       Senator Mitchell and I were each invited to address the \n     Forum, which is held each Friday at Dublin Castle. Among the \n     audience of approximately two hundred were Tainiste Spring of \n     the Irish Government, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, and John \n     Alderdice of the Alliance Party. After introductions by Forum \n     Chair Judge Catherine McGinness and Ambassador Jean Kennedy \n     Smith, I explained that I had come at this pivotal time to \n     give encouragement to all the parties involved in the peace \n     process, and to emphasize that the United States would fully \n     support their efforts in an even-handed way. I stressed that \n     the Framework Document, portions of which had been leaked to \n     the press and were already the focus of much debate and \n     intense criticism from Unionists, should be treated as a \n     discussion document rather than a final blueprint. I said \n     that as long as it was based on the principle of consent, it \n     should threaten no one.\n       Senator Mitchell, who was in the final day of his visit, \n     described the strong desire he had sensed among the people \n     for a better life and the importance of moving quickly to \n     attract economic investment. He noted that the majority of \n     the 44 million Irish immigrants in the U.S. are non-\n     Catholics, and that economic hardship in Northern Ireland is \n     felt by both Catholics and Protestants. He mentioned several \n     items that will be on the May conference agenda, including: \n     establishment of U.S.-owned plants; support for community \n     banking; tax free regimes for U.S. investors; duty free \n     status for Irish imports; addressing the problem of under-\n     represented \n     [[Page S4744]] communities in the workforce; the problem of \n     dual currencies in North an South; and the MacBride \n     principles.\n       Our speeches were followed by a general discussion among \n     the participants, which included several appreciative \n     comments about the important role of the United States in \n     moving the peace process forward.\n       Meeting with Taoiseach John Bruton: Although there was some \n     initial speculation in the press that Taoiseach Bruton might \n     not be as seized with the peace process as his predecessor, \n     he has won praise for keeping the process moving steadily \n     forward. Senator Mitchell and I met privately with the \n     Taoiseach for approximately 45 minutes. We discussed the \n     Framework Document and events leading up to it, and how he \n     thought it would be received. We also emphasized President \n     Clinton's strong, personal interest in the peace process and \n     the importance of pressing ahead despite Unionist threats to \n     boycott the talks.\n       Dinner hosted by Ambassador Smith: A dinner hosted by the \n     Ambassador included Judge Catherine McGinness, Senator \n     Maurice Manning, Reverend Roy Magee, and Dr. Martin Mansergh, \n     all of whom have had a role in the peace process. I discussed \n     the British Government's demand that the IRA decommission \n     some of its weapons before Sinn Fein is rewarded with a seat \n     at the negotiating table. The general view was that Prime \n     Minister Major has backed away from this position somewhat, \n     recognizing that the IRA is unlikely to respond favorably at \n     this point and that it would be a mistake to link further \n     progress in the peace talks to this single issue. The point \n     was made that turning over weapons by one side has never \n     happened in Irish history, and that the aim should be to keep \n     the dialogue moving forward. The issue of disarmament by all \n     parties will be dealt with in the process of the talks. \n     (Since my return, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, in response \n     to President Clinton's decision to permit him to raise\n      funds in the United States, agreed to discuss the issue of \n     disarmament with the British Government at the ministerial \n     level. Although the President's decision was criticized by \n     British officials, I am hopeful that it will lead to \n     further progress towards peace which would be to \n     everyone's advantage.)\n       The Northern Ireland conflict has been winding down since \n     about 1989. The IRA concluded that violence was accomplishing \n     very little, and that the political process might offer more. \n     On the other hand, the Unionists, lacking imaginative and \n     dynamic leadership, have lost touch with the people, who \n     desperately want peace. But while the war is over, the guns \n     are not going to be relinquished immediately. As the British \n     move their troops out, the IRA and Protestant paramilitary \n     groups will surrender their weapons incrementally as further \n     progress is made towards a final peace agreement. It was also \n     suggested that the British Government exaggerated the amount \n     of weapons possessed by the IRA to suit their own ends, and \n     it also coincidently benefitted the IRA. Now it is a problem \n     for both, and there is no way to prove how many weapons they \n     have. Giving up a small amount of semtex to a third party \n     such as the United Nations or the United States, as I and \n     others have suggested, would be a positive gesture that could \n     help build confidence.\n       Meeting with former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds: Without the \n     forceful leadership of former Taoiseach Reynolds it is \n     doubtful that there would be a cease-fire or peace process \n     today. Reynolds told me that the Unionists, who claim they \n     were not consulted on the text of the Framework Document, had \n     significant input into the 1993 Joint Declaration. Reynolds \n     said it was his idea to replace Article 3 of the Irish \n     Constitution, which contains Britain's claim of sovereignty \n     over Northern Ireland, with the principle of consent. The aim \n     was to shift responsibility for the status of the North to a \n     majority of the people there. This was a crucial initiative \n     that has become the cornerstone of the Framework Document.\n       Reynolds described the future as unpredictable. The \n     demographics of the North are changing. Today, 57 percent are \n     Protestant, down from 63 percent a decade ago. In another \n     generation the majority may be Catholic. But not all \n     Catholics want to be part of the Republic.\n       Reynolds said that both sides accept the reality that the \n     weapons will have to be surrendered, but it will take time. \n     As the process develops it will become less of an issue. He \n     said the IRA will never turn over their weapons to the \n     British, since it would imply surrender. It will have to be \n     to a third party. Reynolds said United States support for the \n     peace process has been critical. He said the decision to \n     grant Adams a visa was what led to the cease-fire, but that \n     there was no way Adams would or could renounce terrorism at \n     that time and that anyone who thought so was naive. He agreed \n     with the view that the Unionist leadership is out of touch. \n     They never thought a cease-fire would happen, and in the \n     unlikely event that it did they assumed it would be short-\n     lived. They have not thought about what they would do in the \n     absence of violence, and were unprepared for the situation \n     they now find themselves in.\n\n\n                                belfast\n\n       The trip from Dublin to Belfast was notable for the \n     dramatic change that has occurred at the border, where just \n     six months ago a British military checkpoint slowed traffic \n     to a crawl and subjected travelers to close scrutiny by armed \n     soldiers and searches of any suspicious vehicles. Today, the \n     checkpoint is unmanned and vehicles pass through without \n     delay. Although British military observation posts still \n     protrude from the tops of hills, the military presence \n     generally is far from what it was. In Belfast, where armored \n     troop carriers and helmeted troops regularly patrolled the \n     streets in large numbers, daytime patrols there have ended. \n     British troops now wear berets instead of helmets.\n       The reduced British military presence in Northern Ireland \n     has won wide acclaim from Catholics. However, the day before \n     I arrived in Northern Ireland heavily armed British troops \n     conducted a raid in the IRA-stronghold are of Crossmaglen \n     near the border, which drew strong criticism from Sinn Fein \n     as well as Irish Government officials, who felt that the eve \n     of publication of the Framework Document was a time for both \n     sides to show restraint.\n       Dairy Farm IFI Project: Shortly after arriving in Belfast I \n     toured the `Dairy Farm'' shopping center with International \n     Fund for Ireland Chairman Willie McCarter, and IFI Joint \n     Directors General Chris Todd and Brendan Scannell. The \n     center, located in a Catholic area of West Belfast, is a \n     community-owned project developed with $3.8 million from the \n     IFI. It includes a retail complex with a large supermarket, \n     multi-purpose civic center, library, retail units, and \n     service businesses that have brought life to a depressed \n     community that lacked any of these facilities.\n       In later meetings with IFI officials, I discussed past \n     management problems with the Fund and reports that the House \n     and Senate Budget Committees have proposed to eliminate \n     United States funding for the IFI in FY 1996. They assured me \n     that the IFI is no longer financing golf courses and other \n     kinds of projects that drew past criticism, including from \n     myself. It targets disadvantaged communities, Catholic and \n     Protestant, in the North and in border counties in the \n     Republic. Since its inception a decade ago, the IFI, with \n     total contributions of about $400 million from the US and the \n     European Community, has leveraged twice that amount in \n     private sector investment. These funds have\n      been used to support economic regeneration projects in some \n     300 communities.\n       I pointed out that whether or not there is an earmark for \n     the IFI in the foreign aid appropriation, the President has \n     said he will provide a $30 million contribution to it in each \n     of FY 1996 and FY 1997, a $10 million increase from FY 1995. \n     IFI officials, and indeed everyone I spoke to in Dublin, \n     Belfast and London concerned with the situation in Northern \n     Ireland, argued persuasively that continued United States \n     funding is an important measure of its support for the peace \n     process.\n       Comber Orange Lodge: In preparation for my visit to \n     Northern Ireland, I requested the opportunity to speak to a \n     Unionist audience. Arrangements were made for me to address \n     the Orange Order in Comber, a middle-class community near \n     Belfast. The Orange Order is the oldest and largest \n     Protestant organization in Northern Ireland, with over 80,000 \n     active members, and some 4,000 members in the Republic. They \n     regard themselves as British subjects and are intensely pro-\n     Unionist.\n       My purpose in addressing the Orange Order was, as an Irish \n     American Catholic, to attempt to counter the impression that \n     the United States Government, and especially Irish American \n     Catholics like myself, seek a particular outcome in the \n     North. I stressed that the United States has one goal only, \n     peace, and that it will support the peace process even-\n     handedly. I expressed support for the principle that the \n     status of the North should not change without the consent of \n     a majority of its people. I also stressed the importance of \n     protecting the civil rights of all people, majority and \n     minority.\n       Several people in the audience vigorously criticized the \n     Framework Document. I responded that rather than reject a \n     document that has not yet been published, they should look \n     towards bringing their ideas and concerns to the negotiating \n     table and to treat the Framework for what it is, a discussion \n     paper rather than a final settlement.\n       Unionists fear that the British Government's real purpose \n     in seeking a resolution to the Northern Ireland conflict is \n     to abandon them, and they see the United States as part of a \n     pro-Nationalist plot. They fear being isolated--foresaken by \n     Britain and unwilling to become Irish. Lacking dynamic and \n     imaginative leadership, they are at risk of history passing \n     them by. Many long for a past that never was, dream of a \n     future that never would be, and they fear a present they do \n     not understand.\n       Members of the Comber Orange Lodge were impassioned, but \n     respectful. They claimed to support tolerance and jobs for \n     all people, and pointed out that many Protestants are as bad \n     off as Catholics. Several complained about not being able to \n     interest the US media in their cause, although they refuse \n     the press access to their own meetings.\n       Meeting with Gerry Adams: I spent about an hour with Gerry \n     Adams. I commended the efforts he, John Hume and Albert \n     Reynolds have made to seize this opportunity for peace. We \n     discussed Adams' request to raise funds in the United States, \n     which at the time was under consideration by the Clinton \n     Administration. He felt that British opposition to it was \n     nothing more than an effort to control the peace talks, since \n     it is even inconsistent with their own policy of letting him \n     raise funds there. He added that Sinn \n     [[Page S4745]] Fein can already raise funds in the United \n     States, only he and certain other leaders are banned from \n     doing so. I told him that the fundraising issue is an issue \n     primarily because the British have made it one.\n       Adams said the United States contribution to the IFI \n     enables the Administration and the Congress to speak with \n     credibility on the peace process. He added that the Catholics \n     were organized and ready to make proposals to the Fund, \n     unlike the Protestants, but that Protestant leaders have \n     since been impressed by the Fund's accomplishments.\n       Adams raised the case of an IRA prisoner in Tucson, \n     Arizona, who is charged with buying explosive detonators. He \n     expressed concern about the conditions of his imprisonment.\n       Meeting with West Belfast Catholics: On Sunday morning, \n     after meeting with Sister Mary Turley and Father Myles \n     Kavanaugh of the Flax Trust, which like the IFI funds \n     projects in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Belfast, I met \n     with a group of Catholic community workers in West Belfast. \n     Geraldine McAteer, the spokesperson for the group, explained \n     that they work in both Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods. \n     She said there was a great desire for peace, and that with \n     the ceasefire they were finally able to stop living in fear \n     of seeing their children beaten or killed. She said people of \n     both traditions want equal social and cultural rights. She \n     emphasized the importance of equal self-esteem. She said \n     Unionists should be able to act British if they choose, and \n     Nationalists should be able to act and feel Irish. She said \n     there is room on the island for both, and that both have much \n     in common.\n       We talked about why there was a sense that this time the \n     conflict might really be over. They said that working class \n     Protestants have come to recognize that although they always \n     thought being tied to Britain would make them better off, it \n     has not turned out that way. Their kids are doing worse in \n     school than Catholics. They said the Unionists need to learn \n     to fend for themselves, because the government is not going \n     to do it for them. Catholics realized that a long time ago.\n       They said the Unionists fear that a united Irish Catholic \n     majority would mistreat them as they have mistreated the \n     Catholic minority in the North. At the same time, when they \n     as Catholics imagine a united Ireland, they become concerned \n     about being part of a religious state. They favor separation \n     between church and state, and the right of all to worship as \n     they please.\n       Ms. McAteer mentioned the planned construction of a public \n     university on land within their community, funded in part \n     with K5 million from the IFI. She expressed support for the \n     project because of the economic benefits it will bring, but \n     concern that too little has been done to involve community \n     members in the planning of the project. She fears that many \n     of the high paying jobs will go to outsiders, and local \n     people will be left only the menial jobs. I later conveyed \n     her concern to IFI Chairman Willie McCarter.\n\n\n                                 london\n\n       Meeting with Ambassador William Crowe and Under Secretary \n     Peter Tarnoff: At an evening meeting with Ambassador Crowe \n     and Under Secretary Tarnoff, we discussed a wide range of \n     issues including Northern Ireland and the problem of the \n     proliferation of antipersonnel landmines. The issue of Gerry \n     Adams' request to raise funds in the United States came up, \n     and the Ambassador expressed concern that the IRA has done \n     nothing since the cease-fire to enhance confidence in its \n     commitment to peace. Ambassador Crowe also expressed concern \n     about the landmine problem and described some of his own \n     experiences with landmines in combat.\n       Meeting with Under Secretary Sir Timothy Daunt: I met for \n     approximately 90 minutes with Under Secretary Daunt and three \n     members of his staff on funding for UN peacekeeping \n     operations, international efforts to stop the proliferation \n     and use of antipersonnel landmines, and developments in \n     Northern Ireland.\n       Sir Timothy and his staff expressed alarm at proposals \n     under consideration in Congress which would have the effect \n     of drastically reducing United States funding for UN \n     peacekeeping operations. They specifically mentioned \n     legislation that would apply the cost of in-kind \n     contributions, such as transport costs and materiel, towards \n     UN assessments. They said the effect of this, if applied to \n     Britain, would be that the UN would owe Britain hundreds of \n     millions of dollars it does not have and UN peacekeeping \n     would quickly end. The logical results would be greater \n     direct United States military involvement in regional \n     peacekeeping activities. I told them that I agreed that these \n     proposals are misguided, and that what is needed is a \n     permanent UN logistical force that can respond to \n     humanitarian crises without unnecessary delay.\n       On the subject of landmines, Sir Timothy said that Britain \n     and the US are near agreement on a comprehensive agreement \n     (``control regime'') on the production, use and transfer of \n     antipersonnel landmines. He said Britain accepts elimination \n     of antipersonnel landmines as the final goal. They favor \n     restructuring landmine stockpiles in favor of mines that \n     self-destruct or deactivate within 48-72 hours, if they are \n     not in marked and guarded minefields.\n       I explained the problems posed by such an approach, namely, \n     that they do not always self-destruct and that it assures the \n     continued use of non-self-destruct mines by countries that \n     cannot afford the more expensive alternative. Sir Timothy \n     said that while Britain recognizes these arguments, which are \n     also put forward by certain Members of Parliament and \n     nongovernmental organizations, the government continues to \n     regard landmines as a legitimate and necessary weapon. He \n     said that in the future there may be alternatives and changes \n     in military strategy, but that elimination of these weapons \n     is not feasible in the short or medium term. He added that \n     the British military believes they can assure a failure rate \n     of self-destruct mines of not more than 1/1000. I said that \n     while the United States and British Governments can say they \n     will use only self-destruct mines, Third World governments \n     will be unmoved. They are not going to declare war against \n     either of our countries, but they are going to keep using \n     them against their own people and their neighbors.\n       The British officials expressed concern that insurgent \n     groups would not comply with a complete ban on antipersonnel \n     mines. I said that while there will always be some who ignore \n     a ban, if the use of landmines is treated as a war crime they \n     will be rarely used. This is what we have seen with chemical \n     weapons. Sir Timothy said they are afraid to take an ``all or \n     nothing approach'' that could jeopardize support in the Third \n     World for less drastic measures. I pointed out that the \n     approach being advanced involves an elaborate, largely \n     unenforceable scheme that will not solve the problem.\n       The subject of demining was discussed. I was told that \n     Britain has contributed K7 million towards this effort, and \n     that 67 British troops are involved in training deminers in \n     Cambodia. While this is important, all agreed it was a far \n     cry from what is needed.\n       Finally, we discussed the Northern Ireland situation. Sir \n     Timothy spoke of the strong sense of alienation felt by \n     Unionists in the North. He said the overwhelming majority of \n     people in Britain want to get out, but they also have a sense \n     of responsibility that is reflected in the K4.5 billion in \n     aid Britain sends to Northern Ireland annually.\n       Meeting with Member of Parliament Paul Murphy: Paul Murphy \n     is\n      the Labour Party's chief spokesman on Northern Ireland. He \n     began the meeting by describing his contacts with leaders \n     of Sinn Fein, who he said are skillful and well-informed, \n     if somewhat unsure of how to proceed. They clearly want to \n     get back into the political process, and are anxious to be \n     treated as politicians although they control only 8-12 \n     percent of the vote. He said Sinn Fein is a growing \n     political threat to John Hume's Social Democratic and \n     Labour Party. He said he is encouraged that Protestant \n     gunmen have also spoken about the need to solve social \n     problems. The armed groups have become used to peace, to \n     being able to walk around without fear. He believes that \n     anyone who threatens that will be harshly criticized.\n       I told Murphy that I was very impressed with Prime Minister \n     Major's leadership on the Northern Ireland issue, and Murphy \n     confirmed that the British Labour Party fully supports the \n     British government's policy. He said both have strong \n     Unionists in their ranks, but agree on the principles in the \n     Framework Document. He added that there may be some \n     disagreement over the pace of moving ahead. He said the \n     Ulster Unionist Party is facing a successionist vote, and \n     that it's current head, James Molyneaux, may resign in favor \n     of David Trimble who has been a vocal opponent of the \n     Framework. He said no Unionist can embrace any kind of ``all \n     Ireland'' structures, although the obvious and intelligent \n     solution is to have one approach in such areas as energy, \n     tourism, trade, and agriculture. He said he understands the \n     Unionists' fear of being absorbed into a theocracy, but \n     questioned why they are so upset when they know the Framework \n     enshrines the principle of consent and they constitute a \n     majority. He said the Unionists will complain about the \n     Framework but they will be under considerable pressure from \n     their constituents, who want peace, to join the process.\n       We discussed the issue of Gerry Adams' request to raise \n     funds in the United States. Murphy said he has no objection \n     to this as long as the proceeds are not used to buy weapons. \n     We also discussed the need for reform of the Royal Ulster \n     Constabulary, the Protestant police force in Belfast which is \n     hated and feared by Catholics. Murphy said that any Catholic \n     who joined the RUC would be killed. Sinn Fein favors \n     disbanding the RUC and creating a new, united police force \n     for the whole island.\n       Meeting with Minister of State Tony Baldry: Minister \n     Baldry's portfolio includes North America, foreign \n     assistance, and international counternarcotics programs. We \n     discussed recent changes in the Congress, and the need for \n     more interaction between legislators from our two countries. \n     We also discussed Northern Ireland, and the use of the \n     British Virgin Islands as a transhipment point by narcotics \n     traffickers.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       The single most compelling message I heard from the people \n     of the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was that they are \n     done with violence, and that anyone who returns to violence \n     would be condemned by a majority of people of both \n     traditions. I could feel an intense desire on the island to \n     find a way for both Catholics and Protestants to coexist. \n     However, I also sensed that some Unionists, who have \n     willingly seen themselves as British subjects their whole \n     lives, are so \n     [[Page S4746]] fearful that their way of life is coming to an \n     end that they could ignite renewed violence if they are not \n     reassured otherwise.\n       Despite this danger, I was very impressed with the momentum \n     the peace process has gained. The visionary leadership of \n     John Hume coupled with the courageous decision of British \n     Prime Minister Major, former Irish Prime Minister Reynolds, \n     and Prime Minister Bruton, to seize this opportunity, have \n     constructed a process that I am optimistic will lead to \n     lasting peace.\n       The much-anticipated Framework Document was published the \n     day after I arrived back in Washington, where it was very \n     well received. Since then, President Clinton has agreed to \n     permit Gerry Adams to raise funds in the United States, and \n     Adams responded by declaring his readiness to discuss the \n     decommissioning of arms with the British Government. The \n     British Government reciprocated by withdrawing 400 of its \n     troops from Northern Ireland. Ministerial level talks between \n     Britain and Sinn Fein are expected soon. I believe this is \n     crucial to reassuring Unionists that they will not be left \n     defenseless to a renewed IRA threat.\n       The role of the United States in this effort cannot be \n     overstated. After a somewhat inauspicious beginning, the \n     International Fund for Ireland has served a vital role in \n     creating jobs--29,000 at last count, and bringing hope to \n     hundreds of the most depressed communities, both Catholic and \n     Protestant, in Northern Ireland and the border countries of \n     the Republic. The IFI is clearly a short-term solution. If \n     peace takes hold, private investment should replace the IFI \n     as the engine of economic development within two or three \n     years. Until then, the IFI is an important symbol of U.S. \n     support for the peace process and a tangible way to support \n     that process during this fragile period.\n       In addition, President Clinton's willingness to take \n     political risks that the Irish and British Governments were \n     either unwilling or unable to take themselves, has made an \n     enormous difference. My hope is that my reinforcing his \n     message in Dublin, Belfast and London I was able to give some \n     added impetus towards lasting peace in the land of my \n     father's father.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4743-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           REGULATORY REFORM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the March 6, 1995 edition of the New \nYorker included a thoughtful piece on regulatory reform by James Kunen. \nHe recalls the history that led to the enactment of laws and agency \nregulations designed to protect the public from unsafe foods and warns \nagainst regulatory reforms that will doom us to repeat that history.\n  This article deserves the attention of the Senate as we prepare for \nthe upcoming debate on regulatory reform so I ask that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the New Yorker, Mar. 6, 1995]\n\n                  Rats: What's for dinner? Don't ask.\n\n       Ninety years ago, Upton Sinclair's immensely popular \n     documentary novel ``The Jungle'' exposed the conditions then \n     prevailing in the American meat-packing industry. ``Rats were \n     nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for \n     them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go \n     into the hoppers together,'' Sinclair wrote, in one of many \n     vivid passages based on his research in Chicago, and he \n     added, ``There were things that went into the sausage in \n     comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.''\n       Peering back in time from the moral heights of the present, \n     we may find it hard to make out why the captains of industry \n     circa 1905 conducted their businesses so rapaciously. Were \n     their hearts more resistant to the promptings of conscience \n     than those of today's corporate executives? Or did Sinclair's \n     villains do what they did because it kept costs down and, \n     besides, they could get away with it? Such questions are of \n     more than just literary interest right now, for what can be \n     got away with may be on the brink of vast expansion.\n       Sinclair's best-seller helped spur the passage by Congress, \n     in 1906, of America's first great consumer-protection \n     measures--a federal meat-inspection law and the Pure Food and \n     Drug Act, which together prohibited the shipment of \n     adulterated or mislabeled foods in interstate commerce. The \n     first great political obstruction of consumer protection \n     quickly ensued. When producers of dried fruit complained that \n     limits on the use of sulfur as a preservative might hurt \n     sales, President Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture, James \n     Wilson, backed down. ``We have not learned quite enough in \n     Washington to guide your business without destroying it,'' \n     Mr. Wilson explained to them apologetically, no doubt \n     omitting to deride the inside-the-Beltway outlook of the \n     Department's scientists only because the Beltway had yet to \n     be built. Pro- and anti-regulatory forces have grappled for \n     advantage ever since. This week, the House Republicans, as \n     part of their Contract with America, are striving to rout the \n     rulemakers once and for all with a set of measures they \n     imaginatively call the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act \n     of 1995. The legislation would erect new obstacles in the \n     already tortuous path of risk assessment.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4746-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 GLENCOE STUDENTS WIN ENGINEERING AWARD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, more than 1.8 million Americans are \nemployed as engineers, making it the Nation's second largest \nprofession.\n  National Engineers Week has been celebrated annually since 1951 in \norder to increase recognition of the contributions that engineering and \ntechnology make in the quality of our lives. During the week of \nFebruary 19 to 25, more than 40 well-known engineers participated in a \nvariety of activities to help promote engineering.\n  Among those activities was the national engineers week future city \ncompetition. This competition encourages middle-school students to help \nenvision solutions to facing our Nation's cities. These seventh- and \neighth-grade students use math and science skills to design tabletop \nmodels of futuristic cities, and each group of students is assisted by \na teacher and a volunteer engineer.\n  This year a team of students from Glencoe, IL, was among the seven \nteams from around the country that went to the final competition at the \nNational Science Foundation, and I was pleased when they took third \nplace in the competition.\n  Those deserving special recognition are Stephanie Richart, Alexandra \nWang, and Denise Armbruster, and their teacher, Barbara James, of \nCentral School in Glencoe, and also Bob Armbruster who volunteered his \nservices in helping the group with their project.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/28/senate-section/article/S4746-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               MAKING MINORITY APPOINTMENTS TO COMMITTEES\n\n  Mr. REID.

I think \nthis is a significant bill and one that has been improved because it \nhas been bipartisan.
