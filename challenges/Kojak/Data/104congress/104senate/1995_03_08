Mr. President, I know we are ready to go momentarily to \nH.R. 889, the supplemental appropriations bill. I do expect the \ncommittee members to be here shortly so we can proceed.\n  In the interim, I would like to take a moment, Mr. President, to \nwelcome the distinguished guest Chaplain to the Senate today, Dr. Neal \nJones. I truly believe that some of the most meaningful lessons that \ncould ever have been learned on the floor of the U.S. Senate have come \nfrom our Chaplains.\n  I also always remember the prayers of Peter Marshall, when he served \nas the Chaplain of the Senate, and his prayers were actually put in \nbook form. I have one of those. Not many of them are around any more. \nThey were very meaningful, and I am sure they sustained the Senators in \nthe days that they were delivered as prayers in the Senate.\n  I know Dr. Neal Jones to be the same type of man. He is pastor of \nColumbia Baptist Church. I have known him in his role there at that \nvery fine church \n[[Page S3642]] for I guess close to 20 years. He has meant a great deal \nto this Senator personally. I just wanted to acknowledge the fine work \nhe has done at Columbia Baptist Church and the work he has done, and it \nextends down to Texas.\n  It extends, as a matter of fact, in the international community. As a \nmember of Columbia Baptist Church, I remember many occasions when Dr. \nJones had the congregation and the church family there to reach out to \ninternational members of the Washington area community, members of the \nambassadorial corps, and staff members from our embassies. They were \nalways wonderful events, dinners and lunches, where we welcomed \nrepresentatives from countries all over the world to Columbia Baptist \nChurch.\n  I also would note that both of my children were baptized along with \nmy wife by Dr. Neal Jones at Columbia Baptist Church. I really \nappreciate the fine work he does. I have been enjoying and appreciating \nhis prayers this week and I look forward to hearing more of them. He is \na perfect example of why the Senate has always had a Chaplain. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3641-7", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3642-S3643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FALLOUT FROM BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to make an observation or two. \nSometimes we do things in the U.S. Senate that no one pays much \nattention to around the world. In the 4 days since we have turned down \nthe balanced budget amendment, we have seen a precipitous fall in the \ndollar.\n  I heard on the radio as I came in this morning, and at a breakfast \nmeeting where I heard the distinguished presiding officer speak, I \nheard a reference to the international markets being concerned about \nthe action and our failure to face up to our deficit problems.\n  The Chicago Tribune, yesterday, front page subhead ``Dollar's Role as \nthe Top Currency of International Trade Is Threatened.'' And I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Where Will the Buck Stop?\n\n                          (By Ronald E. Yates)\n\n\n                              the downside\n\n       Americans face higher prices for many imports and foreign \n     trips, and the dollar's role as the top currency of \n     international trade is threatened.\n\n\n                               the upside\n\n       A cheaper dollar makes American exports more competitive \n     abroad, helping U.S. companies that sell overseas and \n     combating trade imbalances.\n\n\n                     a losing battle with mark, yen\n\n       With the dollar continuing its free fall in currency \n     markets around the world Monday, questions furrowed brows \n     from London to Tokyo:\n       Does the buck stop here? Or will it fall further? And if it \n     does fall further, what will the impact be?\n       The answers depend on who you are and what your agenda is.\n       If you are an American consumer thinking about buying a new \n     Japanese or German car, the weaker dollar means you'll pay \n     more because it takes more dollars to buy the vehicle. It's \n     the same thing for those who are planning a trip to Europe or \n     Asia. Hotels, meals and other costs associated with travel \n     will cost more for those traveling with dollars.\n       On the other hand, if you are Federal Reserve Board \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan, you aren't too concerned about the \n     plummeting greenback because a weaker dollar helps drive \n     domestic economic growth. How? A devalued dollar makes U.S. \n     goods cheaper and more competitive overseas.\n       But if you are Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi \n     Takemura, the idea of the dollar weakening and the yen \n     strengthening has no apeal.\n       At one point Monday, the Japanese yen was trading at a new \n     post World War II high of 92.80 against the wobbly dollar. \n     Takemura and the other leaders of the Japanese economy hate \n     news like that.\n       Why? Because a strong yen makes Japanese products expensive \n     in overseas markets, thereby decreasing their \n     competitiveness. That, in turn, slows the Japanese economy, \n     which is still struggling to come out of a 4-year-old \n     recession.\n       While neither Greenspan nor Federal Reserve Board member \n     Susan Phillips have said outright that they support a weaker \n     dollar, that's the way it's being read around the world.\n       ``Certainly the dollar is something we look at,'' Phillips \n     told reporters Sunday. ``But domestic considerations are in \n     many ways primary [to a falling dollar].''\n       Traders and analyst were in general agreement Monday about \n     what that statement meant.\n       ``Not only doesn't the buck stop here, but the U.S. \n     government apparently doesn't care if the dollar falls \n     further,'' said currency trader Manfried Holliger in Zurich. \n     ``It's a strange attitude for a government to take about its \n     currency.''\n       While many currency nationalists might deplore the \n     government's apparent lack of concern over the falling \n     dollar, there is another, more practical reason to be \n     concerned about the currency's plunge, some economists say. \n     If the dollar continues to nose dive, its 50-year reign as \n     the currency of choice for global business transactions may \n     be over.\n       That's a much more serious matter than old-fashioned \n     currency chauvinism, say some analysts. Worldwide confidence \n     in the U.S. economy is already at one of its lowest points in \n     recent memory.\n       The U.S. is already the world's biggest debtor nation, with \n     liabilities at the end of 1994 of some $750 billion. Foreign \n     economists say that Congress' refusal last week to pass a \n     constitutional amendment that would have required a balance \n     budget by 2002 showed that Washington is simply not serious \n     about putting its economic house in order.\n       ``The German mark is already replacing the dollar as the \n     currency of choice in Europe, and it may do so in Asia, \n     too,'' Holliger said. ``That will undermine international \n     faith in the U.S. economy and its government even further. I \n     can't understand what benefit U.S. leaders see in allowing \n     the dollar to fall even more than it already has.''\n       From the perspective of Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, \n     who, some economists say, continue to be obsessed by the fear \n     of inflation, a weaker dollar may force another rise in \n     interest rates.\n       The Fed already has raised interest rates seven times in 13 \n     months. The fear in Washington is that when a weaker dollar \n     spurs economic growth by making American goods more \n     attractive in foreign markets, it will rekindle inflation.\n       ``The Fed does care about the dollar's value,'' said Susan \n     Hering, an economist with Salomon Brothers in New York. ``A \n     weaker dollar will intensify the Fed's concerns about \n     inflation and make it more prone to raise [interest] rates.''\n       Not all analysts agreed with that assessment, however. ``We \n     see no chance the Federal Reserve will hike U.S. short-term \n     interest rates to defend the dollar, because they have never \n     done so before,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at \n     High Frequency Economics in New York.\n       The dollar fell to 92.80 yen in late trading Monday in New \n     York, down from a Friday record low of 94.05. It also \n     declined against the German mark, dropping to 1.4042 marks, \n     the lowest level in more than two years and down from \n     Friday's close in New York of 1.4250 marks. The dollar was \n     down against other major currencies as well.\n       The dollar's low against the mark is 1.387, reached in \n     September 1992. In London, the dollar was quoted at 1.4013 \n     marks, down from 1.4355 Friday.\n       In overnight trading in Asia, the dollar sank as low as \n     92.63 yen in Tokyo, the lowest it has been since modern \n     exchange rates were established after World War II.\n       Against other currencies, the dollar sank to 4.9580 French \n     francs from 5.0270; to 1.1735 Swiss francs from 1.2010; and \n     to 1,661.00 Italian lire from 1,672.50.\n       ``The dollar is being flawed by a huge U.S. current-account \n     deficit,'' said Weinberg, referring to the trade measure that \n     includes goods as well as services. He added that central-\n     bank intervention in propping up the dollar last week failed \n     to do anything other than create profit-taking opportunities \n     for speculators, who continued to dump the currency by the \n     billions.\n       ``This means [central] banks either have to give up their \n     support for the dollar--which is unlikely--or inflict more \n     pain on speculators this week by propping it up with more \n     dollar purchases,'' Weinberg said.\n       A poll of several analysts revealed that many feel the \n     dollar will fall to 1.35 marks and 90 yen before beginning a \n     slow climb back.\n       ``Any return to its old glory days as the leading currency \n     in the world will be slow,'' Holliger said. ``It doesn't take \n     much for a government to destroy the confidence people have \n     in a currency, but it takes an awful lot of work to revive \n     that confidence. That's where the dollar is today.''\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this article mentions a currency trader \nthat is apparently very prominent. I have to say I am not that \nknowledgeable in this field. A gentleman from Zurich, Switzerland, \nManfried Holliger, says:\n\n       Foreign economists say that Congress' refusal last week to \n     pass a constitutional \n     [[Page S3643]] amendment that would have required a balanced \n     budget by 2002 showed that Washington is simply not serious \n     about putting its economic House in order.\n       The German mark is already replacing the dollar as the \n     currency of choice in Europe, and it may do so in Asia, too \n     [Holliger said].\n       That will undermine international faith in the U.S. economy \n     and its government even further. I cannot understand what \n     benefit U.S. leaders see in allowing the dollar to fall even \n     more than it already has.\n\n  When I served overseas in the Army--and I have to say that was a long \ntime ago, 1951 to 1953--for $1, you got 4 German marks. That has \nchanged dramatically.\n  Every once in a while, we do things here that are of monumental \nimportance to the Nation. What happened last week is of such import. If \nwe want to stop the slide of the dollar, the U.S. Senate can do it \nvery, very quickly by adopting the balanced budget amendment.\n  I say to my 34 colleagues who voted against it, any one of you can do \na great favor for this Government and for the future of world stability \nby changing that vote. I hope before too long we will have a changed \nvote. The news on the dollar should be a matter of concern to all of \nus.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not know my friend was going to \nspeak on the subject of the falling dollar, but I fit right in with his \ndiscussion. I ask unanimous consent that I have up to 7 minutes as in \nmorning business to discuss this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3642-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3643-S3644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FALLING DOLLAR: IMPORTANT IMPACT ON AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, let me suggest that the \nfalling dollar seems like something out in the sky that does not have \nan impact on the American people. Let me suggest it has a very, very \nimportant impact on the American people.\n  I said to my staff this morning, ``Let's not talk about Wall Street \nand the markets. Let's talk about a couple in their home, living in an \napartment house with two children and are thinking about buying a new \nhouse.'' That is the kind of American who is going to get hurt, or the \nAmerican who is thinking about buying a new car or a new refrigerator \nand is going to have to borrow money, because essentially as the dollar \nlowers in value and America's appetite for borrowed money grows because \nwe do not have a balanced budget and we do not have any game plan to \nget our deficit under control, what happens is that those foreigners \nwho invest in American debt will insist on higher interest rates. \nBecause the dollar is worth less money, they want higher interest \nrates.\n  So what are we already seeing as a result of the falling price of the \ndollar? We are seeing higher interest rates, higher long-term interest \nrates. So I want to discuss for a few minutes with the U.S. Senate and \nthose interested in this about things we ought to be doing that we are \nnot doing to see if we cannot stop this and put America's dollar and \nAmerica's economy back, from the standpoint of the world, in the proper \nlight, in the light it should be and should have.\n  The currency markets might even be said to be in turmoil. Yesterday's \nnews on that is not a disconnected Wall Street event. It is a critical \ncomment on the U.S. economy and on the budget policy of this Nation, as \nI see it. Leadership in this country requires more than just saying a \nstrong dollar is in our interest. Who would not say that today? And \nwaiting around to see what happens is not an appropriate response.\n  It is backing that up with responsible fiscal policy that does not \ntake a walk on the deficit. Half a year ago, I spoke to the Senate the \nlast time America's currency was falling precipitously to new lows \nagainst foreign currencies. The yen per dollar exchange rate was \nflirting then with a historic floor of 100.\n  At that time, I warned that the dollar slide was a global vote of no \nconfidence on the direction of U.S. policy, both foreign and domestic, \nand, in particular, fiscal policy. Now we are seeing the dollar hitting \nnew record lows every day since the Senate's failure to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  On Monday, our currency declined to a record low of 93 yen per \ndollar, down 4.5 percent. In a week, it fell a similar amount against \nthe German mark and entered a record low territory against that \ncurrency as well.\n  Yesterday, the dollar slide accelerated. By afternoon, the dollar had \nfallen sizably further, 2 percent, since the previous day to a record \nof 90 yen to the dollar, setting a fourth consecutive record low in as \nmany days. Against the mark, the dollar fell to 137, a new record low \nagainst that currency as well. As a result, long-term interest rates \nwere pushed higher and stock values declined, just what I said in my \nopening remarks. Interest rates are pushed up.\n  This is not the work of the Federal Reserve Board, which has been \nadjusting short-term rates. Clearly, this is not that. This is the \nworld currency market responding.\n  These are not random disconnected events. Here is how we got to this \nplace:\n  First, Federal deficits are going up, not down, I say to my good \nfriend from Illinois. Last July, the projected deficits were said to be \n$173 billion for 1996 and much was made of that decline.\n  In February, without any changes in policy, the administration upped \nits estimate to $196 billion and took a walk on controlling long-term \ndeficits--that is the President's budget--took a walk on having any \nimpact on long-term deficits, thus, avoiding involvement by our country \nin a meaningful way in getting long-term interest rates under control.\n  Second, and I regret to state this but it is absolutely true, we must \nborrow even more, I say to Senator Simon, even more from abroad, rather \nthan less. Higher Federal deficits and low national savings rates mean \nAmerica's borrowing from abroad will have to grow tremendously in order \nto fund America's investment needs.\n  Over the last four quarters, America has increased its net borrowing \nfrom abroad by 50 percent, from $100 billion in 1993 to $150 billion in \n1994. Last month, the administration projected borrowing needs from \nabroad to rise to $170 billion by 1996.\n  The administration's shaky leadership with reference to the peso also \ncontributed somewhat to the crisis and is part of a connected web of \nAmerican activities that have shaken the market. I believe that event \non the Mexican peso contributed to some lack of confidence in the \ndollar and our abilities to get involved in an appropriate way.\n  Then last Thursday, the U.S. Senate sent a message to the world \ncapital markets that the U.S. Government did not have the resolve to \ndeal with these damaging trends. The balanced budget amendment failed \nin the Senate by one vote after passing overwhelmingly in the House. \nThe dollar now stands 7 percent lower against the yen and 6 percent \nlower against the mark relative to 1 week ago.\n  The current 7.6-percent interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds is 20 \nbasis points higher than a week ago, and the Federal Reserve Board has \ndone nothing to adjust interest rates, so it is something else causing \nit because they have not changed short-term interest rates, which many \nthink has no impact on long-term rates anyway.\n  A weak dollar and higher interest rates is prima facie evidence that \nforeign investors lack confidence in dollar investments. Foreign \ncentral banks time and time again have had to pick up the slack through \ncurrency interventions, as they attempted to do last Friday, apparently \nwithout success.\n  What should we be doing? There are many factors that can affect the \ndollar. They include strengthening economies in Germany and elsewhere, \nJapan's earthquake, and the peso crisis, but there will always be \nevents like that occurring outside our immediate control.\n  The question is, what are we doing to guide America's future in this \nsea of uncertainty? If we do not provide a firm currency, obviously our \neconomic goals are put in jeopardy. That does not mean relying on the \nFederal Reserve Board to increase rates enough to entice foreign \nlenders to hold American-denominated securities, because obviously \nthere are two sides to that coin. When you do that, you hurt America, \nalthough you might help the \n[[Page S3644]] dollar overseas. When it comes to changing interest \nrates, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board should always place domestic \ninterests first. A U.S. recession helps no one.\n  The only way to strengthen America's rate of return is to strengthen \nAmerica's economy by reducing long-term deficits, improving our savings \nand investment climate, and getting the Government out of the way of \nworkers and business. All of these are on the agenda for this year and \nnext year, right on the table. Allowing confidence in the stability of \nU.S. currency to significantly erode is not just unfortunate, it \nreflects misguided and, I believe, irresponsible Government policies.\n  This is a very simple graph, easy to understand. It talks about the \nU.S. dollar and its decline to new lows. The green one is its decline \nagainst the yen. The red one is its decline against the other major \ncurrency, the mark. This is all in the period of time, I say to my \nfriend from Illinois, from April 1, 1994, to March 7; that is \nyesterday. It is rather significant, not something that is esoteric and \noutside of impacting our people. It is very, very important to average \nAmericans and to our continued success as a viable economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3643-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3644-S3645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with interest to the \nremarks by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, who has served so well and so long here. I \nknow the people back in his home State recognize and realize that New \nMexico is well served here with my great friend and colleague.\n  I want to simply add my voice of concern, as I think has been so well \narticulated by himself, and I think before him by my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Illinois, who has been with us in trying to \nfocus attention on the dire consequences of the United States of \nAmerica continuing its course of reckless spending.\n  I just cite a statistic or two that I think have been said so many \ntimes they may be old hat, but I am still not sure are fully \nunderstood.\n  The national debt is the accumulation, year after year after year, of \nbudget deficits. Put another way, that means the Government, year after \nyear after year, is spending more than it takes in. Then, whether that \nis in millions or billions, it is shifted over at the end of each \nfiscal year to the national debt. But in 1980, the national debt was \nbelow $1 trillion, the accumulation of all the deficits since this \nNation started over 200 years ago. From 1980 until 1995, that debt has \ngone up about five times, from under $1 trillion to $4.8 trillion as of \nnow. And everyone in this body who understands the budget knows it is \ngoing to go up over $5 trillion sometime in this calendar year. Then it \nis going to go on up from there, because I have not seen a single \nprojection yet by anybody, Democrat, Republican, independent, or any of \nthe think tanks, that does not show continual, as far as we can see \ninto the future, year after year after year, including up to the magic \nyear 2002 that we had outlined in the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget--it is going to go up each year. That is another way \nof saying--with that kind of accumulation, it is an understatement--\nthat the debt will be at least $6 trillion by the year 2000, which is \nanother shattering statement. It may be part of the reason for the \ndecline of the dollar and the concern for that the chairman of the \nBudget Committee has just outlined. I think it is well we understand \nthat.\n  Having said that, there are many complicating factors in play right \nnow. I am not an isolationist, either in military policy or in economic \npolicy, but the more and more we internationalize the United States of \nAmerica's economy--the more and more we talk about free trade, the more \nand more NAFTA's that we have, the more and more GATT's that we have--\nthat is continually putting the economy of the United States of America \nin hands that are beyond our borders, so people in foreign countries \nhave more and more to do with whether or not the economy of the United \nStates of America is a sound one or a fragile one.\n  The Senator from New Mexico made quite a point that the earlier \nestimate by the Clinton administration for the budget deficit at the \nend of this year was about $172 billion and the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee further said that has now been revised upward from $172 \nbillion to $197 billion or $198 billion. Of course, the basic reason \nfor that, among other things, was partially a shortfall in the amount \nof money coming into the Treasury, but primarily it was due to the \nFederal Reserve Board raising interest rates, so that hurt Americans. \nBut it also hurts the taxpayers in America because they have to pay \nmore interest, a higher interest rate on the national debt. So not only \nis the national debt continuing to rise from under $1 trillion in 1980 \nto $4.8 trillion now, going up over $6 trillion before we can have any \nhopes of beginning to get it under control through some mechanism, but \nat the same time the interest that the taxpayers pay on that is going \nup dramatically for two reasons. No. 1, the debt keeps going higher \nand, No. 2, interest rates keep inching up.\n  Now, we are seemingly getting ourselves into a situation that, after \nNAFTA and after GATT and after the bailout of the Mexican economy that \nsome of us understood NAFTA was going to take care of--that was to take \ncare of everything. That would smooth things out between those who live \nnorth and south of the border, which it obviously has not. But after \nall those concerns, we are still back to a situation where, among the \nother concerns of the budget, the fastest-growing, percentagewise, \nportion of the budget today is not national defense, it is not welfare, \nit is not Social Security benefits, it is not Medicare and Medicaid; \nthe fastest growing percentage increase in the national debt is the \ninterest, which is now approaching $300 billion a year.\n  Talk about the foreigners pulling their money out of the United \nStates of America; that is the good news/bad news situation once again. \nThe facts of the matter are that foreign investors in the United \nStates, those buying T-bills in the United States of America, are now \nreceiving somewhere between $50 and $60 billion a year interest that \nthe American taxpayers are paying. That is what they get for buying our \nT-bills.\n  Another alarming thing, consider that about 25 percent of our debt, \nthe excesses that we continue to spend, is being handled by foreigners. \nWhat kind of shape is the United States of America in today? What more \nreason do we need for some discipline to get our expenditures in line \nwith our income on some kind of a reasonable, enforceable glidepath to \na balanced budget?\n  What more reason do we need than the fact that now we are becoming \nnervous because of the collapse of the dollar? The foreign investors in \nthe United States may be pulling their money out of the United States \nof America. That could increase our interest rates. I think the sum of \nthis whole thing is that the United States of America finds itself in \nan additionally perilous situation today where actions of foreigners, \nforeign entities, could cause a major recession in the United States of \nAmerica. I am not sure, if we could balance the budget tomorrow, it \nwould stop that, but it would certainly be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Let me conclude, though, Mr. President, by saying let us not be \npointing fingers at the President of the United States on this. I do \nnot agree with the connotation made by the Senator from New Mexico with \nregard to the fact that he said the President of the United States had \nwalked away from the deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, I submit the record shows that clearly is not correct. \nThe President of the United States and the Democrats in 1993 passed, \nfor the first time, the only significant decrease in the annual deficit \nthat we have ever seen. We took a lot of heat for that. Whether you \nagree with everything that President Clinton does or whether you \ndisagree with that, President Clinton is the first President since \nHarry Truman to establish a policy that has had a downward trend in the \ndeficit for 3 consecutive years.\n   [[Page S3645]] No, he has not licked the problem. There is more to \ndo. And I, too, criticize the President's budget this year. Not only \ndid the President not attack the deficit as I had hoped and wished that \nhe would, but he also fell into line with the Contract With America \nthat is supported by the Republicans on the House side and maybe some \nof the Republicans in the Senate to have a tax cut at a time we are \nscreaming that we have to balance our budget.\n  You cannot have it both ways. Anyone who is out there preaching a tax \ncut today, if they have any basic understanding of the budget of the \nUnited States of America, is either dead wrong or they are trying to \nmislead the people of the United States of America.\n  So I simply say I am pleased that my colleague from New Mexico has \noutlined a very serious problem, another problem, something else that \nwe had not anticipated that could have some rather dire circumstances \non the United States of America. While I say I think it is important we \npress ahead even without the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, which I was for and strongly supported, the world has not come \nto an end because that did not pass, and we still have the \nresponsibility to work as best we can on a nonpartisan basis to move \nahead with balancing the budget by the year 2002 or as soon thereafter \nas possible given the new realities of the situation.\n\n\n                             Senate Comity\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to make some brief remarks on another subject \nthat I think ties in with the reason that this Senate of ours gets \nitself tied up from time to time in gridlock. The events following the \nfailure by one vote in this body last week to pass the constitutional \namendment are something on which I wish to make a few remarks.\n  I appeal to all Members of this body, regardless of which side of the \naisle they sit on and what their political affiliation is, to begin to \nrecognize the lack of comity, the lack of understanding, the failure of \nthose of us on both sides of this aisle to walk in other people's shoes \non the other side of the aisle.\n  I have been here now for 17 years. I must say, Mr. President, I am \nvery much concerned about the fact that this body is becoming more and \nmore a body of vicious arguments, a body that does not play within its \nrules somehow that we do not falsely accuse each other, with the \nteamwork that is necessary in passing many good pieces of legislation; \nthe fact that if someone on the other side of the aisle or someone on \nour side of the aisle does not go along with a key vote that one of us \nthinks is absolutely critical, then there are some recriminations \ntaking place.\n  I need only cite the meeting that I understand from the press is \ngoing on today where the Republican majority in this body is meeting to \nsee whether or not they are going to censure one of the most dedicated \nand talented Members on that side of the aisle, Senator Hatfield from \nthe State of Oregon. Senator Hatfield had the unmitigated gall, in the \nopinion of some, to vote his conviction from that seat the other day \nand thereby, along with several other Senators that could be mentioned, \ncaused the balanced budget amendment to fail.\n  Now, I think I have the credentials to talk about that, Mr. \nPresident, because I did not agree with Senator Hatfield's vote. But I \nwill defend to the end his right to vote his convictions. And if we are \ngoing to send a message throughout the land directed by the new \nmajority that was elected in both the House and the Senate in the \nNovember elections, if that majority is going to be sending out the \nmessage that you march in lockstep with the contract, you march in \nlockstep with whatever we tell you to do or you are out as chairman of \na committee or can be otherwise censured, then I think that points up \nand proves the point I am trying to make today, that this institution \nis beginning to break down and become a pit of rhetoric, not \nunderstanding that each one of us is pledged to do what he or she \nthinks is best for our State and best for our Nation.\n  The Democrats sure do not have all the answers. We have proven that. \nThe Republicans do not have the answers either, and I think they are \nproving that even faster than I thought they could. I simply say it is \nabout time the freshmen Members of this body come into it with a bit of \nhumbleness. Just because they served over in the other body where they \ncould not talk more than 1 minute at a time, time and time again I have \nseen them come over to this body and languish in their new found \nfreedom of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.\n  It does hurt, Mr. President,\n   when Members on this side of the aisle or Members on that side of \nthe aisle by statement, by implication, and by action indicate that we \nare going to punish our Members when they do not hew the line.\n\n  I would only hearken back for a moment, if I might, Mr. President, to \nthat 1993 budget bill that was passed by 50 votes in this body. We had \nto have the Vice President in the chair to cast the vote to break the \ntie. Those were all Democratic votes. There were defections from what \nwas the position of the President of the United States, a Democrat. \nThere were defections from what most of the Democrats in this body, \nincluding this one, thought was the right thing to do. Some of those \ndefections were some of my closest friends and associates in this body \nwho I served with and considered their actions and their decision at \nthat particular time. While I did not agree with it, there was never a \nmurmur on this side. I have never heard even in Cloakroom talk or out \non the street a thought of trying to punish the six over seven \nDemocrats that did not follow the party line. And maybe in the end, Mr. \nPresident, that is a basic difference between the Democratic Party and \nthe Republican Party in the United States of America. They choose to \ntry and whip their people into lockstep.\n  I am proud to say--at least as far as I know--while we hope that \nthere is discipline on this side to a degree when things which are \nfundamentally important are concerned, I have never heard of the \nDemocrats ever considering censoring someone because they had the \ncourage to vote their conviction.\n  Mark Hatfield voted his conviction last week. While I thought it was \na wrong vote, I admire him for that conviction. I hope that the cooler \nheads--and there are many of them on that side of the aisle--will not \nstart on a warpath and not demean the standing and respect that I think \nthis body should have in the public's eye by trying to whip or punish \nSenator Hatfield for casting the vote that he thought was right.\n  Democrats and Republicans, it seems to me, can only expect us--and \nour constituents can only expect us--to trust our judgment to listen to \nthem, but in the end vote our convictions and our consciences as to \nwhat is the right thing for our State and the right thing for our \nNation. Mark Hatfield did that last week.\n  I again say that I wish he had done otherwise. I wish he would have \nbeen the one vote that we needed to pass it. But I felt that I would \nnot be stating my fondness for this institution and what it stands for \nwithout coming to the floor in defense of my friend Mark Hatfield \nbecause I am convinced that, while he did what he thought was right, if \nwe ever get to the place in this body where Democrats are going to \ndictate whether they are in the majority or the minority, the \nRepublicans are going to dictate whether they are in the majority or \nthe minority, how I and every one of the Members of the party vote, \nthen we have destroyed I think the deliberative body that I think the \npeople expect from this great institution that we call the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, is the pending business the Helms amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MACK. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n   [[Page S3646]] Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act is \ndesigned to once and for all bring about the end of the Castro regime \nin Cuba.\n  Senator Dole and Senator Helms and my colleagues were forced to act \nquickly to bring this measure to the Senate floor last night because \nword had seeped out of the Clinton administration that administration \nofficials have recommended that the President move to lift certain \nsanctions on the Castro regime and hold out a list of steps leading to \nbilateral talks between the United States and Cuba.\n  The introduction of this bill in Congress is a message to the \nPresident: Just do not do it. Just do not do it.\n  In fact, people are saying that what has happened is there is a trial \nballoon that is being floated out there to see how it might sell, how \nit might fly. Well, I would suggest that the President of the United \nStates himself ought to pop that balloon. This is not the time to be \ntalking about opening a discussion with Fidel Castro and entering into \nnormal relations.\n  What possible justification could the administration have for \nremoving even the slightest pressure from the Castro regime? How can \nanyone argue that the way to end repression in Cuba is to end the \nregime's isolation when Cuba will not even allow the visit of one man? \nThat one man is an individual by the name of Carl-Johan Groth, the U.N. \nspecial rapporteur assigned to investigate Cuba's human rights records.\n  Let me put that in perspective. The United Nations has assigned an \nindividual as a result of a series of resolutions that were passed in \nGeneva condemning Fidel Castro and Cuba for its human rights \nviolations. For years they have been trying to get someone into Cuba to \ninvestigate these human rights violations and Cuba has denied entrance, \naccess, to Cuba of this U.N. special rapporteur.\n  Groth, though denied an entry visa, has made a--I am quoting now from \nan editorial in the Miami Herald of 4 days ago--``harrowing compilation \nof violations of political and civil rights, arbitrary arrests, \nintimidation of the opposition and political prisoners kept in woeful \nconditions.''\n  His report describes the July sinking of a tugboat full of refugees \nfleeing Cuba. The tug, attacked off the Cuban coast, sank. Most aboard, \nincluding men, women, and children drowned.\n  I think my colleagues will remember that we discussed this issue on \nthe floor of the Senate last year.\n  Fidel Castro puts his faith in the tirelessness of some policymakers \nwho, not living in the hell Castro has created, search for new avenues \nfor negotiation, dialog, and compromise with a dictator who has \noutlasted administration after administration. I say to those who want \nto find those new avenues, when will they ever learn?\n  I put my faith in the Cuban people who continue to struggle and hope \nthat we here in the United States will not forget them.\n  On a personal note, I want to build on that last comment. I have the \nopportunity from time to time to speak with refugees or defectors from \nCuba. And one of the questions that I always ask them is, ``Should the \nUnited States maintain this embargo? Should the United States still \nattempt to isolate Fidel Castro because some people say there is a \nhardship that we are creating on the people of Cuba?''\n  Every single one that I have spoken to says, you cannot back away. \nYou cannot lift that embargo because, if you do, the message you are \nsending to us is you have abandoned us. And in fact, it is the message \nthat comes with the result of the embargo that is beginning to embolden \nus that gives us hope that maybe there is an opportunity that we can \nchange things.\n  So the worst possible thing that we could do would be what is being \nsuggested by those in the administration that now it is time to lift \nsome of the embargo, that now is the time to begin to open a dialog, a \nterrible, terrible mistake.\n  I also remind my colleagues that last year--in fact, I believe it was \nthe last day of the last Congress--there was a hearing in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, a hearing that was designed to deliver the \nmessage that now is the time to lift the embargo, open up dialog, move \nto normalization.\n  The amazing thing, as I sat there at that hearing and I testified, \nwas that it was the day after President Mandela had addressed a joint \nsession of the Congress of the United States and told us if it had not \nbeen for the commitment of the United States, and specifically, he \nsaid, the United States Congress, to the isolation of the regime in \nSouth Africa, his people and he would not be free. And for the people \nwho supported that to turn around today and say, ``Oh, we can't follow \nthe same approach with Cuba and Fidel Castro,'' makes absolutely, \npositively no sense.\n  So as I say, in my opinion, the President of the United States ought \nto embrace the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act and he ought \nto pop the balloon that has been floated by those in the \nadministration.\n  This is not the time for us to weaken our resolve. We need to \ncontinue to send that message to the people of Cuba--that we have not \nforgotten them, that we will not forget them, and that this country is \nunited behind the idea of freedom and democracy returning to that tiny \nlittle island south of Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I want to commend my colleague \nfrom Florida, who has perhaps more personal knowledge regarding Cuba \nand its effect on our country than many of the other Members here in \nthis body. I appreciate his remarks.\n  I would like to elaborate on the comments that he has made as they \nrelate to certain suggestions from the administration that we should \nenter into a new era with Cuba, one in which we ease and/or normalize \nrelations.\n  I would like to read from The Washington Post, March 7. It says:\n\n       President Clinton's foreign policy advisers are \n     recommending he take steps toward easing relations with Cuba \n     by revoking some economic sanctions adopted against the \n     nation in August.\n       The time has come, some U.S. officials believe, to test \n     whether Castro is willing to make deep economic and political \n     reforms, a senior administration official said.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Florida has, I think, made a very \ngood case that indeed this is not the time--not the time--to ease \nsanctions.\n  In Fidel Castro, we have a dictator; in Fidel Castro, we have \nempirical evidence of continued human rights violations, torture, \nmurder, extended imprisonment.\n  Mr. President, in Fidel Castro, we have an avowed enemy of the United \nStates of America, a man who has proliferated hostility throughout the \nhemisphere to the country, a man who has made no suggestion to us that, \ngiven new resources, they, too, would not be turned against the United \nStates of America, a man whose history is riddled with attacks on this \ncountry and whose history, in contemporary terms, has been avowed \nhostility to the United States.\n  Mr. President, there has to be some sense of linkage or continuity in \nthe way in which we engage this hemisphere.\n  If we could just step back for a moment, in very recent terms, we \nhave just imposed the harshest of sanctions possible on a little \ncountry in the same region that offered no threat to the United \nStates--Haiti; massive sanctions on the little country of Haiti. Now, \nCuba is a threat. We could never argue that Haiti was. But the \nsanctions were harsh and strict and with effect.\n  Mr. President, in addition, we had an alleged dictatorship in Haiti, \nand so we sent an invasion to Haiti. We have landed on Haiti's soil \nwith United States troops and personnel to remove the dictatorship and \nto impose or reimpose a democracy.\n  I may be missing something here, but I cannot get the connection with \nsanctions on Haiti, an invasion in Haiti, the expenditure of millions \non preserving a new democracy and, in the same breath, I am reading in \nthe Washington Post that, with Cuba, we should relieve the sanctions \nand engage in a dialog, as if we had a partner off our shores.\n  You know, we are the only world power. We are the dominant figure in \nthis hemisphere. There has to be a logic and a connection about the \nway \n[[Page S3647]] we communicate to our own hemisphere and the world. \nThere is no logic at this time to follow the suggestions that have been \nfloated by this administration to alleviate the sanctions on Cuba.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia and the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, and commend my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms.\n  I have heard, I do not know where, stated that ``The sands of history \nbleach the bones of countless thousands who, on the eve of victory, \nhesitated and, having hesitated, died.'' Such is the case with Cuba. \nThe sanctions are working.\n  Now is not the time to get fanciful ideas of world policy and peace \non Earth. Now is the time to look at the realities of this particular \nsituation.\n  If Castro would renounce communism and replace it with perestroika in \nCuba, as Gorbachev did in Russia, it would be a different thing. But \ninstead, Castro says, ``Oh, no; I have let tourists in, let the farmers \nsell to keep the Communist system afloat.''\n  Mr. President, I just do not believe in financing the opposition. I \nalmost am tempted to digress on the subject of Mexico, but I will \nattest to that tomorrow before the distinguished Banking Committee.\n  Enough on that particular point, Mr. President. I see the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee is ready to move \nalong on this subject.\n\n\n                             BUDGET CRISIS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I cannot let \npass two particular items that occurred here this morning.\n  One was made by my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. He claimed that the President had ``taken a walk'' with \nrespect to budgetary matters.\n  Now, Mr. President, let's set the record straight. In the last 12 \nyears, we have seen the ills of our reckless fiscal policies manifested \nin exorbitant, extravagant, obsessive budget deficits. But, when \nMembers talk about who it was who ``took a walk,'' certainly it was not \nPresident Clinton. He was not even here.\n  Talk about taking a walk, when the current President came to town and \ninherited a financial basket case of a nation, it was he who had the \ncourage and willingness--not walking, but working--to put in a $500 \nbillion deficit reduction package that included taxes.\n  It was not unfair. It was really making things more fair by proposing \nthe cuts and revenues needed to reduce the deficit. As part of that \nplan, he put in motion a program that is over half complete of reducing \n272,000 employees from the Federal work force. When complete will have \nthe smallest Federal work force since the Kennedy administration, and \nfor what? To balance the budget, not walk.\n  Mr. President, I remember to December 18, 1994, when the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico and his House counterpart, \nCongressman Kasich were on ``Meet the Press.'' At that time they were \ncrowing. They were going have three budgets in January, ready, willing, \nand able to go with the understanding that we would put the spending \ncuts in the bank to pay for tax cuts. But we did not get those spending \ncuts in January. We did not get those spending cuts in February. And \nMarch is marching by.\n  Mr. President, before they talk about the wonderful record that \nPresident Clinton made year before last without a single Republican \nvote in the Senate or the House of Representatives, we should \nstraighten the history about who is walking and who is talking. Where \nis the budget?\n  I remember my friend, former Senator Hart from Colorado, wanting to \nknow, ``where's the beef?'' It's high time we asked, ``Where's the \nbudget?'' I outlined one in January to show the hard task ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

Mr. President, when Members talk of taking walks and \nwaving white flags, what they are really angry about is that a large \npart of their budget plan has disappeared. I will ask unanimous consent \nat this time that the GOP alternative deficit reduction and tax relief \nplan of the year before last be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the plan was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    GOP Alternative: Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief--Slashing the \n                  Deficit, Cutting Middle Class Taxes\n\n       The Republican alternative budget will reduce the deficit \n     $318 billion over the next five years--$287 billion in policy \n     savings and $31 billion from interest savings. This is $322 \n     billion more in deficit reduction than the President proposes \n     and $303 billion more in deficit reduction than the House-\n     passed resolution contains.\n       Moreover, the GOP alternative budget helps President \n     Clinton achieve two of his most important campaign promises--\n     to cut the deficit in half in four years and provide a \n     middle-class tax cut. The GOP plan:\n       Reduces the deficit to $99 billion in 1999. This is $106 \n     billion less than the 1999 deficit projected under the \n     Clinton budget.\n       Even under this budget federal spending will continue to \n     grow.\n       Total spending would increase from $1.48 trillion in FY \n     1995 to more than $1.7 trillion in FY 1999.\n       Medicare would grow by 7.8-percent a year rather than the \n     projected 10.6-percent. Medicaid's growth would slow to 8.1-\n     percent annually rather than the projected 12-percent a year \n     growth.\n       It increases funding for President Clinton's defense \n     request by the $20 billion shortfall acknowledged by the \n     Pentagon.\n       Provides promised tax relief to American families and small \n     business:\n       Provides tax relief to middle-class families by providing a \n     $500 tax credit for each child in the household. The \n     provision grants needed tax relief to the families of 52 \n     million American children. The tax credit provides a typical \n     family of four $80 every month for family expenses and \n     savings.\n       Restores deductibility for interest on student loans.\n       Indexes capital gains for inflation and allows for capital \n     loss on principal residence.\n       Creates new incentives for family savings and investments \n     through new IRA proposals that would allow penalty free \n     withdrawals for first time homebuyers, educational and \n     medical expenses.\n       Establishes new Individual Retirement Account for \n     homemakers.\n       Extends R tax credit for one-year and provides for a one-\n     year exclusion of employer provided educational assistance.\n       Adjusts depreciation schedules for inflation (neutral cost \n     recovery).\n       Tax provisions result in total tax cut of $88 billion over \n     five years.\n       Fully funds the Senate Crime Bill Trust Fund, providing $22 \n     billion for anti-crime measures over the next five years. The \n     Clinton budget does not. The House-passed budget does not. \n     The Chairman's mark does not.\n       Accepts the President's proposed $113 billion level in \n     nondefense discretionary spending reductions and then secures \n     additional savings by freezing aggregate nondefense spending \n     for five years.\n       Accepts the President's proposed reductions in the medicare \n     program and indexes the current $100 annual Part ``B'' \n     deductible for inflation. Total medicare savings would reach \n     $80 billion over the next five years.\n       Achieves $64 billion in medicaid savings over the next five \n     years, by capping medicaid payments, reducing and freezing \n     Disproportionate Share Hospital payments at their 1994 level.\n       Achieves additional savings through reform of our welfare \n     system totaling $33 billion over the next five years.\n       Repeals Davis-Bacon, reduces the number of political \n     appointees, reduces overhead expenditures for university \n     research, and achieves savings from a cap on civilian FTE's.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read:\n\n       Accepts the President's proposed reductions in the Medicare \n     program and indexes the current $100 billion part ``B'' \n     deductible for inflation. Total Medicare savings would reach \n     $80 billion over the next 5 years.\n\n  Now, with respect to that $80 billion, the President struggled to \nfind budget savings within the context of health care reform. For that \neffort, he and the First Lady got ridiculed. If I was his lawyer, this \nyear I would say, for Heaven's sake, do not do it this year. Let them \ncome up with it. You tried and lost Democratic seats in November as a \nresult. Let them try. You did it. So let's not talk about taking a \nwalk.\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that Republicans want to come back \nand accept the President's cut so that they can run around with \ndemonstrations in front of the Capitol and say that it was the \nPresident that cut Medicare. Do they think we were born yesterday? They \ntalk about walking all they like, but where is the budget?\n  During the debate on the constitutional amendment I asked, ``Where is \nthe budget?'' I said rather than showing us 7 years, just give me 1 \nyear. That is my request this morning. Where's the budget? It is the \nmiddle of March, and under the rules we are suppose to complete the \nhearings and complete conference by April 15.\n  Are we just going to come in with a fixed vote and say, ``All right, \nno use offering amendments; we have to report it out now. No use to \nhear from you, you can be heard on the floor.'' That is not the way to \nrun things; that is terrible government.\n  Now, with respect to the other matter, that the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment failed by one vote. Mr. President, in the next \n10 minutes, they could get five votes. The five votes were offered to \nthem time and time again if only they would do what they said they \nwanted done--namely, protect Social Security.\n  I notice my friend, James Glassman, on the front of the business page \nof the Washington Post, wrote an article which was the truth, but it \nwas not the whole truth. Section 13301 of the Congressional Budget Act, \nsigned by President George Bush on November 5, 1990, says that Social \nSecurity shall be protected. Unless we honor that law, we will continue \nto move the deficit, not eliminate it.\n  That is the game, not to eliminate the deficit, but to move it from \nthe Federal Government to the Social Security trust fund. If they \nviolate section 13301, Mr. President, they can move $636 billion in the \nnext 7 years from the deficit over to the trust fund.\n  And who flip-flopped? It is really at best ironic to see Senators \nmeet in front of a placard, and I laugh because I got calls on it, that \nsays I am in a rogues' gallery for keeping my word. They claimed that \nthere were six Senators who flip-flopped. Could it be that I could cast \nthe same stone at those who voted in 1990 for section 13301, and then \nfor the balanced budget amendment to repeal section 13301?\n  Should I get the pictures of all those Senators and go in the front \nof the Capitol and holler, ``Flip-flop, flip-flop, they broke the trust \nwith Social Security''?\n  Under the rules, as the distinguished former President pro tempore \nknows, we are supposed to have the courtesy and decency to call each \nother distinguished. But 10 minutes later, they have me in a rogue's \ngallery. It is wonderful serving up here now. The devil take the \nhindmost and forget about the truth.\n  The truth is that the majority leader wanted to protect his troops. \nThe truth is that while saying that they were going to protect Social \nSecurity, the Republicans were running around saying: ``We cannot do it \nwithout Social Security funds.'' I can tell you--you cannot do it with \nSocial Security funds, because all you do is you move the deficit over \nfrom the Government over to the trust funds. You are not paying \nanything. You are taking credit and misleading the people. And with \nthat, the creativity is just starting.\n   [[Page S3649]] Those who say all they need is $1.2 trillion in the 7 \nyears are acknowledging that they are going to use Social Security \ntrust funds. If we take Social Security out, it should be $1.7 \ntrillion. Today's creativity is to get rid of the Department of \nCommerce, get rid of the Department of Education, get rid of the \nDepartment of Energy. Send welfare, send food stamps, send everybody \nelse back to the States; give them the deficit. Give it to Social \nSecurity to the tune of $636 billion. In addition, they say, ``We will \nnot raise taxes and we will not cut Social Security benefits, but we \nare going to recompute the CPI.'' But check the fine print. Changing \nthe CPI will force many Americans to pay higher taxes and will cut \nSocial Security COLA's for retirees. They are meeting themselves coming \naround the corner.\n  But with a lower CPI, they can pick up another $150 billion. Next, \nthey can go to dynamic scorekeeping and pick up another $150 billion. \nIf they need more money, they can start selling assets, like the \nelectric power grid, or move to a capital budget.\n  Oh, we know all the tricks. We ought to get our friend Stockman, who \nwrote about Dunkirk, and let him come and write about duplicity. There \nis no discipline coming to this tricky crowd who will not take five \nvotes, or more. All they have to do to get my vote is to let me keep my \nword, keep section 13301, and keep it there for the next generation.\n  My crowd--Senator Thurmond and I--are getting our money. It amazes \nme, but at 72 years of age, you have to take it. But be that as it may, \nthe next generation is going to pay more. When it comes their time to \nretire, Mr. Parliamentarian, they are going to raise your taxes.\n  Now, that is what is happening. That is what is happening, and it \nought to stop. They ought to quit running around making these silly \nstatements. The distinguished majority leader was on ``Face the \nNation'' Sunday, and I saw him categorically say we are going to \nprotect Social Security. If he really means it, accept this little \namendment. You accepted an amendment on the courts. You accepted an \nexception for borrowed funds. Just except Social Security trust funds \nrather than repeal section 13301. That is all you have to do to pass a \nbalanced budget to the Constitution.\n  But do not go around moaning and groaning all over Washington that \nall we need is to get one vote, get one vote, get one vote. He can walk \nout here this afternoon and pick up five.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3645-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3649-S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the \nstatus of our parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 326, as \nmodified. That is to strengthen international sanctions against the \nCastro government in Cuba.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair. At this time, I urge any Members who \nwish to be heard on this amendment by the Senator from North Carolina \n[Mr. Helms] relating to Cuba, to come to the floor and express their \nviews and, hopefully, we may bring this amendment to a conclusion \nshortly. We have been on this now for a number of hours, and it seems \nto me that we should bring it to that culmination and get on with other \namendments.\n  So I urge Members to come to the floor if they wish to be heard on \nthis.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to just speak for a very brief \ntime about this amendment that is pending by the Senator from North \nCarolina. I have just been trying to read through it. It is a 37-page \namendment, which is essentially a bill which I gather he introduced \nearlier, called the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of \n1995.\n  To my knowledge, there have been no hearings on this bill, and the \nSenator from North Carolina is the chairman of the committee before \nwhich hearings would be held. I have great difficulty understanding why \nthe chairman of the committee with jurisdiction would want to have the \nissue dealt with without hearings.\n  It seems to me it is a very important issue, a very important issue \nof public policy for our country, and one that needs to be thoroughly \ndebated and discussed. Clearly, that cannot be done as an amendment to \na supplemental appropriations bill pending before the Senate today.\n  So I hope very much that we will not proceed to actually enact \nsomething like this without having the wisdom to go back and subject it \nto scrutiny in the hearing process in the committee, in the committee \nof jurisdiction, which the Senator from North Carolina now chairs. I \nthink that would be the appropriate course to follow.\n  I have not had a chance to do a detailed analysis of this \nlegislation, but I do think that it would be foolhardy in the extreme \nfor us to proceed and try to adopt it as an amendment at this point.\n  I did want to make a couple of other points on the general subject of \nour relations with Cuba, because I know it has been in the news this \nweek. I have been noticing that there are suggestions in the news that \nthe President is considering going back on a couple of things that he \ndid by Executive order this last August. Let me just recount for the \nSenate what I understand the history of that to be.\n  We had a very major problem that occurred this last August where the \nCuban Government stopped preventing Cubans from fleeing to the United \nStates by boat. This change in Cuban policy on about the 15th of August \ncaused a surge of migration to the United States. It was the largest \nsince the Mariel boat lift of 1980.\n  With this situation occurring, 5 days later the President acted to \ntry essentially, as I understood it, to build some leverage for more \nnegotiations with the Cuban Government, and he put in place four \nmeasures against the Cuban regime.\n  First, cash remittances to Cuba would no longer be permitted. \nPreviously, United States citizens could provide up to $300 each \nquarter to their relatives in Cuba, which is not, as the President \nwould understand, an excessive amount to send. That works out to about \n$100 a month. And I do not think that is an excessive amount to be \nsending. But we stopped that. The President stopped it by Executive \norder.\n  Second, chartered flights between Havana and Miami were to be \nrestricted for those designed ``to accommodate legal migrants and \ntravel consistent with the Cuban Democracy Act.''\n  Third, the United States would use all appropriate means to increase \nand amplify its broadcasts to Cuba.\n  And, fourth, the United States would continue to bring before the \nnations and other international organizations evidence of human rights \nabuses.\n  Now, the recent news accounts indicate that the President is \nconsidering advice from some of his advisers that the first two of \nthose, the prohibition against cash remittances to relatives in Cuba \nand the prohibition against travel to Cuba, be relaxed again.\n  I believe the thinking there is that on September 9 of last year the \nUnited States and Cuba signed a migration agreement that stemmed the \nflow of Cubans flowing to the United States by boat. So the immediate \ncrisis, the crisis which had caused the President to put in place those \nExecutive orders, has gone and is now no longer facing us, and the \nPresident was considering, or at least his advisers were urging him to \nconsider, a change in that policy back to what it had been before.\n  Mr. President, I for one hope the President will take the advice that \nevidently he is receiving from his advisers. I can honestly say to my \ncolleagues here in the Senate that it strikes me as contrary to our own \ninterests to have in place, to continue in place, the policies that are \nnow being discussed in the White House. To say that Cuban-Americans \ncannot send, cannot remit to their relatives in Cuba up to $300 per \nquarter strikes me as unduly onerous and is hurting the very people who \nwe proclaim we are trying to help with all of these sanctions against \nCuba.\n  The distinction which needs to be kept in mind, Mr. President, is how \ncan \n[[Page S3650]] we help the people of Cuba without giving assistance to \nthe Government there? And I would say, if there is one way we can help \nthe people of Cuba without giving assistance to the Government, it \nwould be to allow their relatives in this country to remit to them very \nsmall amounts as they see fit up to $300 per quarter.\n  This is not going to threaten the future of our Republic. I think \nthis is an eminently responsible course for the President to take, to \ngo ahead and repeal or rescind that portion of the Executive order and \ngo on with allowing remittances to relatives in Cuba.\n  The other issue, Mr. President, also strikes me as one that should be \nclearly changed by this President, and that is the prohibitions against \ntravel to Cuba. One of the great constitutional rights which I think \nhas been recognized since the beginning of our Republic is the right to \ntravel, the right of Americans to travel.\n  Now, I understand that there are exceptions. There are occasions \nwhere we are in hostility with another government and it is not \nappropriate for U.S. citizens to travel to that country, or where those \ncitizens are in danger and we do not want to see them travel to another \ncountry because of the risk of international incident that that would \ncreate. But I do not believe either of those circumstances adequately \nprevail at the present in this situation to justify prohibiting travel \nto Cuba.\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, that the present law which is \non the books prohibiting travel to Cuba is not enforced. I picked up \nthe New York Times Sunday Magazine 3 days ago and was reading through \nit, and there was a big advertisement: ``10-day excursion to Cuba.''\n  That is not something which is being advertised for Canadians or for \nGermans. That is for Americans who want to go to Cuba for 10 days and \nview downtown Havana and old town Havana and all the other things that \nare available there. I know Members of this body have traveled to Cuba.\n  This is a law which is not being enforced. In my view, it is a law \nwhich does not make sense at this time in our history, and it is a law \nwhich causes all who look at it to wonder about our resolve in \nenforcing any of our laws relative to Cuba.\n  So I think that for the President to rescind that portion of his \nExecutive decree would make good sense. I for one believe that is the \nproper course to follow. At a later time I hope we can have an extended \ndebate about this whole embargo issue. I know it is of great concern on \nall sides to a lot of people in this country whether we should retain \nan embargo of Cuba.\n  However, today I at least want to go on record as indicating that \nremittances of small amounts of cash to relatives in Cuba should be \npermitted, in my opinion; travel to Cuba by American citizens should \ngenerally be permitted. In fact, it is being permitted today, since \neveryone seems to be winking at it or looking the other way or finding \nways not get your passport stamped or some other subterfuge so that the \npenalties which are in the law are in fact not applied. This is a law \nthat does not make sense. We should recognize that the President should \nrescind those portions of his Executive decree.\n  Again, getting back to that which I guess is the specific issue \npending before the Senate, that is, the proposed amendment by the \nSenator from North Carolina, again I hope very much we do not take it \nupon ourselves to legislate a whole new regime of sanctions and \nembargoes and onerous provisions at this time as an amendment to an \nappropriations bill. It strikes me as an act which would not be \nresponsible, and I very much hope colleagues would see it that way as \nwell and that the amendment, if it is brought to a vote, would be \ndefeated.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am going to follow the Presiding Officer \nin the chair, and I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from North Carolina. I am deeply troubled by some of the \ncomments that I have seen in the press yesterday and today in that \napparently President Clinton was considering easing the sanctions on \nthe Castro regime. Either the President has been misled or has misread \nthe will of the American people or he continues to get the wrong advice \nfrom advisers such as Morton Halperin because in either case this is a \ngrave mistake.\n  The attempts to oust Fidel Castro go back many, many years to the \nEisenhower administration. It transcends party, for sure; a number of \nPresidents in both political parties have been steadfast in their \nattempts to at least bring this blemish on our hemisphere to an end.\n  Now, when we are just about to cross the finish line, to do anything \nthat would keep that from happening is just a serious mistake. It is \nnot the time to relax our pressure on Fidel Castro. It is time to turn \nup the heat, not turn it down.\n  The Castro regime as we all know it is morally and economically \nbankrupt. It has been for over 40 years. Decades of corruption and \ncommunism have left the Cuban people disillusioned, left them in \npoverty, left them yearning, almost begging, crying out for new \nleadership on that island nation. For those who are struggling for this \nfreedom and democracy in Cuba, at this very time when we have the \nchance to win that for them, to move away from that is a serious, \nserious foreign policy mistake. Those people, the people who suffer at \nthe hands of Fidel Castro, do not want us to coddle him. They do not \nwant us to ease the pressure on this corrupt regime. They do not want \nus to give him the economic benefits of investment or tourism.\n They do not want it, and they are the people who are suffering at the \nhands of Fidel Castro.\n\n  On the contrary, they would like us to do everything possible to \nhasten this Communist leader's demise, that is what they want, to \naccelerate his removal from power and to help bring about this \ntransition to democracy.\n  This is exactly what the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina \ndoes. It keeps the pressure on Cuba and it accelerates the planning for \na transition to democracy in Cuba and the humanitarian and economic \nassistance programs that will ensue in a democratic Cuba, which we all \nare waiting for.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to reject this effort on the part of the \nadministration to coddle Fidel Castro, maybe not intentionally, but the \nresult is to promote this Communist regime which is now on the ropes, \nfinally. The Cuban people not only need our support, they deserve our \nsupport. They deserve it. They have suffered long enough. They need us \nto turn the pressure up. We are on the threshold, now, of removing \nFidel Castro. Many people have said that on this floor and in \nPresidential offices for many, many years. ``One more year, a few more \nmonths, Castro will be gone.'' But we are on the verge right now. This \namendment will hasten Fidel Castro's demise. More important, it keeps \nfaith with the Cuban people.\n  I congratulate the Senator from North Carolina for his amendment, and \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of it. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of it and to think very carefully about what this policy, the \nPresident's policy, will do to the Cuban people who live under this \ndictator, No. 1, and, No. 2, the people who await--not only here in the \nUnited States but in other nations around the world--who await the \nopportunity to go back to a democratic Cuba and build that island \nnation into the country it can and should be in the Western Hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the chairman's amendment on Cuba is a \nvery serious one. Cuba is a country of significance to the United \nStates and our policy toward it should be very carefully considered, \nmeasured, and open to a wide range of dynamics which necessarily come \nup between virtual neighbors.\n  I have been one, like the chairman, who has supported an aggressive \npolicy toward Cuba which will promote democracy and respect human \nrights. Like the chairman, I believe that was, in large part, why we \nfought the cold war. It was part of the effort.\n  But I advocate a different approach.\n  To my mind, further isolating Cuba is just not an effective approach. \nIn a world where we are trying to establish multifaceted, global post-\ncold-war relationships, it makes little sense to ignore that your \nneighbor exists, or to try to build regional coalitions around \n[[Page S3651]] a major island, as if there is a black hole in the \nCaribbean. We cannot do much to push democracy and respect for human \nrights if we will not even talk to the Cubans. Indeed, we only hurt \nourselves if we pretend that a country--particularly if it is \nobjectionable or threatening--does not exist. That is what I am afraid \nis the direction of this amendment.\n  I also think that pushing our friends and allies to also impose \nembargoes on Cuba is a waste of diplomatic chits. It is a waste of \ntime. We have much higher priorities with countries like Canada and \nGreat Britain, and most of Latin America than to try to ask them as a \nhigh priority to further isolate Fidel Castro. It would be far more \nconstructive to work with our regional partners to develop a post-\nCastro policy--a policy which will help rebuild Cuba economically, \nestablish democratic institutions, and strengthen regional \nrelationships, including trade and investment opportunities when the \ntime is appropriate.\n  Finally, I am a little amused that anyone could even advocate \nincreased funding for TV Marti. This program is a proven failure both \ntechnically and substantively.\n  Among its programming highlights have been baseball--a popular sport \nin Cuba--and sitcoms such as ``Kate and Allie,'' ``Fame,'' and ``Que \nPasa, USA?,'' a show about a Cuban-American family adapting to Miami.\n  I am told technically, it is almost inoperable. I have had occasion \nto refer to it as a ``balloondoggle.'' Its signal is jammed by the \nregime--that is, when the signal reaches Cuba. Transmission is faulty \nat best most of the time.\n  The programs are produced each day in Maryland. They are then \nuplinked--beamed up--from Washington and relayed to an aerostat \nballoon--a blimp known as ``Fat Albert''--which hangs on a tether \n10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key. From there it is projected to Havana.\n  However, because of inclement weather, the blimp can only be flown \nsometimes. Often volatile weather conditions knock Fat Albert off its \ntethered cable. In 1991, the blimp was found in the Florida Everglades, \nafter a $35,000 search, where it laid damaged for months.\n  TV Marti is even more useless when you think that we have an \neffective program in Radio Marti. Radio Marti is not jammed, and I am \ntold, unlike TV Marti, it enjoys a large Cuban audience.\n  To recommend more funding for TV Marti--to single it out for \nincreases in a year when we are slashing so many other worthwhile \naccounts--is just ludicrous. It's hardly the way to balance the budget.\n  It is just the opposite.\n  These are just some of the varying views on Cuba. Some of my other \ncolleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including the \nranking member of the full committee, Senator Pell, and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Dodd, favor lifting the U.S. trade \nembargo. I may want to link such a proposal to human rights reforms in \nCuba, which apparently are quite needed.\n  Therefore, instead of conducting an ad hoc, seat-of-the-pants debate \nhere today, I would respectfully request that the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings in the committee on \nthis topic. I know that the ranking members of both the full committee \nand the subcommittee would work closely with you to make that happen.\n  A full examination of all the options, proposals, and ramifications \nis long overdue, but quite necessary. There are serious implications to \nwhat we do: The refugee flow we witnessed this summer is but one \nexample. That shows this has great implications, not just for Cuba but \nfor us.\n  It would be to the credit of the committee to hold such hearings and \nshape the public debate on United States-Cuba relations in a \ndeliberative and constructive way.\n  I am sure we all agree that United States policy toward Cuba is too \nimportant and too complicated to offer statements today with full \nconfidence that we are doing the right thing.\n  I will very much appreciate it if the chairman will consider that \npossibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Wisconsin on his \nwords, which I agree with and endorse.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to my esteemed colleague, the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina and chairman of the Committee on \nForeign Relations, I add that I, too, strongly oppose the amendment he \nhas offered to the pending DOD supplemental appropriations bill.\n  First, this amendment is virtually identical to legislation the \nSenator introduced earlier which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations. Clearly, the committee should have hearings on this \nlegislation, so that the full impact of these proposed changes in U.S. \npolicy can be publicly discussed prior to Senate action. Although I \noppose the policy direction set forth in the amendment, as the ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Foreign Relations I will work with \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee to facilitate committee \nconsideration after full public hearings. The Senate should have the \nviews and recommendations of our committee prior to voting on \nlegislation as important and significant as this.\n  Second, the distinguished chairman and I both want to see a free and \ndemocratic Cuba, but we disagree on the policy our country should adopt \nto achieve our common goal. I have long spoken to the need for a \nserious reexamination of our country's policy toward Cuba. However, the \nchairman's amendment clearly does not reflect the direction I had in \nmind.\n  Yesterday I was encouraged to read that President Clinton is \nconsidering taking some modest steps toward altering the existing \nsanctions policy in favor of more communication and contact between the \nCuban and American people--and I must say I applauded that initiative.\n  Existing United States policy, consisting of a rigidly enforced \nembargo and an aversion to any significant dialog with Cuba, has, as \nbest I understand them, three goals: To promote a peaceful transition \nto democracy; to support economic liberalization; and to foster greater \nrespect for human rights while controlling immigration from Cuba.\n  These three goals have guided our national policy toward Cuba for 30 \nyears, Mr. President, yet there has been scant progress toward \nachieving any of them. There is still a government in Cuba which is not \nfreely elected, which is only just beginning tentative steps toward a \nmarket economy, and which continues to fall short of international \nstandards in the area of respect for human rights.\n  Therefore, I can only conclude that this policy is not only outdated \nand ineffective, but, far worse, it is counterproductive. We should be \nratcheting up and not down. It seems to me that the time has come to \nadmit the obvious. The policy is a failure and will never achieve its \nstated objectives.\n  Consequently, it would be a serious mistake, in my view, to intensify \nthe embargo and impose even more stringent measures on the people of \nCuba as proposed in the pending amendment.\n  I believe that, rather than tightening the embargo and further \nisolating Cuba, the United States should expand contact with the Cuban \npeople and enter into negotiations on all issues of mutual concern to \nour two countries, including the lifting of the economic embargo.\n  For example, I believe the President will find a great deal of \nsupport within the Cuban-American community to a rolling back of last \nAugust's sanctions that were imposed during the Cuban migrant crises--\nsanctions that have prohibited Cuban-Americans from sending money to \nfamily members in Cuba or visiting them, except in cases of dire \nemergency. This would be a small first step in the direction I support, \nbut we must go much further.\n  I say this not because of any regard for the government in Havana, a \none-party state with a record of intolerance toward dissident voices \nwithin the society. Rather, I say this because, if our country and Cuba \nare to break the impasse that has existed in our relations for more \nthan three decades, someone must take the first step in that direction. \nWe are large enough and strong enough, and we can afford to do so.\n  I believe, and have said many times, it is in the U.S. national \ninterest to take that first step--to agree to sit \n[[Page S3652]] down at a negotiating table, where all issues can be \ndiscussed.\n  In the meantime, there should be greater contact between our own \ncitizens and the Cuban people. Such contact will serve to plant the \nseeds of change and advance the cause of democracy on that island. Just \nas greater exchange with the West helped hasten the fall of communism \nin Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, so, too, it can achieve \nthe same results much closer to our shores.\n  I well remember when I was living in Czechoslovakia. The people would \ncome to visit America and then came back. They came back much less \nconvinced of communism than when they went. The more exchange of people \nand ideas the more likely communism is to erode. To erode means \ncontacts, and this is what is necessary.\n  Liberal Democrats are not alone in holding this view. Former \nPresident Richard Nixon wrote shortly before his death last year that, \n``we should drop the economic embargo and open the way to trade, \ninvestment and economic interaction.'' Learned people across the \npolitical spectrum have made similar comments and observations about \nthe policy.\n  Why? Because they have all observed across the globe that policies \nwhich foster greater commerce and communication between countries work \nand those which engender isolation and enforced misery do not work. We \nhave a choice. Let's take the one which works. It has been impossible \nfor those who would seek to defend the status quo to cite an instance \nin modern history where a policy of forced isolation has successfully \ntransformed a totalitarian state into a democracy.\n  United States travel restrictions to and from Cuba are among the most \nprohibitive in the world--this to an island that is only 90 miles from \nour shores. At this point, only United States Government officials and \njournalists have unrestricted access to Cuba and only a small \npercentage of Cubans who apply are allowed to travel to the United \nStates each year. The pending amendment would restrict binational \ncontacts even further.\n  Mr. President, do we as a nation not have enough faith in the power \nof our democratic system and the strength of our ideas to let contact \nbetween our citizens and other peoples flourish? I would hope so.\n  In my view, the strongest advocate for democracy and a free market \neconomy would be a Cuban student or family member who had recently \nvisited the United States and seen the sharp contrast between our way \nof life and that in Cuba.\n  Current policy not only denies the United States the opportunity to \npromote positive change in Cuba, but it increases the likelihood of \nwidespread political violence and another mass exodus of refugees to \nFlorida. The Cuban Government, which is vigorously pursuing expanding \npolitical and economic ties with the rest of the world, is unlikely to \ngive in to unilateral United States demands. Nor is there much \nindication that a viable opposition currently exists within Cuba strong \nenough to wrest power from existing authorities.\n  We have made it very easy for Cuban authorities to justify the lack \nof political freedom in Havana. They simply point to the external \nthreat posed by a hostile U.S. policy.\n  I am concerned that adoption of the pending amendment would add \nfurther justification to the Cuban Government's repression--quite the \nopposite effect from that intended by the sponsors of this amendment. \nThat justification would lose all credibility were we to adopt a more \nreasoned U.S. policy. Cuban authorities would then be hard pressed to \njustify the denial of political rights and economic opportunities that \nthe Cuban people readily observe elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, I have urged the administration to take the first step \ntoward a new and enlightened policy--a policy that can once again unite \nAmericans and Cubans. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsending a message that it is time to open up a new and constructive \ndialogue with Cuba by voting against the pending amendment.\n  The best reason for doing that--as we see what has happened in the \npast few years as the Iron Curtain has dissolved--is the fact, as \nexposure is being increased between the East and West, that communism \nhas been eroded as seen by its present disappearing act and what then \nfollows in Europe today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I again urge any colleagues who wish to \nbe heard on this pending amendment on Cuba to present themselves on the \nfloor. We have a number of other amendments pending, that we are at \nleast aware of, that Senators will ask to be considered.\n  We do not want to lose a lot of the time waiting for that to happen. \nSo let all Members be on notice that we are prepared to dispose of this \namendment in an orderly way at some point soon and/or take up any other \namendment and set this one aside.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 326, as modified.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am sorry that I missed my friend and \ncolleague from North Carolina. He was on the floor here. I gather he \nhas gone to a conference lunch.\n  I was unable to talk to him, and I am unclear whether or not this \namendment will be withdrawn or voted on. I will work on the assumption \nit will be voted on. If it is not, then these remarks can be used in \nthe context of when it comes up at some future date. I am unclear as to \nwhether or not we will actually have a vote on the amendment.\n  Let me address, if I could, Mr. President, the amendment that the \nSenator from North Carolina has proposed and, at the very outset, urge \nthat all of our colleagues read this amendment very, very carefully.\n  This is an amendment that does not deal with the present situation in \nCuba. There is nothing that I know of in this amendment, with the \npossible exception of changing the frequency of TV Marti to ultra-high \nfrequency to deal with the present situation. The amendment is geared \nto deal with the post-Castro situation in Cuba.\n  For that reason, knowing full well how a strong majority of my \ncolleagues feel about boycotts and embargoes and so forth on the \npresent regime, I strongly urge them to look at the amendment because \nit does not deal with primarily what exists now, but rather what comes \nafterward.\n  My concern is that this could have a very, very negative impact on \nour ability to deal in the post-Castro period, whenever that comes, \nhopefully sooner rather than later. It seems to me this amendment will \ncomplicate our ability to assist any post-Castro regime as it grapples \nwith the difficult period of transition to democracy. We do not even \nknow what that government may look like. It may be a carbon copy of \nwhat exists now. It may be a flourishing Jeffersonian democracy.\n  We have been asked to take a position, if we adopt this amendment, \nthat would predetermine in many ways what kind of government would \nfollow Castro and, I think, tie the hands of not only our own \nGovernment but of United States industry and business from doing \nbusiness in Cuba by making them subject to potential civil lawsuits by \npersons who may later claim to have owned property at some point in \nCuba.\n   [[Page S3653]] United States companies are clearly not going to set \nthemselves up for such lawsuits, and they will stay away from Cuba \nuntil all property claims are resolved. What I mean by this is the \namendment says no assistance can occur in Cuba, no businesses can do \nbusiness in Cuba in a post-Castro regime until all property claims \ndating back to 1959 are resolved. I do not know of anyone who would go \ndown and want to make investments in Cuba with the possibility that at \nsome future point a claim may arise which would prohibit them from \nengaging in a business practice to assist this new government, whatever \nit may be, in Cuba.\n  That will not be the case, obviously, with foreign interests who want \nto do business in Cuba. They will not be constrained by such \nlimitations.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this amendment because, \nagain, I understand the intent. Senator Helms cares deeply about \nexpropriation of property, and he is right to do so. We have had a \nnumber of cases in El Salvador and, I think, in Nicaragua where there \nhave been some pending. I have been supportive of them in those efforts \nto see to it that American citizens who own property that was \nexpropriated get the property back. But I do not think we have ever \ntaken the position that nothing ought to happen in these countries \nuntil all the matters are resolved.\n  From time to time, we exerted pressure on those governments. We held \nback foreign aid, we provided aid, we held it back--we used the levers \nto try and achieve the desired results. Here we are now about to take a \nposition in a post-Castro Cuba in which we are saying no matter what \ngovernment emerges, no matter what the circumstances may be, that you \nare not going to be able to do business there until all the claims, \nwhich potentially, I guess, go back to 1959 when Castro took over, have \nbeen resolved.\n  So I think, in a sense, it gets way beyond what we ought to be doing. \nEven if there are those who see merit in this approach, this is a \ncomplicated matter. It is not a simple matter. It really not ought to \nbe the subject of an amendment on the floor. This ought to be the kind \nof legislation that is at least subject to a couple hours of discussion \nand hearing as to what the implications are in terms of the Claims \nSettlement Act of 1949--how does it work; could we apply this \ninternationally, as the amendment would seem to suggest?\n  The distinguished Senator from North Carolina is now the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I could almost understand if someone \nin the minority were offering this amendment on the floor because they \nare unable to get a hearing or there was no ability to conduct some \nanalysis of what the amendment might be. But here the chairman of the \ncommittee is offering a floor amendment without the full Foreign \nRelations Committee or even a subcommittee thereof having an \nopportunity to analyze what the implications might be.\n  So I know that any amendment that has ``Cuba'' on it, we have a \ntendency automatically to vote for it. I just urge in this short amount \nof time that my colleagues take a look at this. I think this goes a lot \nfurther than anything that has ever been suggested in any other place, \nthat I know of, in the world.\n  I suspect it may have been motivated in part by a story that appeared \nin the Washington Post about lessening some of the sanctions that were \nimposed, I think, last August during the deluge of humanity that poured \nout of Cuba and how we were going to work with that. That situation \nhaving been resolved, as I understand it, some of the sanctions we put \nin place then, in light of what was happening, we now may be lifting, \nalthough, frankly, I do not have any specific personal knowledge as to \nthe genesis of that particular story myself.\n  But that aside, it seems to me that we are breaking some significant \nnew ground as to who would be eligible to be compensated under the \nInternational Claims Act of 1949 which, by the way, Mr. President, is \nthe primary mechanism for settling U.S. persons' property claims, to \nmake eligible individuals who are not citizens of the United States at \nthe time of expropriation and who may not even be citizens today. This \nis not international law, international law standard, I point out, and \nmay seriously complicate efforts to resolve claims of individuals who \nare U.S. citizens at the time of expropriation, which is where our \nprime interest ought to be. Not that we are unsympathetic to non-U.S. \ncitizens' claims. But, it seems to me, our thrust in this body ought to \nbe focused on what happens to U.S. citizens where expropriation has \noccurred.\n  To invoke the International Claims Settlement Act, it seems to me, is \ngoing to complicate this situation dramatically at the expense of our \nown people. That is what I am really trying to emphasize.\n  I said at the outset that there is a piece of this that one might \nargue does have some immediate effect on the Castro government. The \nbill would require the President to convert TV Marti to ultra-high \nfrequency UHF broadcasting but fails, I point out, to provide the \nnecessary funding to accomplish this effort.\n  I think we have been through a pretty significant debate with \noverwhelming support in this body for unfunded mandates. Here we have a \nmandate that requires the change of frequency and no allocation of \nresources to do it. I just raise that as a further point.\n  Mr. President, I will not raise a point of order at this point, but I \ndo believe this is legislation on an appropriations bill. I want to \nmake sure everyone has an opportunity to discuss the amendment, and \ncertainly I would not do it without informing my colleague from North \nCarolina ahead of time that I intended to do that so that he would have \nan opportunity to exhaust whatever remarks he wanted to make about his \namendment. But at an appropriate time, Mr. President, if the amendment \nis not withdrawn--and maybe it will be withdrawn. I gather there is \nsome discussion about offering this at a later time. I urge we have a \nhearing on it.\n  Senator Coverdell--I have not had a chance to talk with him--who is \nnow chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I suspect would be \nwilling to have a subcommittee hearing if the full membership was not \ninterested in examining this issue. I certainly would take the time to \ndo it with him. If not that, then the full committee.\n  I am a little surprised in a way that we have the chairman offering \nan amendment on an appropriations bill that he has the power on his \nnotice to call a hearing on this issue so we really understand what the \nissues are.\n  Again, my emphasis is primarily that this could be very, very \ndeleterious to U.S. business interests. I do not know of any business \nwhich is going to want to make investments knowing at some date there \nmay be a cloud on titles of property that have not been resolved. This \nwill not be the case with the Spanish and other Latin American \ncountries, the European Community, the Canadians, our friends to the \nnorth who are already involved there. They will be going gung ho in the \npost-Castro period. Our business interests, which may see some real \nvalue in being involved in Cuba, I suspect would be very reluctant to \nget involved if this amendment is adopted.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues who may be listening, or their staffs, \nplease take a good look at this amendment. Again, anything that has \n``Castro Cuba'' on it has almost an immediate Pavlovian response to the \namendment. This is all post-Castro regime. So you are not doing \nanything to Fidel Castro with this amendment, except the UHF issue, and \nthat one you ought to take a look at.\n  But the other issues are all after Castro and what the implications \nare for us. I am not sure Members of this body necessarily want to be \nin a position without knowing what that government looks likes. We \nprohibit all assistance to that new government in this amendment, \nexcept just the most dire humanitarian kind of assistance. Maybe that \nis what we want to do when that new government emerges. I do not know \nif anyone can say with any certainty today--and I have studied the \nissue for a long time--I cannot tell you how that issue is going to \nresolve itself when Castro leaves, dies, or whatever else happens. To \nsay today no matter what happens we are going to put in law a \nprohibition of doing anything, it seems to me to go far beyond where we \nought to be going in the consideration of an appropriate foreign policy \nprogram.\n  So I urge, Mr. President, last again--just to emphasize--please take \na look \n[[Page S3654]] at this amendment. I urge my colleague from North \nCarolina not to proceed with the amendment. That will be the best \ncourse of action so we do not have to have a vote on this. But if he \ndoes proceed, I will raise the point of order about it as legislation \non an appropriations bill, and if I fail at that, then obviously urge \nmy colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  Again, take a good hard look at this before you walk in here and just \nhear the words ``Castro Cuba'' and decide it is OK. I think a lot of \npeople, particularly the majority here, would have some strong concerns \nabout the implications for U.S. interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I concur completely with my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  Foreign policy should reflect the national interest, not the national \npassion. Our policy in Cuba reflects the national passion, not the \nnational interest. If the old leaders of the Soviet Union and Cuba had \ngotten together and said let us try and figure out a United States \npolicy that will keep Castro in power, they could not have figured out \na better policy than the policy we have followed that made Castro a \nhero to his own people, that isolated him.\n  I think we need, if there is such a word, to de-isolate Cuba. I \nthink, for example, we ought to at a minimum sell food and medicine to \nCuba. What harm comes to the United States if we sell food and medicine \nto the people of Cuba? And as I read this amendment, all of a sudden we \nare saying to countries all over the world, if you do not follow the \npolicy that we and we alone are following--no other country in the \nworld has this policy toward Cuba--if you do not follow our policy, \nthen you are going to have economic reprisal against you.\n  That is not the way. It may have been, immediately after World War \nII, when we had better than 50 percent of the world's economy, we could \nmuscle our way around like that even though it would not have been good \npublic relations for the cause of freedom and democracy. Today, we are \none-fifth of the world's economy. Yes, we are the only superpower that \nis left, but it just is not rational to follow this kind of policy.\n  I think we ought to be sitting back and asking ourselves, No. 1, is \nCastro a threat to the United States? I think the answer to that \nclearly is he is not a threat to the United States. No. 2, is he \nviolating basic civil liberties, human rights, in Cuba? Yes. He is, in \nfact, probably the worst violator of human rights throughout this \nhemisphere.\n  Then the question is, How do we get them to change their policy? That \nis what we ought to be asking ourselves, not how we can pick up a few \nvotes back home from people who want us just to corner him. You corner \na dog, you corner a snake, and they lash out.\n  I think we ought to be taking another look at this. I think the Helms \namendment is well intentioned. It will not serve the national interest, \nnot serve our national policy at this point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 327\n\n (Purpose: To delete the rescission of funds for the National Security \n                         Education Trust Fund)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have an amendment, but I do not see \neither of the floor managers present.\n  I think it would not violate anything if I asked unanimous consent to \nset the Helms amendment aside so that I can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 327.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, strike out line 16 and all that follows through \n     page 23, line 2.\n       On page 22, line 2, strike out ``65,000,000'', and insert \n     ``81,000,000'' in lieu thereof.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that restores the \nNational Security Education Act. This was introduced by our former \ncolleague, Senator David Boren, and was cosponsored by Senators Nunn \nand Warner. It was signed into law by President Bush.\n  Before he leaves, I say to my colleague, the former chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, because I know of his interest in \nthis field, this is our former colleague, David Boren's bill. It sets \nup studies in foreign languages, in these isolated foreign languages \nwhere we have very little knowledge, and it is extremely important. I \njust mention it to Senator Pell because I know of his interest in this \narea.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator very much and share the Senator's \nadmiration for Senator Boren. I think some of his ideas about how we \nget more bipartisanship should be followed.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  In Desert Storm, we sent 500,000 American troops over there, and we \nfound we had only 5 people who could translate Iraqi military \ndocuments. The need for having knowledge in these areas is extremely \nimportant. I called David Boren, who is now president of the University \nof Oklahoma, and I say to my colleague from Mississippi, he indicated \nnot only were Senators Warner and Nunn cosponsors of this, but Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Cohen, and he also indicated that Senator \nLieberman and Senator Feingold had been of help to him in this.\n  The other day, I asked the Secretary of Defense about this, and he \nsaid this is a small item but extremely important. He said it really is \nimportant that we have people who learn these isolated languages.\n  My reason for being involved in this is back when I was a member of \nthe House Education and Labor Committee, the then Secretary of \nEducation, Ted Bell, asked to zero out our foreign language program, \nand Cap Weinberger, who was then Secretary of Defense, and Bill Casey, \nwho was then head of the CIA, contacted me and said this is extremely \nimportant for us. This is an area where we have serious deficiencies.\n  My hope is that the managers will be willing to accept my amendment. \nBut if they are not, then I would want to press forward to have a vote \non the amendment.\n  I will yield the floor at this point, and the floor managers can have \na chance to look at this. But, again, this is the measure, the chief \nsponsor of which was Senator David Boren, and Senators Nunn and Warner \nwere cosponsors. President Bush signed the legislation. The Secretary \nof Defense says this is very important for the Defense Department. It \nis a relatively small amount we are talking about, $6 million. The \noffset is more than the $6 million because to handle the outlay portion \nof that, we need to do better than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could at this point just observe the \nabsence of a quorum momentarily so we can discuss this matter with the \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand full well the amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois. It is one directed toward preserving the \nBoren fund concept, that provided for education, particularly \neducational opportunities in foreign cultures and languages. The House \nhad totally eliminated this program. Our committee tried to fund the \nongoing grants and those that had already been approved under the Boren \nplan. We provided for the elimination of the fund at the end of the \nsettlement of the obligations that have been made to date.\n  I think there is a serious question about the redundancy in the \ndefense bill of moneys for research and activities of this type. The \nuniversity grants under the current bill, this year, \n[[Page S3655]] amounted to $1.6 billion. We are looking now at, really, \na difference of some $16.5 million, as far as the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois is concerned, and our position as represented by \nthe Senate report.\n  My advice--and I have conferred with my good friend from Hawaii--my \nadvice to the Senate is we accept the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois, knowing full well that the full spectrum of the House's \nrecommendations will still be in conference. We are going to battle the \nwhole subject. We might as well battle it from the point of view of the \nSenator from Illinois as from the point of view of our proposal to the \nSenate. In the way the Senator from Illinois presented it to us, it \ndoes not affect the outlays or does not affect the basic authorizations \nunder the bill available to the Department of Defense for this current \nfiscal year.\n  Under these circumstances, unless the Senator from Hawaii wants to \ncomment, I am prepared to accept the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have conferred with the chairman of the \ncommittee and I am prepared to accept his recommendation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 327) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I thank them not \nonly on my behalf but on behalf of our former colleague, Senator David \nBoren. I will call him and tell him the news. And I believe I am safe, \nafter my conversation with the Secretary of Defense, in saying the \nSecretary of Defense also thanks you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The ghost of Boren is alive and well on the floor of the \nSenate, Mr. President. However I am not sure that will be the case in \nthe conference. We will do our best.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3649-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I assure my colleagues, the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill and my good friends, that I will not hold the \nfloor long. I noted that nobody else was speaking just at the moment.\n  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago I went on Senate business to the \nRepublic of Ireland in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom over a \n3- or 4-day weekend as one who has been involved in the international \nfund for Ireland. It was at a time just prior to the publication of the \nframework Document of Peace between the Republic of Ireland and the \nUnited Kingdom. Our distinguished former colleague, Senator George \nMitchell, was also there representing the President of the United \nStates. He and I had various meetings in Dublin and elsewhere. I have \ndiscussed those before.\n  But I thought of this earlier this week. I picked up the New York \nTimes and saw under a heading ``Belfast Journal'' a very, very moving \narticle by James F. Clarity. I will speak to that in just a moment.\n  What I noticed were rather hopeful signs as I drove from Dublin to \nBelfast and went into Northern Ireland leaving the Republic of Ireland. \nThe gates and barriers and bomb detectors, police and military that you \nnormally see across the border were absent. In fact, you could see the \nmarks on the ground where the speed bumps had been removed. And you did \nnot see the all-pervasive military patrols, at least in the daylight \nhours throughout Belfast.\n  In Belfast, I met with both Protestant and Catholic groups. They \ntalked of their fears, their concerns, and their hopes. Then on Sunday \nI met with some mothers who spoke to me--it really makes no difference \nwhich faith is involved here because I heard the same thing from all \nmothers I spoke with--that for the first time since the troubles began \nthey were able to walk with their children on the streets and not have \nto worry about car bombs. For the first time they did not have to worry \nabout the knock in the middle of the night of somebody telling them \ntheir husband will be killed or witness such a killing in front of the \nrest of the family.\n  The presence of armed authorities on the streets of Belfast were \ngreatly diminished, in contrast with the Republic of Ireland where the \noccasional police officer you might see goes unarmed. These were the \nhopeful signs. The ``War Widow's'' journal is so moving.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I might put the whole article in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               A War Widow's Thoughts at Peace's Dawning\n\n                         (By James F. Clarity)\n\n       Belfast, Northern Ireland.--Pauline Hegney, the mother of \n     four young children whose husband was slain three and a half \n     years ago by Protestant paramilitaries on a Belfast street, \n     prays every day that the Government peace effort will work \n     and that there will be no more killings here in the name of \n     patriotism.\n       She is among the tens of thousands of survivors of the \n     3,172 Protestants and Roman Catholics who have been killed in \n     sectarian warfare here since 1969. She speaks with a soft \n     Ulster lilt and there is passion in her voice, but no hatred.\n       Her husband, Karl, an unemployed house painter, was gunned \n     down in the street on his way home from a pub. Both his widow \n     and the police say he had no involvement in the Irish \n     Republican Army. The police told her they had an idea who the \n     killers were, but no proof, she said. No one has been \n     arrested.\n       She was left with their four young children and a job at \n     the Europa Hotel in the city center, as head of the banquet \n     dining room staff. But the I.R.A. viewed the hotel as a major \n     economic target and bombed it frequently. The bombings often \n     shut it down, putting her out of work, sometimes for months.\n       The I.R.A. declares that it is fighting for Northern \n     Ireland's Catholics. Mrs. Hegney, who is Catholic, said she \n     prays for them, and for the Protestant guerrillas too.\n       She told her children that ``a sick man'' had killed their \n     father and that he was now in heaven with Granny, his mother. \n     Her daughter, Julie-Anne, said that at first she hated Granny \n     for taking him away and that she saw her father return to her \n     room one night. She said she wanted to die and go to heaven \n     with him. Lately Julie-Anne, who is not 8, says only, ``I \n     wish I could see him, mummy, for one wee minute.''\n       Mrs. Hegney joined a group of Catholic and Protestant \n     widows of guerrilla war victims, and they exchange their \n     feelings and problems.\n       But the cease-fires that have raised the hopes for peace \n     and for a normal life for most people in Northern Ireland \n     also left her and the other widows feeling depressed, she \n     said.\n       ``During the trouble, we were all in it together,'' she \n     said. ``Everyone in Belfast was affected. But when the peace \n     came, I felt isolated. Other people can get on with their \n     lives. We can't.''\n       Last October, as reports spread that the Protestant \n     guerrillas, following the lead of the I.R.A., were going to \n     call their own cease-fire, she hoped it would not be on Oct. \n     13, the third anniversary of her husband's killing, but it \n     was announced on that day.\n       ``It didn't feel right,'' she said. ``I was praying for \n     peace, but I didn't want it on that day.'' Now, she said, she \n     faces the prospect of seeing representatives of the \n     guerrillas become celebrated personalities as they approach \n     formal negotiations with the British and Irish Governments \n     and the other political parties in the North.\n       ``I don't like the idea that after they've killed so many \n     people, they'll be sitting down to say what the future will \n     be, when people like these destroyed my children's future. \n     But if it stops people being murdered, I've no objection.''\n       Her children still miss their father. Karl Jr., who is 14, \n     wants to be a lawyer. She said she asked him if he would \n     defend someone he knew to be guilty of a ``terrible crime.'' \n     Karl said: ``Would you serve him if he came into \n     [[Page S3656]] the Europa. You do what you're paid to do.'' \n     She shrugged.\n       ``I'll get through it,'' she said. ``I'm a struggler. I've \n     begun to write about it.''\n       In her account of the night her husband was killed, she \n     wrote: ``We never know what's to come for us, though, do we? \n     I put the boys to bed when their daddy went out. I went into \n     the kitchen and had a little laugh to myself when I saw the \n     saucepans sitting on the cooker. One was full of potatoes and \n     the other one had sprouts in it all ready for the Sunday. He \n     also had the roast cooked. I thought how organized my Karl \n     is.\n       ``A very curt male voice came on the phone saying he was a \n     police officer and asked if I could make my way to the police \n     station as my husband was in the hospital seriously ill. I \n     lost my mind at that moment and I don't think I have actually \n     found it all again.\n       ``The nightmare for me had only just begun. I went to see \n     Karl lying in that operating theater where he had died with \n     the doctors fighting to save his life. He lay there still and \n     cold, no life left in the body of the man who had taken the \n     core of me, loved me and made my life worth living. I thought \n     how could he leave me? What would I do without him? How was I \n     going to live without him?\n       ``I held Karl's hand and it was like holding the hand of a \n     wax dummy. It felt so strange. I didn't cry. I just asked him \n     to give me strength to get through the next few hours. I went \n     and sat at the top of the stairs waiting for the first of the \n     children to waken. I knew this would be our 5-year-old \n     daughter, Julie-Anne. She was wearing her little pink and \n     green pajamas and she still had her hair in pigtails from the \n     day before. She was just so beautiful.\n       ``What I was going to tell her was going to rob her of her \n     little innocent childhood. She came over to me with her wee \n     arms out and said, `Where's my daddy?' I sat her down on my \n     knee and told her that her daddy had gone up to heaven to see \n     his own mummy, her granny Nancy. `When's he coming back?' she \n     said. I explained to her that some sick man had shot her \n     daddy and that he had died and would not be coming back. She \n     had to blame somebody, God love her, so she started crying \n     and said she hated her granny.\n       ``I told our three little boys what had happened to their \n     lovely daddy. None of them spoke. Karl and Michael began to \n     cry. Mario just sat there. I think he was in deep shock. I \n     put my arms around all four of them and all but Mario cried \n     sorely for what we had lost.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me read something from the journal of a \nmother who lost her husband 3\\1/2\\ years ago. She wrote in her account:\n\n       We never know what's to come for us, though, do we? I put \n     the boys to bed when their daddy went out. I went into the \n     kitchen and had a little laugh to myself when I saw the \n     saucepans sitting on the cooker. One was full of potatoes and \n     the other one had sprouts in it all ready for the Sunday. He \n     also had the roast cooked. I thought how organized my Karl \n     is.\n       A very curt male voice came on the phone saying he was a \n     police officer and asked if I could make my way to the police \n     station as my husband was in the hospital seriously ill. I \n     lost my mind at that moment and I don't think I have actually \n     found it all again.\n\n  She went on to say how when she arrived her husband was there but no \nlonger alive, and speaks of her 5-year-old daughter awakening in the \nmorning. She said:\n\n       What I was going to tell her was going to rob her of her \n     little innocent childhood. She came over to me with her wee \n     arms out and said, ``Where's my daddy?''\n\n  Mr. President, there is more to it, of course, and it will be in the \nRecord. But it is a tale that I have heard from mothers and widows \nthroughout Northern Ireland.\n  And really to that 5-year-old daughter, and those other children, it \nmakes no difference whether the killer was Protestant or Catholic, \nwhether they were unionists or loyalists in their allegiances, the fact \nis, of course, the children have lost their father. Those who are left \nin the family find their lives unalterably altered, their hopes and \ndreams are dashed.\n  I only hope, Mr. President, the peace we now see--a still somewhat \ntenuous peace--in Northern Ireland might hold and that all the parties \ninvolved, all the parties involved, might make an effort to make the \npeace lasting; that those who feel that they have to hold to past \nprejudices or to some rigors of diplomacy that may have made sense in a \ndifferent age will now come together and start showing the kind of \nflexibility and willingness to talk to all parties, and all parties can \nsit down and talk together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3655-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3656-S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 328\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 328.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 110. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended for \n     assistance to or programs in the Democratic People's Republic \n     of Korea, or for implementation of the October 21, 1994, \n     Agreed Framework between the United States and the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea, unless specifically appropriated \n     for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment that I offer today is \nattached to H.R. 889, Department of Defense supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Specifically, the amendment, which I offer on behalf of myself and \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole, requires that funds to be used under \nthis act for implementation of the framework agreement, which was dated \nOctober 21, between the United States and the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea--that is North Korea--must be specifically \nappropriated for that purpose.\n  What the amendment would prohibit in the future is the following: It \nwould prohibit using emergency provisions to implement provisions of \nthe agreed framework with North Korea; second, it would prohibit using \nreprogrammed funds to implement the provisions of the agreed framework \nwith North Korea.\n  Mr. President, I feel the amendment is necessary because as my \ncolleagues will recall a number of Members joined Senator Dole and \nmyself in adding similar restrictive language in the last Congress to \nthe foreign aid appropriations bill and defense appropriations bill. \nAlthough both of those measures passed overwhelmingly, they were \nstripped at the conference on assurances from the administration that \nthe United States was not preparing to give aid to North Korea.\n  However, since signing of the agreed framework, the administration \nhas already seen fit to use $4.7 million in emergency Department of \nDefense funds to pay for the provision of heavy oil for the benefit of \nthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n  Further, the administration has asked for $10 million in reprogrammed \nDepartment of Energy funds to pay for the treatment of spent fuel in \nNorth Korea associated with their existing nuclear reactors. I have \nrecently learned that the administration is prepared to ask for an \nadditional $5.4 million of State Department funds to pay for startup \ncosts of an international consortium known as KEDO.\n  Many of us were dismayed that the administration chose to use \nemergency funds to pay for the provision of heavy oil--essentially \ngiving foreign aid to North Korea without congressional authorization, \nand despite all the restrictions in law prohibiting any assistance to \nthe DPRK. The administration lawyers downtown found the only provision \nthey could to get around congressional approval.\n   [[Page S3657]] This amendment would prohibit such actions in the \nfuture. The amendment prevents the administration from going around \nCongress again to find additional funds to assist North Korea. If the \nadministration is firmly convinced that such expenditures are in the \nnational security interests of the United States, then the \nadministration should first come up and ask for specific appropriations \nfor that purpose.\n  The overall cost of the provision of the two light-water reactors and \nhundreds of thousands of tons of interim energy to the North Koreans is \ngoing to cost billions of dollars. The light-water reactors alone are \nestimated to cost over $4 billion.\n  The administration has testified to committees of jurisdiction that \nthe U.S. portion of the costs of implementing the agreed framework will \nbe in the ``tens of millions of dollars.'' The President's fiscal year \n1996 budget requests $22 million specifically for the Korean Energy \nDevelopment Organization, which is KEDO. I am informed that the \nDepartment of Energy will seek to use fiscal year 1996 funds to support \nspent fuel related activities in North Korea.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer this amendment to all subsequent \nappropriations bills, if necessary.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I would also like to call my colleagues' \nattention to an event scheduled for tonight that will likely have far \nreaching implications for whether the agreed framework with North Korea \nwill be successful.\n  Tonight, something called KEDO is supposed to kick off with a \ncocktail party in New York. Some of my colleagues might be wondering \nwhat KEDO is and why is the administration seeking $27 million for its \nactivities. KEDO, the Korean Energy Development Organization, is the \ninternational consortium the administration pledged to put together \nunder the agreed framework. The agreed framework calls on the United \nStates ``to organize under its leadership an international consortium \nto finance and supply'' the light water reactor project in North Korea. \nAs I mentioned, this light water project is expected to cost at least \n$4 billion. Further, the United States ``representing the consortium, \nwill make arrangements to offset the energy foregone due to the \nfreeze'' of the existing North Korean nuclear power program. In other \nwords, we are expected to arrange to give North Korea free oil. Fifty \nthousand tons were delivered on January 21. One hundred thousand tons \nare scheduled to be delivered by October 21, 1995. Every year \nthereafter North Korea is expected to receive 500,000 tons until the \nlight water reactor project is complete.\n  In addition to these substantial commitments, North Korea is \ndemanding that the United States pay for about $1 billion worth of \nprojects to upgrade the electrical grid to make the light water reactor \nproject worthwhile. It is still unclear whether North Korean demands \nwill be met.\n  If the United States agreed to put together the international \nconsortium, who agreed to pick up all the bills? That is where the \naccountability gets cloudy. So far, only the United States has actually \nsigned any checks. First, the Department of Defense used nearly $5 \nmillion in Defense Department emergency funds to purchase the first \ntrench of oil. Then, the Department of Energy successfully sought $10 \nmillion in reprogrammed funds for treatment of spent fuel from the \ngraphite moderated reactors in North Korea. Now, additional funds are \nbeing sought from the Department of State--and none of the really \nexpensive projects has even started.\n  The South Korean Government has repeatedly said it will play the \ncentral role in the international consortium in financing the light \nwater reactor project. But, the South Koreans have wisely added that \nthis can only occur if North Korea agrees to accept South Korean \nreactors and if North Korea engages in substantive dialog with the \nSouth.\n  The Japanese Government has also said it will play an appropriate \nrole. But, the Japanese have been quick to add that their role is \ndependent on having\n widespread participation in KEDO, including a United States financial \nrole. I often remind my friends in Japan that we spend $2 billion per \nyear to keep 37,000 American troops on the Korean Peninsula. To this \nSenator that is a big contribution.\n\n  Ambassador Robert Gallucci, the lead U.S. negotiator of the agreed \nframework, has indicated that 20 nations are expected to attend the \ninauguration of KEDO, but he admitted that not all of the countries \nwill actually join KEDO. In fact, the only additional contributions \nannounced thus far are from New Zealand and Australia.\n  The test for KEDO--and the State Department--is whether KEDO is \nanything more than a convenient multinational cover for what could \nbecome a costly and dangerous U.S. obligation. The North Korea nuclear \nsituation should certainly be a multilateral and a regional issue. I \nhave always felt that South Korea and Japan should have been original \nsignatories to the agreed framework. I believe that the ASEAN nations \nshould all contribute. I firmly believe that China should be playing a \nsignificant financial role given China's historical role in aiding \nNorth Korea. Has the United States simply taken over that aid role from \nChina?\n  But the most disturbing aspect of KEDO for this Senator is that if \nKEDO fails to solicit the necessary funds, President Clinton has \nalready committed the United States to fulfilling the terms of the \nagreed framework. On October 20, President Clinton sent a letter to Kim \nJong Il, the new leader of North Korea, pledging to use the full powers \nof his office to provide the light water reactor project and interim \nfuel from the United States if other means fail. I ask that a copy of \nPresident Clinton's letter of assurance be submitted for the record. \nThe President acknowledged that his pledge was subject to ``the \napproval of the U.S. Congress,'' but no Member of Congress that I know \nwas briefed on the contents of this letter before it was sent.\n  This Senator continues to believe that if the President must come to \nCongress to seek funds for this multibillion-dollar deal, after having \nignored Congress in agreeing to the terms and conditions of the agreed \nframework, then Congress has the right to reexamine the conditions \nattached to that appropriation. I will continue to insist that North \nKorea allow immediate inspection of the two suspected nuclear waste \nsites that they have kept hidden from IAEA inspectors.\n  In addition, other issues should be addressed. I strongly believe \nthat North Korea must agree to joint recovery teams to search for the \n8,177 service personnel still listed as MIA from the Korean war. \nSecond, North Korea must agree to stop exporting ballistic missiles. \nFinally, North Korea must engage in meaningful dialog with South Korea. \nBut these are issues to take up at another day.\n  The purpose of my statement today is to urge my colleagues to remind \nthe administration of the congressional role in implementing the agreed \nframework and to call your attention to the inauguration of KEDO.\n  Thank you, and I wish the Chair a good day.\n  I have no further statement, Mr. President. I believe that both sides \nhave looked at this, and I defer to my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Stevens].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Murkowski \namendment? The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed that the amendment offered \nby my colleague has been discussed and is in a position now where it \ncan be accepted as an amendment to this bill.\n  I ask my friend from Hawaii if he agrees. I believe it applies to \nfunds in this act and, under that limitation, we are prepared to accept \nit.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am personally prepared to accept the \namendment, but I just received a request from the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Pell] that he would like to look over the amendment, and he \nwill be here shortly. So may I request that the acceptance be held up \nfor, say, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is no objection on my part and, I \nam sure, that of my colleague.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n   [[Page S3658]] Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator just yield? I wonder \nif the senior Senator will be on the floor and can proceed on my behalf \nbecause I have a hearing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall be glad to do that. I think the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Illinois want time. Does the \nSenator from Iowa seek the floor to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Iowa pardon me and allow me to \ninterrupt?\n  I am now informed that the amendment offered by my colleague from \nAlaska can be adopted at this point. There is no further objection, as \nI understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the junior Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 328) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my reasons for voting \nfor the bill, but also to state some concerns I have about the \ndirection that the Department of Defense is taking.\n  I want to commend, first of all, the Appropriations Committee and, of \ncourse, its chairman, Senator Hatfield, for doing what I think is a \nvery responsible thing, and that is to offset the cost of the readiness \nthrough rescissions, not from other Departments of Government, but from \nDefense Department programs.\n  I recently requested both the CBO and the General Accounting Office, \nGAO, to review the defense budget to determine whether there were \nprograms being funded that were not directly related to a strong \nmilitary and our national security operations and responsibilities.\n  CBO identified $64 billion falling into that category, and the GAO \nidentified $70 billion. Those are figures that cover the next 5 years. \nThey suggested that these programs were absolutely clearly not related \nto our national security, but they identified these programs for review \nto determine whether these programs should be continued in the defense \nbudget.\n  I am pleased to note that some of the programs contained in the \nreports that I requested have been used by the Appropriations Committee \nas offsets in this bill.\n  My view, in general, is that we should not only scrutinize nondefense \nspending in the defense budget but many defense-related items as well. \nSo along that line, I commend specifically Senators McCain and Warner, \nboth of them very respected members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, for their work in identifying defense programs that should \nbe cut or reduced, such as the B-2 bomber and the M-1 tank upgrade.\n  Because I firmly believe that we must closely scrutinize both \nmilitary programs, as Senator McCain and Senator Warner have suggested, \nbut also I go beyond that to other so-called nondefense spending, which \nis in the defense budget, before we consider increasing defense \nspending above this administration's proposed levels.\n And I hope you remember that for the 5 years in this year's budget, \nthe President's proposing $25 billion above what it was in his first \nbudget.\n\n  Now, I think that scrutinizing these programs is exactly what the \nAppropriations Committee has done in this bill. The committee found it \nunnecessary to increase defense spending to meet the readiness needs \nbecause it found alternative options to new spending.\n  Mr. President, last year I supported what we call in this body \ndefense firewalls so spending cannot be taken out of defense and spent \nsome place else. Many of my colleagues were concerned then that we \nmight rob the defense budget to pay for domestic programs. Rather, we \nbelieve that if defense spending is reduced, it should be used to cut \nthe deficit, not to increase domestic spending.\n  I also believe there is another corollary, because I believe that \ndefense firewalls should work both ways. We should not rob funding for \ndomestic programs to pay for defense spending either. There is clearly \nsufficient funding within the defense budget to meet readiness \nconcerns. It is simply a matter of the Pentagon prioritizing its \nfunding and improving its management. Because the Appropriations \nCommittee has not robbed the domestic spending accounts to pay for \ndefense readiness, I am willing to support this supplemental \nappropriations bill, and I commend the committee's work. I strongly \nurge the committee, however, to continue its good work and to resist in \nconference any efforts by the other body to pay for defense programs \nfrom domestic offsets.\n  Now, having said that, Mr. President, I wish to address briefly the \nissue of the obligations and expenditures of public money that has not \nbeen appropriated by the Congress and specifically to alert my \ncolleagues to some pending requests from the Department of Defense to \namend authorizing language, present statute, which I think gives them \nthe capability of spending money not appropriated by the Congress.\n  The bill before us, if approved, would provide $126.3 million to bail \nout two Army fiscal year 1994 appropriations accounts. They would do it \nthis way: $3.3 million for the military personnel account and $123 \nmillion for the operation and maintenance account. These two accounts \nare overobligated. They are overdrawn. They are in the red.\n  When the Army was ordered to deploy troops to Haiti, its financial \naccounts contained insufficient funds to cover the cost of the \noperation but we know that the Army deployed anyway. The Army spent \nmoney that it did not have. As a result of that operation, those \naccounts have negative balances. They are in the red to the tune of \n$126.3 million. If the $126.3 million is needed to meet legitimate \nobligations, then we in this Congress have no choice. We have to pony \nup the money because we have to pay our bills.\n  Well, under the Constitution, as we know, that is not the way the \nspending process of the Federal Government, including the Defense \nDepartment, is supposed to work because under our Constitution Congress \nhas the sole authority to decide when and to what extent public moneys \nare committed.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that the bill before us \ncontains unauthorized appropriations. Quite the contrary. The \nDepartment of Defense is authorized under the law to spend money in \nexcess of available appropriations. That authority is contained in the \nFeed and Forage Act that dates back to the Civil War.\n  The authority was justified in those days. Troops often went on long \nperiods without pay and had to forage to survive. Government chits were \nissued to exchange for food and redeemed later on for cash. The Feed \nand Forage Act is embodied in section 11 of title 41 of the United \nStates Code. The Feed and Forage Act was last invoked by the Department \nof Defense on September 19, 1994. That decision generated the request \nfor these $126.3 million that are in this bill. The authorizing \ndocuments were signed by Mr. Deutch, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and \nMr. Hamre, the Comptroller.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1994.\n     Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Departments, \n         Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Commander in \n         Chief, U.S. Special Operations Command.\n     Subject: Obligations in Excess of Appropriations for \n         Restoration of Democracy in Haiti.\n       The Department of Defense is likely to incur, in accordance \n     with applicable law, obligations in excess of available \n     appropriations to ensure the necessary funding to support \n     units of the U.S. Armed Forces conducting military operations \n     in connection with the restoration of democracy in Haiti.\n       I authorize the incurring of deficiencies for clothing, \n     subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, and \n     medical and hospital supplies, not in excess of the \n     necessities of the current year, under the authority of \n     Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 11), known as \n     the Feed and Forage Act. On my behalf, the Comptroller of the \n     Department of Defense shall make the reports to Congress \n     required by law with respect to the use of this authority.\n       [[Page S3659]] Also, pursuant to Section 2201(c) of Title \n     10 of the United States Code and the necessity based on \n     Presidential determination to increase the number of members \n     of the Armed Forces on active duty beyond the number for \n     which funds were provided in Appropriations acts for the \n     Department of Defense, I authorize the incurring of \n     deficiencies for costs of such personnel under Section \n     3732(a) of the Revised Statutes.\n       The Comptroller of the Department of Defense shall issue \n     such instructions as may be necessary to implement this \n     memorandum, including prescription of the dollar levels for \n     deficiencies by appropriations account.\n     John Deutch.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Comptroller of the\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1994.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the Secretary of Defense, \n     this is to advise that the Secretary of Defense has invoked \n     the authority granted by Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes \n     (41 U.S.C. 11) to authorize the Military Departments to incur \n     obligations in excess of available appropriations for \n     clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, \n     transportation, and medical and hospital supplies, not in \n     excess of the necessities of the current year in support of \n     U.S. military. He has also invoked the authority granted by \n     Section 2201(c) of Title 10 U.S.C. to authorize incurring \n     deficiencies for the costs of additional members of the Armed \n     Forces. This action will ensure that the Department of \n     Defense can support U.S. military operations in connection \n     with the restoration of democracy in Haiti.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John J. Hamre.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Feed and Forage Act allows military services to \nmake contracts and to purchase in advance of appropriations for \nclothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, and \nmedical supplies. The Feed and Forage Act gives the Department of \nDefense an open-ended authority to spend money almost without limits. \nThe Department of Defense can invoke the authority whenever it sees \nfit. No special condition or no special circumstances must be met \nbefore that law can be invoked. We need not be at war. We need not be \nengaged in military combat overseas for the Department of Defense to \ntap the Treasury without an appropriation. And there is essentially no \nlimit on the amount of money that can be spent. It is like, you might \nsay, Mr. President, an open line of credit.\n  Now, thank God, no other agency of the Federal Government has this \nkind of authority. Admittedly, in wartime, when our national security \nis threatened, this kind of authority may be essential. But, Mr. \nPresident, I am concerned about the use of this authority in peacetime, \nlike today. My concerns are fueled by a Pentagon proposal to expand the \nauthority beyond existing law. And remember, I just said that I wish to \ntell you what I am concerned about what the Department of Defense is \nthinking about doing.\n  The original fiscal year 1995 defense supplemental bill as submitted \nto Congress included a request for special legislative authority. It \nwould be numbered section 1863. Secretary of Defense Perry has referred \nto section 1863, and these are his words, as his ``readiness \npreservation authority.'' Readiness preservation authority. I ask \nunanimous consent to print that language in the Record, too, for my \ncolleagues to study.\n  There being no obligation, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Excerpt From the 1995 Supplemental Budget\n\n      (Supplemental language now requested, existing legislation)\n\n       Sec. 1863. During the last two quarters of the current \n     fiscal year, upon determination by the Secretary of Defense \n     that such action is necessary in the national interest, he \n     may, with the approval of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, incur necessary obligations to preserve the readiness \n     of the Armed Forces in excess of contract authority and \n     amounts available in appropriations of the Department of \n     Defense during the current fiscal year: Provided, That \n     obligations incurred shall be limited to those which are \n     required for essential readiness functions and activities of \n     the Armed Forces, including activities associated with \n     mission critical proficiency training, scheduled unit \n     exercises, the acquisition of spare parts that are critical \n     to the missions of the Armed Forces and such other activities \n     that the Secretary of Defense determines cannot be postponed \n     without a major impact on the readiness of the Armed Forces: \n     Provided further, That obligations incurred under the \n     foregoing authority shall not be more than 50 percent of the \n     total amount appropriated to the Department of Defense for \n     Operation and Maintenance, Budget Activity 1: Provided \n     further, That any proposal transmitted by the President to \n     the Congress to liquidate costs incurred under the provisions \n     of this section shall be accompanied by offsetting rescission \n     proposals, unless the President determines that emergency \n     conditions exist which preclude such rescissions: Provided \n     further, That the Congress shall be notified when funds are \n     made available for obligations under this authority.\n       This provision would allow the Department of Defense, with \n     OMB approval and Congressional notification, to make \n     obligations in excess of its total budget authority during \n     the last two quarters of 1995 to fund essential readiness \n     activities and functions. Excess obligations incurred under \n     this provision are limited to 50 percent of Budget Activity 1 \n     under the Operation and Maintenance title. Any proposal to \n     liquidate excess obligations incurred under this provision \n     must be accompanied by offsetting rescission proposals unless \n     the President determines that emergency conditions exist \n     which preclude rescissions.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Section 1863 is intended to build on and to expand the \nauthority granted in the Feed and Forage Act. The Department of Defense \nwould be authorized to obligate and authorized to spend money, in \nadvance of and in excess of congressional appropriations, in a great \nbig, broad area well beyond anything that the Feed and Forage Act has \never done. That area is defined then in 1863 as follows, and I quote.\n\n       Essential readiness functions and activities of the Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  ``Essential readiness functions and activities of the Armed Forces'' \nobviously covers a lot of territory. That conceivably covers just about \nanything and everything that the Department of Defense wants. I am \nthankful to report that section 1863 is not included in either version \nof the fiscal year 1995 supplemental bill, the bill that is before us \nnow in this body, the bill that passed the House of Representatives.\n  But I understand the issue will be revisited during consideration of \nthe fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill. That is why I want my \ncolleagues to study this issue, and if it is in there you can assume \nthat I am going to bring it to your attention and to highlight it and \nto make sure we are responsible as we consider that.\n  The practice of spending public money before it is appropriated by \nCongress in peacetime--I want to emphasize in peacetime as opposed to \nwartime--that practice needs to be reexamined. It needs scrutiny.\n  First, the practice is inconsistent with the Constitution. Section 9 \nof article I of the Constitution says, ``No money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriation made by law.'' That \nought to be crystal clear to everyone.\n  Second, the practice of doing this is inconsistent with the Anti-\nDeficiency Act, section 1341, title 31. This law, the Anti-Deficiency \nAct, causes it to be a felony to obligate or expend money before an \nappropriation is made, or in excess of amounts available in an \nappropriation account.\n  When Congress discovered, as we did in the late 1980's, that the \nPentagon was using $50 billion--what was called M accounts, nothing but \na slush fund--to circumvent the law and to hide the Anti-Deficiency Act \nviolations, the Congress shut down those M accounts. That year was \n1990.\n  The Department of Defense is always going to find some way to give \njust a little bit more freedom on the shuffling around of money. So I \nam afraid, with this new 1863, that DOD may try to use the Feed and \nForage Act and the proposed Readiness Preservation Authority, that is \n1863, for another end run around the Constitution and around the law. I \nam afraid the Pentagon may use this authority to hide deficient \naccounts that they are very qualified at doing.\n  In order to better understand this whole issue, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I am taking three specific steps. I have already started \nthis process.\n  First, I have asked the American Law Division at CRS for an opinion \non all pertinent legal points involved.\n  Second, I have asked the General Accounting Office to follow the \naudit trail on the $126.3 million in this bill to make sure the \ndisbursements are properly recorded in the books.\n  Third, I have asked the Department of Defense to tell me how much \nmoney has been spent under the Feed and Forage Act over the last 25 \nyears.\n  Once I have all this information, I should be in a better position to \nmake a final judgment about this matter, \n[[Page S3660]] about 1863, and the intent of the Secretary of Defense.\n  I will say this. He has tried to assure me that he is not trying to \nreestablish an M account sort of approach. That may be his sincere \nmotive, but I question whether or not the language of 1863 is \nspecifically tight enough so that will not happen. It might not happen \nunder his watch, but once it is on the books, there will be some \nSecretary of Defense who will find a way of doing it, because we had \nthese M accounts evolve over a period of the 1950's to 1990.\n  The idea of spending money before it is appropriated ought to bother \nevery one of us. It surely bothers me. It seems to undermine our \ncontrol of the purse strings and our system of checks and balances. \nWith a simple stroke of the pen, a Pentagon bureaucrat can write checks \nwith public money which has not been appropriated and then, thereafter, \npractically extort the funds from Congress to pay the bills.\n  Bureaucrats demand the money, and Congress coughs it up. That is just \nnot right. If we are ever to balance the budget--and that debate was \nlast week but the problem is still ahead of us--we need to put a tight \nlid on this kind of behavior, whether it is in the Department of \nDefense that I have spoken about or any agency of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Sesit)\n\n       London.--Undercut by years of U.S. deficits, the dollar's \n     days as the world's reserve currency may be drawing to a \n     close.\n       On Friday, eighteen central banks spent a half-billion \n     dollars in a futile attempt to resist that notion, following \n     a similar $250 million effort by the Federal Reserve the day \n     before. In Germany and Japan, finance ministries scolded \n     dollar bears as wrongheaded. In the U.S., Treasury Secretary \n     Robert Rubin tried talking up a strong dollar as ``in our \n     national interests.''\n       Traders, unperturbed by the fuss, continued to dump dollars \n     by the billions. As the greenback fell to another post-World \n     War II low against the yen and continued sliding against \n     major European currencies, foreign-exchange dealers and money \n     managers predicted more to come.\n       In trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar hit a new postwar \n     low of 92.75 yen and skidded to 1.3875 marks, just short of \n     its historical low of 1.3870 marks. About noon Monday, the \n     dollar was trading at 93.25 yen, and at l.4030 marks; \n     sterling was at $1.6473.\n       At its lowest point Friday, the U.S. currency touched a \n     postwar low of 93.75 yen, and a 29-month low against the \n     mark. By late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 94.05 \n     yen and 1.4240 marks, compared with 95.25 yen and 1.4415 \n     marks late Thursday. The pound, meanwhile, rose to $1.6295 \n     from $1.6135 a day earlier.\n       ``There is a firm belief that the dollar doesn't have the \n     reserve-currency status it once had,'' says Jeremy Hodges, \n     head of global foreign-exchange sales for Lehman Brothers \n     Inc. ``Globalization and diversification'' are progressively \n     eroding the dollars's mystique, he explains. ``More and more \n     people are adjusting their portfolios to include other \n     currencies--yen, deutsche marks, French francs, Canadian \n     dollars.''\n       Meanwhile, weaker currencies continue to lose out. Early \n     this morning, after an emergency meeting of the European \n     Union's monetary committee, the Spanish peseta and Portuguese \n     escudo were devalued, by 7% and 3.5% respectively, following \n     weeks of difficult trading.\n       Within the next three months, Mr. Hodges predicts the \n     dollar could tumble another 5%, to 1.35 marks, and another \n     4%, to 90 yen, although he cautions not to expect a freefall. \n     So far this year, the dollar has fallen 6% against the yen \n     and 8% against the mark.\n       The basic problem for the dollar is that there are just too \n     many of them sloshing around, says George Magnus, chief \n     economists at S.G. Warburg & Co. in London. The U.S. current \n     account deficit--a broad measure of trade in goods and \n     services plus certain financial transfers--is huge and \n     growing. In addition, ``there is still an underlying outflow \n     of investment capital'' as U.S. companies continue to invest \n     in plants and equipment overseas, he says.\n       ``And don't forget that the U.S. is the world's biggest \n     debtor nation, with external liabilities of $750 billion at \n     the end of 1994,'' he adds. Last week's defeat of a \n     constitutional amendment that would have required a balanced \n     budget by 2002 only underscored the country's lack of will to \n     reform its way.\n       What's more, Mr. Magnus argues, Fed policy isn't as tight \n     as many people suspect. The evidence: strong growth in U.S. \n     loan demand, increasing bank borrowing from the Fed and the \n     modest pickup in bank reserves since October. And, he added, \n     ``the Mexican bailout is going to result in the creation of \n     additional dollar reserves, either by the Fed, the Treasury \n     or both.''\n       Based on 10-year government-bond yields, U.S. inflation-\n     adjusted interest rates are 4.35%, compared with 5.4% in \n     Germany and 4.4% in Japan.

Berry)\n\n       The dollar continued to fall on international currency \n     markets yesterday, hitting a new low against the Japanese yen \n     for the third day in a row and weakening further against the \n     German mark.\n       Many foreign exchange experts said the dollar's weakness is \n     not just a temporary problem, but rather part of a long-term \n     downward trend against the mark and yen, although the dollar \n     is likely to rally from time to time.\n       There was broad agreement among experts that there is \n     little President Clinton, the Treasury Department or the \n     Federal Reserve can do to give the dollar a boost. \n     Coordinated purchases of dollars on Friday by the Fed and \n     other central banks around the world had almost no impact on \n     the currency's value.\n       In late New York trading yesterday, it took just 92.80 yen \n     to buy a dollar, down from 94.05 on Friday. Against the mark, \n     it took 1.4048 marks to buy a dollar, the lowest level in \n     more than two years, down from 1.4250 on Friday.\n       The reasons for the dollar's downward trend, the analysts \n     said, are complex and varied. Some are real, some are \n     psychological; some are as new as the financial crisis in \n     Mexico and some are as old as the tendency of Americans not \n     to save money.\n       First and foremost is the fact that the United States is \n     running a deficit with the rest of the world of more than \n     $150 billion a year in trade, tourism and similar \n     transactions, said economist L. Douglas Lee of NatWest \n     Washington Analysis.\n       That means that each year foreigners end up with $150 \n     billion that they may not wish to hold and so exchange for \n     another currency, driving down the dollar's value. In the \n     view of Lee and many other analysts, as long as the United \n     States keeps pushing that many dollars into foreign hands \n     every year, the currency has little chance of strengthening \n     in a fundamental way.\n       A second key reason for the recent weakness of the dollar \n     that many analysts cited is an abrupt shift in expectations \n     about the level of U.S. interest rates compared with those in \n     other countries, especially Germany.\n       ``The dollar's decline this year has coincided with the \n     evaporation of earlier expectations of future sharp increases \n     in U.S. short-term rates,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist \n     at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.\n       The level of interest rates is important for a currency \n     because higher rates can encourage investors to move their \n     money from one country to another. Until a few weeks ago, \n     many analysts and investors had expected that the Fed would \n     continue to raise interest rates as it did all last year to \n     cool off the U.S. economy and prevent a surge of inflation. \n     However, recent statistics suggest that U.S. economic growth \n     is slowing and many analysts are no longer looking for higher \n     rates.\n       A third major reason the dollar is being hammered is that \n     its value has been declining for many years compared with \n     German and Japanese currencies, and some foreign central \n     banks are switching their foreign exchange reserves out of \n     dollars.\n       ``The track record of the dollar in recent years has been \n     poor, and that's what these investors look at, the record,'' \n     said Scott E. Pardee, special adviser at Yamaichi \n     International (America) in New York. ``The U.S. economy is \n     doing fine, but dollars that have been in other hands for \n     many years are being converted into marks and yen.''\n       A fourth key development hurting the dollar, the analysts \n     said, is the political and financial crisis in Mexico, which \n     led the Clinton administration to forge a huge international \n     rescue package, with the United States putting up $20 billion \n     in loans and loan guarantees.\n       There is a widespread perception that the United States \n     will suffer in a variety of ways because of its close links \n     to Mexico, including a likely large decline in U.S. exports \n     that will make the U.S. trade deficit worse.\n       Yet another reason mentioned by the analysts is the \n     currency turmoil within Europe that led to a devaluation \n     yesterday of the \n     [[Page S3661]] Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo relative \n     to the mark, which is seen by investors and speculators as a \n     ``safe haven.''\n       Meanwhile, many Japanese firms are selling the dollars they \n     are earning from exports to the United States in exchange for \n     yen. They are using that yen to cover losses or operating \n     expenses at a time when Japanese banks are reluctant to make \n     new loans.\n       Analysts such as Lee noted that so long as Americans save \n     such a small portion of total national income that they \n     cannot finance the nation's investment costs--plus the \n     combined deficits of federal, state and local governments--\n     foreign investors must make up the difference. In an \n     accounting sense, the gap between saving and investment is \n     equal to the U.S. deficit in trade, tourism and other \n     transactions.\n       ``The way to address the problem is to do something to \n     bring savings and investment closer together--such as reduce \n     the federal [budget] deficit'', Lee said. And that pointed to \n     yet another reason for the dollar's weakness--last week's \n     Senate defeat of a constitutional amendment to require a \n     balanced budget, which ``was read as a negative by the \n     currency market,'' Lee said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 7, 1995]\n\n   Dollar Falls Against Yen and Mark, But United States Declines to \n                          Intervene in Market\n\n                           (By David Wessel)\n\n       Washington.--The dollar fell again yesterday against the \n     yen and mark, but U.S. officials kept their mouths shut in \n     public and didn't intervene in currency markets to support \n     the struggling currency.\n       The dollar set another post-World War II low against the \n     yen yesterday, touching 92.70 yen in Asia before rebounding \n     to 92.90 late yesterday, down from 94.05 late Friday. The \n     dollar, flirting with its postwar low against the mark of \n     1.3870 set in September 1992, was trading at 1.4048 marks \n     yesterday, down from 1.4240 Friday.\n       Having failed to stop the dollar's slide with rhetoric and \n     money, the U.S. government simply watched nervously \n     yesterday. At earlier moments of market turmoil, Treasury \n     Secretary Robert Rubin, once a currency trader himself, has \n     advised: ``Stay calm and focus on the fundamentals.'' \n     Apparently he was doing just that yesterday. Neither he nor \n     his aides would talk about the currency.\n       While Mr. Rubin was consulting with his German and Japanese \n     counterparts, U.S. officials are holding off on further \n     dollar-buying efforts until the officials sense such \n     intervention is likely to work. Having demonstrated that the \n     U.S. is unhappy about the sliding dollar and convinced the \n     market has gone too far, the officials may now just wait for \n     the market to bring the dollar back up.\n\n\n                              two options\n       If words and intervention won't work, then the government \n     has only a couple of other options should it decide to try to \n     strengthen the dollar: The Federal Reserve could raise short-\n     term interest rates to try to attract global investors, or \n     President Clinton and Congress could reduce the federal \n     budget deficit to shore up confidence in U.S. macro-economic \n     management. Neither policy change appears imminent.\n       Economists' list of explanations for the dollar's decline \n     is growing longer every day. Rudiger Dornbusch, a \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, figures that \n     expectations about interest-rate trends in the U.S. and \n     Germany account for 70% of the dollar's woes. Based on \n     comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed \n     officials, the markets have decided that the Fed isn't going \n     to raise short-term rates anytime soon--and might even cut \n     them. That tends to draw investors to the mark.\n       The failure of the U.S. to reduce further its government \n     budget deficit accounts for 30%, he estimates. The recent \n     slump in the dollar coincides with the Senate's rejection of \n     a constitutional amendment that would have required a \n     balanced budget. ``Germany is balancing the budget without \n     big talk over the next four years. We are widening the \n     deficit with big talk,'' Mr. Dornbusch said. ``They are \n     concerned about inflation at 2\\1/2\\%. We declare it dead at \n     3\\1/2\\%.'' Global investors, not surprising, prefer marks to \n     dollars, he reasons.\n       ``If you need a third [reason for the weak dollar],'' he \n     said, referring to Mexico's economic crisis, ``the mess in \n     our backyard gives you one more reason.''\n       Other economists and traders, however, aren't so confident \n     that they can discern the causes of the dollar's fall. ``I'm \n     puzzled. I didn't expect it. I don't claim to know [the \n     reasons] after the event,'' said Deutschebank economist \n     Norbert Walter. ``Wall Street doesn't like Washington. \n     Everything that happens is considered to be negative for the \n     dollar.''\n\n\n                       global lack of confidence\n\n       The U.S., as Mr. Rubin made clear last week, sees ``a \n     strong dollar'' to be in ``its national interest.'' A falling \n     dollar does help U.S. exporters by making their goods more \n     attractive overseas, but it tends to push up import prices. \n     It also tends to push\n      up long-term interest rates in the bond market even if the \n     Fed doesn't move the short-term rates it controls. A \n     weaker dollar also suggests a global lack of confidence in \n     the U.S. and its government, hardly a welcome development \n     for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Greenspan. In Germany and \n     particularly in Japan, strong currencies could hurt \n     exports at a time when both nations are counting on them \n     to buoy economic growth.\n       While the dollar is sinking against the mark and yen, it \n     has strengthened against two of its major trading partners. \n     The Canadian dollar closed at 1.4168 Canadian dollars to the \n     U.S. dollar yesterday, compared with 1.3557 Canadian dollars \n     to the U.S. dollar a year ago. The Mexico peso closed at \n     6.575 pesos to the dollar, compared with 3.25 pesos to the \n     dollar a year ago. As a result, the value of the dollar \n     against all its trading partners hasn't fallen much, reducing \n     the risks of imported inflation and making it easier for the \n     Fed to ignore the weakness against the yen and mark.\n       Until the dollar plunged last week, the Fed had been widely \n     expected to hold short-term interest rates steady when \n     officials hold their next scheduled meeting on March 28. And \n     if signs of a slowing pace of growth continue to emerge, the \n     Fed isn't likely to raise rates at that meeting. Just \n     yesterday, Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder, speaking to \n     bankers here, tentatively predicted the sort of ``soft \n     landing''--an economy that slows, but not too much--that \n     central bankers are always trying to engineer. ``There are \n     indications, but certainly not definitive sort of \n     indications, that makes me think we have a fighting chance of \n     achieving this sort of soft landing.''\n       With the dollar weak, strong evidence that the U.S. economy \n     hasn't cooled off--which could come as soon as this Friday's \n     Labor Department report on employment in February--could tilt \n     the Fed toward higher rates. Mr. Blinder wouldn't talk about \n     the dollar, but House Banking Chairman Jim Leach (R., Iowa) \n     did: ``Obviously a weak dollar enhances prospects of \n     [interest rates] going up again,'' he said. ``No one likes \n     that. But no one likes a weak dollar either.''\n       Economists who are adherents to the monetarist school, \n     gathered in Washington yesterday, cautioned the Fed against \n     raising rates to defend the dollar. ``Why is the dollar going \n     down? We don't know. But it isn't a monetary phenomenon,'' \n     said Lee Hoskins, chairman of Huntington National Bank and \n     former Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank president. ``What \n     should the Fed do? Nothing.''\n       But David Hale, economist at Chicago's Kemper Corp., said \n     the Fed could help the dollar by making clear it doesn't \n     intend to cut rates soon.\n       Mr. Leach also said that the dollar ``underscores the \n     absolutely mandatory need to get the fiscal house in order so \n     that the monetary side doesn't have to do everything.'' \n     Economists reason that a move to shrink the U.S. budget \n     deficit would increase overall savings in the U.S. and that, \n     in turn, should reduce what is known as the current-account \n     deficit, the broadest measure of international financial and \n     trade flows. That big and growing deficit is, economists say, \n     a major long-run factor in the dollar's weakness.\n       Although the defeat of the balanced budget amendment was \n     seen in Washington as a sign that Congress is less likely to \n     attack the deficit this year, traders and economists disagree \n     about its impact on the dollar. ``You can point to that as a \n     trigger,'' said Virginia Parker of Ferrell Capital \n     Management, Greenwich, Conn. ``But the dollar has been in a \n     pretty significant downturn since the end of 1994.''\n       Mr. Hale suggested the defeat ``played a role at the \n     margin,'' but called other factors more important. Most are \n     beyond the Clinton administration's control.

There's no talk from the Administration. So \n     traders are wondering: `Where's the bottom for the dollar?'''\n       Such questions spread to the stock market * * *.\n       The punishing treatment of America's long-trusted currency, \n     combined with investors' decided preference for German marks \n     and Japanese yen Tuesday, startled veteran \n     [[Page S3662]] traders who wondered aloud how the episode \n     would unfold.\n       ``It's pandemonium, isn't it?'' said Robert A. White, \n     senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. \n     ``It's shocking to a lot of us old-timers in the market to \n     see the dollar ostensibly removed as the reserve currency of \n     the world.''\n       The dollar hasn't suffered alone. In what has become a \n     massive, global shuffling of money, currencies of Canada, \n     Mexico, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and other nations have all \n     been walloped. Germany's surging mark, meanwhile, has reached \n     post-World War II highs against the British pound, French \n     franc, Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Swedish krona.\n       In New York trading Tuesday, the dollar closed at 1.3702 \n     marks, down from 1.4048 late Monday. It closed at 90.05 yen \n     after falling as low as 89.05, down sharply from 92.80, the \n     previous post-World War II low.\n       The buck has slipped 6% against the mark and yen this month \n     alone, compared to an 11% loss against both currencies for \n     all of last year.\n       ``What can we do to stabilize the dollar or cause it to go \n     up without doing long-term economic damage?'' asked Monica \n     Williams, vice president and foreign exchange manager at \n     Sanwa Bank California.\n       While that answer seemed elusive Tuesday, economists cited \n     several reasons for the problem that has erupted in recent \n     days. German interest rates are expected to rise this year, \n     benefiting lenders. By contrast, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     recently hinted that U.S. rates were at or near their peak \n     levels.\n       The prospect of a ``soft landing'' for the U.S. economy--\n     slower growth but no recession--suggests that U.S. consumers \n     will continue to gobble up imports, keeping the nation's \n     trade balance deep in the red this year.\n       What is more, highly visible news from Washington seems to \n     have convinced speculators that the dollar is a less \n     attractive haven than in the past. Traders have repeatedly \n     mentioned the rescue plan for Mexico and the defeat of the \n     balanced-budget amendment in Congress in recent days as \n     reasons to abandon the dollar.\n       ``There's a complete lack of faith in the Fed, the \n     Administration and in Congress to get the budget in order, to \n     get the trade balance in order,'' White contended.\n       The controversy spread on Capitol Hill Tuesday, as members \n     of Congress worried about the dollar and also complained \n     about the rescue plan for Mexico, entailing $20 billion of \n     U.S. loans and loan guarantees for the peso.\n       ``It appears that the currency speculators, the vultures of \n     the world, are beginning to circle around the U.S. currency \n     because they seem to sense that our currency is vulnerable,'' \n     Rep., Dana Rohrabacher (R--Huntington Beach) said during a \n     hearing of the House International Relations Committee. * * *\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Yesterday's Washington Post, in an article by John Berry, \n``Dollar Keeps Falling Against Yen and Mark,'' quotes a Washington \neconomist, L. Douglas Lee:\n\n       ``The way to address the problem is to do something to \n     bring savings and investment closer together--such as reduce \n     the federal [budget] deficit,'' Lee said. And that pointed to \n     yet another reason for the dollar's weakness--last week's \n     Senate defeat of a constitutional amendment to require a \n     balanced budget, which ``was read as a negative by the \n     currency market,'' Lee said.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, the day before yesterday, in an article by \nMichael Sesit, ``Currency's Slide May Mark End of Reserve Role.''\n\n       The basic problem for the dollar is that there are just too \n     many of them sloshing around, says George Magnus, chief \n     economist at S.G. Warburg & Co. in London. The U.S. current \n     account deficit--a broad measure of trade in goods and \n     services plus certain financial transfers--is huge and \n     growing. In addition, ``there is still an underlying outflow \n     of investment capital'' as U.S. companies continue to invest \n     in plants and equipment overseas, he says.\n\n  Here I might add what encourages that outflow is when you do not have \na decline in interest here and when it is more productive, when you get \nmore for your capital, to invest in other countries. The balanced \nbudget amendment, every projection said, would send interest rates in \nthis country down.\n  Then the article continues, quoting this London economist:\n\n       ``And don't forget that the U.S. is the world's biggest \n     debtor nation, with external liabilities of $750 billion at \n     the end of 1994,'' he adds. Last week's defeat of a \n     constitutional amendment that would have required a balanced \n     budget by 2002 only underscored the country's lack of will to \n     reform its ways.\n\n  Here is another one, an article from yesterday's Wall Street Journal, \nquoting Rudiger Dornbusch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology \neconomist, listing the budget deficit accounts as one of the two major \nreasons for the drop in the dollar.\n\n       The recent slump in the dollar coincides with the Senate's \n     rejection of a constitutional amendment that would have \n     required a balanced budget. ``Germany is balancing the budget \n     without big talk over the next four years. We are widening \n     the deficit with big talk,'' Mr. Dornbusch said.\n\n  And today's Los Angeles Times, ``Dollar Again Plunges, Setting Off \nStock Selloff.''\n  In the middle it says,\n\n       ``It's pandemonium, isn't it?'' said Robert A. White, \n     senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. \n     ``It's shocking to a lot of us old-timers in the market, to \n     see the dollar ostensibly removed as the reserve currency of \n     the world.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       * * * highly visible news from Washington seems to have \n     convinced speculators that the dollar is a less attractive \n     haven than in the past.

It just would \nnot have any kind of an impact. In a $6 trillion economy that is not a \nbig thing.\n  But when you compound it with our failure to address our fiscal \ndeficit, then the little things become big things.\n  I hope we learn the lesson. My hope is that 1 of the 34 who voted \nagainst the balanced budget amendment will recognize that a great \nmistake has been made, and that we are harming our country right now. \nWe are now talking about calling on the Federal Reserve and many other \nnations to come to the rescue of the dollar, and that is going to cost \nus a great deal.

I ask that it be read in full.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 329.\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON EMERGENCY AND EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES\n\n       (a) In General.--Funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available to the Department of Defense may not be obligated \n     under section 127 of title 10, United States Code, for the \n     provision of assistance, including the donation, sale, or \n     financing for sale, of any time, to a foreign country that is \n     ineligible under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the \n     Arms Export Control Act to receive any category of \n     assistance.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The limitations in subsection (a) \n     shall apply to obligations made on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the amendment speaks for itself.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment to funds appropriated for title \n10, section 127 of the United States Code makes the point that if and \nwhen a country is not allowed to receive foreign aid from the United \nStates, then, under the provision, that country would not be allowed to \nbenefit from any of the funds provided by the authority of section 127.\n  Section 127 authorizes the Department of Defense to provide for ``any \nemergency or extraordinary expense \n[[Page S3663]] which cannot be anticipated or classified.'' It is a \nslush fund for unanticipated expenses; the Department does not have to \nask for congressional approval to expend any of the money.\n  Let me add that I might not even have known about this little \nauthority had the State Department not abused it so clearly in January \nof this year. At the Department of State's insistence, the Secretary of \nDefense authorized an almost $5 million expenditure from this account \nto purchase fuel oil for our enemy of 40 years, North Korea. Not once, \nsince 1938 when the Department was first allowed to spend money for \nemergencies, has this fund ever been used for anything like this.\n  So why did they use it this time? To get around Congress. According \nto a senior U.S. defense official who spoke to the Washington Post on \nJanuary 6 of this year, the United States had to use this authority \nbecause the Department of Defense ``had the funds on hand and no U.S. \nallies agreed to contribute money for the oil * * *'' It was not an \nemergency. It was simply one of the few accounts the State Department \ncould raid to support its buy out of North Korea without having to come \nto Congress for approval.\n  Congress has voted time and again that North Korea should not be \neligible to receive aid because it is a known sponsor of international \nterrorism, it is a Communist country, and it is a country known to \ntrample the human rights of its own citizens. Just last year, Congress \nvoted to prohibit all direct and indirect assistance for North Korea. \nAnd yet, the administration found some way to get around all of this. \nAnd they abused DOD authorities in the process. My amendment aims to \nensure that will not happen in the future.\n  It is hard for me to imagine how there could be opposition to this \none. If we are all in agreement that terrorists and drug traffickers \nshould not get foreign aid from AID, then why should they be able to \nget foreign aid from the Department of Defense? My amendment is not \nretroactive and it would not prevent the Secretary of Defense from \nusing emergency moneys the way they have been used since 1938. What it \ndoes is shore up one of the gaping loopholes in the way we provide \nforeign aid to other countries.\n  Mr. President, I hope to move my amendment expeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I think the amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, speaking in behalf of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I am happy to report that we \nhave studied this amendment. We find it proper. We accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 329) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to \nan article in this morning's Washington Post that I shall place in the \nRecord. It is an op-ed written by myself. It involves the subject of \nhow public broadcasting could become self-sufficient.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 8, 1995]\n\n                       Reality-Based Broadcasting\n\n                          (By Larry Pressler)\n\n       ``Public broadcasting is under attack!'' ``Congress wants \n     to kill Big Bird!'' These and other alarmist cries have been \n     common in recent weeks. The problem is they are lies. That's \n     right, lies. I tried to conceive of a more polite way to say \n     it. I could not. With rare exceptions the press largely has \n     ignored the specifics of the position taken by members of \n     Congress seeking to reinvent public broadcasting.\n       I have struggled to make my position clear. Yet the \n     misrepresentations continue. I am convinced many simply do \n     not care to report the facts--facts they do not find as \n     interesting as the scenarios they create. That is too bad. \n     The average American taxpayer would find the facts extremely \n     interesting.\n       As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation. I am not seeking to destroy public \n     televisions and radio. I am a strong supporter of public \n     broadcasting, both in my home state of South Dakota and \n     nationally. Pull the plug? Absolutely not. Rather, my plan \n     would expand opportunities and save taxpayer dollars.\n       Why do I seek change? Because times have changed. Today's \n     electronic media are vastly different from those of the \n     1960s, when the current system of federal subsidies for \n     public broadcasting was established. The old theory of \n     ``market failure'' for educational programming is completely \n     untenable in today's environment. Educational and cultural \n     programs can and do make profits when their quality is good \n     and marketing astute. The only money losers in today's \n     arrangement are the taxpayers.\n       A Feb. 24 Post editorial stated it is time for the public \n     broadcasting industry to face reality. The issue no longer \n     should be whether federal subsidies for public broadcasting \n     will be cut. I could not agree more. Congress now is debating \n     when and how much. The House Appropriations subcommittee on \n     labor, health and human services already has cut the public \n     broadcasting budget. The House leadership promises more to \n     come. I fully expect the Senate to follow suit.\n       Instead of crying over public cash, it would be more \n     prudent for public broadcasting executives to use their \n     talents and resources developing the numerous potential \n     sources of revenue available to replace the federal subsidy \n     rather than continuing to fan the flames of fear and \n     exaggeration. As captains of a major corporation, their \n     responsibilities should be clear. The Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting (CPB), National Public Radio (NPR) and the \n     Public Broadcasting System (PBS) need to learn to stand on \n     their own feet.\n       To help in that effort, I recently provided the chairman of \n     the board of CPB with a plan to end its dependency on federal \n     welfare in three years. Ideas to end CPB's addiction to \n     taxpayer dollars include:\n\n\n                           Profits from sales\n\n       CPB should renegotiate sales agreements and improve future \n     agreements to get a larger share of the sales of toys, books, \n     clothing and other products based on its programming. In \n     1990, Barney-related products retailed at $1 billion! Steps \n     have been taken by the CPB board to improve its share of such \n     sales. More should be done.\n\n\n                    Make the most of new technology\n\n       Use of new compressed digitization technology would permit \n     existing noncommercial licensees to expand to four or five \n     channels where once they had only one. Public broadcasting \n     stations could rent, sell or make use of the additional \n     channels for other telecommunications and information \n     services.\n\n\n                             End redundancy\n\n       At least one-quarter of public television stations overlap \n     other public television stations' signal areas. Public radio \n     also suffers from the inefficiencies of redundancy. Ending \n     this overlap and selling the excess broadcast spectrum would \n     provide substantial revenues to public broadcasting.\n\n\n                            Switch channels\n\n       Moving public television stations from costly VHF channels \n     to less costly UHF channels in certain markets would provide \n     a substantial source of new revenue.\n\n\n                  Team with other information services\n\n       CPB could increase commercial arrangements in the computer \n     software markets and with on-line services.\n       These are only a few of the ways in which the CPB could \n     reinvent itself into a self-sufficient corporation for the \n     '90s and, indeed, for the next century. Ending federal \n     dependency does not end public broadcasting. Today's subsidy \n     amounts to only 14 percent of the industry's spending! \n     Indeed, my current plan asks the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting to end its dependency on federal welfare in \n     three years--that's one year more than what current proposals \n     would give welfare recipients to get off federal assistance.\n       It would be tragic if the public broadcasting industry \n     ignores its responsibilities when the federal budget is in \n     crisis. It also would be tragic if the industry spurns \n     exciting opportunities in new markets and technologies. \n     Perhaps most tragic of all, however, would be continued \n     retrenchment from public broadcasting executives crying, ``It \n     can't be done.'' It can be done. It should be done.\n\n   [[Page S3664]] Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I have felt strongly \nthat the Corporation for Public Broadcasting does not need Federal \ndollars. I serve as chairman of the committee that oversees the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. The public broadcasting sits on a \ntreasure trove of opportunities that will enable it to become self-\nsufficient.\n  I have had some disagreements with the Washington Post over the \nreporting on this issue, and I thank them for running my article this \nmorning. My article explains five ways public broadcasting on a \nnational level can be funded without taxpayers' dollars.\n  Now, remember that most State public radio and TV organizations are \nfunded by State legislatures and by contributors. My concerns are about \ninside-the-beltway operations here, where a system has sprung up that I \nfeel is self-serving. A significant amount of Federal funds does not \nget out to the States. Federal money that is sent out ends up coming \nright back to Washington.\n  In my op-ed, I point out that there are a number of ways that \nnational public broadcasting can make money. No. 1, they can get a \nhigher percentage of ancillary sales of products based on programs that \nappear on taxpayer-funded public broadcasting. They can also market \nmuch of their product through digital compression, and making \nprogramming available for sale through other parts of the information \nsuperhighway.\n  They can also sell or rent some of their spectrum in signal areas \nwhere there is redundancy and overlap. Indeed, digital compression also \nfrees up spectrum that could be rented or sold for other \ntelecommunications and information services. They already have what \nthey call enhancements--others might call them advertisements--and they \nhave fundraisers.\n  Mr. President, I support public broadcasting. I have been a \ncontributor to public broadcasting in the past. My colleague in the \nHouse, Newt Gingrich, also has assisted a public broadcasting station \nin his home State of Georgia during a recent fundraising drive. But \nwhat this Senator is concerned about--and I speak only for myself--is \nthe inside-the-beltway system that has grown up.\n  That money is not getting out to the States' public broadcast radio \nand TV. It is sent out, but much of it gets sent right back to \nWashington to pay for PBS or NPR programming. I would rather they have \nmore options. Some might want to buy programming from the Learning \nchannel or Arts and Entertainment or the Disney Channel or the History \nchannel. There is a lot of this kind of programming being made for \nprofit, and I commend them.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will take \nnote of this article. Because regardless of my position on this issue, \neven the Washington Post has also pointed out in another editorial that \nthe days when public broadcasting is funded by the Federal Government \nare coming to an end. I have suggested five ways they can fund \nthemselves without Federal assistance.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We legislate regularly on every appropriations bill. \nThe Appropriations Committee itself reports out legislation on just \nabout every appropriations bill. But let it be known, if such a point \nof order is raised, it is a ruse to do nothing about Fidel Castro in \nCuba. Anybody voting to support that point of order will be voting to \ndo nothing about Fidel Castro.\n  True enough, sooner or later, we will get to it in the normal process \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am the Chairman. But I \ndo not want to delay one more day for the removal of Fidel Castro from \nCuba. He is a tyrant, a Communist tyrant who has been so cruel in his \ntreatment of his own people.\n  So I wish to forewarn Senators that any point of order based on this \namendment's being legislation on an appropriations bill is nothing but \na ruse. You cannot get to it any other way, so you are going to try to \nget it defeated on a point of order. I hope that the Senate will not \nbuy that turkey because it is not justified. I reiterate, again and \nagain as Franklin Roosevelt used to say, every appropriations bill that \ncomes through this Chamber has legislation in it, often put there by \nthe Appropriations Committee itself.\n  So do not be deceived. A point of order is just a ruse to defeat this \namendment when no other avenue of defeat is available to any Senator \nraising such a point of order.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it does not take a great economic wizard \nor professor to know that some deeply troubling things are taking place \nwith the American economy. So I am going to address myself to a couple \nof points, because when we see a 10-percent drop in the value of the \ndollar against some foreign currencies, the dollar going from close to \n100 yen per dollar to below 90, and now so-called stabilizing at or \nabout 90, this should be very, very troubling to people.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to stand up and fight \nfor the American taxpayers--the men and women who must work harder and \nharder just to make ends meet.\n  Last month, President Clinton ignored the will of the American people \nto bail out a mismanaged Mexican Government and global currency \nspeculators. That was wrong.\n   [[Page S3665]] Now that the dollar is in a free fall, Congress must \nclosely examine the administration's raid on our Exchange Stabilization \nFund to bail out Mexico. That fund, known as ESF, is supposed to be \nused to strengthen the dollar. It was never intended to prop up either \nthe Mexican peso or foreign currency.\n  The American taxpayers and the American dollar have taken a double \nhit. First, the failure of the balanced budget amendment has sent a \nclear signal to the economic markets that we do not have the courage to \ncut the deficit and strengthen our economy.\n  And then, add to that, the President of the United States out \ncampaigning against the balanced budget amendment, telling the world's \neconomic markets that we are not serious about reducing our deficit. If \nwe do not get the Federal deficits under control, we are going to be \nMexico II.\n  It is ironic, Mr. President, that here we are fighting to stabilize \nMexico's peso and our dollar is just in free fall. Oh, we have propped \nit up for a while. But what the marketplace is telling us is, if you \ncontinue this, if you do not have the courage to get your house in \norder, you will be Mexico II.\n  It is ironic that we spend as much time as we have with Mexico, the \nPresident lobbying Members of this Congress to support loan guarantees, \nfirst $40 billion, now we have $20 billion, and campaigning against a \nbalanced budget amendment that would do something that would have an \nimpact to strengthen the American dollar, to cut the deficits, to bring \ninterest rates down. And now we are faced with just the opposite.\n  The second tough hit we took was the administration's blatant \ndisregard of the will of the governed when they opened up our Treasury \nto $20 billion of our taxpayers' money.\n  Now, who does that money go to? Where is it being spent? There is not \none Member of this Congress who can tell us how that money is being \nspent. There is not one Member of this Congress who can say that the \nMexican Government is not still continuing to print pesos.\n  Why are we doing this? Who is getting paid off? Who is getting the \nmoney down there?\n  We just read where we have the man who was murdered, the No. 2 man in \nthe Mexican Government, his brother-in-law ran away and they found he \nhas $6.5 million in the bank, American dollars.\n  Is that what we are doing? We are not talking about a democracy. That \nis a corrupt, dictatorial government. Those elections are a farce. It \nis about time we ponied up and told the people the truth.\n  Never before has a President sent $20 billion from our Exchange \nStabilization Fund to bail out a foreign country. This is not the \nPresident's personal piggy bank.\n  Mr. President, Congress must not stand on the sidelines while the \nadministration allows the dollar to fall in a failed attempt to save \nthe peso and a failed administration policy toward Mexico. Congress has \nan obligation to insist that the administration account for its \nactions.\n  The Banking Committee will hold hearings tomorrow and Friday on \nMexico and on the administration's use of the funds to bail out Mexico \nand the impact of Mexico on the dollar. We have an obligation to \ndetermine what the administration knew about Mexico and when did the \nadministration know it. We have an obligation to investigate whether \nthe administration's inaction or silence caused the crisis or \nexacerbated it. We have an obligation to find out if this \nadministration advised Mexico to devalue the peso.\n  The vast majority of Mexicans, Mr. President, deeply resent the \nClinton administration's meddling in their affairs. There is a grave \nrisk that the Mexican people will blame the United States for Mexico's \neconomic meltdown.\n  Could you imagine if your interest rates on your home went from 20 \npercent on the mortgage to 85 percent and you were told that is because \nthe Americans have insisted on these new austere measures? Is that \ndesigned to gain us respect and confidence from the Mexican people?\n  The Mexican economic policy should be set in Mexico and not in \nWashington, DC.\n  The President has set a terrible precedent. What happens next time \nthe peso collapses? What happens when some other country hits an \neconomic currency collapse? Does the American taxpayer come forward and \nbail them out? What happens if our neighbors to the north have serious \neconomic problems? We gave $20 billion or made it available to Mexico. \nCertainly Canada is every bit as important, and historically has been \nvery close to this country.\n  Can we afford to bail out the global currency speculators every time \na foreign currency collapses? Who will bail out the United States if we \ncollapse under a mountain of debt? The Japanese? The Germans? I doubt \nit.\n  Make no mistake about it. The time for Congress to act has come. I \nunderstand that, as of March 3, the Mexican Government has already \ndrawn down $3 billion of the first $20 billion and it will draw down \nanother $7 billion by the end of June.\n  Before Mexico draws down further funds, and particularly in view of \nthe deteriorating situation in Mexico, I think Congress must reassert \nits right and its prerogatives with regard to this matter.\n Congress must consider whether or not we should amend the ESF statute.\n\n  The President was wrong to go around Congress to bail out Mexico, and \nalthough I recognize that the Secretary of the Treasury must have some \ndiscretion in administering these funds, Congress must have the final \nsay on the spending of $20 billion of taxpayers' money on what amounts \nto foreign aid.\n  The Constitution says we have to appropriate. This was just a \nmechanism and a vehicle to get around this, a loophole. Never intended \nfor these purposes. Now that the dollar is under assault, the American \npeople have a right to know the full facts. More of our money is being \nshipped to Mexico, and before it is being shipped, what is going to be \ntaking place with that money? Mr. President, we must fight for the \nAmerican taxpayers, not for mismanaged foreign governments and global \ncurrency speculators.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, let me say again that what we have seen \nis a misuse of this fund. Mr. President, that fund was never set up to \nbe a guarantor or guarantee for foreign currencies. There was no \nprohibition, but it certainly was not set up for that purpose.\n  It seems to me that Congress has an absolute obligation, at the very \nleast, to see how those moneys are being utilized and that the \nadministration cannot hide behind a shield of some kind of executive \nimmunity; that certainly at the very least we should know what \nconditions are being imposed as it relates to the money being drawn \ndown, whether or not Mexico is complying, whether or not it was \npractical for those conditions that are being set out to be \nimplemented.\n  Is it practical to raise interest rates to a height where we may have \na revolution in the country? What about the stability of the Mexican \nGovernment? All of these are questions that are absolutely mandatory. \nWe have a responsibility. The Government may have used this loophole--\nthe President and the administration--but we have an absolute \nobligation to see how these funds are spent, at the very least, if not \namend the statute, to see that this kind of invasion of the Treasury \nwithout congressional authority is never undertaken again. We intend to \npursue that.\n  Mr. President, I think this should be very disturbing to all Members \nof Congress--Democrats and Republicans. There is no accountability. We \nare fighting to cut the budget. Yet here is $20 billion, and I daresay, \n$3 billion at least has been spent. We have not been notified how it \nhas been utilized, nor whether this is just more money going to more \ncorrupt officials, to more speculators.\n  Whether or not the American people have had a say in this, seems to \nme to be of some consequence and some importance. We, as their \nrepresentatives, have had little if anything to say. We have little in \nthe way of ability to give an accounting of how these taxpayers' \ndollars are being utilized.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n   [[Page S3666]] Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Dole and myself, and I estimate \nabout 30 to 35 Senators who met at lunch today, had a purpose yesterday \nin my offering the pending amendment. We wanted to send a clear and \nunmistakable message to the administration that any proposal to make \nlife easier for Fidel Castro will be vigorously opposed on a bipartisan \nbasis by a majority of the U.S. Senators. The presence of Senator Dodd \non the floor illustrates that.\n  I believe that the point has been made. I believe it has been heard \non Pennsylvania Avenue. If it has not, perhaps they should order some \nhearing aids.\n  Let me make a confession or two. First of all, I do not like to break \nthe Senate rules, or bend them. When I offered the amendment yesterday, \nI knew that it was legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  The distinguished Senator from Hawaii and I have a little joke about \nsanctimony, about when an amendment is legislation on an appropriations \nbill. This is done all the time. But that does not make it right, \nreally.\n  So my intent yesterday was just to make a point--and I had discussed \nwith Senator Dole my intention to make a few remarks, which I did, and \nthen to withdraw the amendment. But there was so much excitement about \nthe amendment and so much support for it that I had to back up and see \nwhat I had to do.\n  The pending amendment, the Helms amendment, as the television is \nreferring to it, is in fact the exact text of S. 381, ``The Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act,'' which I introduced on February \n9, with 21 cosponsors. There is a companion bill in the House with a \nnumber of cosponsors--I do not know the exact number.\n  Let me say this: As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is an able \nmember of that committee, I guarantee--and I think Senator Dodd will \nhelp me--that S. 381 will be the subject of a hearing, as early as \nabout the 1st of May, before we get to it because of various schedules \nin the Senate.\n  I say again that the pending amendment is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. While every appropriations bill does have \nlegislation in it, at least everyone which I have seen, I do not enjoy \ntesting the working rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays \non the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, first, I thank my colleague from North Carolina for his \ncourtesy.\n  Also, something that should come as no great surprise to people who \nhave been around here any length of time, the Senator from North \nCarolina, I suppose next to our distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia--I think he would agree with that--is about as good a master \nof rules as there is in the U.S. Senate, but also one who respects the \nrules. He knows how to use them effectively, but also respects them. I \nam not surprised in any way that he would take the position he has on \nthe procedural issue here at all. I commend him for that.\n  This is a complicated piece of legislation. There are a lot of \nsections to it. I am delighted that there will be a hearing. I look \nforward to it and will participate in it.\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, if I can, that I picked up \nyesterday's morning paper and read the headline of the paper and had no \nprior awareness or knowledge that something was changing with regard to \nour policy in Cuba. Whether or not I agreed with the sanctions being in \nplace, the fact they were there, the fact that something may be done, \ncame as somewhat of a surprise.\n  I have suggested to my colleague, Mr. President, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, that we might request in the next few days a meeting \nwith the appropriate personnel from the State Department or the White \nHouse to have a private briefing with Members as to exactly what is \nbeing considered, what actions may be taken.\n  I think that may be an appropriate way to find out whether this is \nexactly just a news story or there is something more to it. We can find \nthat out. I certainly support the Senator in that request that we get a \nbriefing.\n  Again, I look forward to the hearing. I appreciate immensely the \ndecision of the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the \ncommittee, not to proceed with this particular amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has asked \nunanimous consent to withdraw the yeas and nays.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I now withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right.\n  The amendment (No. 326), as modified, was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from \nConnecticut. It is always a pleasure to work with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak for up to 10 minutes, as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first committee amendment is pending.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside until I complete my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not object, I would like the unanimous-consent order to also \nagree that upon the completion of the remarks of the Senator from \nAlaska, I be recognized for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska need not ask that the \ncommittee amendment be set aside. He has asked unanimous consent to \nspeak as if in morning business.\n  Does the Senator from Alaska modify his request, to be followed by \nthe Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska is pleased to modify.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Craig and I, and a \nnumber of our colleagues introduced the 1995 mining law reform bill.\n  Mr. President, during the last several years, members and staff of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources have spent thousands of \nhours debating, staffing, and pontificating reform of the 1872 mining \nlaw.\n  During the 101st, 102d, and 103d Congresses, legislation to reform \nthe 1872 mining law has been introduced, debated, and actively pursued. \nLast year, Congress came within striking distance of enacting \ncomprehensive legislation. Unfortunately, negotiations on a final bill \nbroke down during conference consideration and Senate and House \nleadership made the decision to pull the plug on reform in the 103d.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Craig and others to \nbegin the debate on mining law reform in the 104th Congress. I've \nthought long and hard about reforming the 1872 mining law. What effect \nwill reform have on the mining industry? Will the legislation cost \njobs? What impact will reform have on exploration and development in \nthe United States? Will the environmental community support mining law \nreform? The bottom line is this: The voters sent a clear message to \nCongress in the November elections. No more delay, no more gridlock; \nget on with the Nation's business.\n  The debate over mining law reform has been around longer than many of \nus in the Senate. Everyone agrees there should be reform, the question \nis what kind of reform?\n  We need to protect the environment, but we also have a responsibility \nto \n[[Page S3667]] protect and create jobs in the United States. We should \nencourage exploration and development in the United States, not only \nfor the hardrock mining industry, but for all of our natural resource \nbased industries. We should not drive these industries off shore.\n  During the last 12 years we've seen the oil and gas industry lose \napproximately 500,000 jobs in the United States. I do not want to see \nthis happen to the hardrock mining industry.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is real reform. It is \ncomprehensive reform that addresses every substantive issue raised \nduring the past several years of debate.\n\n\n                                patents\n\n  Critics argue that patenting must be eliminated because individuals \ncan patent/purchase land for $2.50 per acre and that some of these \npatented lands can be used for nonmining uses--ski cabins or fishing \nlodges.\n  The Craig-Murkowski bill specifically requires miners to pay fair \nmarket value for the surface of mineral-bearing lands and includes a \nprovision requiring all patented land to be used for good faith mining \npurposes.\n  If the Secretary of the Interior discovers patented land being used \nfor any purpose other than conducting good faith mineral activities, \nthe Secretary is required to serve notice to the owner of the patent to \nstop nonmining activities. If the owner does not comply with the \nSecretary's notice, the State in which the patented land is located \nwill have the opportunity to take title to the patented estate. If the \nState does not want the land, title and interest in the estate will \nrevert to the Federal Government.\n\n\n                                royalty\n\n  Critics argue that individuals are allowed to extract minerals from \nthe Federal estate without paying a royalty to the Federal Government.\n  The Craig-Murkowski bill requires miners to pay a 3-percent net \nproceeds royalty. The royalty is modeled on the Nevada net proceeds on \nmines tax, a well-established program which--like the mining taxes of \nmany of the western States--collects substantial revenues at a very \nmodest administrative cost.\n  In 1993 Nevada collected $34 million in net proceeds taxes at an \nadministrative cost of less than two-tenths of 1 percent.\n  The bill shares royalty revenues with the States. One-third of the \nroyalties will be distributed to the States from which production \ncomes, one-third to individual State abandoned mine funds, and one-\nthird to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Why a net royalty for hardrock mining and a gross royalty for oil and \ngas?\n  It's simple, oil and gas come out of the ground in a condition almost \nready for market.\n  Impurities are then extracted from the oil and gas.\n  Gold, silver, copper, and other hardrock minerals come out of the \nground as raw ore in the form of rock-like material.\n  Before a gold bar can be produced, several steps must be taken that \nadd value to the product.\n  Crushing; separating rock from the mineral; beneficiating to remove \nforeign materials;\n producing a concentrate; and smelting.\n\n  In short, an operator must take several steps to get hardrock \nminerals ready for the market. The theory that the oil and gas industry \nis similar to the hardrock mining industry is just not true.\n\n\n                              reclamation\n\n  Critics argue that the hardrock mining industry needs Federal \nreclamation standards.\n  In 1979, in a study authorized by the Surface Mine Control and \nReclamation Act [SMCRA]--the COSMAR study--the National Academy of \nSciences concluded that uniform Federal reclamation standards--like \nthose in SMCRA--were not appropriate for hardrock mining.\n  Furthermore, in January 1995, the Western Governors' Association \n[WGA] released a position paper on mining law reform in the 104th \nCongress. The WGA specifically requested that ``Reclamation on federal \nand non-federal lands should be conducted at the state level, through \nexisting state abandoned mine programs where possible, rather than \ncreating new duplicative federal reclamation programs.''\n  In other words, please don't create uniform Federal reclamation \nstandards.\n  In 1995, every State with substantial areas of Federal lands open to \nmineral location under the general mining laws has adopted substantive \nreclamation standards for hardrock mining. State standards are tailored \nto the environment of the States where the mining will occur. \nDisturbances created by mining on Federal lands must be reclaimed, but \nthe standards found in State reclamation law should provide the \nsubstantive requirements of every reclamation program. The Craig-\nMurkowski bill recognizes that State reclamation standards, along with \napplicable Federal and State environmental requirements, are adequate \nto prevent unnecessary and undue degradation.\n\n\n                              reclamation\n\n  During last year's House-Senate conference, over my objection, \nlanguage was included in the chairman's mark which gave the Secretary \nof the Interior authority to regulate control over western water \nresources.\n  The Craig-Murkowski bill does not. I repeat, this bill does not \ninclude any provisions which threaten to upset the historical vesting \ncontrol over western water resources in the Western States.\n  The Western Governors' Association has made it clear that they don't \nwant the Federal Government involved in the regulation of western water \nrights.\n\n\n                              suitability\n\n  Critics argue that the Secretary of the Interior should be allowed to \nmake a suitability determination related to each mining proposal on \nFederal lands.\n  The Craig-Murkowski bill does not include a suitability provision \nbecause the provision is unnecessary and redundant.\n  Federal lands are already required to go through a suitability test. \nLands open to mineral entry have gone or will go through the Department \nof the Interior resource management process. If people are not \nsatisfied with the Bureau of Land Management's Land Management Program, \nCongress should change BLM, not insert suitability language in a mining \nlaw bill.\n  In addition, all mining plans of operation on Federal land undergo \nanalysis under the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] either in \nthe form of an environmental assessment or a full environmental impact \nstatement.\n  Finally, any lands with special characteristics can be withdrawn from \nentry under the mining law pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 [FLPMA].\n  Mr. President, again, as I stated earlier, this legislation is \ncomprehensive reform.\n  I say to the environmental community and the mining industry, if you \ntruly want reform, this is the year.\n  If we fail to enact reform this year it will not be through lack of \neffort. I will pursue comprehensive reform starting with a hearing this \nmonth to consider the legislation we introduce today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3664-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3667-S3669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            REBUTTAL OF BABBITT CRITICISM OF MINING LAW BILL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Finally, Mr. President, I would like to enter into the \nRecord a response to the Secretary of the Interior with regard to his \ncomments regarding the Craig-Murkowski bill.\n  He indicates a criticism, stating:\n\n       This law would do nothing to resolve the most glaring \n     shortcomings of existing 1872 mining law.\n\n  As a rebuttal, I say the Secretary's position is either based on lack \nof knowledge or it is simply a falsehood, because the Secretary ignores \nthe fact that the bill requires paying a fair market value for the \nsurface estate of patented lands and using patented lands for good \nfaith mining purposes. If a miner uses the patented land for non-mining \npurposes the land transfers to the State in which the patented land is \nlocated or reverts to the Federal Government. In addition, the bill \nimposes a 3-percent net proceeds royalty on minerals produced and \nprevents unnecessary or undue degradation of surface lands. This is not \na do-nothing approach, Mr. President.\n  Further criticism, he states:\n\n       [[Page S3668]] It continues the giveaway of valuable \n     public-owned hardrock minerals like gold, silver and platinum \n     for peanuts.\n\n  Again, the Secretary is wrong, Mr. President. The bill requires a \npayment of fair market value determined by the Bureau of Land \nManagement appraisal methods for the surface of estate patented land. \nThe bill requires a payment of 3-percent net proceeds royalty on the \nproduction of minerals from public lands. The bill also requires a one-\ntime payment fee of $25 per claim and a $100 annual maintenance fee per \nclaim. The amount of money generated by the fair market value net \nroyalty and location and maintenance fees is not peanuts.\n  Mr. President, another criticism from the Secretary:\n\n       It is actually a step backward from existing law on a \n     number of points such as the level of environmental \n     protection that is now possible, and the amount of holding \n     fee claimants would pay per acre.\n\n  That is absolutely incorrect, Mr. President. The Craig-Murkowski bill \ndoes not diminish environmental protection in any respect whatever. In \nfact, the legislation assures compliance with all major Federal \nenvironmental laws--including those governing air, water, solid and \nhazardous waste, endangered species, historic preservation, safety and \nhealth, toxic substances and others--and applicable State reclamation \nlaws.\n  The environmental standard set by the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976--prevention of unnecessary or undue degradation \nof public lands--is the standard adopted to the Craig-Murkowski bill, \nand the one against which mining performance will be measured under our \nbill.\n  The bill also contains $100 per claim maintenance fee for the first 5 \nyears following enactment, but thereafter requires the payment of $100 \nfee for assessment work.\n  The last criticism, Mr. President:\n\n       It has a royalty that is likely to be a net loser to the \n     taxpayers. Given the low royalty rate and the fact it is on \n     net rather than gross proceeds, we believe it will cost more \n     to administer than the Federal Treasury will receive.\n\n  Another falsehood. It is totally absurd. A 3-percent net royalty, \nwhich is patterned after Nevada net proceeds on mine tax, is likely to \ngenerate more revenue to the Federal Treasury in the long run than a \ngross royalty of the same amount. Why? Because a gross royalty forces \ncompanies to mine the high-grade, low-production cost mineral ores \nfirst to recover the costs of mining. Once the reserves are mined the \ncompanies would be forced to prematurely abandon low-grade, high-cost \nreserves. Is this what we want?\n  Second, the criticism of cost to administer the 3-percent net royalty \nis more of an indictment of Secretary Babbitt's own department than it \nis of the legislation. In 1993, the State of Nevada generated \napproximately $34 million in revenues from the net proceeds tax, at \nadministrative cost of less than two-tenths of 1 percent. A study by \nSecretary Babbitt's own department indicates an 8-percent gross royalty \nwould cost $11 million to administer in the first year alone, and \nresult in a loss of 1,100 jobs in 3 years.\n  The problem is not with the Craig-Murkowski bill. The problem is with \nSecretary Babbitt's bloated bean-counting bureaucracy at the Department \nof the Interior.\n  Finally in conclusion, there is not one criticism of our bill levied \nby the Secretary that has any merit. The facts contradict all the \ncharges made by Secretary Babbitt and his supporters in the House, and \nfor me to even have to respond to these half truths, absurdities and \ndistortions in order to ensure that the mining law reform process \nbegins properly is simply an outrage. I resent having to take the time \nof my colleagues to set the record straight, but it is necessary to set \nthe record straight.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have a criticism from our good friend, \nGeorge Miller, on the House side. His criticism is that the mining \nindustry will become rich, the taxpayers will receive virtually nothing \nfor their riches, and the environment will be desecrated. This is the \ntype of the-sky-is-falling exaggeration we have heard from the House \nunder the leadership of George Miller for so long and it is absolutely \nan exaggeration.\n  What Miller forgets is this: The mining companies will pay fair \nmarket value, royalties, maintenance fees and location fees and they \nalso pay corporate income tax, and their employees will pay State and \nFederal income taxes. Materials, supplies, and equipment that their \nmines will use will cost millions of dollars and have to be made \npayable as a consequence of the prosperity of the people here in the \nUnited States. All this means is more economic activity.\n  Second, the entire Nation will benefit from mineral production and \nfrom the stimulation mining gives the economy, and finally the \nenvironment will remain protected by every single conceivable \nenvironmental law that Mr. Miller and his colleagues could think to \nimpose on an industry to make public land use more difficult and put \nthe U.S. mining industry more at disadvantage in competing in global \nmarkets.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I think it is fair to let my \ncolleagues reflect on not only is this administration critical of the \nmining industry as it exists in this Nation today, they are critical of \nthe timber industry as it exists today, critical of the oil and gas \nindustry, the grazing industry. It is hard to find one single natural \nresource industry that this administration supports.\n  As a consequence, we are exporting our dollars and losing our jobs. \nAs chairman of the Energy Committee, I intend to hold hearings on these \nmatters to try and reduce our dependence on imports by stimulating our \nown resource industry. I thank the President for the time allocated to \nme.\n                   the mining law reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Craig and \nMurkowski by cosponsoring reasonable and responsible legislation to \nreform the mining law of 1872. Our goal in revising this act is \ntwofold, to maintain mining and mining jobs, and to provide for a \nhealthy environment.\n  First, I would like to deal with the environmental components of this \nlegislation. This legislation affirms that mining activities are \nsubject to at least 15 Federal laws designed to protect the \nenvironment, as well as any State regulations that have been adopted \nsince the original mining law was passed in 1872. A partial list of \nFederal laws includes: the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management \nAct, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Forest and Rangeland \nRenewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, and the Toxic Substances \nControl Act of 1990. Although this list is not complete, I believe that \nit illustrates that modern miners operate far differently than the old \nimage of the prospectors from the unregulated days of the industry. \nThis legislation will ensure that this is the case.\n  The reclamation of mining sites is an important part of this \nlegislative proposal, as well as the provision for requiring financial \nassurance that the work will be accomplished. The filing and approval \nof the plan of operation with the land management agency has been an \nimportant component in mining of public lands. This legislation \npromotes its importance and requires that environmentally sensitive \nreclamation is included in the plan.\n  It is important that mining be planned through the entire operation \nuntil reclamation is completed. With the highly speculative nature of \nthe industry, even well intentioned operations may falter before \ncompletion. With this bill, financial assurance will be provided in \nadvance of operations to assure the mined lands will be reclaimed.\n  Providing a reclamation program for abandoned mine sites is another \nfeature of this legislation. The program will greatly improve those \nsites that have been long overdue for restoration. The costs of \nenvironmental repair will be derived from funds generated through \nroyalty payments by the mining industry.\n  While several fees are set in the body of this bill, let me focus on \nthe major new economic item, the royalty. I am concerned about the \nimposition of a royalty on hardrock mining, knowing that it will be an \nadded cost in jobs to an industry that often faces difficult economic \ntimes.\n  [[Page S3669]] Consequently, I support the imposition of a royalty \nallowing for some specific costs of production to be deducted prior to \nthe royalty being assessed. This has been demonstrated in several \nstudies to be the most reasonable method of assuring that the taxpayers \nwill receive a return from the production of minerals on Federal lands. \nIn addition, a similar provision adopted by the State of Nevada has \nproved to be relatively simple to administer, and it provides a \nsubstantial return to the taxpayers of that State, while allowing for \nthe continuation of mining jobs that are vitally important to the \neconomy of that State.\n  One-third of the revenues from the royalties will be distributed to \nthe States from which the mining was conducted to assist these States \nin offsetting the costs of infrastructure that support the mining \nindustry. These funds will also be available to the States to offset \nthe costs of enforcement of both State and Federal regulations.\n  The second third of royalty revenues will be held on deposit and \ndedicated to programs for the reclamation and restoration of abandoned \nmine, mill, and processing areas. Not all States have reclamation funds \nestablished to assure financing for such activities. It is unquestioned \nthat we are faced with abandoned sites throughout the Nation that need \nattention. With this legislation, we will provide a source of funding \nfor the reclamation programs on lands where the mining practices of the \ndistant past have resulted in well publicized environmental problems.\n  The final third of revenues collected from the royalty established in \nthis legislation will go directly into the Federal Treasury for deficit \nreduction.\n  The Mining Law Reform Act of 1995 is a sensible and significant \nreform of the general mining laws. It provides the needed assurances to \nallow mining to continue to provide needed jobs and resources in this \ncountry, as well as requirements that the environment will be \nprotected. The provisions for access and patenting are included in this \nlegislation because of the importance for these to make mining viable \nand workable. Added to the law are adequate bonding to assure that the \nreclamation envisioned will actually occur on every operation, a \nroyalty that provides support for abandoned mine reclamation and a \nreturn to the Federal Treasury, and assurances that lands patented for \nmineral activities will be used for that purpose, and that purpose \nonly.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3667-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3669-S3670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 330.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     effective 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available for the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration by any previously enacted Act shall \n     be obligated or expended for the NASA/Russian Cooperative MIR \n     program, unless the President certifies to Congress that \n     Russia has agreed not to sell nuclear reactor components to \n     Iran.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief, and I think that \nthe floor managers might be in a position to accept this. It goes right \nto the heart of something that is near and dear to me, and I think all \nSenators and, indeed, the country share my sentiments. This simply says \nthat the funds which have been allocated to NASA in 1995, $251.9 \nmillion, for cooperation with the United States-Russian MIR space \nstation will be suspended effective 30 days after the adoption of this \namendment until the President certifies to us that the Russians will \nnot sell nuclear reactors to Iran.\n  Now, Mr. President, as you know, opposing cooperation with Russia is \nnot normally my cup of tea. I have been a strong supporter of the Nunn-\nLugar initiative to help the Russians dismantle their bombers and their \nnuclear weapons. That is in our interest. That is the reason we do it. \nBut for the Russians to cavalierly sell nuclear reactors to the number \none terrorist regime in the world is not in their interest; it \ncertainly is not in our interest--indeed, Mr. President, it is not in \nthe world's interest-- until there are significant changes in the \ngoverning body of Iran.\n  It is a militant regime. To the State Department and everybody else \nwho assesses the nations most culpable in shielding terrorism, Iran is \nalways at the top of the list.\n  Now, Mr. President, this does not need to be debated. What I have \njust said is absolute, and I believe that everybody in this country \nagrees with the principle. I wish to help Russia. I want them to become \na real democracy. I want them to become viable economically. But I do \nnot want to be sending all this money to Russia if they are going to \ndemonstrate a callous, total indifference to the safety of this world \nfrom nuclear weapons by selling nuclear technology to renegade \ngovernments such as Iran.\n  Until this very day, Mr. President, until this very day, whenever \nthere is a demonstration in Tehran, Uncle Sam and the American flag are \ninvariably the subject of all the venom that the speakers and the \nmarchers can muster.\n  I am not trying to destroy the cooperation between the United States \nand Russia in space. But we are funding almost one-third of the entire \nRussian space program, and it is on the ropes. Thus the Russians need \nspace cooperation with us more than we need space cooperation with \nthem. I do not want to kill the Russian space program. But I do not \nwant them selling reactors to Iran either.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lautenberg be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering H.R. 889, the \nDefense emergency supplemental appropriations. This bill provides $1.96 \nbillion to the Department of Defense for readiness by rescinding funds \nfrom other DOD programs. I will support H.R. 889 because it replenishes \ndefense funds which were depleted to support unbudgeted operations in \nHaiti, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Korea, and refugee support in the \nCaribbean. Without these reimbursements, defense readiness will \ncertainly suffer.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Gordon Sullivan, testified \nbefore the House National Security Committee that ``readiness will drop \noff the table'' if the supplemental appropriations is not passed. He \nfurther stated that all Army training will cease May 31 if the funds \nare not provided. The Navy reports that 4 carrier airwings would be \nforced to stand down and 500 aircraft would be grounded. The Air Force \nhas indicated that its flight time would be cut in half if the \nsupplemental fails.\n  The readiness crisis faced by the Armed Forces is not, unfortunately, \na recent phenomenon. Defense Secretary William Perry admitted last year \nthat in 1994, 3 of the Army's 12 divisions were far below peak \nreadiness standards, and that 2 of the Army's main quick-reaction units \nwould have been unable to fulfill some of their missions if they were \nordered into combat. It was further revealed that, due to funding \nshortfalls, some platoon leaders had never taken their soldiers into \nthe \n[[Page S3670]] field for training exercises, tank crews had not \ncompleted their drill evaluations, and platoons had not been evaluated \nwith live fire exercise.\n  The Armed Forces have found themselves in a readiness crisis for a \nvariety of reasons, such as the new, unplanned deployments mentioned \nabove. But, increased spending on nondefense items in the defense bill \nis another reason that funds are being syphoned off readiness accounts. \nFor example, nondefense expenditures imposed by Congress in last year's \nbill include funding for community roads, ponds, sewers, and a plethora \nof other development projects. The Department of Defense, for instance, \nis paying for security at the World Cup Games and the Olympics. DOD is \neven paying for the roundup of wild horses in New Mexico. Nondefense \nprograms are growing, gobbling up larger portions of the defense \nbudget. The Congressional Research Service estimates that nondefense \nspending by DOD has nearly quadrupled from $3.5 billion in fiscal year \n1990 to $13 billion in fiscal year 1994.\n  This is not to say that all R programs are unjustifiable. Some \ntechnology reinvestment programs [TRP], for example, are properly \nfunded through the Department of Defense, because the program \ndemonstrates a direct linkage back to defense. Other programs, such as \nsome of the projects identified above, have no linkage to defense. This \nNation simply cannot afford to allow the defense budget to become the \ncash cow for nondefense-related programs. In my view the general \nrescission identified by the Appropriations Committee is justifiable \nprovided the funds come from the nondefense programs.\n  I do disagree with the committee on one notable program recommended \nfor rescission--the $77 million for the Apache AH64 attack helicopter. \nLast year, the Congress provided $77.6 million to procure 6 AH-64A \naircraft because, as I recall, we were concerned that a break in \nproduction between the AH-64A and AH-64D could cause the program to \nescalate the costs of the low-rate procurement. At the same time, the \nArmy requested $117.7 for advance procurement of Longbow radar, a key \nmodernization feature, but only received $80 million. Faced with a \ndifficult choice, the Army elected to submit a reprogramming request in \norder to proceed with full funding of the Longbow radar at the expense \nof the procurement of the six helicopters. The committee rejected the \nreprogramming request and rescinded the $77 million.\n  I believe this action is a mistake since the Longbow program is \nclearly an essential Army helicopter modernization effort and certainly \na justifiable defense program. For this reason, I intend to work with \nthe chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to \nrestore the funds for the Apache-Longbow procurement.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if during this period the managers do not \nmind, I would ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 10 minutes \nas if in morning business and to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota is recognized for not to exceed 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3669-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3670-S3671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE U.S. WORLD TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today there has been discussion in \nCongress about the problems of the dollar on the international currency \nexchanges and the collapse of the dollar in the last week or two and \nespecially the collapse of the dollar in recent months.\n  I noted that one of the leaders of the other body said, well, that \ndollar problem relates all to the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. Mr. Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, \ntestified before a congressional committee today, and he said that \nthere were several reasons for the collapse of the dollar.\n  I would like to add my opinion today to what is happening. I think \npeople need to know that the collapse of the dollar on the currency \nexchanges is not something that should be unexpected, given the current \ncircumstances in this country.\n  We received about 3 or 4 weeks ago the trade data for December, which \nmeans that we have trade information for all of last year to try to \nevaluate how did America do in international trade.\n  The chart that I brought to the floor shows how our country has done \nin international trade in the past year. This chart shows a history \nfull of red ink. It shows that in the last calendar year we suffered \nthe largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country--\nin fact, the largest trade deficit in the history of humankind. This \ntrade policy, yes, belongs to this administration, but it belongs also \nto the previous administrations because it is a continuation of the \nsame trade policy we have been conducting and following in this country \nfor nearly 40 years. The deficits are staggering in international \ntrade.\n  Most importantly, you will see what is happening to our manufacturing \nbase in this country. This is a chart that shows foreign imports taking \nover now one-half of the manufacturing gross domestic product in our \ncountry. In 1970, manufacturing imports as a percent of U.S. \nmanufacturing GDP was 10 percent. Last year, it was nearly 50 percent. \nYou can see what is happening to manufacturing in this country by \nvirtue of what we are importing in manufactured goods.\n  ``U.S. faces historic losses in manufacturing trade.'' In other \nwords, the trade on goods that are manufactured, that is a trade \nprocess in which we lose. The fact is in international trade, there are \nwinners and there are losers. The winners have the jobs and the \nopportunities, and the losers suffer economic decline. This trade \npicture in this country shows a picture, a bleak picture, of decline, \nand it is something that we must change.\n  The last chart is an illuminating one. It shows what has happened in \nrecent years to the major economic powers, the net exports of the major \neconomic powers in the world. And you will see what has happened to \nJapan, to Germany, and then take a look at what has happened to the \nUnited States in terms of net exports. It has collapsed. It weakens and \ninjures this country.\n  This trade policy does not work. This trade policy flows from the \npost-Second World War era, when our country decided that our trade \npolicy was also going to be our foreign policy and we were going to \nhave trade policies that helped a lot of other countries get back on \ntheir feet. These days the continuation of that policy weakens our \ncountry. Our country suffers very stiff, steep deficits in \ninternational trade balances, and the fact is it means lost jobs and \nlost opportunity here in the United States.\n  We hear this chant about free trade. Well, the suggestion is that we \nshould compete anywhere around the world and win. That is free trade. \nIf it is free, if it is open competition, we should compete and we \nshould win.\n  The difficulty, of course, is in free trade this chart shows the \naverage manufacturing wages in various countries. The United States is \nhere, $16.79 an hour. Germany is up here at $25, and you can see who we \nare going to compete with. We compete with countries around the world \nwhere they pay 12 cents an hour to 12-year-olds who work 12 hours a day \nto manufacture products and say that is free trade; there are no \ntariffs on that commodity trade, so you go ahead and compete, Mr. and \nMrs. America.\n  The problem is American workers cannot and should not have to expect \nto compete against 12-cents-an-hour wages, and yet that is where we are \nin that kind of trade scheme in this country.\n  I want to put the first chart back up because this is what I want to \ntalk about, the historic trade deficits in this country today and the \nneed for us to fundamentally revisit trade strategy and decide that we \nneed to reinvent our trade strategy in this country.\n  The post-Second-World-War trade strategy of 50 years is failing this \ncountry and it is injuring this country. \n[[Page S3671]] These trade deficits cannot be compiled in a country \nlike ours without threatening the dollar, weakening the dollar, and \ncausing the collapse of the dollar we have seen over a period of a \ndozen years on the international currency exchanges.\n  I have talked about the numbers, but the specifics are even more \ndevastating. If you take a look at the specifics on the 1994 trade \ndeficit what you find is that our trade deficit in autos and auto parts \ntotal $50 billion; our trade deficit in data processing equipment and \nparts totals $21 billion; telecommunications equipment, $17 billion; \nelectrical equipment, $13 billion. These are the high-technology items \nin which manufacturing pays good wages. These are good jobs. These are \nthe very items we ought to be winning in and instead we are losing. It \nis where our jobs are being exported in wholesale quantity to other \nparts of the world.\n  In fact, if you take a look at this trade deficit you will see, \nthough I have not annotated the countries on here, we have a nearly $65 \nbillion trade deficit with Japan at a time when the dollar is at a \nnearly record low against the yen. That is a time when you would expect \nwe would be making progress in reducing our trade deficit with Japan. \nIn fact it grew. Our trade deficit with China is $30 billion and \ngrowing astronomically; again, shipping American jobs outside of this \ncountry and weakening America's currency and causing others around the \nworld to look at this mess and say, ``We do not have confidence. We do \nnot have the kind of confidence we should because the fact is this \ncountry, the United States of America, is running an enormous trade \ndeficit which it cannot continue to do.''\n  At least with respect to the budget deficit you can make a case that \nit is money owed, one to other. With respect to the trade deficit, the \ntrade deficit must be repaid by a lower standard of living in the \nUnited States. It is inevitable and it is true. This bleeds the \nAmerican work force, bleeds American opportunity, and bleeds away \nAmerican jobs.\n  I must say the Mexican example--largely I raise that because of the \ndeterioration of the dollar--the Mexican example in my judgment is an \nexample of the kind of policy we should not follow. When we link the \nAmerican dollar to the peso--as we did when we formed an economic union \nwith Mexico and as we did when we decided on a bailout strategy as a \nresult of the collapse of the peso--it seems to me inevitable that we \ndiminish confidence in the dollar, linked to an economic circumstance \nlike they have in Mexico.\n  It is interesting, I did not support NAFTA but we were told, with \nNAFTA, if we can negotiate lower tariffs across the United States-\nMexican border we will see a massive new trade coming across the border \nthat will strengthen and help both countries. Of course what happened \nthen was the peso was devalued and the fact is to sell American goods \nnow in Mexico means the American goods are 40-percent higher priced \nthan they were when NAFTA was passed and Mexican goods to be sold in \nthis country now sell at a 40-percent discount vis-a-vis when we passed \nNAFTA.\n  What has happened? We had a very significant trade surplus with \nMexico, about $4 billion. That shrunk last year to over a billion, and \nin recent months we even have a trade deficit with Mexico. Of course \nthat threatens to grow.\n  My feeling is that as we look at the collapse of the dollar on the \ninternational currency exchanges and wonder why, we ought not wonder \ntoo long without understanding that a country cannot continue this kind \nof trade policy. Yes, I want open markets. Yes, I want free trade. But \nthis country ought to take the lead in this world to say, ``We also \nexpect fair trade. There is an admission price to the American \nmarketplace and the admission price to sell your products in the \nAmerican marketplace is, yes, you must pay living wages. And you must \nhave a safe workplace, and you cannot hire 12-year-old kids for 12 \ncents an hour.''\n  We must, it seems to me, stand for our own economic interest and stop \nthis kind of policy. That is the sort of thing that ultimately will \nstrengthen confidence in the dollar on the international currency \nexchanges.\n  I hope this President and others who care about this issue--including \nMembers of Congress--will decide that it is time for us to have a new \nBretton Woods conference, a new type of Bretton Woods strategy in which \nwe take a new analysis of trade strategy 50 years after the end of the \nSecond World War and decide what is right for this country. What will \nset us on a course where we will not see these kinds of staggering \ntrade deficits that weaken our country? What will promote new jobs, \ngood jobs, with good income in this country?\n  I hear about everybody being upset in our country, and I understand \nthat. At least one of the reasons the American people are upset is no \nmatter what the economic indicators say, no matter what the dials and \nindicators say in the engine room with respect to this ship of state, \nmost American families having dinner tonight understand they are \nworking harder for less money. Mr. President, 60 percent of the \nAmerican families earn less money today, if you adjust it for \ninflation, than they did 15 years ago. One can tell those American \nfamilies, ``Things are better for you.'' But if they are earning less \nmoney on a real income basis than they were 15 years ago, it is awfully \nhard to convince them that they are doing better. You do better when \nyou have good jobs and good opportunity.\n  I might say, all the other issues that are going to come before this \nSenate in the coming months--almost all of those issues can also be \naddressed by good jobs with good incomes. You can talk about welfare \nreform, you can talk about crime, you can talk about 100 different \nissues--you can address most of them in this country with a good job \nand opportunity for Americans who are skilled and want to work.\n  So, as we discuss the collapse of the dollar and all of the \nmacroeconomic reasons and we hear the economists give us their notions \nof what is at work in the world, at least I would like to contribute, \nfrom this Senator, my notion that these staggering trade deficits, the \nworst in history last year, contribute to a weakening of the confidence \nin the American dollar and I think call out--virtually call out for a \nnew trade strategy, a summit on international trade in this country, to \nwonder: What on Earth are we doing, bleeding away good American jobs \nand good income for the American people with a trade strategy that does \nthis?\n  Let me finish by saying we have a Trade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, \nwho is the best I have seen since I have been in Washington. He gives \nme hope. He has been tough with other countries. He stood up to the \nJapanese and the Chinese and others to say this cannot continue.\n  I appreciate that. I want to offer him strength to whatever extent I \ncan. But I also say we are dealing with a trade regime that is \nfundamentally flawed and we need to build a new foundation and a new \nunderstanding of the various obligations that we and our trading \npartners have for and with each other as we conduct commerce in the \nyears ahead.\n  Our interests must in this country be interests in promoting and \ncreating stronger means to promote jobs and opportunity and hope for \nthe American people. Frankly, this kind of trade picture, not just with \nDemocrats--yes, this is under a Democratic administration--but \nRepublicans and Democrats together have embraced a trade regime that in \nmy judgment is fundamentally flawed and cries out for reinvention and \ncries out for reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the first excepted committee amendment insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. 110. (a) Congress finds that (1) it is the role of \n     Congress, as the representative body of the people, to decide \n     the policy of the United States with respect to relations \n     between management and labor; and (2) the executive branch \n     should not use the Federal procurement process to initiate \n     major changes in the labor-management relations of the United \n     States.\n       (b) The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the Congress \n     decides important labor-management relations policy by \n     prohibiting the executive branch from spending any \n     appropriated funds for the purpose of implementing an \n     executive order that would debar or in any way limit the \n     right of Federal contractors under common law to use \n     permanent replacements for workers engaged in a strike.\n       (c) None of the funds made available under any \n     appropriations Act for fiscal year 1995 may be used to \n     implement, administer, or enforce any executive order, or \n     other rule, regulation, or order, that limits, restricts, or \n     otherwise affects the ability of any existing or potential \n     Federal contractor, subcontractor, or vendor to hire \n     permanent replacements for lawfully striking employees.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, if I may just explain for a moment. \nI believe it is going to be the expressed wish of the chairman and the \nmanagers on the floor to bring this amendment up again tomorrow, but I \nwould like to briefly talk about it yet this evening.\n  I am offering an amendment which would prohibit the executive branch \nfrom spending any money to implement the Executive order limiting \nFederal contractors from hiring permanent striker replacements. This \nlegislation assures that the Congress, rather than the executive \nbranch, decides major labor-management relations policy.\n  Federal labor law permits workers to strike. It also permits \nemployers to continue to operate during a strike, if necessary, by \nhiring permanent replacements for striking workers. This has been the \nlaw of the land for 60 years.\n  Madam President, as my colleagues may recall, during both the 102d \nand the 103d Congress, the Senate rejected legislation that would have \namended our Federal labor laws to prohibit employers from hiring \npermanent striker replacements. In fact, more Senators voted against \nthe measure in 1994 than in 1992.\n  In an attempt to make an end-run around the Congress, the \nadministration today has issued an Executive order that would debar \nFederal contractors that hire permanent striker replacements. I view \nthis as a direct challenge to congressional authority.\n  Congress makes the laws, not the administration. We have the \nresponsibility, as the representative body of the people, to decide \nlabor-management policy through legislation. The executive branch \nshould not attempt to use the Federal procurement process to make major \nchanges in our labor laws.\n  The amendment I am offering today prohibits the administration from \nspending any appropriated funds during the 1995 fiscal year to \nimplement or enforce any Executive order that would limit Federal \ncontractors or subcontractors in their use of permanent striker \nreplacements. This amendment assures that the Congress, rather than the \nadministration, establishes Federal labor policy.\n  Madam President, I understand that the administration contends that \nthe striker replacement Executive order is no different than previous \nExecutive orders issued by past Republican Presidents. This argument \nhas no merit.\n  If I may just for a moment comment on those previous Executive \norders. The Reagan and Bush administrations issued Executive orders \nrequiring Federal contractors to post a notice informing workers of \ntheir rights under Federal labor law, prohibiting Federal contractors \nfrom signing agreements that they would hire only unionized work \nforces, and prohibiting the illegally striking air traffic controllers \nfrom being rehired into Federal jobs.\n  None of these Executive orders that I mentioned--and there were \nthree--dealt with a subject that the Senate had debated and rejected. \nNone of these Executive orders was an attempt to make wholesale changes \nin the balance of labor-management relations. Clearly, these previous \nExecutive orders differed significantly from the striker replacement \nExecutive order.\n  Madam President, I suggest this action is without precedent. I urge \nmy colleagues to give support to this amendment.\n  Madam President, if there is no further debate at the moment on this \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business \nfor a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3671-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3672-S3673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JACOB JAVITS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I would like to speak for just a \nmoment in memory of Senator Jacob Javits, the distinguished New York \nRepublican who served in this Chamber for 24 years. I think it does us \nall good to reflect on his career.\n  I was honored to serve with Senator Javits for 2 years. In that time, \nI came to admire and respect him as a man who always scrupulously \nprepared for any legislation, who worked hard out of the spotlight, and \nwho voted his conscience. And what a conscience it was.\n  He did not have his name attached to very many bills--he was a \nRepublican, after all, back when Republicans were not in the majority. \nSenator Javits served from 1958, just missing the years that the \nRepublicans were in a majority at the time of President Eisenhower, to \n1980, just again missing the time the Republicans had a majority.\n  But Jack Javits had his hand in more landmark legislation than most. \nThe War Powers Act, the ERISA Act protecting private pensions, and the \nestablishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities are \noften cited. But he also played important roles in civil rights and \nhousing legislation, and late in his career, as the ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, he helped set the stage for the \nhistoric Middle East peace settlement.\n  Nine years ago yesterday, Senator Javits died. His daughter, now the \ndirector of a housing program for disabled homeless, wrote a tribute to \nher father for yesterday's New York Newsday. She carries on his legacy \nwell. I ask unanimous consent that her article be printed in the \nRecord. It is a fitting homage to her father, a man of public service \nand conscience. We miss \n[[Page S3673]] his presence, but we remember his example.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From New York Newsday, Mar. 7, 1995]\n\n      About Republicans--My Father Was Cut From a Different Cloth\n\n                           (By Carla Javits)\n\n       Today is the ninth anniversary of my father's death. My \n     sense of loss has been acute at times, and now is one of \n     them. Jacob Javits served as a proud Republican in public \n     office, entering the U.S. Senate the year after I was born \n     and staying there until 1980. His achievements included \n     sponsoring the legislation that established the now \n     controversial National Endowments for the Arts and the \n     Humanities; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     (ERISA), which for the first time established standards to \n     protect the private pensions of working people from \n     bankruptcy; and the War Powers Act, requiring the president \n     to consult with Congress before committing America to war. \n     But the legislative battle I remember most clearly was \n     passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. When my father returned \n     from the vote on that historic bill, he lifted me and threw \n     me up into the air.\n       Throughout my life, I turned to my father to illuminate the \n     reasons for our country's political decisions. Despite our \n     differences of opinion, I could always rely for insight on \n     his balance, thoughtfulness and genuine love of debate. I \n     have recently felt his absence not only because of this March \n     anniversary, but also because I am so curious about what he'd \n     think of his party, which has taken control of Congress for \n     the first time since the 1950s. Because he is not here I've \n     been reading his books, and I find myself amazed by how \n     relevant they are to today's debate about the role of \n     government.\n       In 1964, following the defeat of Barry Goldwater by Lyndon \n     Johnson in the presidential election, my father wrote ``Order \n     of Battle: A Republican's Call to Reason,'' an attempt to \n     redefine Republicanism. He maintained that the American \n     people had rejected Goldwater on the basis of his stance that \n     the federal government should shed its responsibility for \n     America's poor and working people, and had opted instead for \n     Johnson's War on Poverty. Personally, he withheld his support \n     from Goldwater ``as a matter of conscience. I could not \n     support a ticket which proposed to reverse the policies of \n     Arthur Vandenberg and Dwight D.\n      Eisenhower in respect to foreign policy; the policies of \n     Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower in civil rights \n     and the policies of Robert A. Taft in education and \n     housing.''\n       Even though the 1994 elections have pushed the pendulum in \n     the opposite direction, my father's insights in 1964, still \n     strike me as stunningly on target: ``The main issue is this: \n     Under modern conditions how can we strike the right balance \n     between the need to decentralize the power of decision in \n     matters affecting our individual preferences, and the need \n     for a unity of direction in matters affecting all of us as \n     members of the American state and society?''\n       While he was viewed as a liberal, I think my father saw \n     himself more as a patriot and proponent of free markets, with \n     a strong interest in how democracy could balance the just \n     claims of a diverse populace. He suggested that instead of \n     dividing ourselves into camps of liberalism and conservatism, \n     we focus on concrete proposals, testing them in light of \n     three questions: ``Will the specific terms of the proposal \n     enlarge the area of freedom and opportunity for the \n     individual while serving the common good? Given the aim of \n     the proposal, is it beyond the reach of private resources, \n     and therefore, must it be made a government matter? If a \n     government matter, is it beyond the reach of local and state \n     resources, and must it, therefore, be entrusted to the \n     central government?''\n       My father's Republicanism found its roots in Alexander \n     Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, and \n     combined a strong belief in free enterprise with firm \n     convictions about the role of federalism and government \n     activism. His politics were also informed by his personal \n     history--growing up poor on New York's Lower East Side. One \n     of his favorite stories was about a boxing match in which he \n     was knocked to the ground. The lesson he drew from it? Always \n     get back up swinging.\n       Buried deep in his book I found several pages dedicated to \n     his activism in the development of housing programs. While he \n     favored programs that strongly encouraged private-sector, \n     federal and local cooperation, he stated, ``. . . to get done \n     what the people needed done by government was good, orthodox \n     Republicanism--if the private sector could not do it alone,'' \n     and that ``federal activity in housing should be expanded in \n     those directions where it has a proven record and should \n     strike out in new directions with imaginative programs that \n     show promise.''\n       Those pages spoke directly to me. My father died before I \n     took my current job with an organization that helps non-\n     profit, non-governmental agencies provide housing, combined \n     with health and social services, to homeless people with \n     disabilities. I can't help but think that my father who \n     worked so hard to eliminate poverty, would have been a leader \n     in efforts to end homelessness, which exploded in the years \n     after his death. I imagine that he might have especially \n     advocated the public/private partnership that drives the \n     successful development of supportive housing. It remains to \n     be seen whether his congressional successors will feel as he \n     did, that federal support of effective, cost-efficient and \n     humane housing for our most vulnerable citizens is ``good, \n     orthodox Republicanism.''\n       One afternoon toward the end of my father's life, when he \n     was already ill, I was talking to him and crying over how \n     much I would miss him when he was gone. He said, a``You will \n     not miss me, you will remember me.'' On the second point he \n     was right.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add my name as \na cosponsor of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I know we are going to debate this issue \ntomorrow, but I wanted to come down and make a very short statement on \nit tonight.\n  I believe that the President, through Executive order, is trying to \naccomplish something that he has been unable to accomplish through \nCongress and the legislative process. I think it is very important that \nwe not allow the President to use an Executive order to limit the \nfreedom of our people.\n  The issue of whether or not an employer can hire someone to replace a \nworker who refuses to work is not a matter of labor rights. It is a \nmatter of freedom. If I do not want to work for you, I have the right \nto quit or to strike, but I do not have the right to prevent someone \nelse from working for you. I think this is a very important issue.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from Kansas for providing leadership on \nthis issue. I think it is very important that we pass this amendment, \nand I intend to vigorously support it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's \nstatement. I, too, think it is a very important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be listed as \noriginal cosponsors: Senators Dole, Warner, Hatch, Thurmond, Gramm, and \nGregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I want to congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Kassebaum. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of her amendment.\n  I believe that President Clinton started the 1996 reelection campaign \nwhen he signed the Executive order sent special delivery to his friends \nin organized labor.\n  The President may say his directive is designed to foster fairness in \nthe Federal workplace. Its real purpose, of course, is to help shore up \na political base the President currently believes is critical to his \nown political future.\n  The issue here is simple:\n  Just as an employer's demands are moderated by the knowledge that his \nemployees are legally entitled to \n[[Page S3674]] strike, so too are the demands of workers moderated by \nthe knowledge that a strike over wages and other economic conditions \nmay result in the hiring of permanent replacements.\n   This uncertainty is an essential element of collective bargaining. \nIt forces both labor and management to negotiate in good faith and \nresolve their differences through compromise.\n  With today's power grab, the President has upset the careful balance \nthat has been the hallmark of our system of collective bargaining for \nmore than 60 years.\n  The President has also set a dangerous precedent forgetting that it \nis the responsibility of Congress, not the administration, to write the \nlaws governing labor-management relations in this country.\n  Unfortunately, the President has chosen to do an end run around \nCongress. Congress has repeatedly rejected the so-called striker \nreplacement bill. The President is making a big, big mistake if he \nbelieves he can revive the defeated legislation by issuing an Executive \norder. The President may enjoy thumbing his nose at Congress but his \nenjoyment will be short-lived at best.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum. It is Congress who should set \nlabor policy in the United States, not the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3673-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Madam President,\n   this past January, America lost a patriot, and many in the Senate \nlost a friend with the passing of John White.\n\n  Several Members of Congress joined me attending memorial services for \nJohn on January 31, here in Washington, DC.\n  It was a very moving ceremony, filled with stories of John's life in \nand out of politics.\n  White House Counselor Mack McLarty obtained a transcript of the \nservices, and I believe that all those who knew John will enjoy the \nmemories it provides, and those who did not know John will learn more \nabout a remarkable public servant.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the transcript be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Services for John C. White, Tuesday, January 31, 1995, First Baptist \n                  Church of the City of Washington, DC\n\n       Reverend Dr. Gladstone. We welcome you to this memorial \n     service for Mr. John C. White, and I welcome you on behalf of \n     this Church, of which they were members, and on behalf of \n     Mrs. White, his dear wife, and the members of the family.\n       Let us worship God. God is our refuge and strength, a very \n     present help in trouble. Though the earth change and the \n     mountains be removed, God will be with us and will not leave \n     us. Jesus said, ``I am the resurrection and the life. He who \n     believes in Me, though he dies yet shall he live, and whoever \n     lives and believes in Me shall never die.''\n       Let us pray. Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God \n     almighty, just and true are Your ways, oh King of Saints. Who \n     shall not fear You, oh Lord, and glorify Your Name for You \n     only are holy, wherefore with your whole church both in \n     Heaven and on Earth. We worship and adore You, Father, Son, \n     and Holy Spirit. Ever one God, world without end. Oh Lord, \n     Jesus Christ, we do not ask for Your presence with us in this \n     service of remembrance, and gratitude and love. For you have \n     promised that where two or three are gathered together in \n     Your name, there You are in the midst. But we do ask You that \n     You would help us to recognize Your presence. Open our eyes \n     that we may know You. Melt our coldness so that we may love \n     You. Loosen our tongues that we may praise You. Take our \n     wills that we may commit them afresh to Your service. And may \n     go through this journey of life without fear and in great \n     confidence. And this we pray for Your love's sake. You taught \n     us when we pray to say together. Our Father, who art in \n     Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be \n     done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily \n     bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who \n     trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver \n     us from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the \n     Glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n       I want us now to listen to the Word of God as it comes to \n     us in the Scripture and in writings based on the Scripture. \n     We pray that this word may be a source of comfort and \n     inspiration as we face the future.\n       We begin with a writing from the book of Ecclesiastics. Let \n     us now sing the praises of famous men, the heroes of our \n     nation's history through whom the Lord established His renown \n     and revealed His majesty in each succeeding age. Some held \n     sway over kingdoms and made themselves a name by their \n     exploits. Others were sage counselors who spoke out with \n     prophetic power. Some led the people by their councils and by \n     their knowledge of the nation's law. Out of their fund of \n     wisdom they gave instruction. Some were composers of music or \n     writers of poetry. Others were endowed\n      with wealth and strength, living peacefully in their homes. \n     All these won fame in their own generation and were the \n     pride of their times. Some there are who had left their \n     names behind them, to be commemorated in story. There are \n     others who are unremembered. They are dead, and it is as \n     though they had never existed, as though they had never \n     been born or left children to succeed them. Not so our \n     forefathers. They were men of loyalty whose good deeds had \n     never been forgotten. Their prosperity is handed onto \n     their descendants and their inheritance to future \n     generations. Thanks to them their children are within the \n     covenant. The whole race of their descendants. Their line \n     will endure for all time and their fame will never be \n     blotted out. Their bodies are buried in peace, but their \n     name lives forever. Nations will recount their wisdom, and \n     God's people will sing their praises.\n       Psalm number 23: The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. \n     He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside \n     still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of \n     righteousness for His name's sake. Even though I walk through \n     the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I fear no evil, for Thou \n     art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou \n     prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies. Thou \n     anoints my head with oil, my cup overflows. Surely goodness \n     and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will \n     dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\n       John. Chapter XIV. The Words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let \n     not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in \n     Me. In my Father's house there are many rooms. If it were not \n     so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for \n     you? And when I go to prepare a place for you, I will come \n     again and will take you to Myself, that where I am, you may \n     be also. ``And you know the way where I'm going,'' Thomas \n     said to Him, ``Lord, we do not know where You are going. How \n     can we know the way?'' Jesus said to him, ``I am the Way, and \n     the Truth, and the Life.\n       And finally, I want to read a passage from a book, which to \n     so many people is next to The Bible, John Bunyon's ``Pilgrims \n     Progress.'' And I think that you'll agree that, as you listen \n     to it, it describes this good man, this servant of this \n     nation whom we remember today. It is the passing of Mr. \n     Valiant for truth. After this it was known abroad that Mr. \n     Valiant for truth was taken with a summons by the same post \n     as the other and had this for a token that the summons was \n     true. That his pitcher was broken at the fountain. When he \n     understood it, he called for his friends and told them of it. \n     Then said he, ``I am going to my father's. And though with \n     great difficulty I got hither yet how I do not repent me of \n     all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword \n     I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage. And \n     courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and scars \n     I carry with me to be a witness for me that I have fought\n      his battles who now will be my rewarder. When the day that \n     he must go hence must come, many accompanied him to the \n     riverside into which as he went into he said, ``Death, \n     where is thy sting?'' And as he went down deeper, he said, \n     ``Grave, where is thy victory?'' So he passed over, and \n     all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side. Thanks \n     be to God.\n       Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty III. As a young state legislator \n     well over twenty five years ago now, I had my first occasion \n     to meet John White when a group of us from a neighboring \n     state to that rather large state to our west traveled to \n     Austin, Texas. I was struck with Commissioner White's \n     understanding of his job, the depth of his thinking, the \n     commitment to public service. But as a young legislator at 23 \n     I was even more struck by his thoughtfulness, his ability. \n     Despite great pride and love for his state, he didn't brag on \n     it too much in our presence, and even said a few nice things \n     about Arkansas. We stayed in touch and some years later \n     serving under another distinguished chairman, Bob Strauss, I \n     had the occasion to spend considerable time with Commissioner \n     White. I benefited again from his wisdom and his counsel, but \n     continued to be influenced by his thoughtfulness, his ability \n     and his example.\n       When Donna and I moved to Washington, just over two years \n     now, no one was more gracious than Nellie and John White to \n     us. I continued to be influenced by his example and his \n     thoughtfulness. As has been written, politics and party are \n     both poorer for his passing. Commissioner, Secretary, \n     Chairman \n     [[Page S3675]] John white leaves a rich legacy and an \n     enduring example.\n       Another young man from Arkansas met Commissioner White \n     about two or three years after I had. He also was struck by \n     those qualities and characteristics that I noted, but was in \n     a little bit more of a hectic time in a national campaign \n     working with Bob Armstrong for Senator George McGovern. He, \n     too, stayed in close touch with John White over the years and \n     was influenced by his wisdom, his counsel, by his ability, \n     and by his example. He writes to the family and friends of \n     John C. White:\n       ``A patriot, a wise counselor, a truly honorable man, John \n     White consistently displayed the best of the American spirit. \n     His decency, determination, and humor are models for all of \n     us who are working to move our nation forward and to improve \n     our people's lives. I was lucky to know John and benefit from \n     his advice for many years and I will miss him. His life's \n     work is an inspiration to all of us in public life and we \n     will always be grateful for his extraordinary efforts to help \n     make our government and our country better. His legacy of \n     leadership and compassion will serve as a guiding force\n      for generations to come. Hillary and I extend our deepest \n     sympathy to you. You are in our thoughts and in our \n     prayers.'' Signed, Bill Clinton.\n       John White leaves a rich legacy and an enduring example.\n       Honorable Robert Strauss. Most of you, friends of John \n     White's, are also friends of mine and well aware of the fact \n     that I enjoy speaking, but this is one time remarks don't \n     come very easy. I suspect that John knows we're here. I \n     suspect he's looking on, and I further suspect that, if he \n     could communicate, he would say, ``Strauss, would you ever \n     have believed that a distinguished group like this would \n     gather in a memorial service for me?'' And in keeping with \n     our typical conversation I suspect that I would reply, ``No, \n     White, you know I carried you a long way for no more talent \n     than you have.'' And that would be in keeping with most of \n     our conversations. So much has been written and so much has \n     been said about John in such a good taste, so marvelously \n     done that I certainly don't want to try to say much for fear \n     of being too repetitive. But John would have loved to know \n     that you were all here. He had tremendous personal pride and, \n     like all of us, vain. He had his share of vanity. Not too \n     much, just about right. And he would be very pleased if he \n     were here today. John and I, as most of you know, had lunch a \n     couple of times a week. Had lunch at Duke Zeibert's, who I \n     see here today. I used to say to White every now and then, \n     ``You know this food at Duke's is gonna kill you, John.'' And \n     sure enough, it did.\n       John White was an old fashioned fellow with old fashioned \n     values, and we liked to talk about them. He had values that \n     don't show up too often in the political marketplace, \n     particularly here in this community. But he never varied from \n     them, and no matter what his troubles were, he was never \n     self-indulgent, and he never felt sorry for himself. He \n     enjoyed living every day. He had pride in himself. He had \n     tremendous pride in Nellie and all the rest of his family.\n       I remember planning the 1976 Convention. John called me \n     from Austin and said, ``Strauss, Nellie wants to be on the \n     platform committee.'' And said, ``Can you put her on there?'' \n     And he said, ``You said you know you have a vote there.'' And \n     I said, ``Well, that's what I'm looking for.'' All of you \n     remember the Democratic Party in the 1970's. You needed votes \n     if you were trying to get anywhere, and so we put Nellie on \n     the platform committee, and I'll never forget the platform \n     committee had deliberated quite a few days, maybe a few \n     weeks, and I called White or I saw him in town, I don't \n     remember which, and I said, ``Damn, White, that Nellie's \n     tough.'' He said, ``What do you mean?'' I said, ``Well, she \n     wants to prove everyday that I don't own her and you don't \n     own her.''\n      And he told me of the guaranteed vote I had; ``Well, she's \n     never voted against you, has she?'' I said, ``No, but why \n     she makes me work for every one of them so hard?''\n       Well, and so it is that we are here today. It was just a \n     couple of months ago that Vera Marie who is also here today \n     called John and said, ``John, we're having a birthday party \n     for Bob. It's his birthday, last October 19, and I hope you \n     can make it.'' He said, ``Well, I have a date, but I'll break \n     it. I'll break it.'' And then he said, ``You know, Vera, we \n     may not get to go to many more of these.'' I know John was \n     thinking that he would be here and I wouldn't and it worked \n     the other way.\n       Last Friday we were in Austin for John's funeral service, \n     and it was a lovely service, and a mob of people were there, \n     and they had such a pride in John and in his life, and the \n     Reverend Jesse Jackson spoke. And he spoke eloquently, and \n     beautifully, and tastefully, and the crowd was moved by every \n     word he said. And as he finished, he did something that \n     startled me, something that I had never seen done before. But \n     I enjoyed that. I enjoyed it. And I know Nellie did, so I'll \n     do it what the Reverend Jackson did. I'll ask each of you: \n     Join me in a round of applause for John White. He earned it. \n     Thank you.\n       Senator Robert Dole. Nellie and members of the family. When \n     Tip O'Neill looked back at his political career, he said one \n     of the best pieces of advice he ever received was from the \n     legendary Boston mayor, James Curley. Curley once told him, \n     he said, ``Son, it's nice to be important. But remember, it's \n     more important to be nice.'' And I suppose that anyone \n     looking to life of John C. White, he would say that he was \n     important. And the news stories about John's passing listed \n     the official and unofficial positions in which he served \n     during a very remarkable career. But I believe the lasting \n     legacy of John White is he knew that important titles and \n     spacious offices are only temporary. He knew, as Mayor Curley \n     said when it's said and done, it's more important to be nice. \n     And I think during each and every day of John's sixteen years \n     in this city, he proved that Harry Truman was wrong when he \n     said, ``if you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.'' And \n     I am just one of the countless men and women who learned over \n     the years--as a Republican I might say--``Just needed a \n     friend? Call John White.''\n       I remember my first meeting with John White. It was in \n     1977. Senate Agriculture Committee. Senator McGovern was \n     there. It was a rather raucous hearing--we used to have those \n     in the Senate. But I was very impressed with Commissioner \n     White, who was about to become Deputy Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and I remember seconding his nomination, which I \n     think surprised him and surprised maybe some of my \n     colleagues, because it didn't take me long to learn that, \n     realize that America would be well served\n      with John's decency, and honesty, and integrity, and above \n     all, just a lot of good common sense. A few days after \n     John passed away I saw a survey that said, ``one of the \n     things that makes Americans most angry is people in \n     positions of power who say one thing and do another.'' And \n     I thought that probably John would agree with that \n     statement, for in his life he was a man of his word, \n     regardless of politics. He was a man of his word. And if \n     you read Washington's Sunday Post, an excellent piece by \n     Mark Shields, in which he wrote, ``John White didn't bob \n     or weave or hedge or trim. If he was with you, you always \n     knew it.'' And when it came to politics, John didn't bob \n     or weave. He was a Democrat through and through. But he \n     always knew that being a partisan was far less important \n     than being a patriot. And no doubt about it, John was a \n     patriot. He loved Texas. He loved America. He loved his \n     family. And few served them better.\n       At the beginning of his first inaugural address in 1953, my \n     political hero, Dwight Eisenhower, led America in prayer. And \n     while the words may be Ike's, the sentiments expressed are \n     also undeniably those of John White, and I quote, ``May \n     cooperation be the mutual aim of those who, under the \n     concepts of our Constitution, hold a different political \n     face. So it all may work for the good of our beloved country \n     and Thy Glory. Amen.'' End of quote. Thank you.\n       Honorable Bob Armstrong. When I talked to Nellie, she said, \n     ``I'd like to have somebody up there that just knew him as a \n     friend.'' And John C. and I were friends. Over a long period \n     of time, we were thrown together because we did politics \n     together. We were thrown together because we liked to do a \n     lot of the same things. We had an office arrangement where he \n     happened to be above my office in a building and we could see \n     each other every day and I really loved this man. You know, \n     he came from an interesting part of Texas. It was a part \n     where rain was important, and people's lives and their \n     fortunes were governed in the old days by how much it rained. \n     It was a strip of Texas that produced products like Sam \n     Rayburn, and Lyndon Johnson, and John Nance Garner, and Ann \n     Richards, and Bob Strauss, and Webb, and Bedacek and Dobie, \n     and John C. White.\n       And as John C. said in one of these quotes in the program, \n     he couldn't wait to get out. But it still had a profound \n     effect on him and the kind of person that he was. He always \n     had fun. One of the poems that he liked, kind of harked back \n     to his upbringing. It was by Carlos Ashley, who when they \n     moved the inauguration into the House chamber, because it had \n     started a cloud burst, stood there and looked out and wrote, \n     ``Oh the glamour and the clamor that attend affairs of state \n     seem to fascinate the rabble and to some folks seem just \n     great. But when the final scale is balanced in the field of\n      loss and gain there's not one inauguration's worth a good, \n     slow, two-inch rain.'' And those were John's sentiments \n     about pomp and circumstance and what real values were. He \n     always had fun, his advice was always sound, and he was \n     always an unflagging and an unequivocal friend. First \n     example of advice he gave to me: I was two years elected \n     in a state which was pretty topsy-turvy and he'd been \n     there for eight or ten years and George McGovern became \n     our nominee, not the most popular person to be a nominee \n     for the Democratic Party in Texas.\n       I went to John's house one afternoon and, as was always the \n     case there was the New York Times and The Washington Post on \n     the coffee table, because he loved to find out and know what \n     was going on, and he said, ``Armstrong, they need us. We \n     really need to help them.'' I said, ``Well, it's probably \n     gonna be political suicide, but if you say that's what we \n     need to do, John, let's do it.'' And so he and I started on \n     that endeavor. Never always pleasant. Not with much chance. \n     Again as Mark Shields pointed out, but you knew it had to be \n     done, and he told you, ``let's do it,'' and so we did. His \n     advice turned out to be pretty good. I never had an opponent \n     for the next ten years. But you couldn't have convinced me of \n     that when I started that out with him that day. And he also \n     told me that it didn't make much difference whether it was \n     popular or not as long as it was the right thing to do.\n       You know, Nellie said, ``I want you to tell them the story \n     about the limo because you \n     [[Page S3676]] always had a good time.'' And I said, \n     ``Nellie, in church?'' And she said, ``Yeah, in church.'' But \n     I'm going to get to that in a minute. I think that most of \n     what we did that was fun had to do with campaigning, but the \n     times that I remember the most were the things that we just \n     did together. We'd leave the office and go over to Memorial \n     Stadium and we would run, because we thought that was good \n     for us. And frequently there would be coeds on that running \n     track, and some of them just lying out there in the sun. And \n     John White developed what he called ``the slow run.'' And he \n     was still running, but it was awful slow when we went by and \n     watched them.\n       Bruce Babbitt told me the other day that he thought that I \n     was the product of a misspent adulthood. And I want to tell \n     you that John White was a major contributor to that \n     condition. I remember after he'd been there for about fifteen \n     years, he said, ``You know, I've got this office where I can \n     just do it with my eyes closed.'' And he said, ``One thing I \n     started doing there for a little while was I'd get to the \n     office about 7:00 or 7:30,'' (and he was just the proper \n     amount of devious about this), ``and at 10:00 o'clock I was \n     on the golf course, I was back at 4:00 and I would stay and \n     make calls until about 7:00 at night, and people would think \n     I was the hardest working public employee they'd ever seen; \n     in at 7:30 and out at 7:00.'' And he always enjoyed those \n     kinds of times when we\n      would get out. When he got up here and I'd come to see him \n     he introduced me to golf at Congressional in the leaves, \n     in the fall. And we never did have partners. We'd just \n     ride together and he talked to me about his dad and I \n     talked to him about mine and how we hated them, because \n     they made us do chores and made us be disciplined when we \n     didn't want to be. But they also taught us what was right \n     and what was wrong, and they also got real smart, our dads \n     did, when we went away to college. And when we came back \n     they were a lot smarter than they were when we went. But I \n     guess the things that I remember the most was that he \n     always bragged on Nellie, and he always said, ``You know, \n     it's just amazing to me how Linda and Nellie put up with \n     us.'' And that they do. And he always talked about his \n     kids, and he talked about how wonderful they were. If I \n     had one wish right now, I wish that you could have heard \n     what his children had to say about him in Austin, because \n     John R. and Ed were just absolutely perfect; (that) was \n     the term I used about their dad and their relationship.\n       Well, I'll tell you about the limo. We weren't used to \n     riding in them, but we were in Houston and we went down to \n     some kind of a meeting and on our way back on the road. It \n     was very hot in Houston, as it can be, and we were riding \n     along there, kind of embarrassed that we were in a limo, and \n     it was air-conditioned, and there came along a `57 Chevrolet \n     with about five to six kids in it, and they pulled up \n     alongside and looked over there at these guys riding in that \n     air-conditioned limo, and they gave what I would call the \n     ``Texas hot weather hand signal,'' that people give to people \n     in a limo. And John was sort of appalled by this and I said, \n     ``Just think about it as them giving us a hand, one finger at \n     a time.'' And he always liked that and used that. Sometimes, \n     good things come out of bad ones.\n       I guess he understood about money and how important it was \n     in politics, and his favorite story was about the time that \n     Speaker Rayburn woke up one day and found out that the money \n     from cotton had not come to Washington, and Roosevelt was in \n     his fourth election. He had a new guy named Harry Truman \n     replacing John Nance Garner and the cotton money hadn't \n     gotten in, but, as they did in those days, they sent a fellow \n     up with a satchel with the money in cash, and he got to Union \n     Station and the money was burning a hole in his pocket, and \n     he didn't know what to do, but what he did was he went over \n     and said, ``Where's the Democratic headquarters?'' And they \n     said, ``It is over right next to the Senate.'' And sure \n     enough, there was a small headquarters over there that they \n     had set up for Senator Truman, because he could just go there \n     and kind of do what he needed to do and nobody ever came to \n     it. And so, Mr. Jackson, who\n      had the money, walked in and he said, ``Here's the cotton \n     money.'' And Harry Truman looked at it and it was a lot of \n     money, and nobody had ever done that. And he got back on \n     the train. He went back to Austin. They said, ``What did \n     you do with the money?'' He said, ``I gave it to the \n     headquarters.'' They said, ``Which one?'' He said, ``Harry \n     Truman's.'' They said, ``You, fool. That's not the right \n     headquarters. You gave it to the wrong person.'' One year \n     later, Mr. Jackson had his own desk in the White House, in \n     the Truman White House, where he could do all the business \n     that he wanted to do. And John White thought that was \n     simple justice, and he loved to tell that story.\n       He gave me one other piece of advice. He said, ``You really \n     ought to come up here.'' He said, ``You'll love it,'' and, \n     ``They need you.'' The last thing was superfluous. He always \n     had that ability to flatter you, just a little bit. They \n     didn't need me, but he'd say ``They need you.'' But you could \n     always kind of believe in it if John C. told you that. But he \n     loved this city, and he loved the people, and he loved the \n     power, and he loved the system. But he didn't love the power \n     as an end in itself. He loved the fact that people could use \n     that power for good if they were the right kind of office \n     holders and if they used it wisely.\n       I used to ask him when he was going back. And he wouldn't \n     ever answer me directly. He just kind of looked off in the \n     distance maybe and say that he really had a lot of friends \n     here in Washington. And in a way, that was an answer. And so, \n     I had a great time knowing him. I always said that a \n     conversation with John White was like a drink of cold water \n     from a hill country spring on a hot day. He was always \n     refreshing and he was always sustaining.\n       Let us pray. John C. is with You now, God. Thanks from all \n     of us for letting us have him for a while. Amend.\n       Mr. Jack Nelson. Bob Strauss said that, uh, John White \n     would have loved to have seen you all here today and I know \n     he would have looking out over this crowd. You know what John \n     White would've really loved? He would've loved the Reverend \n     Jesse Jackson preaching his funeral in the rotunda of the \n     Texas State capital and Bob Dole eulogizing him at a memorial \n     at the First Baptist Church here. He would have really loved \n     that.\n       Most of you were not at John's funeral, but as one of many \n     of his reporter friends, I want to report just briefly on \n     what a moving and extraordinarily unusual funeral service it \n     was. It was a sad--but I must say a magic--moment. Jesse \n     Jackson, in a flowing, white robe, conducted the service in a \n     packed rotunda. The first funeral service ever held there.\n       The Texas Democratic establishment turned out in force: Ann \n     Richards, Jim Wright, Bob Strauss, Lloyd Bentsen, and many \n     others--and they came from all over Texas and from all over \n     the country. His family and friends spoke movingly of John as \n     father, grandfather, business associate, politician and \n     friend, and in his eulogy, Jesse Jackson made a point that's \n     central of John's life: He was one of the few white men who \n     had the courage to take the political risk to bring equal \n     justice to Texas and the South. ``Look around you,'' said \n     Jackson, ``Look around you at the black and the brown faces \n     among all the white faces. Thirty years ago you wouldn't have \n     seen that, and you can see it now because of John C. White.'' \n     And then Jesse did what Bob Strauss said startled him, and \n     then I must say sort of surprised me. He said, ``Everyone \n     should express themselves,'' and calls for the applause and \n     it rang out throughout the capital. And I gotta tell you, it \n     made us all feel a lot better. Jesse said, ``When we go to \n     the state cemetery for the burial you'll see `1924 dash 1995' \n     on John's tombstone.'' He said, ``Well the year he was born, \n     1924, means nothing. We don't have anything to do with when \n     we are born and come into this world. And 1995 doesn't mean \n     anything either. We don't have anything to do with when we \n     leave. It's the dash that counts.'' And Jesse touched on a \n     long and impressive list of what John did with that dash.\n       You know, John told me more than once--and like Robert \n     Strauss, I went out to lunch frequently with John White; \n     maybe not twice a week, but an awful lot of times. John told \n     me more than once, ``God, I love this town, but I wish it \n     hadn't gotten so mean.'' And I thought that said a lot about \n     John. He did love Washington, and he did love the political \n     game, and he played a key role in it. But Washington never \n     changed him. He was never mean, and he despised the kind of \n     personal attacks aimed at destroying political careers that \n     has become so commonplace here. He always said the way he saw \n     Washington was that it wasn't so much made up of Democrats \n     and Republicans as it was of real people and jackasses. John \n     had a lot of friends on both sides. Real people, of course.\n       He did have an extraordinary relationship with the press. \n     And I thought it was appropriate that you got two reporters \n     here among the political figures who are eulogizing him. He \n     was a source for many reporters, and some of them are in the \n     audience here. For me it was like having another reporter in \n     the bureau. I could call him up and say, ``John, have you \n     heard so and so?,'' and he then might, say, either, ``Give me \n     some information,'' or he'd say, ``Well, I don't know a lot \n     about that, but let me make a few calls.'' Reporters saw him \n     as much more than a news source. He was our friend. In most \n     cases, he was a close friend, and certainly in my case, he \n     was first and foremost.\n       Men sometimes have a hard time sharing their innermost \n     thoughts and feelings, but I could do that with John. He \n     could do that with me. And when John asked, ``How you \n     doing?,'' it wasn't a routine greeting. He really wanted to \n     know how you were doing. He was concerned if you had a \n     problem. He always wanted to know if he could help. He was \n     reassuring, too. He would tell you that he had similar \n     problems. ``Not to worry, things will work out alright.'' He \n     used to say that people he liked most were those who would \n     stand by their friends and their commitments and who never \n     forgot where they came from. John certainly never forgot \n     where he came from. He took pride in his humble beginnings \n     and he stood by his friends through thick and thin, even when \n     that caused him more than a little trouble. When a Republican \n     friend most of us knows was hit by a criminal charge, John \n     concluded that the criminal charge was unfair, and he not \n     only stood by his friend, but he helped raise funds for his \n     defense. And he made a point of being seen at lunch with him \n     at popular Washington restaurants such as Duke's. Later, of \n     course, the friend was exonerated. John didn't tear down \n     people. He built them up. He was proud of his friends and his \n     family. He talked with pride of Nellie and her \n     [[Page S3677]] work in Romania. He was proud of his children \n     and grandchildren, and he often talked of them.\n       Nellie has asked me to share with John's friends the letter \n     she received, a personal letter. It says, ``I'm glad we had a \n     chance to talk. I'll never forget the first time I met John \n     back in 1972. He had such a great balance of common sense and \n     compassion with an energy, and I was elated when he became \n     the DNC chair, and I am grateful for all he has given to our \n     party and our country since. All of us who know John are \n     better for the experience and all of us will miss him. I know \n     you will miss him most of all, and I hope the memory of your \n     great years together and the love and support of your friends \n     will help to sustain you. Hillary and I send you our thoughts \n     and prayers. Sincerely, Bill''\n       You know, it's hard to avoid all the cliches when \n     remembering John, because in his case they're all so true. \n     His word was his bond. He would give you the shirt off his \n     back. He did light up a room when he walked in. And I'm proud \n     to call him a friend. He's a friend we'll all miss, but we'll \n     remember, I think, with deep affection.\n       Mr. Jim Wooten. Here's a good rule for reporters: Don't be \n     pals with pols. It doesn't mean that you can't enjoy their \n     company, once in a while. It doesn't mean you can't have \n     lunch with them, once in a while. It doesn't mean you can't \n     like them, once in a while. It just means there needs to be \n     some proper distance in space between us and them. Between \n     those of us who cover the news and those who make it. Because \n     the\n      closer you get, the less you see. So if you want to see \n     clearly, don't get too close. Don't be pals with pols. \n     This is a very good rule for all reporters.\n       Sometimes, though, he was a pol, wasn't he? You could tell \n     that, because of the pure pleasure he derived from telling \n     the political story. And not only that, from listening to \n     them. To yours. To Strauss's (now there's a real test). And \n     to mine, too. I don't think I ever told my political stories \n     to better listeners that John C. Even if he knew they weren't \n     exactly true (and what political story ever is). Even if he \n     heard them before, he'd sit there and listen and help you \n     along, and encourage you, and chuckle you, and then give a \n     big rip of a laugh, and then he'd say, ``I knew some old boys \n     like that.'' And off he'd ride on some wonderful jaunt down \n     the trails of his remarkable life. For John C., a good story \n     was like a pair of boots: the more you worn them, the more \n     comfortable they were. I loved his story about how much he \n     grew in the eyes of Lyndon once he'd introduced him to \n     Nellie. I loved listening to him. His voice for me was like \n     the distant bell of a country church, always reminding me of \n     home. And he said once, ``Well, pal, they have fewer voters \n     in Alabama, but I expect we come out about even on mules and \n     fools.''\n       He was a pol, wasn't he? You could tell that because he \n     made it look so easy. Whether he was managing an unmanageable \n     national convention or untying some devilish knot in the \n     party, or settling some bloody internecine squabble or just \n     working the tables at Duke's--he made it look easy. And \n     politics never is. Not in this town, and not in Texas. And \n     especially not for a man who felt about his party the way \n     most men feel about their mothers. It was where he came from, \n     and who he was. He was his party's son, and he would, by God, \n     wear its name as proudly as he wore his own. White, John C., \n     Democrat, Yellow-Dog. And in five separate decades, in the \n     stormy politics of Texas and America, those were John C.'s \n     unimpeachable credentials. When governor Shivers defected to \n     Ike, John C. backed Adlai. When the preacher said, \n     ``Catholics oughtn't be president,'' John C. was a Kennedy \n     man. When herds of Texas democrats stampeded over to \n     Goldwater and Nixon, John C. stood straight up for L.B.J. and \n     Humphrey. ``Hubert Umphrey'' as he called him--and McGovern, \n     too. Over the years in campaign after campaign, from Carter \n     through Clinton, through the sunshine and the rain, he rode \n     that same old horse. And he was as tall in the saddle when he \n     finally got off as when he first got on.\n       This is important to remember about John C. Not that he was \n     blind to his party's warts or deaf to its bologna, but rather \n     that he loved it for its promise. Not that he was indifferent \n     to its foolishness or insensitive to its folly, but rather \n     that he was committed to its possibilities.\n       John C. was the most hard-headed, down-to-earth, practical, \n     realistic, commonsense dreamer I ever knew. That was his \n     strength and the source of his stamina. This fierce embrace \n     of an imperfect party as the perfect political expression of \n     the ideas and ideals that he cherished. Others might stray or \n     waffle or wander or waiver; John C. always danced with the \n     girl who brung him. He was a pol wasn't he? You can see that \n     in the respect that other pols had for him; even if he \n     wouldn't give a dime to their party. You can see that here \n     today, look around. And you can hear it too, in the unspoken \n     affirmations of everybody who ever knew him or worked with \n     him or worked against him, that here was one politician who \n     gave politics a good name.\n       Years ago over lunch at Duke's, he was scolding me for my \n     appearance; ``Listen pal,'' he said, ``you ain't a newspaper \n     man no more--you've got to get yourself some clothes. You \n     need more than one suit and tie. Hell, I'll loan you the \n     money!'' And that progressed into us listing the real friends \n     we had, the genuine pals, people who might even lend us \n     money, folks in whom we could place our complete trust. John \n     C. had too many to count, he said, which was true, look \n     around, and I had too few to mention and now one less. He was \n     a pol and he was a pal.\n       We argued about a lot of things over the years, but there \n     was one thing we agreed on and that was that we were both \n     literary critics. And that we had found and read and reread \n     the great American novel. A rough and tumble saga about two \n     Texas rangers who went off up to Montana, far far away from \n     Lonesome Dove. How he loved that book, how I did too and we'd \n     recite from it over lunch. Especially, its last few pages: \n     ``mortally wounded and down to his last, few breaths, \n     Augustus McCray looked up at his long time pal and partner \n     Captain Caw and he whispered, `My God, Woodrow, it was quite \n     a party.''' My God, chairman, it was quite a party.\n       Reverend Dr. Gladstone. We have listened with gratitude, \n     with admiration, and with hope. Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the \n     Victorian Baptist preacher said of William Ewart Gladstone, \n     four times Prime Minister of Britain, he said, ``We believe \n     in no man's infallibility, but it is restful to believe in \n     one man's integrity. Let us pray. Eternal God before who's \n     face the generations rise and fall. Beneath who's will and \n     within who's patience the story of our lives is told. In this \n     memorial service, for your servant John, we lift up our \n     hearts in gratitude, we thank you for his character. We know \n     that this is the true wealth of life. We may be festooned \n     with the whole haberdashery of success and yet go to our \n     graves castaways. We thank you that we heard Senator Dole say \n     that while it is nice to be important, it is more important \n     to be nice. And so we thank you for the decency, the \n     integrity, and the loyalty of your servant John. We thank you \n     his commitment to the political affairs of this nation. We \n     thank you for all those who are ready to walk the lonely \n     places of leadership, to become vulnerable to criticism, \n     abuse, misrepresentation and public failure and yet who \n     believes they are called to do this for love of country and \n     party. For his commitment to his president, his party, and to \n     the whole nation we give you thanks. And we thank you for his \n     enjoyment of his family. For his dear wife, Nellie, for his \n     children, whom he admired so much, for his sister and for his \n     grandchildren. We remember them all now tenderly and commit \n     them to your loving care. And we pray that as they sigh for \n     the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is \n     still, they may know your living presence. And we thank you \n     for our Lord Jesus Christ who has defeated death and brought \n     life and immortality to light. We thank you that we can say \n     he is not here but he is risen again until we meet in your \n     presence. So bless each one of us here members of the family \n     friends and colleagues and keep us at it and with it and for \n     it until our work is done our course is run and on your kind \n     arms we fall. And this we pray through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n     Amen.\n       Will the congregation stand for the blessing and the \n     benediction and remain standing while the family and speakers \n     leave.\n       Go forth on your journey, Christian soul. Go in the \n     strengths of God and may He bring you at last to the land of \n     Promise, the Country of the Great King. The grace of our Lord \n     Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the \n     Holy Spirit be with us all ever more. Amen.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3674-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3677-S3678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ACT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, one of the more exciting and innovative \nprograms enacted during the 103d Congress was the National and \nCommunity Service Act proposed by President Clinton. Under the \nAmeriCorps program established as a result of that act, young men and \nwomen are now able, through community service, to earn an education \nbenefit to help defray the costs of a higher education.\n  I am concerned, however, that this program may now be the target of \nsevere cutbacks. Because of this, I wanted to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the correspondence I recently received from Mr. George \nGraboys of Barrington, RI, where he is a distinguished and widely \nrespected business leader. Having retired as the chief executive \nofficer of Citizens Bank, Mr. Graboys, nevertheless, remains very \nactive in civic affairs. Among many activities, he serves presently as \nthe vice chairman of the Rhode Island Children's Crusade for Higher \nEducation.\n  Mr. Graboys' view on the operation of AmeriCorps in Rhode Island \nmerit careful and thoughtful consideration. I ask unanimous consent, \ntherefore, that the text of his January 31, 1995, letter to me be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Barrington, RI, January 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Claiborne DeB. Pell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the AmeriCorps \n     [[Page S3678]] national service program and to enlist your \n     assistance in light of the recent call by House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich to eliminate the program.\n       From my perspective, AmeriCorps is a refreshing new \n     government initiative. I am impressed, particularly, by its \n     grassroots nature and its ability to place 20,000 dedicated \n     individuals directly into community agencies in its first \n     year of operation.\n       As Vice Chairman of the Rhode Island Children's Crusade for \n     Higher Education, I have had the opportunity to see the \n     merits of the program first hand. The Crusade's 51 AmeriCorps \n     participants--13 full-time and 38 part-time--have provided an \n     infusion of new energy to the organization. In less than two \n     months, they have built relationships with over 40 schools \n     and community agencies and have created 23 new Crusade \n     mentoring programs in the seven Rhode Island communities with \n     the greatest numbers of low-income children. At the same \n     time, they have been busy phoning parents whose children may \n     need services and going door to door to recruit new \n     Crusaders. Presently, 324 children are being served through \n     these AmeriCorps programs. Crusade Corps members are well on \n     their way to reaching their goal of creating 26 programs that \n     will serve 780 children.\n       Newt Gingrich has called the program ``coerced \n     voluntarism.'' Based upon what I have seen, nothing could be \n     further from the truth. Our AmericCorps participants \n     represent a racially diverse group of people from ages 16-55, \n     including 10 parents of Crusaders. Within this diversity, all \n     of them share an intense desire to serve the community and to \n     better themselves in the process. AmeriCorps and the Crusade \n     provide a structure and direction that meshes with their \n     sense of altruism. The modest living stipends they receive \n     make it possible for them to dedicate a full year to \n     community service--rather than a few hours a week. This \n     substantive volunteer experience is something that is likely \n     to effect many participants' choice of careers and to foster \n     a commitment to community service that will endure as their \n     careers advance.\n       Speaker Gingrich has also indicated that it is a ``waste of \n     money to give limited benefits to college students.'' Again, \n     I think he has missed the mark. The Crusade's AmeriCorps \n     participants cover a broad range of educational attainment. \n     Approximately 30% do not have an undergraduate degree, 53% \n     have earned or are in the process of earning a Bachelors \n     degree, and 17% have or are working towards their Masters or \n     Ph.D. Each of the Crusade's participants has indicated, \n     however, that they have a desire to further their education. \n     For them, the educational benefits of AmeriCorps--$4,725 for \n     full-time participants and $2,363 for part-time \n     participants--will be of substantive help along the way. \n     Moreover, the leadership and community building skills they \n     are acquiring through their experience with AmeriCorps will \n     complement their formal education and enable them to become \n     more productive citizens.\n       I think the AmeriCorps program has produced remarkable \n     results in a very short period of time. It has tremendous \n     potential for strengthening the nation's service ethic while \n     impacting community needs in a cost of effective manner. I \n     hope that I can count on your support in ensuring that the \n     program nurtured and protected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George Graboys.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3677-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we approach St. Patrick's Day 1995, \nIrish eyes are smiling as perhaps never before in the quarter century \nof violence that has wracked Northern Ireland. In celebrating the \nremarkable progress made toward peace during the past year, we are also \nmindful of the responsibility that all of us who care about Northern \nIreland have to the people there who have suffered so much from the \nviolence. We must do all we can to make certain that a lasting peace is \nachieved.\n  Last Monday, the New York Times carried an eloquent and very poignant \narticle by James Clarity about Pauline Hegney, a Catholic mother in \nBelfast. Her husband, the father of her four children, was killed by \nProtestant paramilitaries more than 3 years ago. She is one of the \ncountless survivors of the violence who, rather than harboring hatred, \nfeverently hopes that no one else--Protestant or Catholic--will suffer \nher fate.\n  Clearly the people of Northern Ireland want the current cease-fire to \ncontinue and peace talks to begin. All of us share that hope as well.\n  Mrs. Hegney wrote an extremely moving account of the death of her \nhusband, and Mr. Clarity quotes at length from her words in his \narticle.I believe that his story and her words will be of interest to \nall of us, and I ask unanimous consent that the article by James \nClarity may be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that \na poem by W.H. Auden, which speaks to all such loss, may be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 1995]\n               A War Widow's Thoughts at Peace's Downing\n\n                         (By James F. Clarity)\n       Belfast, Northern Ireland.--Pauline Hegney, the mother of \n     four young children whose husband was slain three and a half \n     years ago by Protestant paramilitaries on a Belfast street, \n     prays every day that the Government peace effort will work \n     and that there will be no more killings here in the name of \n     patriotism.\n       She is among the tens of thousands of survivors of the \n     3,172 Protestants and Roman Catholics who have been killed in \n     sectarian warfare here since 1969. She speaks with a soft \n     Ulster lilt and there is passion in her voice, but no hatred.\n       Her husband, Karl, an unemployed house painter, was gunned \n     down in the street on his way home from a pub. Both his widow \n     and the police say he had no involvement in the Irish \n     Republican Army. The police told her they had an idea who the \n     killers were, but no proof, she said. No one has been \n     arrested.\n       She was left with their four young children and a job at \n     the Europa Hotel in the city center, as head of the banquet \n     dining room staff. But the I.R.A. viewed the hotel as a major \n     economic target and bombed it frequently. The bombings often \n     shut it down, putting her out of work, sometimes for months.\n       The I.R.A. declares that it is fighting for Northern \n     Ireland's Catholics. Mrs. Hegney, who is Catholic, said she \n     prays for them, and for the Protestant guerrillas too.\n       She told her children that ``a sick man'' had killed their \n     father and that he was now in heaven with Granny, his mother. \n     Her daughter, Julie-Anne, said that at first she hated Granny \n     for taking him away and that she saw her father return to her \n     room one night. She said she wanted to die and go to heaven \n     with him. Lately Julie-Anne, who is now 8, says only, ``I \n     wish I could see him, mummy, for one wee minute.''\n       Mrs. Hegney joined a group of Catholic and Protestant \n     widows of guerrilla war victims, and they exchange their \n     feelings and problems.\n       But the cease-fires that have raised the hopes for peace \n     and for a normal life for most people in Northern Ireland \n     also left her and the other widows feeling depressed, she \n     said.\n       ``During the trouble, we were all in it together,'' she \n     said. ``Everyone in Belfast was affected. But when the peace \n     came, I felt isolated. Other people can get on with their \n     lives. We can't.''\n       Last October, as reports spread\n        that the Protestant guerrillas, following the lead of the \n     I.R.A., were going to call their own cease-fire, she hoped \n     it would not be on Oct. 13, the third anniversary of her \n     husband's killing, but it was announced on that day.\n       ``It didn't feel right,'' she said. ``I was praying for \n     peace, but I didn't want it on that day.'' Now, she said, she \n     faces the prospect of seeing representatives of the \n     guerrillas become celebrated personalities as they approach \n     formal negotiations with the British and Irish Governments \n     and the other political parties in the North.\n       ``I don't like the idea that after they've killed so many \n     people, they'll be sitting down to say what the future will \n     be, when people like these destroyed my children's future. \n     But if it stops people being murdered, I've no objection.''\n       Her children still miss their father. Karl Jr., who is 14, \n     wants to be a lawyer. She said she asked him if he would \n     defend someone he knew to be guilty of a ``terrible crime.'' \n     Karl said: ``Would you serve him if he came into the Europa. \n     You do what you're paid to do.'' She shrugged.\n       ``I'll get through it,'' she said. ``I'm a struggler. I've \n     begun to write about it.''\n       In her account of the night her husband was killed, she \n     wrote: ``We never know what's to come for us, though, do we? \n     I put the boys to bed when their daddy went out. I went into \n     the kitchen and had a little laugh to myself when I saw the \n     saucepans sitting on the cooker. One was full of potatoes and \n     the other one had sprouts in it all ready for the Sunday. He \n     also had the roast cooked. I thought how organized my Karl \n     is.\n       ``A very curt male voice came on the phone saying he was a \n     police officer and asked if I could make my way to the police \n     station as my husband was in hospital seriously ill. I lost \n     my mind at that moment and I don't think I have actually \n     found it all again.\n       ``The nightmare for me had only just begun. I went to see \n     Karl lying in that operating theater where he had died with \n     the doctors fighting to save his life. He lay there still and \n     cold, no life left in the body of the man who had taken the \n     core of me, loved me and made my life worth living. I thought \n     how could he leave me? What would I do without him? How was I \n     going to live without him?\n       ``I held Karl's hand and it was like holding the hand of a \n     wax dummy. It\n      felt so strange. I didn't cry. I just asked him to give me \n     strength to get through the next few hours. \n     [[Page S3679]] I went and sat at the top of the stairs \n     waiting for the first of the children to waken. I knew this \n     would be our 5-year-old daughter, Julie-Anne. She was wearing \n     her little pink and green pajamas and she still had her hair \n     in pigtails from the day before.

A bill to eliminate the Board of Review for the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority and increase the number of Presidential \nappointees to the Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n the metropolitan washington airports authority amendments act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that \nseeks to accomplish two goals: first, to make sure that the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority [MWAA] can continue to \noperate and prosper; and second, to ensure that appropriate input into \nthe decisions of the MWAA is maintained. The bill thus protects the \ninterests of the travelling public and maintains many well-developed \nand defined compromises on which many of my colleagues have worked over \nthe years.\n  I had initially considered legislation recreating a board of review \nwith authority to oversee the actions of MWAA. That was part of the \noriginal arrangement in transferring these airports--Congress would be \nable to oversee actions of the airports because they are critical \nresources, not just for Virginia, but for all of the States. Such an \napproach also would have protected the traveling public and maintained \nthe resolution of difficult issues accomplished with the transfer. This \nbill does not take that step, but instead is intended as a compromise, \nand one that is workable for all concerned.\n  I want to put this matter in perspective for my colleagues. In 1986, \nI spent many days on the Senate floor debating the transfer of \nWashington National and Dulles Airports. I believed then, as I do now, \nthat we have a responsibility to ensure that Federal assets are \nproperly used, are properly valued, and are able to provide benefits to \ntheir users. These airports are important to all of us and our \nconstituents. As a result, when Congress created the MWAA, a number of \ncritical and interrelated compromises were made, including assurances \nthat access to the airports would be appropriately maintained and that \nthe Federal Government would retain its authority and oversight of the \nairports.\n  In addition, Congress specifically recognized the historic use of the \nairports and legislated that the number of operations, or slots, and \nthe rules governing flights would be frozen. The local community, \nincluding Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, recognized \nthat National Airport would be allowed to continue to serve cities that \nit had traditionally served, and Dulles would be given a chance to grow \ninto a major domestic and international airport. This meant that noise \nproblems would be minimized at National, and growth would occur at a \nthen-distant facility some 22 miles from the Capital.\n  As my colleagues know, both Washington National and Dulles \nInternational are undergoing major renovations. The airports floated \nmore than $1.3 billion in bonds and currently have underway about $700 \nmillion in construction projects. All of us have seen first hand the \nmajor construction going on at these airports. That construction came \nabout because Congress recognized that the airports served different \npurposes, and we\n facilitated future planning and growth opportunities. National Airport \nhas a perimeter rule, which ensures service to communities within the \nperimeter rule. That was part of the original deal. The former Governor \nof Virginia, Gerald Baliles, at a hearing before the Commerce \nCommittee's Aviation Subcommittee, recently reiterated how carefully \nbalanced the transfer legislation was. Dulles, without a perimeter \nrule, has the benefit of a superhighway with door-to-door access from \ndowntown Washington to the airport, to facilitate its growth. And it \nhas grown. We need to make sure that we keep our commitments to all of \nthe States involved.\n\n  Congress also recognized that these airports are more than just local \nairports, and because the underlying land is Federal property, we \nestablished a congressional board of review and an Airports Authority--\ntwo separate bodies, appointed in different ways, and with different \nresponsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed with our method of \noversight, and on January 23, 1995, the Supreme Court denied certiorari \nin Hechinger versus Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. The \nCourt of Appeals had struck down as unconstitutional the congressional \nboard of review. The appellate court's decision has been stayed until \nMarch 31, 1995.\n  Under the existing legislation, because the board of review has been \nfound to be unconstitutional, the Airports Authority is unable to move \nforward on major decisions.\n  As a result, Congress must now take action to address the problem. \nThere are many options available, but our goal should be to ensure \nappropriate oversight of a facility on Federal property being operated \nunder a long-term lease, without creating a maze of oversight. This is \na fine line, but a responsibility we must accept. Therefore, today I am \nintroducing legislation that will add six Presidentially appointed and \nSenate-confirmed members to the MWAA board of directors. This will \nensure that the Federal Government continues its active participation \nin the decisions of these airports, but also will recognize that the \ncommunities have an important and critical role in shaping the future \nof these airports. The bill eliminates the congressional board of \nreview.\n  The legislation goes to the heart of the problem--and does so in a \nway that \n[[Page S3681]] is constitutional. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 85\n\n       Whereas women constitute more than 50 percent of the \n     population of the United States;\n       Whereas, because women's health historically has received \n     little attention in terms of Federal funding and in terms of \n     research priorities, there should be an increased emphasis on \n     the needs and preferences of women in such areas;\n       Whereas the Federal Government should increase its support \n     for women's health and can make a significant difference in \n     improving the status of women's health;\n       Whereas increased funding for research is insignificant if \n     women's health care services are restricted;\n       Whereas many women view their obstetrician-gynecologist as \n     their primary or sole physician;\n       Whereas approximately 70 percent of women would be \n     unwilling to change their obstetrician-gynecologist to save \n     money;\n        [[Page S3682]] Whereas an obstetrician-gynecologist \n     improves the access to health care of a woman by providing \n     primary and preventive health care throughout the woman's \n     lifetime, encompassing care of the whole patient in addition \n     to focusing on the processes of the female reproductive \n     system;\n       Whereas preventive and primary care provided by an \n     obstetrician-gynecologist includes instruction in breast \n     self-examination, cervical cancer screening, health \n     education, instruction in health promotion, hypertension and \n     cardiovascular surveillance, osteoporosis counseling, \n     sexually transmitted diseases counseling, and identification \n     of victims of domestic violence;\n       Whereas the most effective way to treat health problems is \n     to prevent such problems from occurring or to catch such \n     problems in the early stages, when such problems are most \n     treatable;\n       Whereas 60 percent of all office visits to obstetrician-\n     gynecologists are for preventive care;\n       Whereas obstetrician-gynecologists refer their patients to \n     other physicians less frequently than other primary care \n     providers, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming referrals;\n       Whereas more than two-thirds of all visits to obstetrician-\n     gynecologists were by established patients of the physician \n     who were returning for care of a medical condition;\n       Whereas obstetrician-gynecologists manage the health of \n     women beyond the reproductive system, and are uniquely \n     qualified on the basis of education and experience to provide \n     such health care services to women;\n       Whereas obstetrician-gynecologists provide health care to \n     women with an awareness of the relationship of disease to \n     family history;\n       Whereas over two-thirds of general family practice \n     physicians do not deliver newborns and will not be able to \n     address this need of women; and\n       Whereas 80 percent of maternity care services in the United \n     States are provided by obstetrician-gynecologists: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) obstetrician-gynecologists should be included as \n     primary care providers for women in Federal laws relating to \n     the provision of health care; and\n       (2) legislative proposals that define primary care should \n     include primary care services performed by obstetrician-\n     gynecologists in such definition.\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senator \nBoxer and Senator Snowe, along with 37 other Senators in submitting a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that obstetrician-gynecologists [OB-\nGYN's], should be recognized as primary care physicians under Federal \nhealth programs.\n  This resolution is a very important first step in guaranteeing \nAmerican women the access to quality medical care that they need in \norder to lead healthy and productive lives. Such a change in policy \nwould give women greater access to the medical treatment they need, \nwhile eliminating much of the bureaucracy in our current health care \nsystem.\n  American women use obstetrician-gynecologists more than any other \ntype of physician. In 1987, more than 53 percent of women aged 15 and \nolder, who visited an OB-GYN, did so to receive a general check-up. In \n1990, over 7 million women visited an OB-GYN for a general examination. \nWhen asked, the majority of these women stated that they regarded their \nOB-GYN as their primary care physician. In fact, receiving a general \ncheck-up was cited more frequently as a motivating factor for seeing an \nOB-GYN than for visiting either family physicians or internists.\n  OB-GYN's provide a variety of services which are vital to women's \nhealth: screenings for breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer; counseling \nabout sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV; and identifications \nof domestic violence victims.\n  One of the most important services that OB-GYN's provide is prenatal \ncare. Lack of adequate prenatal care has serious ramifications on our \nsociety: mental retardation, deafness, blindness, autism, cerebral \npalsy, epilepsy, or chronic lung ailments, are just a few of the \nproblems that affect children whose mothers did not receive adequate \nprenatal care. The Institute of Medicine, in its report, ``Preventing \nLow Birthweight,'' found that prenatal care is most effective in \nreducing the chance of low birthweight among high-risk women.\n  Dr. Ruth Schwartz, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at \nthe University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, has \nstated that a woman with prenatal care is five times as likely to give \nbirth to a living child than women who have no prenatal care. Although \nonly 7 percent of live births were low-birth-weight babies, this number \naccounts for nearly 60 percent of all infant deaths.\n  Infant mortality rates in this country should be a concern to all of \nus. We are the richest nation on the planet, the most industrialized \ncountry in the world, and yet we have one of the highest infant \nmortality rates in the industrialized world. As the preceding \nstatistics attest, one way to defeat this statistic is to provide \nAmerican women freer access to OB-GYN's.\n  The majority of American women perceive their OB-GYN's as their \nprimary care physicians. The challenges that we face with regard to \nbattling infant mortality and ensuring health babies point us toward \none direction: giving women direct access to OB-GYN's.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nresolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3681-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 86--RELATIVE TO THE DEPUTY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, last November's election signaled the end of \nbusiness as usual on the part of the Federal Government. With the \npostelection talk of welfare reform and block grants, Indian country \nhas been swept up by concern that the unique needs of Indian tribes \nwill be ignored during the debate on block grants and welfare reform. \nIndeed, in the dozens of meetings I have had with tribal leaders over \nthe past month, they have expressed concern that current block grant \nproposals in the Congress will diminish the already inadequate level of \nwelfare and social service resources available to tribes and their \nmembers. I understand these concerns because, as a practical matter, \ntribal governments have been routinely shut out of the policy debates \nand kept away from the table when major policy decisions are made.\n  What is most frustrating, however, is that during the past 2 months I \nhave heard statements that are premised solely on the notion that \npromoting block grants implies that the new majority in Congress \nintends to diminish the trust responsibility that the Congress and the \nadministration have toward American Indians and Alaska Natives, and \nthat the majority intends to use reform to undermine tribal sovereignty \nand the government-to-government relationship between the United States \nand Indian tribes. I find it unfortunate that there are those who would \nchoose to spread this message of impending doom rather than work \nconstructively and creatively to find ways to include tribal \ngovernments in the current debate.\n  Mr. President, let me set the record straight. I do not believe any \nMember of this body, Republican or Democrat, would deliberately and \npurposefully seek to diminish the benefits that various Federal \nprograms have provided for individual Indians and Indian tribes. In \nfact, I believe that the new Congress has the potential for offering a \nrare opportunity for Indian tribes to reshape how the Federal \nGovernment has dealt with them. The primary reason we are undertaking \nwelfare and block grant reform is to enhance the control of local \ngovernments over these programs. This rationale is quite similar to the \nFederal-Indian policies I have continuously promoted for Indian tribal \ngovernments since the beginning of my tenure on the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  As the chairman of the committee, I will continue to advance Federal \npolicies that are intended to enhance the control of tribal governments \nover Federal programs. Therefore, I intend to do everything I can to \nensure two \n[[Page S3684]] things--first, that tribes are not swept aside as we \nreform the welfare system. And second, that any block grants support, \nrather than undermine, the unique role that tribal governments have in \nthe Federal system.\n  In order to accomplish these goals I intend to advocate for the \nprovision of direct Federal funding to Indian tribes for programs \notherwise under consideration for consolidation into Federal block \ngrants. I will promote direct funding for tribal governments through \ntribal block grants. To do otherwise would be inconsistent with the \nFederal Government's legal and fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. \nDirect Federal grants to tribes, bypassing the State governments, is \nconsistent with the government-to-government relationship between the \nIndian tribes and the Federal Government.\n  At present, in most Federal welfare programs, more often than not, \nState governments use Indian population figures to justify higher \nlevels of Federal funding. But no matter how much Federal money a State \ngets, tribal members continue to experience inequity in the quality and \nquantity of services available under State administered programs. What \nis most shocking is the fact that, despite the piles upon piles of \nexisting Federal regulations requiring State government accountability \nin operating welfare programs, there are literally no requirements to \nensure that tribal populations receive an equitable share of these \nFederal funds. The only excuse given by State government administrators \nfor this inequity is that administering programs for tribal populations \nis problematic and more costly because of the remoteness of many tribal \ncommunities. If this is indeed the case, States should embrace, not \noppose, a new approach that vests in tribal governments the Federal \nfunds and flexible authorities necessary to carry out these \nresponsibilities.\n  I know that there are some tribal and State governments which have \nestablished cooperative working relationships under the present \nFederal-State arrangement despite the legal and structural impediments \nto such relationships. There are also many tribal governments which are \neither too small or unable to administer specific federally funded \nprograms. Many of these tribes have to\n rely on State governments to administer these programs for their \ntribal members. In these instances, Indian tribal governments should \nhave the opportunity to use the Federal funding to contract with a \nState government to administer programs for tribal members.\n\n  Many tribal governments have the ability to administer these and many \nother federally funded programs. Many are eager to do so. As with State \ngovernments, excessive Federal regulations have hindered tribal \ngovernments in their efforts to administer these programs to serve \ntheir communities. For this reason, in the current legislative efforts \nto reform welfare and other social service programs, tribal governments \nseek changes that will provide direct Federal funding to them along \nwith reductions in regulatory burdens so that administrative costs are \ndiminished and tribal innovation and flexible authority is increased.\n  Indian tribal members have long received direct services from a \nvariety of State administered programs. More than 1.1 percent of all \nIndian people have received State-administered Aid to Families With \nDependent Children [AFDC]. The Head Start Program has had a successful \ntrack record of serving Indian children and families living in \nproverty. The Job Opportunity Basic Skills [JOBS] and Job Training \nPartnership Act [JTPA] programs have helped to improve the lives of \nthousands of Indians by providing training and employment opportunities \nboth on and off reservation communities. Therefore, I believe it is \nimperative that the Congress outline a clear role for tribal \ngovernments in the block grant and welfare reform debates. Consider, \nfor a moment, the certain result of failure if we do not include tribal \ngovernments as part of the solution.\n  Mr. President, under the Constitution, Congress has plenary power to \nprescribe the Nation's Indian policy. Over the past 2 centuries \nCongress has poorly exercised that power, developing inconsistent or \ncontradictory policies which over time have wasted or misdirected \nmillions upon millions of scarce Federal dollars. More importantly, the \nperiodic contortions in Federal Indian policy have had grave \nconsequences for American Indian people.\n  I believe Congress has finally begun to make significant strides in \nimproving its dealings with the Indian tribes. Last year, by passing \nthe Indian Self-Determination Act amendments and making the Tribal \nSelf-Governance Demonstration project permanent, Congress clearly set a \nnew course. This new direction offers two key principles that should \nlikewise guide all welfare reform and block grant efforts: (1) Provide \ndirect Federal funding to tribes, in recognition of the government-to-\ngovernment relationship; and (2) affirm the right of tribes to choose \nto administer their own programs or to use their funds to contract with \nStates to administer programs according to tribal design.\n  I am convinced that these principles must be the cornerstone of a \nviable and fiscally sound Federal policy that will prove to be \nbeneficial to individual Indians and Alaska Natives who have been so \ncritically underserved by Federal-State arrangements. I firmly believe \nthat this policy is wholly consistent with the goal of shifting funds, \npower, responsibility, and accountability for such programs to local \ngovernments, like Indian tribes, which are closest to the people to be \nserved. In addition, I am sure that many tribal leaders will agree with \nme that all programs currently claiming to serve Indian people should \nbe scrutinized to find ways to cut administrative waste and enhance \nlocal tribal government control and flexible tribal administration.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must remind those who spread fear that the \nconditions of Native Americans and their tribal governments will \ngreatly suffer under a Republican-controlled Congress: Indian issues \nare neither Republican nor Democratic. They are unique, human issues \nwhich call for understanding and cooperation on both sides of the \naisle. I believe it both wrong-minded and counterproductive to suggest \nthat the new majority party intends to place Native American tribes in \nsome new or greater peril. The far more constructive approach would be \nto work, in a nonpartisan manner, to adapt the new directions being \ndiscussed in the Congress to the unique needs and arrangements that \nhave characterized the best Federal-Indian relations, and that uphold \nthe unique moral and constitutional relationship we have with Indian \ntribes--that of direct, government-to-government dealings between each \ntribe and the United States.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3683-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3684-S3685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday marked the celebration of the \nfifth annual National Sportsmanship Day. Designed to promote ethics, \nfair play, and good sportsmanship in athletics, as well as in society \nas a whole, National Sportsmanship Day was initiated by the Institute \nfor International Sport at the University of Rhode Island.\n  The Institute for International Sport gained national attention in \n1993 as the sponsor for the highly successful World Scholar-Athlete \nGames. More than 1,500 student-athletes from 108 countries participated \nin athletic and scholastic competitions. This year, the institute will \nsponsor the Rhode Island Scholar-Athlete Games, which will serve as a \nmodel for similar events in all 50 States.\n  Schools and colleges from across the United States are encouraged to \nparticipate in National Sportsmanship Day. This year, 5,000 schools \nrepresenting all 50 States and 48 countries are expected to participate \nin the celebration. The programs to celebrate National Sportsmanship \nDay include discussions, debates, and essay writing and are based on \nmaterial that the institute provides.\n  The information provided to participants by the institute also \noutlines the Student-Athlete Outreach Program, which encourages high \nschools and colleges to send talented student-athletes to local \nelementary and middle schools as positive role models. The institute \nalso selects individuals to serve as Ethics Fellows. This year's Ethics \nFellows include a Rhode Islander, Claire Ferguson, who is best known as \nPresident of the U.S. Figure Skating Association. \n[[Page S3685]] All of this is done in an effort to highlight the \nqualities that comprise sportsmanship--honesty, integrity, and \nhumility.\n  National Sportsmanship Day is recognized by the President's Council \non Physical Fitness and Sports. Florence Griffith Joyner and Tom \nMcMillen, co-chairs of the President's Council, pointed out the \n``valuable life skills and lessons that are learned by youth and adults \nthrough participation in sports.'' I ask that the full text of the \nletter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I am delighted that National Sportsmanship Day was created in Rhode \nIsland and I applaud all of those who participated in this inspiring \nevent from the students and teachers, to the Ethics Fellows and the \nparticipants in the Outreach Program. Finally, I would like to \ncongratulate all of those at the Institute for International Sport at \nthe university of Rhode Island who have made this program a success for \nthe past 5 years.\n  The letter follows:\n                                           The President's Council\n\n\n                               on Physical Fitness and Sports,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1994.\n     Mr. Todd Seidel,\n     Director of National Sportsmanship Day, Institute for \n         International Sport, University of Rhode Island, \n         Kingston, RI.\n       Dear Mr. Seidel: The President's Council on Physical \n     Fitness and Sports is pleased to recognize March 7, 1995, as \n     National Sportsmanship Day.

We will adjourn or recess following that \nstatement.\n  For the information of my colleagues, we will complete action on the \nsupplemental bill tomorrow; therefore, Senators should be aware \nrollcall votes are expected throughout tomorrow's session, probably \ninto the evening, and I ask that following the statement by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, the Senate \nstand in recess under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, President Clinton is right to use his \nexecutive authority to side with American workers and defend their \nbasic right to strike. An insidious business practice has grown up in \nrecent years like mushrooms in the dark under which employers hire \npermanent replacements for striking workers. That practice is unfair \nand ought to be prohibited, and that is what the President's Executive \norder does. It restores the fair balance in labor-management relations \nand ends the unfair tilt against working families.\n  I urge the Senate to defeat the Kassebaum amendment, to support the \nPresident and reject the unseemly business and Republican right wing \npressure to nullify his order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I have up to 5 minutes to \nspeak before we adjourn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let me rise in this Chamber to echo the words of the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I believe the action taken by the President is an extremely important \nmessage. It is an important message that has a great deal to do with \nfairness and restoring some balance of power between those who work for \nwages and management. I do not think we are really going to be able to \nbuild the kind of successful economy we need for ourselves, for our \nchildren, and for our grandchildren unless we have high morale, high \nlevels of productivity, and a really good working relationship between \nlabor and management.\n  I have seen over the past decade-plus so many strikes defeated, so \nmany unions busted, so many broken lives, so many broken families, and \nso many broken dreams, and the right to strike has now become the right \nto be fired, and so much of what many of us or many of our parents or \nmany of our grandparents fought for, which was basic collective \nbargaining rights, some kind of fairness in the workplace, some kind of \nsupport for working people is, I think, really very much in peril.\n  So, Madam President, I just want to make it clear as we discuss this \namendment tomorrow I will be in the Chamber, I will be in the Chamber \nwith documents, I will be in the Chamber with \n[[Page S3686]] a very full analysis, and I will make every effort \npossible as a Senator to make this debate real in terms of what it \nmeans in personal terms for working people, whether they be in unions \nor whether they not be in unions. So I look forward to a very spirited \nand a lively and very important and I think a very long debate.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I look forward to the debate tomorrow. \nI applaud the action, as I mentioned earlier, the President has taken. \nWe will have an opportunity to debate both the authority and the \nreasons for that.\n  Quite clearly, the President has the responsibility to make sure, in \nterms of implementing the various contracting responsibilities in which \nthe Federal Government is involved, that there is going to be a good \nproduct received in a timely way which meets the various quality \nstandards. He has a responsibility to do so. He has made the judgment \nthat this action is called for.\n  I was not here earlier tonight at the time those who opposed this \naction were saying that we ought to have a legislative solution. Last \nyear I was on the floor of the Senate, with, I believe, my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Minnesota, when we attempted to take that \naction, and it was effectively filibustered by those who refused to let \nthe majority of the Members of this body take that action in a \nbipartisan way. The House of Representatives had taken that action in \nan overwhelming way. So we were denied the opportunity to take action \nby the Congress to address this in a legislative way.\n  The President has responded in a responsible way, and we will have an \nopportunity to look over the recent history as we debate this issue--\nthe actions that were taken by the President, President Bush, and other \nPresidents who had used Executive orders to diminish the legitimate \nrights of workers in this country at a time when legislative proposals \nwere before this body.\n  But it is important that we understand what is at risk for tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of working families. I do not know \nwhat it is about the Republicans. They have it in for working families, \nfor the most part families that are making $25,000, $26,000 a year, \ntrying to pay a mortgage, trying to educate their children, trying to \nmake sure that their parents are going to live constructive and \nproductive and hopeful lives. I do not know what it is that the \nRepublican leadership and the Republican Party has against those \nAmericans who are the backbone of this country.\n  We already heard the efforts in our committee, the Labor and Human \nResources Committee. We have seen the actions taken by the House to \neffectively emasculate the Davis-Bacon Act. The average construction \nworker is making $27,000 a year--$27,000 a year. What is it about \nworking families that the Republicans have to try to diminish the wages \nand the working conditions and the rights of working families? We have \nseen that. And we will see and have the opportunity to debate that \nissue on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Here we have another example about the attitude of Republicans \ntowards working families. It is very interesting. You talk about trying \nto do something about health care for working families--``No, we cannot \ndo that. We cannot possibly address it, to make sure that working \nfamilies are going to be able to have health insurance.''\n  We want to do something about minimum wage--``Oh, no, we cannot pass \nthat. We cannot have an increase in the minimum wage. We cannot bring \nthe minimum wage up to try to make it a livable wage. We cannot do \nthat, even though we have record profits in this country and even \nthough the minimum wage has decreased in terms of its purchasing power \nto what it was the last time we increased the minimum wage and with \nRepublican--with bipartisan support. No, we cannot have an increase in \nthe minimum wage.''\n  We have to do something about those families whose kids are going on \nto college. We have to assist those two-thirds of the young people in \nmy State, 67 percent of whom require student loans, to be able to \nafford a college education. But the Republicans say, ``No, we are going \nto make them pay increased interest rates while they are going to \nschool and college. The indebtedness of those sons and daughters of \nworking families is not high enough. We are going to make them pay \nmore.''\n  And now we find when it comes to an economic issue for working \nfamilies we have them in the bullseye again. When you just look across \nthe spectrum: No on the minimum wage, retreat in terms of Davis-Bacon, \nto try to make sure workers rights are going to be preserved so we are \ngoing to get quality product--that is basically the issue. As John \nDunlop has pointed out, the issue is not the wages, it is performance. \nYou can pay less wages and get a lousy product and the taxpayer will be \nleft holding the bag.\n  So we have ``no'' on the minimum wage, ``no'' in terms of trying to \ndo something to protect the construction workers and give the assurance \nto the taxpayers on their interests, ``no'' in terms of looking out \nafter the legitimate rights of working families who are trying to \nparticipate in this dramatic expansion of the profits that we have seen \nin the period of the last 4 or 5 years for the major companies and \ncorporations. The workers are not getting any participation in it. For \nthe first time, basically, in the history of the industrial revolution \nin the United States, workers are not participating.\n  All they are trying to do is, not demand, but what they want to do is \nto be able to represent their views, economic views, in a collective \nbargaining context which is as old as the industrial policy of this \ncountry. We find the first time the President stands up on that to try \nto protect it, the ink is not even dry and our Republican friends are \ndeclaring all-out war on these working families.\n  Sometimes we have to say ``no.'' I look forward to the debate and \ndiscussion when we will get into greater detail, not only on these \nmeasures but on the particular Executive order. On tomorrow we will \nhave a chance to debate this issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator, my colleague from Massachusetts, \nagree that actually tomorrow will be a very important day for the \nSenate and for the country, because we really will have a full \nopportunity to talk about the concerns and circumstances of working \nfamilies? That this really will be an opportunity to talk about wages, \nto talk about jobs, talk about opportunities--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Talk about children.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. To talk about children, that is correct. To really \ntalk about what is being attempted right now in the House of \nRepresentatives, and over here in the Senate, and to try to take all of \nthis discussion about strategy--I really respect the way the Senator \nput it just a moment ago--all this talk of strategy and which buttons \nto push, to put it in personal terms: families, people's lives, \nopportunities.\n  I think tomorrow will be a day--I ask the Senator--where we will take \nthe opportunity to really spell out in great detail what the meaning of \nall this is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree with the Senator. We just got notice of the \nintroduction of this amendment a short while ago. We will have a full \nopportunity to debate it tomorrow. I was prepared to debate it this \nevening or tomorrow or the day after or whatever it takes. The Senator \nis one of our leaders in terms of what has been happening to children, \nto children's rights and children's interests, what has been happening \nto hungry children. These are the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies. All of this is coming into a sharper perspective. And all of \nthese are basically related to the economic rights of working families.\n  They are not able to pursue those economic rights which have been \nbasic and fundamental rights in our society, and which have been the \nbackbone of our strength and vitality--the fact that men and women were \nable to pursue their economic dreams, as well as the success of the \nprivate sector, in a way which both of the parties were able to grow \nand to prosper. And to see that kind of effort to diminish that, and to \nalso see, Madam President, the efforts that have been made in the \nrecent days on changing Taft-Hartley, \n[[Page S3687]] and that 8(a)2 provision, to try to repeal the existing \nability for the trade union movement to organize workers, to have that \nwhole concept threatened with company-controlled unions, as I fear \nwould be the case with the 8(a)2 recommendations--this is all part of \nan effort.\n  We are only into this year some 2\\1/2\\ months. Take how we are going \nto change the whole Taft-Hartley law and the 8(a)2, take the action \nthis evening on the President's Executive order to protect workers \nrights, take the opposition to the minimum wage--the whole series. We \nwill have a chance to debate this, hopefully, in an informed, balanced \nway tomorrow and to really point out what is at risk with this \nparticular amendment from my friend and colleague.\n  I urge my colleagues this evening to think deeply about this \namendment. It is a matter of enormous importance and I think it will \ntell a great deal about this Senate and also about where we as a \ncountry are really going in these next few years.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield for one final question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator agree with me that some of the issues \nthat he just highlighted tonight have a great deal to do with 60 years \nof history, and to an extent this agenda we see right now is an attempt \nto really turn the clock back in a way people of the United States of \nAmerica, when they see it, will just not support? It is beyond the \ngoodness of people. It is beyond what people are about in our country.\n  Will the Senator agree that this really calls for, tomorrow, a full \ndebate? This really calls for a day of real debate on this question? So \nit will be our hope that Senators will be out here and we will have a \nchance to go through these issues in great depth.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. I will look forward \nto that opportunity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I look forward to that.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/08/senate-section/article/S3685-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
