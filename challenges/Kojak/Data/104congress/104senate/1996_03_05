Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\nprivileges be granted to the following staff members from the House \nCommittee on International Relations, Mr. Roger Noriega and Mr. Stephen \nRademaker, during the pendency of the conference report on H.R. 927 and \nfor the rollcall votes thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are beginning deliberation on the \nCuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, H.R. 927. There has been \nmuch said about this piece of legislation. It has been controversial \nfrom the beginning.\n  I believe it is important that we put this legislation in context. \nThis legislation, Mr. President, is directed at a dictator and regime \nthat has engaged in the violation of human rights of their own people \nand others, murder, terrorism, exportation of revolution, and has been \nan open adversary of the United States of America and her people.\n  To put it in context, there have been decades of pursuit of the \nobjectives I just referred to. In 1959, Cuba aided armed expeditions \nagainst Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. During the 1960's, \nCuba backed attempts to develop guerrilla insurgencies in Guatemala, \nColombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia. In the 1970's and the 1980's, \nCuba had 50,000 troops in Angola; in Ethiopia, 24,000; and in Nicaragua \n1,500.\n  By the end of 1960, the Cuban Government, under Fidel Castro, had \nexpropriated all--all--private United States property in Cuba.\n  We all remember--or should remember--the confrontation between the \nUnited States and Cuba and the Soviet Union as they attempted to put \nhostile missiles on Cuban soil, directed at the United States. In July \n1964 the Organization of American States voted to suspend diplomatic \nand trade relations with Cuba because of Cuban support for subversive \nactivities in Venezuela.\n  In the 1980's, from April through September of 1980, 125,000 Cubans \nfled Cuba in the so-called Mariel boatlift. In February 1982 the \nSecretary of State added Cuba to the list of countries supporting \ninternational terrorists for its complicity with the M-19 movement in \nColombia.\n  On April 29, 1994, Cuban border guards rammed and sank a private \nvessel, the Olympia, which had fled Cuba and was 25 nautical miles off \nits shores; 3 of the 21 Cubans aboard drowned, including two 6-year-old \nchildren.\n  On July 13, 1994, approximately 40 Cubans, many of whom were \nchildren, drowned when the tugboat Trece de Marzo, stolen by a group of \nCubans attempting to flee Cuba, sank after being rammed by Cuban border \nguard vessels and flooded with fire hoses into the hold, sweeping the \ninnocent citizens off the deck.\n  On December 22, 1995, the U.N. General Assembly approved a \nresolution, again calling on Cuba to cooperate fully with the U.N. \nSpecial Rapporteur, regretting profoundly the numerous violations of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba.\n  Beginning on February 15, 1996, the Cuban Government began a \ncrackdown on members of the Concilio Cubano, an umbrella group of more \nthan 100 dissident organizations that had applied for permission to \nhold a national meeting on February 24, 1996.\n  And then, Mr. President, on February 24, Cuban MiG-29 fighter jets \nshot down two United States private airplanes, Cessna 336's, in the \nFlorida straits, flown by members of the Cuban-American group, Brothers \nto the Rescue.\n  Mr. President, I might add that both aircraft were destroyed, \nunarmed, in international waters, 4 and 6 miles beyond Cuban airspace.\n  This incident has caused considerable outrage and has caused the \nadministration to alter its policy of befriending the Castro \ngovernment; and they have now come together with the authors of this \nresolution, Senator Helms of North Carolina and Representative Burton \nof Indiana, in an agreement to finally pass the Libertad Act and direct \nour hostility toward the Cuban Government.\n  But the point is that this is not an isolated incident. This is but \none of hundreds of incidents and infractions of common and civil and \nappropriate behavior on the part of the Cuban Government, which it \ncontinues to fail to practice.\n  Let us look at a summary of the Libertad Act. Title I: Strengthening \ninternational sanctions against the Castro government.\n  It urges the President to seek in the U.N. Security Council an \ninternational embargo against the Castro dictatorship.\n  It authorizes the President to furnish assistance to support the \ndemocratic opposition and human rights groups in Cuba.\n  It instructs the United States executive directors to international \nfinancial institutions to oppose Cuban membership until the President \ndetermines that a democratically elected government is in power in \nCuba.\n  It codifies--this is very important--it codifies the existing embargo \non Cuba, making it law unless a transition government is in place.\n  Title II: Assistance to a free and independent Cuba, instructs the \nPresident to develop a plan for providing support to the Cuban people \nduring the transition to a democratically elected government; and it \nauthorizes the President to suspend the embargo, once a transition \ngovernment is in place, and to terminate the embargo once a democratic \ngovernment is in power in Cuba.\n  Title III: Protection of property rights of United States nationals. \nIt establishes, as of August 1, 1996, a private right of action by \nwhich U.S. citizens can protect their interest in property \nconfiscated--stolen--by the Castro government. The President has the \nauthority to delay the effective date on a 6-month basis if he \ndetermines that such an act of delay is ``necessary to the national \ninterest of the United States and will expedite the transition to a \ndemocratic government in Cuba.''\n  Title IV: Exclusion of certain aliens. It denies visas to aliens who \nconfiscate, convert or traffic or benefit from property confiscated \nfrom United States nationals by the Cuban Government.\n  Mr. President, opponents of this legislation will contend that it \nwill disrupt trade with our European and other allies and claim that \nthe bill violates our international trade agreements. Although a number \nof our allies have expressed displeasure with this measure, the right-\nof-action provision will provide a measure of protection for all \ninternational investors by making it clear that trafficking in stolen \nproperty will not be tolerated.\n  We will be asked, ``Why limit the property rights debate encompassed \nin this bill to Cuban-Americans? Why not expand it to Americans from \nPoland or China or Vietnam or other nations of Eastern Europe?''\n  In fact, the United States has reached settlements of confiscated \nAmerican property claims with Albania, Vietnam, the People's Republic \nof China and most of the States of Central and Eastern Europe, \nincluding the former German Democratic Republic --East Germany--\nBulgaria, Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.\n  Castro, conversely, has shown no serious interest in the settling of \nproperty claims--neither of American citizens at the time of the \nseizures in the early 1960's, nor for the thousands of Cuban citizens \nwho had property stolen by the regime since then. The only remedy the \nLibertad bill allows is for American citizens who meet the \njurisdictional requirements to have their day in court to deter the \ncontinuing wrong of Castro's exploitation of property.\n  Opponents will say that the bill will result in an explosion of \nclaims in the United States court system; but the primary intent of the \nright of action is as a deterrent to would-be investors in Cuba. Few \nactions are expected to be brought under this conference report because \nboth parties must be sufficiently present in the United States to \nsustain jurisdiction in our courts. The Congressional Budget Office, in \nits estimate of the House bill, stated that they expect that only a few \ncases would actually go to trial.\n  Further, in the process of arriving at this conference agreement, \nthere is a cap. The cases must involve property valued at $50,000 or \nmore. We have concluded that there are only about 700 claims, \nprincipally commercial interests, that would therefore come under the \nact.\n  Mr. President, the Libertad conference report, as I said, provides a \nway for American citizens whose property was stolen by Fidel Castro to \nprotect\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\ntheir claim or receive compensation from those who knowingly and \nintentionally exploit that property and are in the United States under \nthe jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\n  Castro is running a fire sale in stolen properties. Since his loss of \n$5 to $6 billion in annual Soviet subsidies, Castro is looking to \ncapitalize on the sale of stolen property. He has gotten into the \nbusiness of joint ventures with stolen property.\n  Imagine if you were in an airport in Canada or Europe and picked up a \nbrochure actually advertising these properties to the highest bidder? \nThe Castro regime offers the sale of the Hermanos Diaz Refinery in \nSantiago, Cuba. Its rightful owner, however, Mr. President, is Texaco.\n  ``Item 119'' for sale is the Manuel M. Prieto sugar mill; its \nrightful owner is a naturalized U.S. citizen whom Castro has never been \nforced to compensate for the claim.\n  This is why title III is needed. It puts would-be investors--those \nwho would be accomplices to a dictator and his property theft--on \nnotice that, if they enrich themselves with stolen property, they will \nbe held liable to the legitimate U.S. owners.\n  For some reason, the opponents of the pending bill have expressed \noutrage that American citizens would be given a means of defending \ntheir property in the United States. This bill violates no treaty or \ninternational convention. It does not violate customary international \nlaw, which recognizes that a nation's domestic courts may reach actions \nabroad when those actions directly affect that nation. There is no \ndoubt that Castro's illegal confiscations and the exploitation of those \nproperties has a direct effect on American citizens.\n  Mr. President, there is an old cliche that the truth is often \nstranger than fiction. I think that is the case here.\n  The United States has more effective mechanisms to protect fish and \nmarine life than it has to protect Americans who have property stolen. \nWe have statutes on the books to protect dolphins from tuna fishermen \neven when those provisions violate trade agreements. Other nations are \nrequired by U.S. law to protect sea turtles in order to continue having \naccess to U.S. markets. Yet opponents of the Libertad bill object to \nprotecting the legitimate interests of U.S. citizens.\n  Mr. President, property rights are the core of investments and \ncommerce historically and forever.\n  I was recently in Nicaragua and had discussions with the Chamarro \ngovernment, which was struggling to deal with property rights following \nthe fall of the Sandinistas. Until they got that straight, there would \nbe no investment.\n  There will never be a rebuilt Cuba without property adjudication--\nnever.\n  Mr. President, this legislation moves to the center of the debate the \nissue of property rights and international treatment of property \nrights. I believe it is benchmark legislation. I believe it is \nlegislation that can initiate positive new developments; that the scope \nand the breadth of it, as it moves the issue of property rights \nforward, will not only serve the citizens of the United States but the \ninternational community in general as we globally deal with the issue \nof property rights and the victims of property thefts. This is a \nsingular case that demands our attention as it relates to Fidel Castro, \nhis dictatorship, and the brutality of his regime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from \nTexas for a period of up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can we make that 10?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Can we use 5 minutes and come back?\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, 50 years ago today Winston Churchill came \nto America to a tiny college in the middle of the Midwest--to \nWestminster College--and gave a speech that awakened America and the \nworld to a crisis. We all know that speech. We all remember it from our \nchildhood, or reading about it in history books. He talked about the \ndescending of an iron curtain across the face of Europe. And, while the \ncold war was already underway, that speech probably more than anything \nelse awakened America and the world to the Soviet threat.\n  We started to respond with the policy of containment. We responded by \nbuilding up NATO and SEATO. We responded by fighting in Korea and \nVietnam. We responded with the Marshall plan and the Truman plan to \nexpand trade and work toward free trade. Our policies won the cold war, \ntore down the Berlin Wall, liberated Eastern Europe, and transformed \nthe Soviet Union. We won one of the greatest victories in the history \nof mankind.\n  But there still is important unfinished business from the cold war. \nCommunist China is in transition, and so is Vietnam. But there are two \nCommunist regimes on this planet that are totally unchanged, that still \nbelieve in Marxism and Leninism, that still are committed to everything \nthat we oppose in the world. One of those regimes is the military \ndictatorship in North Korea. The other is Fidel Castro's Cuba.\n  For 3 years, Bill Clinton has coddled both of those regimes. We have \na policy in place today to give, through an international consortium, \n$4 billion to North Korea to build for them two nuclear powerplants \neven though there is no evidence whatsoever that either of the existing \nnuclear powerplants in North Korea was ever used to generate a watt of \nelectricity or ever had any purpose other than building nuclear \nweapons. We are today supplying oil through that consortium to North \nKorea and propping up a Communist regime.\n  President Clinton for 3 years has coddled Fidel Castro. He announced \na policy last year that enforced the imprisonment of the Cuban people--\nthat actually used the United States Navy to enforce the imprisonment \nof the Cuban people. The United States Navy was given the assignment by \nthe President of the United States to pick up people who risk their \nlives to flee Communist oppression from Cuba, put them in American \nnaval vessels, and then turn those people back over to Fidel Castro. \nThe President set out a policy that opened the door for nongovernment \norganizations to establish a presence in Cuba and in the process \nstarted what Fidel Castro believed, and the world believed, was a \nmovement toward normalization. Voices were raised in Congress in \nopposition to the President's policy. Both the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia and I spoke out against it, as did many others.\n  We now see the fruit of that policy, and the fruit of that policy is \nthat Fidel Castro brutally murdered four Americans. We have the tapes \nof the communications from the MiG's as they talked to their home base, \nidentifying civilian planes with no armament. We have the tapes of \nthose conversations when they then boasted how they were going to \ndestroy these planes. On an order from their home base, they fired the \nmissiles that killed four American citizens.\n  We are now considering a bill to change our relationship with \nCastro's Cuba and bring it back to what it has always been; that is, a \npolicy of strong opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our position expressed with this bill goes \nback to what our position has been with regard to Fidel Castro since \nthe early days of that brutal regime. Our position is founded on the \nrecognition that Fidel Castro is a brutal dictator and murderer and \nthat his regime in Cuba must end.\n  Our position under Democrat and Republican administrations has always \nbeen--until the Clinton administration--a commitment to the isolation \nof Castro's Cuba, and a commitment to seeing the overthrow of Fidel \nCastro and his accomplices.\n  Today with this bill, we restore that policy and we hit Fidel Castro \nwhere it hurts the most. We hit him in the pocketbook. We allow \nAmericans to sue those who buy their property stolen by Castro, to sue \nthose who are trafficking in stolen goods. With this bill we allow \nAmericans to sue international interests in American courts to recover \ndamages. The effective result of that will be that private investors \nwill think two and three times before they bring their investment money \nto Castro's Cuba.\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, that there is more that we can do. I \nthink the President ought to act unilaterally to deny Americans the \nability to send money to Castro's Cuba.\n  While it is true that allowing people to send money to their \nrelatives provides some temporary assistance to them, some relief to \nthem, those funds, that hard currency also props up Castro's Cuba, \nallowing Castro to continue his imprisonment of the people. It prolongs \ntheir misery, and in my opinion that should be ended.\n  I believe that we should demand that Cuba turn over the two pilots \nwho fired the missiles, turn over the air traffic controller who gave \nthe order to fire, and turn over anyone in the chain of command who was \nengaged in giving the orders or carrying those orders that killed four \nAmericans. As we did in Iraq, as we have done in Bosnia, I think we \nneed to declare a no-fly zone over Cuba for military aircraft until \nthose people are turned over, and I think we ought to enforce that no-\nfly zone.\n  I believe we need to recommit ourselves to the principle that Fidel \nCastro and his regime will not survive the end of the 20th century. \nWhat a terrible tragedy it would be if this tidal wave of freedom which \nhas covered the planet is allowed to subside before it drowns Fidel \nCastro. I think we have in these brutal murders a new example to remind \nus again of who Fidel Castro is and what he stands for, and I believe \nwe should dedicate ourselves to the principle that the 20th century \nwill not end and find the Castro dictatorship intact in Cuba.\n  This bill is a step forward. I urge the President to take other \nactions, such as to cut off cash transfers to Cuba by American \ncitizens, to demand that the pilots and the air traffic controllers who \nwere responsible for the death of four Americans be turned over, along \nwith anyone in the chain of command who gave or carried out those \norders. I think we ought to enforce that with a no-fly zone.\n  I congratulate our colleagues from Georgia and North Carolina for \ntheir leadership on this bill. This is long overdue. We should have \nmade this bill the law of the land last year. I remind my colleagues \nand the American people that up until the last few days President \nClinton fought this bill and threatened to veto this bill. He thought \nhis policy of coddling Fidel Castro was working. He thought a movement \ntoward normalization of relations with Castro's Cuba could be \nsuccessful. We now know what the fruits of that policy were: death for \nfour Americans. I say enough is enough. Let us restore freedom and \ndemocracy to Cuba. Let us do it in this century. Starting with this \nbill let us get serious.\n  I thank our colleague for yielding to me.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from New Mexico 3 \nminutes to speak in support of the conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to support the conference report \nof H.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. I commend \nSenator Helms and Congressman Burton for their foresight and fortitude \nin tackling the Castro regime.\n  On Saturday, February 24, two Cuban MiG fighter jets shot down two \ncivilian, unarmed Cessna aircraft off the coast of Cuba. The Cuban \npilots gave the Cessnas no warning. These planes were operated by \nBrothers to the Rescue, a group based in Miami whose mission is to look \nfor Cuban refugees floating toward the United States.\n  The Havana government has failed to provide proof that the Cessnas \nwere in Cuban airspace, but never mind that. No country has the right \nto shoot down civilian planes. Cuba even adopted the 1983 international \nrules stating that there is never a justification for such actions.\n  These planes posed no threat to Cuba's security. They were unarmed on \na nonviolent humanitarian mission, and the Cuban Government knew it. To \nrespond with deadly force is a shamelessly cruel act. This is cold-\nblooded murder and shows Fidel Castro's total disregard for human life \nas an alleged attempt to enforce Cuban sovereignty.\n  My deepest sympathy goes out to the families and friends of the four \npilots killed.\n  Mr. President, some politicians and businessmen were encouraged over \nthis past year, encouraged that Castro and Cuba were reforming and open \nto a warmer United States relationship. But we should not have been \nsurprised by Cuba's latest crime against the United States. Castro is a \nruthless dictator and we must stop underestimating him.\n  No matter how open the Cuban economy becomes, Castro never will \nchange. A dictator who enforces doctrines through the secret police, \nfiring squads, taking political prisoners, confiscating property, and \nlimiting the basic rights of Cuban citizens. Only a brutal and vicious \ndictator could justify the murder of these four unarmed pilots all to \ncounter the threat the Brothers to the Rescue makes on his cruel, \nauthoritarian government.\n  Our best chance to oust Fidel Castro from power is now. The Cuban \neconomy is in a crisis and Castro's totalitarian leadership has been \nthreatened. H.R. 927 is our chance to exert more pressure on Mr. \nCastro, on the Cuban economy, and on those aiding the Cuban economy by \ntrafficking in confiscated United States property.\n  Within 2 weeks of taking power in 1959, Castro issued his \nconstitutional amendment authorizing the confiscation of property. In \nthe following 2 years, Castro demolished private property rights by \nexpropriating all businesses in Cuba owned by United States citizens, \nnationalizing industries owned by United States companies, and \nconfiscating personal property of Cubans who left the country.\n  No compensation has been made in any U.S. claim in 37 years. Instead \nCastro has energetically promoted the exploitation of this stolen \nproperty by third-country joint ventures and foreign investment in \norder to sustain its faltering economy. These joint ventures have \nabounded, but to the benefit of Castro, not to the Cuban people whose \nlabor is exploited. The Cuban Government has used the exploitation of \nworking people and the absence of individual human rights as a lure to \nattract investors.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 927 because it would stop \nsuch deals and stop the resources Castro needs to restrain his ruthless \nand repressive regime.\n  Might I say to my friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, I listened to \npart of his remarks, and I commend him for them. I think the Senator \nwould share with me a concern about the very strange situation that in \nthe United States we are bragging about. The world is moving toward \ndemocracy and free enterprise and private property rights--we kind of \ncall it Pax Americana. Everybody is moving in that direction, and \neverybody is saying we are going to have a better life for billions of \npeople than we ever thought we would have had 10 years ago when the \npotential for Communist dictatorships was very prevalent throughout the \nworld. Is it not strange that right off our coastline sits a Communist \ndictator who is still in power, still in office while his people \nsuffer, while his economy deteriorates, while people have no chance \nthere of freedom and individual opportunity and individual rights?\n  I am sorry that it takes this kind of incident for the U.S. \nGovernment to become serious about doing everything in its power to \nerase that dictatorship from the face of the Earth.\n  This bill will push in that direction, but obviously this country \nalso requires sustained leadership at the top levels of our Government. \nLeadership that will not bend its ideas to any concept that Castro is \ngoing to reform, and that things are going to work out in some normal \nway. We have to lend ourselves in legitimate ways to getting rid of \nthis dictator and letting those people be free.\n  Can you imagine what is going to happen to that country when they are \nfree and when enterprise is alive again? Just go to Florida and see \nwhat those people who have escaped this yoke are doing. Cubans will do \nthe same in their country once they are free, but for now they cannot.\n  Today, Cubans are prisoners in their own country.\n  Again, I compliment the committee for what they have done in this \nbill and urge that the President sign it. I think that is what the \nSenator is saying, and perhaps that is not even enough, but let us get \nstarted today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\nFlorida to speak in support of the conference report.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me this time.\n  I rise today in support of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act, H.R. 927. I am proud that I was an original cosponsor \nof this bill and to have worked in support of its passage.\n  I commend my colleagues, particularly Senator Helms and Congressmen \nBurton, Diaz-Balart, and Menendez, and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for \ntheir efforts.\n  This bill reflects the heartfelt desire of many Americans to see the \nend of the tyranny and decades-long repression Castro has inflicted on \nhis people. Make no mistake: The killing of the four Brothers to the \nRescue was not out of character for Fidel Castro. The Cuban \nGovernment's heinous conduct reminded the world of Fidel Castro's true \ncolors.\n  I might just say to those who take the opportunity to read about \nFidel Castro's history, you will find that those words I just mentioned \nabout not being out of character are quite accurate. The Cuban \nGovernment's heinous conduct, as I said a moment ago, reminded the \nworld of his true colors. The brutal murder of unarmed Brothers to the \nRescue occurred on a weekend when a prodemocracy and human rights group \nwas to conduct an organizational meeting before Castro stopped it. \nScores of Cubans affiliated with the group have been arrested, detained \nand harassed. In 1994, a tugboat with freedom-seeking Cubans was rammed \nby Cuban Government ships until it sank. Year after year, Cuba has had \none of the world's worst human rights records.\n  It is time for tough talk to give way to tough actions. Guided by the \nprinciple that freedom is the core of all human progress, the bill \ncontains provisions designed to isolate Fidel Castro, squeeze him from \npower and usher in an era of democracy and freedom.\n  In the best spirit of the American people, this legislation holds out \nthe prospect of United States aid to transition and democratic \ngovernments in Cuba.\n  America will be there as soon as we can but not a moment before the \nlong nightmare of the Castro regime is ended. So long as Fidel Castro \nis in power, United States hard currency, financing and other kinds of \nsupport will not go to the Cuban regime. We know that Castro uses the \nhard currency he gets from foreign investment to support the \ninstruments of power and repression, and that must stop.\n  President Clinton last week finally agreed so support the Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. His support for the bill is \nwelcome, if overdue. I am sorry it took the tragic murder of four \npilots to focus the administration's mind on this bill.\n  Castro's efforts to intimidate the United States through onslaughts \nof refugees and now through the brutal and calculated shooting down of \ncivilian humanitarian planes have come during Democratic \nadministrations when Cuban policy has been weakened. It was incumbent \nupon President Clinton to stop delaying the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity Act. Anything less would have been a travesty and \ndishonored the lives of the Brothers to the Rescue who lost their \nlives.\n  With the President's agreement and with his call to congressional \nDemocrats to support the legislation, America's long history of \nbipartisan opposition to tyranny in Cuba has been restored.\n  The bill that passed the House-Senate conference is even stronger \nthan the bill that first passed the House. It contains the extremely \nimportant provisions of title III which deny Castro the ability to \nprofit from illegally confiscated properties of Americans.\n  It also contains title IV's powerful provisions denying U.S. visas to \nindividuals who traffic in confiscated property.\n  Although the bill gives waiver authority to the President, President \nClinton will be hard pressed to find conditions that merit waiving the \ntitle III provisions.\n  It took tremendous pressure from the Congress to make the President \naccept title III. He will face the same pressure again should he \nattempt to delay the effect of title III's right to sue.\n  The bill also provides that all provisions of the United States \nembargo against Cuba will be codified in law, ensuring that the embargo \nwill be preserved until a democratic transition is underway in Cuba.\n  All existing Cuban embargo Executive orders and regulations will now \nbe signed into law. This is a major victory for the opponents of the \nCastro regime. No longer can President Clinton react unilaterally to a \nsupposed reform in Cuba and lift a sanction here or there. No longer \ncan administration wavering on the embargo threaten the historic policy \nof isolating the repressive Cuban regime.\n  When President Clinton announced measures in reaction to the shooting \ndown of American citizens, he said they were a first step, and they had \nbetter be. While Ambassador Albright's performance at the United \nNations was commendable, the administration must do more to convince \nour allies to impose an international embargo against Cuba and treat \nFidel Castro as an outcast. His record deserves nothing less.\n  The fight must be taken up in every capital around the world. I \nbelieve our allies would respond to a sincere and concerted effort to \nwin our cooperation in the embargo. Our Government must make the case \nthat foreign investment perpetuates a dictatorship bent on brutality \nand repression, and it must stop.\n  I thank the President's support of the Libertad bill. Now he must \ntake our Cuba policy to another level--to make it a priority with our \nallies to stop foreign investment in Cuba for the life of the Castro \nregime. I promise you, without that foreign investment, Castro's regime \nof repression cannot stand. It will be all that much sooner when the \nCuban people can create a new society of freedom, justice, democracy \nand the protection of basic human rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those who have \nexpressed their outrage about the Cuban Government's reckless and \ncalloused shooting down of two small, unarmed civilian aircraft flown \nby the exile humanitarian group, Brothers to the Rescue. These \nshootings, which took place on the 24th of February, are deplorable, \nand I endorse the President's efforts to console and aid the families \nof those who died in this tragedy.\n  But as heinous as this shooting was, it does not justify the passage \nof wrongheaded legislation. Everything that was wrong with the Helms-\nBurton legislation before the incident remains wrong today.\n  I am reminded of the words of former Chief Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes who, in a dissenting decision, stated as follows:\n\n       Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases \n     are called great, not by reason of their real importance in \n     shaping the law of the future, but because of some accident \n     of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the \n     feelings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests \n     exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what \n     previously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even \n     well settled principles of law will bend.\n\n  Mr. President, the shooting of these planes have created, in Justice \nHolmes' words ``overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and \ndistorts the judgment.'' We in the Senate are feeling that ``hydraulic \npressure'' to which Justice Holmes referred. Senator Helms and others \nwho have stated that the message of this bill is ``Farewell, Fidel,'' \nare ignoring the utter failure of 35 years of our embargo against Cuba.\n  Rather, the Helms-Burton legislation is now being adopted and \nembraced by both parties and, unfortunately, by the President in a bid \nto curry favor with the Cuban-American community. As I have argued \nbefore on this floor, the passage of this bill will harm rather than \nhelp American interests in Cuba. It will restrict this President and \nany future President's hand in conducting foreign policy with an \nimportant neighboring nation and in responding to events quickly when \nthe need arises. And it will codify in law an Executive order imposing \nan economic embargo on Cuba that has clearly failed.\n  Our Nation's foreign policy is rife with anachronisms, and I cannot \nsupport helping to reinforce and entrench in our foreign policy such an \noutmoded and regressive policy as is reflected in this bill.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\n  In October of last year, the President announced a plan that received \nmuch bipartisan praise. The President promised to more vigorously \nenforce laws against unlicensed travel to Cuba, but to broaden support \nfor cultural, intellectual and educational exchange in a way that the \npeople of Cuba could encounter more frequently and broadly the fruits \nof democracy at work in the United States.\n  The President stated that he would license non-Government \norganizations to operate in Cuba, to provide information and to provide \nemergency relief when needed, to provide the necessary infrastructure \nto help guide Cuba and its people toward democracy in the future.\n  The President also noted that Cuban-Americans with relatives still in \nCuba would be permitted to visit Cuba to tend to family crises and that \nthese one-time-per-year licenses to visit would not be stymied by the \ndelays and management problems that frustrate American citizens \nattempting to get to Cuba when a family emergency hits.\n  These steps were important ones and they did not strengthen Castro's \nhand. What these provisions did was to help bond the people of Cuba to \nthe people of the United States. For 35 years, we have tried to bring \nFidel Castro down with heavy-handed tactics. One would think that \nduring such a long period of time, we might have figured out that our \npolicy had completely failed. We need a new direction, and it must \ninvolve building bridges with the Cuban people.\n  The Helms-Burton legislation will only injure and alienate ordinary \nCubans, weaken Cuba's civil society, and retard Cuba's democratization. \nAnd the unprecedented effort to impose United States policies on other \ncountries will make it more difficult for the United States Government \nto cooperate with its allies in fashioning a joint approach towards \nCuba.\n  The problems with the bill before us are summed up well in an article \nthis week by Walter Russell Mead in the New Yorker. Let me just quote a \ncouple of sentences from that article. He says:\n\n       Now President Clinton has agreed to sign the so-called \n     Helms-Burton bill--a piece of legislation that will cement \n     the embargo into law and deprive the President of the option \n     of modulating it for diplomatic purposes. It will also permit \n     lawsuits in American courts against Canadian, Mexican, \n     European and other foreign companies whose Cuban investments \n     involve the use of expropriated property--a category broad \n     enough to include virtually every activity in Cuba. Moreover, \n     the officers of these companies will be ineligible for \n     American visas . . .\n       . . . Fidel Castro has survived the enmity of nine American \n     Presidents. In concert with his enemies in South Florida, he \n     retains a hypnotic ability to induce stupidity in Yankee \n     policymakers. That seems unlikely to change until the United \n     States Government gets around to taking control of its Cuba \n     policy away from a small, self-interested lobby group.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is an anachronism that ties America to a \npast from which it needs to move on. America is the only industrial \npower in the world maintaining an economic embargo against Cuba. It is \ntime we consider a new course. The shooting down of two civilian \naircraft was a great tragedy that we all should mourn, but as Chief \nJustice Holmes warned, we need to stand strong against the ``hydraulic \npressure'' of momentary events that evidently will cause this Congress \nto enact this very misguided law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nGeorgia and also the Senator from North Carolina for bringing forward \nthe Libertad Act, which is a very appropriate act in light of what has \nhappened recently in Cuba, but it is more appropriate in light of what \nhas happened in the last 37 years.\n  This is not an event of momentary instance, as was just referred to \nby the Senator from New Mexico, in my opinion. This is a problem that \nhas existed and confronted this country for 37 years, and we have \nfailed to take the aggressive action we should have to relieve the \nCuban people of the dictatorship which has oppressed them in the last \n37 years.\n  The least we can do as a nation is not aid and abet the activities of \nFidel Castro and his actions, which have been to oppress his people, by \ngiving him economic assistance and by giving him psychological support. \nThis bill makes it very clear that no longer shall we give Cuba \neconomic assistance in any way, indirectly or directly. We will no \nlonger allow our citizens, American citizens, to have their property \nexpropriated and mismanaged by this illegal and criminal government \nwhich now governs Cuba, but rather we will say clearly to the world \nthat you have to choose between a democracy of America and American \ncitizens whose rights are being abused, and in the instances of 2 weeks \nago actually being killed, at the hands of this dictatorship, or you \ncan choose the Government of Cuba operated by a dictator.\n  That is what this bill essentially says. It says to the world it is \ntime to choose up in this confrontation. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has had a schizophrenic, almost bumper-car approach to \nits foreign policy, but also on its policy to Cuba, it almost looks as \nif with Cuba they are looking through the eyes of the radical chic, the \n1960's view of the world, which still views Castro as some sort of \ncharacter of sympathy or character of international quality, whereas, \nin fact, he has proven himself over 37 years to be nothing more than a \npetty 2-cent dictator who has oppressed his people for his own personal \ngain.\n  Yet, this administration is not willing to face up to that, or has \nnot been until American citizens lives were lost. Now we are going to \ngive this administration and this country some teeth to come forward \nand say to Cuba, ``No longer will we tolerate your form of government \nand to support the Cuban people and especially Cuban Americans who have \nlost their property in that nation.''\n  So I want to commend again this bill, and I want to commend the \nauthors of this bill. I was one of the original coauthors of this bill. \nI strongly support its initiatives, and I congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and the Senator from Georgia for bringing it forward \ntoday. I hope we will pass it overwhelmingly, send it to the White \nHouse, and we will finally see a definitive course from the White House \nby their signing this piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I believe we all want to promote a peaceful \ntransition to democracy and economic liberalization in Cuba. Where we \nclearly differ is on how we get there.\n  Despite the recent tragic loss of life in the shootdown of two \nunarmed civilian aircraft by the Cuban Air Force, I continue to believe \nthat the Cuba legislation before us takes us further away from \nachieving the goal of democracy and economic reform on the island of \nCuba.\n  If anything, the conference agreement takes us even further down that \nwrong road than either the House- or Senate-passed versions of the bill \ndid.\n  It is naive, in my view, to think that this bill or any sanctions \nlegislation we might pass will succeed in forcing Castro to step aside \nwhen all similar actions in the past over many, many years have failed.\n  All we are likely to ensure is that the living conditions of the \nCuban people are made even worse, making a mass exodus from for Miami \nthe only attractive option. Taken to its most extreme, this bill could \neven provoke serious violence on the island.\n  In some ways, this legislation is even more problematic than earlier \nefforts to tighten the screws on Castro. I say this because its \nimplications go well beyond United States and Cuban relations. It now \nallows that our foreign allies and friends can be sued in American \ncourts for undertaking activities totally lawful in their own \ncountries. It mandates that the Secretary of State deny entry into the \nUnited States those foreign businessmen and women and their families. \nClearly, these measures can only alienate our allies and undermine \nAmerican global foreign policy objectives.\n  Thirty-five years of policies of United States isolation have failed \nto change Castro, or convince our allies of the wisdom of our policy. \nIs it not time to try something else? I think of the success we had in \nEastern Europe, when\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nfreedom, free thinking and democracy came over those countries as they \nopened. Is it not time to try a similar approach in Cuba, particularly \nwhen we think that it has now been 35 years that we have been trying \nthis approach and we have had absolutely no success?\n  We are just about where we were--a little worse off with our \nrelationship--35 years ago.\n  I continue to hold the view that contact and dialog between Havana \nand Washington is more likely to bring about democracy on the island of \nCuba, not isolation and impoverishment. Perhaps if we took that \napproach, our allies would be more likely to support our policy with \nrespect to Cuba, which virtually none of them do at this time.\n  The bill before us has gone through a number of changes since it was \nfirst introduced. However, no version to date resolves the fundamental \nproblem that I have with the direction it takes U.S. policy. It take us \nfurther down the road and leads to no where rather than reversing \ncourse, as we should have done years ago and can still do, and open up. \nWhen we have a free exchange of ideas in which we have free competition \nbetween democratic ideas and Communist ideas, democracy usually, one \ncan say always, wins out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I recognize this bill is going to pass, and \nI recognize the President is going to sign it. It is bad legislation. \nIt is an emotional reaction to a situation that, obviously, all \nAmericans are unhappy about. The action of Castro in shooting down \nthose planes is indefensible. I have to add, our policy toward Cuba has \nbeen the basic cause of the friction. If that policy had changed a long \ntime ago, those planes would not have been shot down.\n\n  I will take two examples--Cuba and China. Will anyone here suggest--\nand I do not for a moment defend the human rights policies of Fidel \nCastro--but does anyone here suggest that Cuba's human rights policy is \nworse than China's? Yet, what do we do? We say to China, ``We are going \nto give you the MFN status, the favorable treatment on trade.'' When \nChina growls, as the Presiding Officer knows, we quake.\n  I think it is a bad policy to have one policy like this on China and \nanother totally different policy on Castro, who is not a threat to \nanybody. How many nations in the world follow the policy that we do on \nCuba? None. Not even our good friend, Israel, who frequently, probably \nsometimes in embarrassment, votes with the United States. No nation \nfollows our policy on Cuba. It just does not make sense.\n  Stephen Chapman had an op-ed piece in the Chicago Tribune--he is a \nregular columnist there--in which he quotes Senator Dole as saying:\n\n       ``Firmness and pressure'' is what we have to use against \n     Cuba. He says, ``Firmness and pressure are what the United \n     States has used against Castro since he came to power in \n     1959, and if they had succeeded, we wouldn't be dealing with \n     him today. The Cuban dictator has outlasted eight American \n     presidents, and the odds are good that Bill Clinton will also \n     leave office long before Castro does. By any conceivable \n     standard, our efforts to bring down his regime or force him \n     into democratic reforms have been a monumental failure.''\n\n  No question about it. If in the old days of the Soviet Union, the \nSoviets and Castro had gotten together and said, ``How can we design \nAmerican policy so Fidel Castro can stay in power,'' they could not \nhave designed a better policy than the United States followed. It is \nabsolutely self-defeating.\n  It is interesting how we treat two different incidents. Belorussia \nshot down two American balloonists--innocent balloonists. We protested. \nBelorussia apologized. The incident has been forgotten. Now, there are \ndifferences. One is that Cuba has not apologized, which they should. \nBut the other difference is, those balloonists were completely \ninnocent. They were not trying to overthrow the Government of \nBelorussia.\n  It is a different situation, but the response is obviously an \nemotional response on our part. Foreign policy ought to represent \nnational interests and not national passion. What our policy toward \nCuba represents is national passion, rather than national interests and \na desire to get those electoral votes in Florida.\n  Now, both parties are guilty. I recognize that. That is not the way \nyou ought to make foreign policy.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. It does not make sense.\n  The bill that is before the Senate, among other things, codifies \nexisting sanctions. That means, and I say to my colleague from Georgia \nand I say to my colleague from Wyoming, if Bob Dole is elected \nPresident of the United States and wants some flexibility in dealing \nwith Cuba, we have taken that away. I think we ought to leave \nflexibility in the hands of the President of the United States.\n  Canada's Trade Minister, quoting in the Washington Post:\n\n       ``If the United States wants to get at Cuba, that's one \n     thing. But what they are doing here is contrary to the \n     relationship we have had with them and it is a violation of \n     NAFTA.'' That is the Trade Minister of Canada.\n\n  I read, and I regret I did not cut out an article by a woman \nprofessor who is a Cuban exile who said we are just playing into \nCastro's hands. What he wants is for the United States to beat up on \nCastro so he can say, ``I am standing up to this big bully.''\n  In the Washington Post, March 3, Louis F. Desloge had an article in \nwhich he says, talking about this bill, ``They may very well achieve \njust the opposite of what they seek by buttressing, not undermining, \nCastro's support at home and weakening, not strengthening, the \nembargo's prohibition on trade with Cuba.''\n  This is a Cuban-American exile. This whole thing just does not make \nsense. The only thing that makes sense is yielding to the national \npassion and yielding to electoral politics. It is not good foreign \npolicy. I will vote against it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nLet me thank my colleagues, Senator Pell of Rhode Island, Senator \nBingaman of New Mexico, and my colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, \nfor their statements here this morning.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to this \nlegislation. This piece of legislation before us is truly just a bad \nproposal, Mr. President. The unfortunate part of it is that it comes in \nthe wake of a tragedy of significant proportions in the Straits of \nFlorida. That is what makes it so difficult to act sensibly.\n  Obviously, the authors of the legislation had a difficult time, over \na year or so, moving this bill forward for the obvious reasons that the \nbill is so flawed substantively that many Members were reluctant to \nsign on to it. However, in the wake of what I call a terrorist act in \nthe straits of Florida by a rogue government attacking innocent pilots \nand unarmed planes, it is virtually impossible at this point to have an \nintelligent discussion about the specifics of this bill.\n  I suspect that today this measure will pass overwhelmingly, and I \nfeel that is a great tragedy. I think it will come back to haunt us \nterribly. With the provisions of this bill--we are carving out \nexceptions that will create a nightmare for us in our Federal courts, \nin our consular offices, in our relations with our friends and allies--\nI will go through the reasons why here this morning.\n  I certainly want to begin my remarks, Mr. President, by saying to my \ncolleagues and others, and particularly to the families of these young \nmen who lost their lives at the hands of an armed MiG attacking single-\nengine planes, Piper-Cubs how much I regret that violent act. To me it \ndoes not matter whether they were flying over Havana. It is inexcusable \nfor a heavily armed plane to attack unarmed commercial private planes \nunder any circumstances.\n  The debate ought not be about whether or not we are all horrified and \nangry over what happened a week ago Saturday in the straits of Florida. \nThat is not the debate. I think people agree with the President's \nactions--he spoke out clearly on this issue immediately. I want to \napplaud Madeleine Albright, our Ambassador at the United Nations, who \ndid a remarkable job. Getting the People's Republic of China to agree \nto a statement of condemnation was no small feat considering the \nrelationship that exists between Cuba and the PRC. The fact she was \nable to\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\ndo that speaks volumes about her ability as our Ambassador.\n  I regret we did not build on that particular momentum and seek to \nexpand the support within the United Nations for other joint \ninitiatives which might have had even a greater effect on Cuban \nbehavior. As we all know, every time there has been an issue in the \nUnited Nations on the Cuban embargo, we get two or three votes in \nsupport of our policy and that is it. We get clobbered on this issue. I \nsuspect as a result of the legislation we are about to adopt here today \nthat will be the case once again. Instead of building on Ambassador \nAlbright's efforts, the Security Council will now squander that \nparticular achievement.\n  Mr. President, again, I do not take a back seat to anybody when it \ncomes to condemnation of this act. I do not take a back seat to anyone \nin my desire to see change in Cuba. It is a dictatorship. No other way \nto describe it. That is what it is. Our hope is that democracy will \ncome to this island as the last nation in this hemisphere to be denied \nthe opportunity of its own people to choose its own leadership.\n  In the strongest of possible terms, Mr. President, I would say to my \ncolleagues that I carry no brief for the Cuban Government--none \nwhatsoever. Nor do any of my colleagues who join me in opposition to \nthis bill. Our opposition to this legislation is rooted in something \nthat each and every one of us ought to ask ourselves when we consider \nany bill that comes before the Congress, particularly one involving \ninternational relations: Is it good for my country first and foremost? \nIt is not about Cuba, not about Castro, not about others. It is \nstrictly is it good for us? What does it do to my country? I am a U.S. \nSenator; I am not a Senator for any particular group. I am not a \nSenator for any particular nation except my own.\n  So the first, threshold question is: What does this bill do to my \npeople, to my country, to my interests?\n  I will make the case here this morning that this bill is devastating \nto my people and to my country. It is foolish. Despite the obvious \nemotion surrounding what happened last week, we ought to be looking \ncarefully at the contents of this measure. There is a reason why the \nSenate is a deliberate body--why we follow a process here.\n  The consideration of this bill has been anything but deliberative. We \nhad no markup of this bill in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nnot a markup of this bill. We held a hearing on a very early version of \nthe bill and no followup hearings once the legislation had been \nsignificantly altered. The bill itself came directly to the Senate \nfloor without any vote to report it from the committee of jurisdiction.\n  Normally, on a bill of this significance, this magnitude, considering \nwhat an exception we are creating in law, you would have thought we \nwould have had extensive hearings and a markup in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. That was not the case. The conference was \nsimilarly conducted with the proponents of the bill working behind \nclosed doors to produce yet another version of the bill.\n  By the way, the bill has been changed at least four times on the \nSenate side alone. Similarly the final conference agreement is \ndecidedly different than either the House or Senate passed bills I am \nsure my colleagues have not read all the details of it. I do not expect \nthem to; they are busy. Nonetheless, we are about to vote on something \nhere that is just bad law.\n  There is a reason why we take our time in the U.S. Senate. It is \nbecause we do not want to react to the emotion of the moment. We have \nseen too many occasions, historically, when this body, because of the \nemotions of the moment, has passed legislation and looked back only \nweeks later and wondered what it was doing at the time. If this is a \ngood bill, it will be a good bill a week from now, a month from now, 6 \nmonths from now. If it is a bad piece of legislation, it does not \nchange. Taking a few days, which we are not going to have, to analyze \nthe implications of enacting this measure into law, how it will affect \nour country, is the least we ought to be able to do.\n  I will make a case here--by the way, for the many people who showed \nup in the Orange Bowl the other day who may have claims, against the \nCuban Government who think that they are going to be able to seek \ncompensation once this bill becomes law. They may not know it, but many \nof them are excluded from exercising the right of private action \nincluded in this bill.\n  Pay attention, Cuban-Americans, pay attention. The majority of you \nare probably not going to be benefit from this legislation. It is the \nfat cats who are going to get the money, not you. Pay attention to this \nbill and pay attention to those who would seek to have this legislation \npassed and what their interests are.\n  So, again, I regret we are moving as quickly here as we are, carving \nout unique and special pieces of legislation that I think will come \nback to haunt us very, very quickly.\n  Mr. President, let me take some time here, if I can, just to go over \nsome of the provisions contained in the conference agreement. I \nprobably have had more time than some of my colleagues to follow the \nchanges that have been made in this legislation. In my view, the \nfundamental premises of this legislation remain fatally flawed; namely, \nthat it will strangle Fidel Castro, causing him to scream ``uncle'' and \nstep down; that our allies will be bludgeoned--we are going to beat up \nour allies--into going along with this approach; and that there will be \nno negative consequences to the United States, to the American people, \nor to the myriad other outstanding foreign policy concerns that we have \nin common with our allies around the globe.\n  It may seem trite to say this, Mr. President, but I believe, as I \nsaid a moment ago, that our legislative process as it has evolved with \nexperience exists to protect citizens from bad laws. There is a reason \nthat we normally hold hearings on legislative proposals and conduct \nmarkups to examine highly complex issues. There is a reason we seek to \ntake testimony from recognized experts on the implications of a \nmeasure, intended or unintended. There is a reason that our Founding \nFathers provided for the possibility of extended debate in the U.S. \nSenate. We all know why. It is to try to at least protect against the \npassage of bad laws.\n  In the case of this legislation, we have short-circuited that \nprocess, particularly in the U.S. Senate. Most Members of this body, \nlet alone the general public, do not have the vaguest idea what is in \nthis legislation before us. The conference report was only available \nyesterday--and on a very limited basis, I might point out.\n  Suffice it to say, the final version of the Helms-Burton bill is \nworse than the previous versions that passed either body of this \nCongress last year. I fear many of us are going to be in for a surprise \nonce legal experts and others have an opportunity to review this bill. \nUnfortunately, that will not happen until it has already become law.\n  As I said on numerous occasions, the stated purposes of the \nlegislation are laudable. I do not have any debate with what the \npurposes are: to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom and \nprosperity, to encourage the holding of free and fair elections, and to \nprotect American nationals' property against confiscatory takings by \nthe Castro regime. We all agree on that. That is not what is at issue. \nUnfortunately, the conferees on this measure adopted legislation that \nwill not make any of this achievable.\n  We only have a couple of hours to make the case against this bill. I \nwill attempt to do that this morning. I would say that I believe we \nwould all have been better served had outside analysts had an \nopportunity to review and comment on this measure before we vote. That \nisn't going to be possible.\n  Let me begin by highlighting some of the more problematic provisions \nin the final conference agreement that were in neither the House bill \nnor the Senate-passed bill as it came out of conference.\n  First among these is codification in law of all current embargo \nregulations. Let me point out here, this is unique, what we are about \nto do here and pass here. To the best of my knowledge we have never \ncodified in law outstanding regulations and executive orders targeted \nat Libya, Iran, Iraq, China, Vietnam, North Korea--none of these \ncountries. We are now going to say, with regard to Cuba, that all of \nthe sanctions and regulations are now going to be codified into law. \nSenator Simon of Illinois was making this point. Any effort\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\non the part of this President or future Presidents to in any way modify \nwhat are normally executive branch decisions when it comes to economic \nsanctions can occur only once we enact a law to change them until \ndemocracy has come to Cuba. We have never taken such a draconian action \nanyplace else in the world. This is really going far beyond anything we \nhave ever done. As angry as we were about what happened to our hostages \nin Iran, as angry as we were about what happened in Iraq, as angry as \nwe are about what could happen in North Korea, or as we watch the human \nrights abuses in China, yet Presidents have had the flexibility to deal \nwith those situations through executive orders and the promulgation of \nregulations.\n  In the case of Cuba that isn't tough enough. Read the bill; we codify \nthese sanctions. That is unwise foreign policy. It is unwise. Yet the \nemotions of the moment are carrying us along here. We are going to be \nlooking back in a matter of days and saying, ``My Lord, what did we do \nhere by doing that?''\n  So that is my first concern. I urge my colleagues to look at section \n102(h) of the conference agreement. We have never, in my view, done \nthat before. We have imposed a lot of sanctions and done a lot of \nthings, but codifying them all into law is, I think, very dangerous. \nWith the codification of the embargo regulations we have tied the hands \nof this and future Presidents, as I said a moment ago, in their efforts \nto respond flexibly to changes that we hope will occur in Havana. None \nof us knows for sure if they will. They may not. But if they do, \nPresidents ought to have the ability to respond to that. Make no \nmistake about what this codification does. It sidelines, our Government \nas a participant in facilitating positive change in Cuba for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Let me turn to what I believe is the most troublesome provision in \nthis conference report, and that is title III. This title, which was \ndeleted from the Senate-passed version, grants a private right of \naction to some individuals who have had property expropriated by Fidel \nCastro. While the sponsors have tinkered with this title continuously \nin response to criticisms leveled against it, the essence of this title \nremains fundamentally the same and, therefore, continues to be \nobjectionable.\n  Instead of the United States utilizing the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission to validate the claims of American citizens and the U.S. \nGovernment to then espouse those claims with the foreign government \nthat has taken U.S. citizens' property to obtain compensation--which, \nby the way, has been the practice for more than 40 years,--our Federal \ncourt system, the Federal court system, now will be given the role of \neffecting compensation for expropriated property claims.\n  By the way, the historic treatment by the United States of \nexpropriated property claims is not unique to our country. It has been \ninternational law for 46 years. So, all of a sudden, 46 years of law \nand practice world wide are going to be overturned for one particular \ncountry in one part of the world.\n  Moreover, this legislation will broaden the universe of those \neligible to be compensated to include individuals who were not U.S. \ncitizens at the time their property was taken. For those who follow \nthis expropriation of property without compensation, a fundamental \nprinciple for 46 years internationally has been that you must have been \na citizen of the country that seeks to espouse your claim at the time \nthe property was taken. That is, you must have been a United States \ncitizen, in this case, at the time your property was expropriated in \nCuba. That is the rule internationally.\n  We are now saying, ``No, in this case you do not have to be a U.S. \ncitizen at the time of the expropriation, and you go to the Federal \ncourts.'' I urge my colleagues, no matter how angry you are about what \nhappened a week ago, consider what we are doing here. We have already \nrejected over the years similar attempts to change the eligibility \nrequirements for property compensation cases.\n  So my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee will recall it \nwas a difficult case--expropriation of property. They came and said, \n``Won't you allow Hungarians who were not citizens at the time to be \nable to be covered in the compensation program?'' We said as a body \nhere, ``We are deeply sorry. We understand your point. You have a \nvehicle available to you through your courts. If we carve out an \nexception for you, then what are we going to say to Polish-Americans, \nChinese-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans, and Arab-Americans?'' Up until \nnow, we have said ``no'' to them. Now we are saying ``yes'' here. Now \nwe are going to have to back other countries, I presume, who are likely \nto seek similar treatment.\n  No matter how angry we are, to carve out an exception to one country \nhere and deny others the opportunity is a bad, bad practice.\n  The principle of international law and practice in the area of \nexpropriation is very well established. Let me quote from the legal \nbrief prepared by Mr. Robert Muse which summarizes very clearly the \ninternational law of claims:\n\n       If international law is to apply to a governmental taking \n     of property, a party claiming the loss must occupy at the \n     time of loss the status of an alien with respect to the \n     Government that took the property. The injured person must be \n     a foreign national.\n\n  The U.S. courts have stated on numerous occasions that confiscations \nby a State of the property of its own nationals, no matter how flagrant \nand regardless of whether other compensation has been provided, do not \nconstitute violations of international law.\n  This is not the first time, as I said a moment ago, an effort has \nbeen made to mandate legislatively that the United States depart from \nthe nationality principle of international claims laws. Fortunately, on \nthose occasions Congress wisely rejected such efforts.\n  During the 84th Congress the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nexpressed very clearly why that should not be done in its report \ndealing with claims programs related to property losses in Hungary, \nRomania, and Bulgaria.\n  The committee said:\n\n       The committee has carefully considered the arguments \n     advanced in support of the proposed extension of eligibility \n     which, if adopted, would mark the first time in claims \n     history of the United States that a declaration of intention \n     was equated with citizenship. While sympathetic to the plight \n     of those unfortunate individuals who are not American \n     citizens when they sustained war losses, the committee has to \n     keep utmost in view the interests of those individuals who \n     did possess American nationality at the time of the loss.\n\n  That is why I said our first responsibility is to our own citizenry--\nto American citizens. We are placing them in second-class status. That \nis why in the 84th Congress we rejected, no matter how laudable, no \nmatter how sympathetic we are to the claims of Hungarians, Rumanians, \nand Bulgarians, we said, ``No. We are sorry. We cannot do that.'' Today \nwe are about to reverse that. Forget the other countries where \nindividuals may have similar cases to make. They, of course, will not \nbe handled accordingly, although they may come forward and seek similar \ntreatment, I presume, once this legislation has been adopted.\n  The committee went on to say, ``Further, these persons who have a \nparamount claim [speaking about American citizens] to any funds which \nmay be available to include the not-national-in-origin group will only \ndilute the funds still further and increase the injustice to American \nowners.''\n  So here you are going to take an action that is likely to increase \nthe injustice against those American citizens whose property was taken \nby Castro-- 1,911 of them. I say that because their chances of being \nfully compensated for their losses once this bill passes will be worse \nthan beforehand because of the vastly expanded pool of claimants \nproduced by this bill. In essence we are taking funds that might \notherwise be available to them and diluting them by carving out this \none exception to our global property claims programs.\n  So, if you run to pass this bill and sign up for it, remember what \nyou are doing. You are taking American citizens and putting them in \nsecond place. U.S. citizens at the time of the expropriation get \nsecond-class status when this bill passes because we are caught up in \nthe emotion and the horror of what happened a week ago. Why not slow \ndown and take a few days and think about what we are doing here instead \nof jamming this through on the emotion of the moment?\n  Proponents of the Helms-Burton legislation appear to be indifferent, \nI must\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nsay, to the injustice that this legislation will entail to certified \nAmerican claimants, although these claimants are terribly mindful of it \nand for that reason continue to oppose title III in this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a February 29 \nletter that we received from one of the largest U.S. claimants, Mr. \nDavid Wallace, chairman of Lone Star Industries, who states quite \nclearly his opposition to this change in law and practice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Joint Corporate Committee\n\n\n                                              on Cuban Claims,\n\n                                  Stamford, CT, February 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Ranking Member, Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western \n         Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: As Chairman of Lonestar Industries and \n     on behalf of the Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims, I \n     want to express my deep appreciation for your unwavering \n     leadership in standing up for the rights of U.S. certified \n     claimants.\n       The Joint Corporate Committee deplores the recent actions \n     of the Cuban Government in the strongest possible terms, but \n     as egregious as those actions are, we should not let the \n     passions of the day lead us to uncritically enact legislation \n     that is harmful to the rights of U.S. certified claimants, \n     contrary to international law, and constitutionally suspect.\n       As I've indicated in my previous communications to you, \n     Title III of the Helms-Burton bill will lead to a flood of \n     litigation in our federal courts. As you know, the Title is \n     so broadly drafted that not only third country foreign \n     investors would be subject to suit in U.S. courts for \n     ``trafficking'' in confiscated properties, but agencies and \n     instrumentalities of the Government of Cuba also would be \n     subject to suit. As a consequence, we can reasonably expect \n     that tens if not hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans \n     will file Title III lawsuits for the property losses they \n     suffered over thirty years ago as Cuban nationals.\n       Apart from the burden these lawsuits will place on our \n     already clogged federal court system, serious constitutional \n     questions arise that may result in substantial liability to \n     our government. The harm U.S. certified claimants will suffer \n     as a result of the enactment of Title III is indisputable. \n     The U.S. State Department has estimated the total value of \n     Cuban-American claims at $94 billion. U.S. certified claims, \n     by contrast, total $6 billion. Faced with the prospect of \n     tens of billions of dollars in federal court judgments, the \n     Cuban Government will have neither the means nor the \n     incentive to negotiate a settlement of the U.S. certified \n     claims. This effective nullification of the property \n     interests of the U.S. certified claimants is not without \n     consequence. Under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, \n     if the U.S. Government elects to advance a foreign policy \n     objective at the expense of the certified claims lawfully \n     held by its citizens, it will be required to pay just \n     compensation to that group of citizens. In other words, by \n     enacting Title III, we may be putting the U.S. taxpayer in \n     the shoes of the Government of Cuba--ironically, the very \n     Government this legislation seeks to punish--to pay the debt \n     these claimants are owed under international law.\n       Finally, the creation of a lawsuit right that benefits one \n     national origin group, Cuban-Americans, at the exclusion of \n     all others, will not be tolerated under our Constitution. The \n     equal protection clause of the Constitution will require the \n     extension of this lawsuit right to other national origin \n     groups. Consequently, Vietnamese-Americans, for example, will \n     be able to sue U.S. companies that today or in the future are \n     ``trafficking'' in the properties they once owned as \n     nationals of Vietnam. The same right will be extended to all \n     naturalized citizens who have lost properties in their native \n     countries as a result of governmental actions.\n       I regret that in its haste to demonstrate our abhorrence of \n     the Castro regime's actions, Congress is prepared to enact \n     ill-conceived legislation that, apart from strengthening \n     sanctions against the Cuban Government, will penalize U.S. \n     certified claimants and create a myriad of undesirable \n     domestic consequences. Your principled opposition to Title \n     III and your resolute support of the claimants is all the \n     more appreciated under these difficult circumstances.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Wallace.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, ironically title III, which has been so \nfiercely defended by its sponsors, is not going to do much to harm \nFidel Castro either. He is not likely to make himself available, as I \npoint out, as a defendant in our courts coming down the road.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will have serious implications on our \nFederal court system, on the value of claims of certified U.S. \nclaimants and on our relations with our close trading partners who will \nfeel much of the brunt of these lawsuits. If this new approach to \nresolving expropriated claims is so good, why do a number of the \nlargest U.S. certified claimants continue to oppose the legislation?\n  I believe that many of my colleagues in the Senate had come to share \nmy view that title III was not in the interest of the United States \nand, for that reason, they joined in opposing its inclusion in the \nSenate-passed version of the bill.\n  While the events of a week ago Saturday were tragic and senseless, \nMr. President, they do not in any way change the fact that title III is \ncontrary to the interests of our country, of the United States, and \ninconsistent, as I have tried to point out, with international law.\n  To disregard, without even a markup in our committee, 46 years of \ninternational law and practice in the handling of expropriation issues, \nas this title does clearly, is foolhardy, in my view.\n  There is also a question of whether title III is constitutional \nbecause of the equal protection provisions of law.\n  But even if on narrow legal grounds this bill stands the \nconstitutional test, on political grounds it is indefensible, Mr. \nPresident. As I said earlier, why should not Polish-Americans, \nVietnamese-Americans, Arab-Americans--the list of 38 countries where we \nhave claims outstanding--be granted similar access to our United States \ncourts? Will they not come forward tomorrow, or the next day, and \ndemand equal treatment as we are giving in this particular case? Why \nnot? Is this somehow different than the horrors that went on in Poland, \nor Vietnam, or China? Is anyone going to stand up on this floor and \nsuggest to me that they are somehow different, were not quite as bad as \nwhat goes on in Cuba when we lose four citizens in a tragic act of \nshooting these people down, as horrible as it is?\n  What about the young people on the Pan Am flight that we now know \nLibya was involved with? What about claims there? They have a case to \nmake? I do not see them included in this bill.\n  What happened under the Communist regimes before? Where are they \nhere? They had their property expropriated and taken from them. Why are \nthey not included in this bill? If I were they, I would be angry. This \nis special-interest legislation carving out extraordinary treatment for \na special group.\n  By the way, in order to exercise the provisions of title III with \nrespect to the right of private action you will have to have a claim \nworth more than $50,000--I will get to that in a minute--so your \naverage poor Cuban is not included in this. Out of 5,911 U.S. certified \nclaims, only slightly more than 800 will benefit from title III. The \nrest of them are excluded. Pay attention, Cuban-Americans. Pay \nattention to what this bill does or doesn't do for most of you. You are \nnot going to get any benefit. It is the fat cats who are going to \nbenefit. The tobacco and the rum interests are going to be the \nbeneficiaries of this. Read carefully how the law is written here.\n  So, Mr. President, to all of those who say they support title III of \nthis bill, I would say that I hope they have had an opportunity to \nstudy the final version and understand the implications. I suspect, for \nexample, that when the more than 85 percent of the 5,911 U.S. certified \nclaimants discover that they are precluded by provisions in this title \nfrom availing themselves of this new private right of action, they are \ngoing to be doubly opposed to this bill. Unfortunately, they will not \nfind out until it is passed.\n  In the final conference report, the sponsors sought to address a \nsignificant criticism leveled against this title--that it would cause \nan avalanche of lawsuits in our courts. They have responded to that by \nputting a floor on the value of the claims that will be admissible in \nU.S. court in adjudication. Putting aside my underlying objection to \nthat, the floor in the bill is $50,000. The problem with their efforts \nto limit lawsuits is that only suits that are really excluded by this \nfloor are those by U.S. certified claimants whose property has already \nbeen valued at $50,000 or less.\n  Can you imagine, in 1959, $50,000 of value of United States citizen \nproperty in Cuba? It has to be valued at the time of the taking, by the \nway. As a result of that, you are seeing here a situation where 85 \npercent of the 5,911 certified\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nclaimants get excluded. They cannot go to court here--just the 800 or \nso people that have claims in excess of that can. I presume that Cuban/\nAmericans who were ineligible to submit their claims to the Foreign \nClaims Settlement Commission and who therefore have no particular value \nassociated with their claim will start alleging claims in excess of \n$50,000 so that they can get access to the courts.\n  On the other hand, of course, the $50,000 floor is not likely, as I \nsaid, to limit filing of lawsuits by Cuban-American claimants. They are \nobviously going to allege more than $50,000. You can argue $50,001 and \nyou get into court. That is available to them. But our people, U.S. \ncitizens, who have already been certified by the commission as having a \nproperty value of $50,000 or less can't try the same thing. These U.S. \ncitizens are out of luck.\n  Again, let us remind ourselves why we are here, who we represent, to \nwhom is our first obligation. Last time I looked it was to U.S. \ncitizens--U.S. citizens. That is my first obligation, U.S. citizens. \nThey get taken to the cleaners on this; 85 percent of them do not get \nany advantage under this. And for the bulk of people who have claims of \nless than $50,000 who were not United States citizens when their \nproperty was taken, they will allege more and they get to access to our \ncourts. So U.S. citizens lose. U.S. citizens lose. Clearly, these small \nclaimants would be foolish, as I said earlier, not to avail themselves \nof this relief by alleging a claim in excess of $50,000.\n  They can claim that their property falls above the threshold value, \nfile suit and attempt to convince the courts that they qualify for a \npositive judgment. At the very least, this will put them in a position \nto perhaps negotiate a side deal with the alleged offending party, \nclearly permissible under this law, negotiation of a deal.\n  I predict that even in this latest version there will be a flood of \nlawsuits in our courts. What is most troubling about putting our courts \nat the centerpiece of this legislation is that it transforms our \njudicial system, the principal duty of which is to adjudicate legal \ndisputes, into an instrument of U.S. foreign policy, something we have \nalways tried to avoid in this body, always tried to avoid. Do not turn \nyour courts into an instrument of foreign policy. And yet this \nprovision of this bill not only vaguely requires that; it insists upon \nit.\n  So all of a sudden we say to the Federal courts now, with all the \ncomplaints we get from our States about the overload of work, here \ncomes another load of work in your lap. When people start complaining \nabout handling criminal cases in the United States and drug cases, \nconsider the fact you are going to be inundated now with a bunch of \nclaims matters, that we have all of a sudden involved you in a foreign \npolicy matter with Cuba.\n  The inclusion of periodic Presidential waiver authority in this \ntitle, in my view, does not change that conclusion at all--this is bad \nlaw.\n  There are also serious problems with other parts of the legislation, \nMr. President, provisions that restrict our ability to provide \nassistance to Russian and other New Independent States countries. As \nangry as we are at Cuba and what the Cuban authorities have done, why \nare we going to jeopardize our relationship with Russia and the New \nIndependent States. That is what the bill does. Read it.\n  I understand the anger. I understand the frustration. But why would \nwe jeopardize the delicate relationship we are trying to build in \nRussia and the New Independent States and have those relationships hang \non legislation here dealing with Cuba? That is not smart. That is \ndangerous, in my view.\n  Provisions in this bill also impact on our adherence to provisions of \nGATT and NAFTA, provisions that seek to micromanage our relationships \nwith future Cuban Governments--post-Castro governments.\n  Let me predict right now our allies' response to title IV of the \nbill. Let me spend a minute or so talking about this part of the bill. \nAnd people ought to pay attention to this so-called exclusion of \ncertain aliens title of the bill. It is going to make foreign commerce \nand travel a nightmare, in my view, for our business community.\n  Title IV calls upon the Secretary of State--listen to this--calls \nupon the Secretary of State to deny entry into the United States to any \nalien whose been involved in the confiscation or trafficked in Cuban \nproperty formerly owned by a United States national. The actions called \nfor by title IV, require that the Secretary of State and the Attorney \nGeneral deny entry into the United States by any foreign business \nperson, foreign official and their family members for an activity which \nis lawful in the country where that person is a citizen and consistent \nwith international law. This action flies in the face of international \ncommitments we have made. We talking about potentially a great many \ncountries being effected here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n               U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc.\n\n\n          non-United States Companies and the Republic of Cuba\n\n       Corporations and companies cited in the international media \n     as having commercial activities with the Republic of Cuba.\n       Australia: Western Mining Corp.\n       Austria: Rogner Group (tourism)\n       Brazil: Andrade Gutierrez Perforacao (oil), Coco Heavy \n     Equipement Factory (sugar), Petrobras S.A.

On this list are roughly 26 countries and nearly 200 \nforeign companies doing business in Cuba today. And so under this \nprovision of title IV of the bill, as you go through the list now, we \nare going to have to go and I guess do a fact finding of some kind or \nanother and determine whether or not--I presume that a lot of this may \nin some way touch on confiscated property in Cuba. Obviously, we have \nseen that happen--they were involved in confiscation. All these \ncompanies are going to have to go through it. And then, of course, we \nwill have to let our consular service know because any one of the \npeople involved in these companies or family members who seek to come \nto the United States can be stopped from coming. It is going to put us \nin a difficult situation in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, \nand so on.\n  Read the language. If you do not think we are going to get reprisals \nfrom this nightmare, this quagmire, let us see what happens when an \nIsraeli is denied a visa because some of their people are doing \nbusiness in Cuba or what happens when Canadians try to come to this \ncountry. Do not think we are not going to feel the brunt of it.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to read this legislation. This is unwise. \nThis is unwise. Why are we not doing this in China? My Lord, there are \nhuman rights problems there. Imagine if you tried to do that here. You \nwould be laughed off the floor if you tried it here, or Vietnam or \nother places. And yet are they any less guilty in a sense. And so here \nare 26 countries, most of them allies, where we are now going to have \nour immigration service at the gates denying entry to members of \nfamilies of people who are doing business on property that may have \nbeen confiscated without compensation in Cuba.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues just look at what we are doing here; we \nare about to run through and adopt this legislation probably on an \noverwhelming vote, without for a moment considering and the \nconsequences of it.\n  I know in some quarters it is considered good form to say the United \nStates is prepared to renounce our trade agreements. I listened to the \nPresidential debate going on and certainly there are those who are \nagainst NAFTA and against GATT, well, we are about to do it here. You \ndo not have to wait for Buchanan to become President of the United \nStates. We are about to do it.\n  I do not think those of our citizens who count on the integrity of \nthese agreements to protect the sanctity of their international \nbusiness transactions find this acceptable. I for one take these \nnational commitments seriously. When I vote on them here, I vote on \nthem seriously because I think they are right and the right direction \nto go. I think most Americans do, and I think most of our colleagues \ndo.\n  Overall, this bill is bad for U.S. business. It will undercut efforts \nby the United States to ensure that U.S. investors face a stable and \npredictable environment when they do business abroad.\n  We can hardly insist that our trading partners respect international \nlaw in the areas of trade and investment when we ourselves are prepared \nto violate it. Where is our moral high ground when we give these \nspeeches around the world about the sanctity of the efforts to try and \nget the world to live by the rules we adopt. Here we are about to go in \nand just blow that apart on our own, and then presumably give a lecture \nto the rest of the world about how they ought to live up to these \nagreements.\n  I wonder what our response is going to be when other governments \nwhose citizens are adversely affected by this legislation decide to \nenact some special interest legislation of their own directed at our \npeople, our country, our citizens and their properties abroad. We are \nhardly going to be in any position to object or to assert some \nprovision of international law in that situation.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, has a great deal of hortatory \nlanguage. Much of it I agree with. For example, section 201 sets forth \nU.S. policy toward a transition and a democratic government in Cuba. It \nis good language. Among other things, it states that it is the policy \nof the United States to ``support the self-determination of the Cuban \npeople and to recognize that the self-determination of the Cuban people \nis a sovereign and national right of the citizens of Cuba which must be \nexercised free of interference by the government of any other \ncountry.''\n  Exercising their right, the right of the citizens of Cuba which must \nbe exercised free of interference by the Government of any other \ncountry in that transition. Who can disagree with that? I could not \nhave written it better myself. I love it. I think it is wonderful. \nHowever, the operative provisions of the bill are totally at odds with \nwhat we state is our policy in section 201. There are 19 criteria in \nthis bill that the future Cuban government must meet--a future \ngovernment, not the Castro government in order for the United States to \nengage in any significant way with that government. Nineteen criteria \nthey have to meet, 19 of them, before we deem it to be in transition to \ndemocracy including when it should hold its elections--within 18 \nmonths, how and who must not be at the head of State.\n  Does this really constitute respect for self-determination? Can you \nimagine if we had these criteria with the New Independent States or in \nRussia? Do you know how difficult their transition has been, as they \nhave wrestled with trying to form their own notion of democracy. When \nyou want to help that process, nurture it, provide aid and assistance \nthat would be impossible if this legislation governed our relations \nwith those countries. We would be prohibited from doing it in this \nbill. Similarly even if Castro goes and the Cuban Government is in \ntransition, we cannot do anything meaningful to assist until the \nrequirements of the bill have been met. That is foolhardy--foolhardy--\nto do that.\n  Mr. President, I have said on numerous occasions, when we consider \nforeign policy legislation of this nature--and I said at the outset--we \nhave to ask ourselves two very basic questions: Is what is being \nproposed in the best interest of our own country, and is it likely to \nachieve the stated goals in the country to which it is directed?\n  Two basic questions: Is it good for my country, and is it likely to \nachieve the stated goals in the country that may be the target of the \nlegislation?\n  In the case of the pending legislation, I think the answer to both of \nthese questions is a resounding no.\n  I regretfully say that I think this is a bad bill, and for that \nreason, I strongly oppose it. I also realize that I may be in the \nminority, a small minority, but I could not stand here and watch this \ngo by today and not point out the fundamental flaws in the whole \napproach.\n  I will point out again that I think it is dreadful what happened a \nweek ago Saturday--dreadful what happened. There is no excuse for it. \nBut if we rush to legislate a bill that has been around a year or so, \nand it has been around because, frankly, people had serious problems \nwith it. The problems are not any less because of what happened last \nSaturday. This bill would have passed a long time ago if it had \nintelligent provisions in it dealing with how might effectively we deal \nwith Castro.\n  The only reason it is up today is because of the tragedy a week ago. \nIn fact, I argue the bill is worse today than before. There are a lot \nof provisions, as part of this conference report, that none of us ever \nvoted on.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n  I realize this may be a futile effort on my behalf to urge my \ncolleagues in the next few hours to do something, which I guess none of \nus do with great frequency. And that is to just read this conference \nreport, in particular read title III and read title IV. Consider what \nwe are about to do. I believe if you sit back objectively and look at \nthis and see how we are changing so many things in this bill, carving \nout unique exceptions that, I think, are going to cause us serious \nproblems, you will come to the same conclusions I have.\n  This does not diminish our determination to see change occur in Cuba, \nto see democracy and freedom come to the Cuban people; that Fidel \nCastro leave or that we find ways in which to effectively make our case \nthat what happened there not only should not happen but must not happen \nagain.\n  We will not forget what happened in the Straits of Florida, and we \nwill not forget who is responsible. Let us not, in the emotion of the \nmoment in dealing with that particular issue, do damage to ourselves. \nMy sole point is this bill does damage to our country. It does damage \nto our citizens. It does damage to our ability as the leading \nsuperpower in the world today to negotiate and to conduct its foreign \npolicy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \neditorials and articles in opposition to this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 3, 1996]\n\n           The Reciprocal Obsession of Castro and Washington\n\n                           (By Gaddis Smith)\n\n       New Haven, CT.--Throughout our history, the U.S. \n     government, on the one hand, and whatever regime was in power \n     in Cuba, on the other, have been prone to spasms of \n     reciprocal obsession--marked by wild rhetoric, economic \n     warfare and sometimes armed violence. Cuba's stupidly brutal \n     shooting down of two U.S. civilian airplanes last weekend, \n     and President Bill Clinton's subsequent surrender to Congress \n     on maniacal legislation aimed at the destruction of Fidel \n     Castro's regime, mark the latest spasm.\n       Today, no U.S. presidential candidate dares challenge the \n     wisdom of escalating intervention against a small, if \n     unpleasant, neighboring government. The angriest voices in \n     Washington and Florida advocate a naval blockade and do not \n     rule out invasion--ignoring international law and the opinion \n     of other governments. This furor has an all-too familiar \n     ring.\n       Since the early 19th century, Cuba's proximity to the \n     United States, strategic location on the seaways of the \n     Caribbean and economic importance have induced U.S. \n     politicians to assert the right to dictate Cuba's foreign \n     policy and internal arrangements. But the line between \n     legitimate U.S. national-security interests in Cuba and \n     domestic political partisanship has always been blurred.\n       For example, in 1853, Washington, influenced by the \n     slaveholding states, tried to buy Cuba from Spain to increase \n     the area of slaveholding and suppress a feared insurrection \n     of slaves in Cuba and its spread to the United States. Spain \n     refused to sell. In response, three senior U.S. diplomats--\n     including soon-to-be President James Buchanan--issued the \n     ``Ostend Manifesto,'' which argued that Spain's continued \n     possession of Cuba threatened ``our internal peace and the \n     existence of our cherished Union.'' If we cannot acquire Cuba \n     in any other way, said the diplomats, we should take it \n     through war. Nothing came of this because the United States \n     was hurtling toward civil war--but its tone and its intimate \n     connection to politics in the United States set a pattern.\n       In the 1870s and again in the 1890s, the Cuban people rose \n     in armed rebellion against the Spanish colonial regime. The \n     Spaniards became alarmed, with good reason, over the support \n     for the rebels coming from the United States, in general, and \n     Cuban Americans, in particular.\n       Spain suppressed the first insurrection, but not the \n     second, in 1895-98. This time, Cuba was a far hotter issue in \n     U.S. politics--thanks to coverage by mass-circulation \n     newspapers, deeper economic interconnections, the strident \n     lobbying of Cuban Americans and heightened concerns in \n     Washington over the strategic security of the Caribbean. \n     President William McKinley, eager to assure his reelection, \n     joined those who said Spain must be ousted. The sinking, in \n     Havana harbor, of the U.S. battleship Maine as a result of an \n     internal explosion in February 1898, (260 Americans died) \n     inflamed a war spirit--though it is highly unlikely that the \n     Spanish government was responsible. McKinley did not make a \n     serious effort to negotiate. The Spanish government, in turn, \n     preferred war to what it considered dishonorable concessions. \n     And war it was--``the splendid little war'' of 1898. Spain \n     lost Cuba--along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines.\n       The Cuban freedom fighters expected immediate independence. \n     Instead, the United States militarily occupied the island for \n     four years, then imposed, through the Platt Amendment, its \n     right to control Cuba's foreign relations and to intervene, \n     with troops if necessary, in the country's internal affairs. \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt formally relinquished these \n     rights in 1934--but U.S. influence remained pervasive.\n       Fast-forward to Jan. 1, 1959. Fulgencio Batista, a corrupt \n     and non-ideological dictator, fled Havana and Castro, leader \n     of a successful rebellion, entered the city and established \n     the regime he heads to this day. Scholars debate whether the \n     regime was communist from the outset or became so within a \n     year or two. They also debate whether an accommodating \n     posture by Washington, instead of an obsession with \n     undermining the regime, could have preserved amicable \n     relations. Or were Castro's obsession with Washington as the \n     source of all Cuba's problems and his welcome of the Soviet \n     Union as protector the real obstacles? There can be no \n     question, however, that a pattern of reciprocal obsession and \n     provocation was evident from the outset. Washington organized \n     an exile force to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April \n     1961. It was, as one historian said, ``the perfect failure.''\n       More serious, of course, was the 1962 crisis over the \n     placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba--the most \n     dangerous moment of the Cold War and a genuine threat to U.S. \n     security. Castro was ignored in the negotiated Soviet-U.S. \n     settlement. The Russians removed the missiles and Washington \n     promised not to invade Cuba.\n       For the next 30 years, Castro poked his finger in Uncle \n     Sam's eye at every opportunity--supporting leftist \n     revolutionaries in Latin America, sending troops to Africa at \n     Moscow's behest--and Washington did everything possible to \n     inflict economic pain and make Cuba a pariah state--only to \n     be thwarted by the subsidies sent to Castro by the Soviet \n     Union.\n       With the end of the Cold War and disappearance of the \n     Soviet Union, easing tensions, even normalizing relations, \n     might have been expected. But objective security interests \n     and domestic politics are different matters. Castro was too \n     proud--and too convinced of U.S. hostility--to make \n     conciliatory gestures toward Washington. Castro also believed \n     that Mikhail S. Gorbachev lost control of the Soviet Union \n     because he abandoned a repressive political system. Castro \n     says he will not make the same mistake. And in the United \n     States, politicians of both parties competed for the support \n     of the Cuban American community by demonstrating how tough \n     they could be on Castro.\n       By 1995, Republicans in Congress appeared to have won the \n     tough-posture competition. The Helms-Burton bill--officially \n     the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Bill--sets new \n     heights of obsession with Cuba and pretensions for dictating \n     that country's future. And it has gained tremendous momentum \n     since the planes were shot down.\n       The bill's purpose is unequivocal: Use economic \n     strangulation to eliminate Castro, then establish, with \n     military help, a transitional government and market economy \n     under U.S. supervision, followed by free elections. These \n     measures are justified both on the idealistic ground that \n     Castro is a violator of human rights--which he is--and on a \n     fanciful description of his regime as a threat to U.S. \n     security and international peace. The bill's arrogant and \n     overblown rhetoric recalls the Ostend Manifesto and its \n     specific provisions are more intrusive than the Platt \n     Amendment of 1903-34.\n       Helms-Burton assumes that Castro is on the edge of a cliff \n     and the Cuban economy is in shambles. But both assumptions \n     are wrong. Castro is paranoiac about internal criticism, but \n     remains popular. And the island's economy is reviving with \n     expanding trade and considerable new investment from Canada \n     and Europe.\n       This trade and foreign investment are the real targets of \n     Helms-Burton. If its provisions become law, and are sustained \n     in the courts, they would burn down the house of U.S. foreign \n     policy. Seeking to overthrow the regime of one little \n     country, the law inflicts great injury to the larger fabric \n     of U.S. trade and investment.\n       The key provisions flow from the assertion that the \n     confiscation and nationalization of private property in Cuba, \n     carried out by the regime sine 1959, violates U.S. and \n     international law. Therefore, any person, corporation or \n     state entity engaging in trade and investment in Cuba is \n     likely to be ``trafficking'' with stolen property--since, by \n     definition, virtually all economic activity in Cuba is based \n     on confiscated property. Any current U.S. citizen, or any \n     U.S. corporation--like the Bacardi rum company--with a claim \n     to such property can sue these ``traffickers'' in U.S. courts \n     and be awarded damages.\n       Furthermore, individual traffickers, or officers or \n     controlling stockholders of trafficking corporations--\n     including their spouses and children--can be excluded from \n     the United States. In theory, the son or daughter of an \n     executive of a Canadian hotel company with Cuban interests \n     attending school in the United States could be deported. The \n     bill's implementation would create a nightmare for U.S. \n     courts and would violate major treaties and international-\n     trade agreements.\n       Last summer, Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher \n     recommended that Clinton veto the bill when and if it came to \n     his desk. Until Feb. 24, the chances of the bill being passed \n     and signed were slight. But then Castro blundered into the \n     hands of his enemies--by authorizing the destruction of the \n     two civilian planes flown by the Brothers to the Rescue \n     group. The Cuban government is brazenly unapologetic and said \n     it was defending\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n     its sovereignty--but even Castro's newest friend, China, has \n     joined in deploring the deed.\n       By this action, Castro achieved what his most fervent \n     critics in Congress could not: He persuaded Clinton to agree \n     to Helms-Burton. Clinton, like McKinley in 1898, wants a \n     second term. The final details of the legislation remain to \n     be worked out, but the president said he will sign. \n     Reciprocal obsessions have again triumphed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 29, 1996]\n\n                   U.S. Policy: Held Hostage in Miami\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       Question: Who sets U.S. policy toward Cuba?\n       (A) The president.\n       (B) Congress.\n       (C) Any Cuban American with an airplane.\n       The answer, apparently, is ``C''--or, if you'd like a name, \n     Jose Basulto. He is the leader of Brothers to the Rescue, the \n     humanitarian group with a political mission, and a survivor \n     of the recent massacre in the skies near (or over) Cuban \n     waters. Four others died when their unarmed Cessnas were \n     downed by Cuban MiGs. They were brave men.\n       It is important to say, as the American government has, \n     that Cuba was wrong. The downing of the two planes, no matter \n     what their location, was a violation of international law--\n     not to mention common decency. It was as if the police here \n     had caught some burglars red-handed, determined they were \n     unarmed and executed them on the spot. Fidel Castro committed \n     murder--and not for the first time.\n       Whatever its faults, though, the nature of the Castro \n     regime is well known. It is a museum piece, a relic of the \n     communist era, frozen in ideological amber and, like Pavlov's \n     famous dog, predictable in its reaction to certain stimuli. \n     After years of a U.S. embargo--after the Bay of Pigs and \n     other CIA operations, after Radio Marti and numerous attempts \n     at coups, a farcical facial (the CIA tried to make his beard \n     fall out) and, probably, assassination--it would be just \n     plain insulting to call Castro paranoid. The man has enemies, \n     and they are out to kill him.\n       One of them, in fact, is Basulto. Not only was he flying \n     the one plane that was not downed, but he announced himself \n     to the Cuban authorities as the guy in the cockpit: ``Cordial \n     greetings from Brothers to the Rescue, from its president, \n     Jose Basulto, who is talking.''\n       That greeting, it turned out, was met with a warning: \n     ``Sir, be informed that the north zone of Havana is \n     activated.'' Basulto was then told he was in ``danger,'' and \n     he responded with an acknowledgment: ``We are aware that we \n     are in danger each time we cross the area to the south of the \n     24th [parallel], but we are willing to do it as free \n     Cubans.''\n       Ah, but Basulto is not merely a ``free Cuban.'' He is also \n     a Cuban American. As such he reminds me of those zealous \n     Israeli settlers who, citing the Bible, declare a certain \n     spot divinely zoned for Jewish occupation and promptly \n     establish a settlement there. The Arabs respond with clenched \n     teeth and unsheathed daggers, and the settlers demand that \n     the Israeli army protect them. Which side are you on? they \n     demand to know, ours or the Arabs? The army moves in.\n       In this case, the Clinton administration is playing the \n     role of the Israeli army: Deep down it has all sorts of \n     reservations about the United States' traditional Cuba \n     policy, but it cannot afford to show good sense lest it be \n     seen as weakness. The boycott of Cuba has done little more \n     than make the Cuban people miserable. Castro remains--\n     resplendent, entrenched and still wearing those silly \n     fatigues. He is no more and no less a communist than the \n     leaders of Vietnam, old foes with whom we now do business.\n       The influence Cuban Americans have over U.S.-Cuba policy is \n     neither illegitimate nor novel. American Jews have a \n     passionate concern about Israel, and the Irish here are \n     intensely interested in the Irish there. One might even \n     suggest that the recent U.S. occupation of Haiti would not \n     have happened were it not for the political clout of African \n     Americans--an assertion, you might say; a fact, I would \n     insist.\n       Yet, some Cuban Americans are in a class of their own. \n     Basulto, for one, does more than write his congressman or \n     raise money. He was at the Bay of Pigs and, a year later \n     (1962), was one of 23 men who took two converted PT boats \n     into Cuban waters and shelled a Havana suburb. The Associated \n     Press named him ``the man behind the gun.'' Since then, he \n     has formed Brothers to the Rescue, which, among other things, \n     has dropped anti-Castro leaflets on Havana, testing the \n     dictator's celebrated sense of humor.\n       Basulto had been warned by both Washington and Havana to \n     watch his step. That does not excuse the subsequent killings, \n     but it does tend to explain them. The same holds for \n     Washington's policy toward Havana. It's easy enough to \n     explain why Washington toughened the embargo in response to \n     the shoot-down (all those votes in Florida), but harder to \n     excuse. It makes little sense. Toughening the embargo causes \n     ordinary Cubans--not Castro--to suffer even more.\n       The Clinton administration had little choice but to get \n     tougher with Castro. But it has to be firmer, too, with \n     certain Cuban Americans. U.S. policy toward Cuba, inching \n     toward sanity until the recent shootings, cannot become the \n     captive of anyone, no matter how well-intentioned, who \n     literally flies off on his own. More than planes got shot \n     down the other day. So did U.S. policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 1996]\n\n                           A Bad Bill on Cuba\n\n       The Clinton Administration had done many things right and \n     one thing terribly wrong in response to Cuba's shootdown of \n     two unarmed planes flown by Miami-based exiles.\n       Providing a Coast Guard escort to accompany an exile \n     flotilla to the site of the downing today registers American \n     determination to protect the security of international waters \n     and airspace. Equally important, it minimizes the risk of \n     either the exiles' or Havana's provoking a new incident. The \n     Administration's decision earlier this week to suspend \n     charter flights to Cuba and to impose travel restrictions on \n     Cuban diplomats in this country made clear that Havana had \n     attacked not just anti-Castro activists but international law \n     itself.\n       However, the Administration is about to make a huge mistake \n     by signing into law a bill, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms \n     and Representative Dan Burton, that aims to coerce other \n     countries into joining the American embargo of Cuba. By \n     dropping his opposition to the bill, Mr. Clinton junks his \n     own balanced policy for encouraging democracy in Cuba and \n     signs on to an approach that will inevitably slow the opening \n     of Cuban society and pick a pointless quarrel with American \n     allies.\n       The bill threatens foreign companies with lawsuits and \n     their executives with exclusion from American soil if they \n     use any property in Cuba ever confiscated from anyone who is \n     now a United States citizen. Some of its provisions appear to \n     violate international law and trade treaties, and the \n     Administration had been saying since last summer that it \n     would veto the measure unless these provisions were removed.\n       The United States is the only country that maintains an \n     economic embargo against Cuba, an outdated policy that has \n     failed in 35 years to topple the Castro Government. Trying to \n     coerce other countries to join the embargo is offensive to \n     American allies and unlikely to succeed.\n       Backers of the Helms-Burton bill believe the Cuban economy \n     has been so enfeebled by the loss of subsidized Soviet trade \n     that the Castro regime can be brought down with one final \n     shove. But Cuba's economy, though hurting, has already \n     revived from the depths of the early 1990's. Its recovery has \n     been built on austerity, limited reforms and new trade \n     relationships with the rest of the world. It is unrealistic \n     to think that a reinforced American embargo would bring Mr. \n     Castro down.\n       What Havana really worries about is the resurgence of \n     opposition in Cuba itself. Opposition groups have been \n     invigorated by Cuba's widened contacts with the outside \n     world. They are also encouraged by a more supportive attitude \n     on the part of Miami-based exile organizations. These used to \n     view all Cubans who remained on the island, even opposition \n     activists, with suspicion. Now groups like Brothers to the \n     Rescue, the organization whose planes were shot down last \n     week, see opposition groups on the island as a key to \n     political change.\n       The Castro regime is alarmed by this potential link between \n     domestic opponents and outside support groups, heralded by \n     Brothers to the Rescue's previous airborne leafletting of \n     Havana. Indeed, Havana's concern over this prospect may have \n     been a factor in last week's missile attack against the \n     exile's planes. Washington should be doing everything it can \n     to promote opposition within Cuba by encouraging more human \n     interchange between the island and the outside world, not \n     less.\n       The Helms-Burton Act is not an appropriate response to \n     Cuba's murderous deed. It is a wholesale policy reversal that \n     weakens America's ability to encourage democracy in Cuba. Mr. \n     Clinton should return to his original sound position.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 1, 1996]\n\n                    Surrendering U.S. Policy on Cuba\n\n       After more than 30 years of them, it should be clear that \n     trade sanctions against Cuba will not force Fidel Castro to \n     surrender. What a shame, then, that a great power like the \n     United States has surrendered its foreign policy to a tiny \n     population of hard-line anti-Castro Cubans. What an \n     embarrassment.\n       By agreeing this week to impose new economic penalties \n     against Cuba, President Clinton and the Republican-controlled \n     Congress have proven that, given a choice between sound \n     foreign policy and pandering to the rabid anti-Castro crowd \n     in a critical electoral state, they'll pander.\n       In no way do we defend Castro's dictatorship or the \n     outrageous disregard for human life represented by Cuba's \n     downing last weekend of two small civilian aircraft. But in \n     that regard, an old American adage is instructive: Don't go \n     looking for trouble, it cautions, cause it'll find you \n     anyway.\n       Brothers to the Rescue, an exile group, went looking for \n     trouble by violating Cuba's sovereign air space to drop \n     leaflets and by playing hide-and-seek with Cuban jets along \n     its periphery.\n       By law, private citizens may not make foreign policy. Yet \n     the Cuban exiles invited this ``crisis,'' if they didn't \n     actually manufacture it, and suckered both a Democratic \n     president and a Republican Congress into making policy to \n     suit their purposes.\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n       Ironically, the new sanctions, while aimed at isolating \n     Castro and weakening his power, are certain only to \n     complicate trade relations with key U.S. allies and \n     commercial partners such as Canada, Mexico and France.\n       Under the sanctions, U.S. visas will be denied to foreign \n     corporate executives--and their stockholders--if these firms \n     are among those that have invested billions of dollars in \n     Cuban property. (The U.S. is the only nation that observes \n     the absurd embargo of Cuba.)\n       Another provision would allow U.S. citizens to file suit \n     against foreign firms utilizing property that was seized by \n     Castro. But in a cynical provision designed to neuter that \n     very same proposal, the president is granted power to waive \n     the rule every six months to throw out the backlog of \n     anticipated cases.\n       Like all dictators, Castro shows unwavering patience in \n     allowing his people to suffer. But if America wants to \n     influence Cuba to liberalize, then more ties--not a trade \n     embargo--is the answer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 30, 1995]\n\n  Cuba Expropriation Bill Could End Up Costing U.S. Taxpayers Billions\n\n       In his Sept. 25 Op-Ed, Rep. Dan Burton understates an \n     important aspect of his Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act of 1995 (``Cuban-American claims . . . and \n     counterclaims'').\n       Mr. Burton says that his proposed legislation will allow \n     U.S. citizens to sue ``foreigners'' who ``buy or use'' \n     expropriated properties in Cuba. The litigation provisions of \n     Mr. Burton's bill, like Sen. Jesse Helms' counterpart Cuba \n     bill that is awaiting action in the Senate, are far broader \n     than that.\n       In fact, the nation of Cuba itself will be the chief \n     defendant in the 300,000 to 430,000 lawsuits that will be \n     filed in the federal courts of Florida by naturalized Cuban \n     Americans if Mr. Burton's bill becomes law.\n       It is this aspect of the bill that its proponents tend to \n     downplay. The reason such an avalanche of litigation is \n     inevitable is that the bill bestows--in flagrant disregard of \n     international law--a set of retroactive lawsuit rights \n     against their native country upon Cuban Americans who were \n     naturalized in the United States after suffering property \n     losses in Cuba.\n       Unfortunatley, the unprecedented rights that are intended \n     to be conferred on Cuban Americans by the bill are at the \n     expense of U.S. citizens who do have rights under \n     international law with respect to Cuba--that is, the 5,911 \n     holders of $6 billion in claims certified against that nation \n     by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission in the 1950s. \n     (One such certified corporate claimant is my client, Amstar.)\n       If the lawsuit provisions of Mr. Burton's bill become law, \n     certified claimants will see their prospects of recovering \n     compensation from an already impoverished Cuba extinguished \n     in a sea of Cuban-American claims that have been estimated by \n     the State Department at approximately $95 billion.\n       It is ironic that a pair of well-meaning Republican \n     legislators are threatening with their bill (1) to create a \n     litigation explosion in this much-heralded year of tort \n     reform, and (2) to destroy or gravely damage the adjudicated \n     interests of one group of Americans in an era of supposed \n     greater protectiveness of the property rights of U.S. \n     citizens.\n       The bill raises two further serious questions. First, on \n     what principled basis are the lawsuit rights proposed to be \n     given Cuban-Americans to be denied other national-origin \n     groups (e.g., Vietnamese-Americans, Chinese-Americans, \n     Polish-Americans, Palestinian-Americans, etc.) that have \n     suffered property losses in their former countries?\n       If history is any guide, the courts will not void the \n     rights proposed to be accorded Cuban-Americans by the Burton \n     bill; rather they will decree, pursuant to the equal \n     protection clause of the Constitution, that such rights be \n     extended to other similarly situated national-origin groups. \n     It is anyone's guess how many additional hundreds of \n     thousands of litigations will then ensue.\n       The second question posed by the Burton bill is, once a \n     class of hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans judgment \n     creditors against Cuba is created, how will relations ever be \n     normalized with that country? The answer is that such \n     normalization will inevitably require the dismissal of the \n     underlying federal court awards because of the running-sore \n     problems of the attachments in the United States--following \n     the lifting of the embargo--of Cuban bank accounts, ships, \n     airplanes, agricultural produce and manufactured items of \n     Cuban origin by hundreds of thousands of Cuban-American \n     judgment holders.\n       When those judgments are dismissed by the president, the \n     issue of liability of the U.S. government to the Cuban-\n     American holders of extinguished federal court awards \n     inevitably will arise.\n       It is not alarmist to warn that the U.S. taxpayer may well \n     be made, under the Fifth Amendment ``takings clause'' of the \n     Constitution, to indemnify hundreds of thousands of Cuban-\n     Americans in the amount of approximately $95 billion.\n       If anyone doubts that Mr. Burton's bill harbors such \n     consequences for the U.S. Treasury, then he or she might \n     usefully consult the Supreme Court's opinion in Dames & Moore \n     vs. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981). We should hope that the \n     Senate, member by member, will do precisely that before \n     voting on Mr. Helms' bill--Robert L. Muse, Washington.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas to speak on behalf of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Georgia \nyielding. I intend to vote in favor of this conference report despite \nsome serious reservations about several of the provisions.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has just spoken strongly about several \nof the same reservations that I hold, although I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, I think some of the examples he has given about unintended \nconsequences might be a bit exaggerated.\n  I would like to outline some of my concerns and the reasoning for \nthem.\n  First, I question whether this bill, on the whole, moves us in the \nright direction. The laws of nature dictate that Castro cannot remain \nin power forever, and I am skeptical that the best means at this point \nof ensuring a peaceful transition is to further tighten the noose \naround Cuba, despite the outrageous acts of a week ago.\n  Second, I remain concerned about title III of the legislation, as has \nbeen addressed, which allows new lawsuits in Federal court against \ninvestors of property that was confiscated in Cuba.\n  I opposed this provision when the legislation first came before the \nSenate, and I am disappointed it has been restored in the conference \nreport. I still believe it is unwise for Congress to set up United \nStates Federal courts as tools in the pursuit of foreign policy \nobjectives in Cuba, although I take some comfort in the new authority \nprovided for the President to weigh this provision.\n\n  Third, I also am disappointed that the conference report goes further \nthan the Senate bill in two important areas, which, of course, the \nSenator from Connecticut also discussed, neither of which has had the \nbenefit of examination in the Senate.\n  The conference report would deny United States visas to any person \nwho invests in confiscated property in Cuba with only two narrow \nexceptions. We have allowed no flexibility to accommodate the awkward \nsituations that inevitably will arise. The conference report also \ncodifies in statute all existing sanctions and embargoes against Cuba, \nstripping this President and future presidents of the flexibility to \nrespond step-by-step to changes in the situation in Cuba.\n  For these many reasons, I would prefer that we enact something other \nthan this bill. But, Mr. President, that is not an option. Nobody has \ndone more to ensure enactment of this legislation than Fidel Castro \nhimself. By shooting down two American civilian airplanes last week, he \ndemanded that we respond.\n  I strongly believe we must respond to this latest provocation and \nthat America should speak with one voice on this matter. While this \nparticular legislation would not be my preference, it clearly is the \npreference of the Republican leadership in both houses of Congress. It \nnow is the preference of the President of the United States. I am one \nwho believes the President should have some discretion to shape U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  The situation reminds me of a young cowboy who worked hard each week \nto earn money so he could ride into town each weekend and play poker. \nHe always lost. After months of watching him lose, a sympathetic \nbartender pulled him aside one evening and said, ``Son, I just want you \nto know, this game is rigged. The cards are marked. The deck is \nstacked. And the dealer keeps an ace up is sleeve.''\n  ``I know,'' replied the young cowboy.\n  The bartender was flabbergasted. ``You know?'' he exclaimed. ``Then \nwhy do you keep coming back?''\n  ``That's simple,'' replied the cowboy. ``This is the only game in \ntown.''\n  Mr. President, there is no other option before this body for those of \nus who believe strongly that the United States must respond to Fidel \nCastro's latest outrage. Despite its faults, this legislation is the \nonly game in town. For that reason, I will support it.\n  I yield back any time I may have, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair and the manager of the bill, \nSenator Coverdell.\n  Mr. President, the premeditated, cold-blooded murder of four American \ncitizens by Cuban war planes last Saturday is an outrage, an outrage \nagainst the United States of America, against international law, and \nagainst every concept of human decency. Neither the United States nor \nthe world community can allow these murders to go unpunished. The four \nAmericans who were killed were part of Brothers to the Rescue, an \norganization that has helped to save countless Cuban citizens who \nrisked their lives to flee oppression and poverty in their country. \nWithout the Brothers' heroic, humanitarian efforts, thousands of Cuban \nfamilies would have died on the open seas.\n  How did the Cuban Government react to this heroism? How did it reward \nthose who had saved thousands of its own citizens? It carried out the \nruthless execution of four of these brave Americans.\n  The Cuban Government can try to argue that its actions were justified \nas an act of self defense, but the whole world knows the truth--that \nCuban MiG's pursued and shot down the crews of two unarmed Cessna \naircraft.\n  The whole world was watching, Mr. Castro. It was not self-defense. It \nwas cold-blooded murder.\n  We are shocked by what happened the weekend before last, but nobody \nshould be surprised. Mr. Castro is a brutal dictator with no regard for \nbasic human rights, no respect for international law, and he has an \nabiding hatred for the United States and everything it stands for.\n  This is a man responsible for the suffering in Cuba--hunger, forced \nlabor, oppression, and worse. This is the man who has exported military \nequipment and Cuban soldiers to foment civil war in nations in our \nhemisphere and around the world. This is the man who tried to put his \nfinger on the launch button of nuclear missiles aimed at the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, he is an evil man. A series of American Presidents, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have understood this and have sought to \nisolate and individually bring down his government, for the good of the \nCuban people and the world. Nevertheless, Mr. Castro always has had his \napologists in this country. Until Saturday before last, it had become \npopular in some circles to see him as ``older and mellower,'' a more \n``moderate'' revolutionary Communist. That view of a ``kinder, \ngentler'' Fidel Castro was evidenced in the recent relaxation of travel \nand other restrictions against Cuba. The folly of appeasement and \naccommodation is now tragically apparent.\n  Today, we will act to restore United States policy to its previous \nand proper direction--to isolate the Castro government, and hasten the \nday that it will fall.\n  The legislation before us will reinstate and reaffirm United States \neconomic sanctions, it will deny foreign investment and hard currency \nto sustain this corrupt government, and it will protect the interests \nof American citizens whose property was seized illegally by the Cuban \nGovernment.\n  Without huge Soviet subsidies that propped it up for decades, the \nprovisions of this legislation will inevitably bring the Castro \ngovernment to the brink of two alternatives: give up power voluntarily, \nor have it taken away by the long-suffering Cuban people. The goals of \nUnited States policy toward Cuba must be: the end of the Castro regime, \nand the opportunity for freedom and democracy for the Cuban people.\n  Mr. President, we must do more than we are even doing today. This is \na step in the right direction, and I am pleased that we are going to \npass this important legislation. I am also pleased that the President \nhas thought better of his earlier opposition to this legislation. But \nwe must also address another urgent problem, and that is the threat \nposed by Cuban construction of two nuclear reactors. These reactors are \nfatally flawed--Chernobyls in the making. In the event of a meltdown, \nlethal radioactivity would threaten the entire southeastern United \nStates. These two reactors cannot be allowed to go online. This is a \nmatter of direct and vital national security interest to the United \nStates.\n  Our allies and the Cuban Government must understand that we cannot \npermit the existence of this threat to our country. So I call on the \nPresident today to take the lead in coming to grips with this impending \ncrisis.\n  I extend my sympathies to the families of the four brave men who lost \ntheir lives in the name of freedom. Nothing can replace the husbands \nand fathers they lost. But it would be a fitting testament to the \nsacrifices of these American patriots if the tragedy strengthened \nAmerican resolve and thereby hastens the day that the Castro \ndictatorship crumbles and freedom is restored to the people of Cuba.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join others in expressing our profound \nappreciation to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nSenator from Georgia, and other colleagues on that committee, for their \nabsolute steadfast determination to bring this measure to the Senate \nfor a vote and eventually for passage and enactment into law. That took \nreal courage. And it is regrettable that the final impetus to get this \nlegislation passed had to come in a week of absolute tragedy.\n  I want to deal with that for a minute, Mr. President. This world \ntoday is sieged with acts of terrorism. All of our hearts are filled \nwith compassion and sadness for the people of Israel today for the \ntotal useless taking of life in those recent terrorist acts. We admire \nthe courage the people of Israel have shown in the face of these \nattacks.\n  Just over a week ago, four innocent lives were lost in the Straits of \nFlorida due to the Cuban shoot-down of two unarmed civilian aircraft. \nThese acts, at the explicit direction of Fidel Castro, were first-\ndegree, premeditated murder--offenses which would be punished in the \nUnited States upon conviction, and in most instances with the death \npenalty. I regret the level of reaction by the current administration. \nBut this legislation will go further and bring about, through economic \nmeans, an incentive to stop it, because terrorism knows no boundaries, \nand unless it is thoroughly and unanimously oppressed across the board, \nit will spring up elsewhere, as we see in this very troubled world \ntoday.\n  Castro's total lack of support for democratic reform, and his lack of \nwillingness to even attempt to provide some economic recovery for his \nrepressed people, brought about, in some measure, this legislation.\n  The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act--what a fine name \nthat is--contains three primary objectives: To strengthen international \nsanctions against the Castro regime, to develop a plan for future \nsupport for a free and independent Cuba, and provide for the protection \nof property rights of United States nationals.\n  I firmly believe that this legislation, if passed and signed into law \nby the President, will greatly enhance the likelihood that Cuba, some \nday, will join the other nations in this hemisphere with a democratic \nform of government and a freedom to which those people are entitled.\n  Mr. President, as I look through the technical aspects of this \nlegislation, I would like to address a question, for clarification, to \nthe distinguished manager of the bill. It is about a concern I have \nwith respect to the $50,000 limitation in section 302 of title III. It \nseems to me that a lot of people under the figure of $50,000 are \nseverely injured, as are those above the figure of $50,000. To them, \nthe few dollars they could recover, with a lesser cap, is of equal \nimportance to them and their families--and to try and assure their life \nin this country to be a better one--than the higher limit. I know it \nwas a difficult decision. But if the distinguished Senator from Georgia \ncould give me some background on that particular issue, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the $50,000 cap comes from the workings \nof the Congress itself. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut, in \nhis opposition to the bill, and several others, were worried about a \nflood of court cases, and so the cap was placed to address that \nconcern. There are some\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n500,000 claims, or so some opponents claim, that could have come into \nthe court system without the cap. So in response to the concern that \nthe court system could not manage this number of claims, the cap came \ninto play. Secondarily----\n  Mr. WARNER. To make that fair, Mr. President, in other words, the \ninitiative to put the cap in came from those originally opposed to the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely. Second, the focus of this bill is to \ndiscourage and chill economic joint ventures with Castro. Economic \njoint ventures do not involve residential housing properties, instead \nthey deal with the broad commercial properties. So there were these two \nreasons for setting the $50,000 cap. I, myself, more than welcome the \nopportunity at some later point to lower the cap to zero.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with that assurance, I depart the floor \nbetter informed, because if at a later time Congress, looking at how \nwell this act has performed and will serve the goals in here, would \nbegin to consider that perhaps there is a hardship, and could address \nthat.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I join the Senator in welcoming that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the proponents \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Georgia has \n16\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield to the Senator from Florida for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to \nspeak today on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Helms-Burton bill, I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation, which has taken on \nincreased importance as the level of repression has escalated both \nwithin and outside Cuba.\n  For 37 years, Fidel Castro has held the Cuban people hostage to his \nbrutal repression and mismanagement. He has brazenly violated their \nhuman rights.\n  Since 1992--a year after the collpase of the Soviet Union and its \nsubsidization of Cuba's economy--United States Cuba policy has been \nbased upon tightening the economic embargo around Castro's neck, while \nat the same time extending the hand of democracy and human rights to \nthe Cuban people.\n  The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 started us down this road. Today's \naction will accelerate our pace.\n  Our drive to free Cuba from Castro's grip would benefit from the \nexample of an organization whose bravery, selflessness, and unflagging \nhumanitarian spirit deserves recognition on this historic occasion.\n  On February 24, four brave members of Hermanos al Rezkate--Brothers \nto the Rescue--lost their lives at the hands of a dictator and his \nbrutal regime.\n  They were the victims of a pattern of escalating human rights abuses \nthat previously had been reserved for the citizens of Cuba. This time, \nFidel Castro extended his violent reach outside his own airspace.\n  These men knew, when they embarked on their mission, that it involved \nsignificant personal risk. But they also believed that the suffering of \nthe Cuban people demanded courage in the face of risk.\n  The brave, tireless, humanitarian acts of Brothers to the Rescue must \nlive on despite the deaths of these brave pilots.\n  Mr. President, their mission must become ours.\n\n\n                 castro oppresses, the brothers rescue\n\n  While Fidel Castro has terrorized the Cuban people, Brothers to the \nRescue has extended the hand of brotherhood to his victims.\n  Fidel Castro has never hesitated to resort to violence to protect his \nautocratic rule. Last weekend's incident is a perfect example of that \ninclination toward violent action.\n  Brothers to the Rescue deplores violence. Their mission is strictly \nhumanitarian. Its leaders receive training at the Martin Luther King \nCenter for Non-Violence in Atlanta. Its leaders speak and practice \nGandhi's precepts of nonviolence.\n  They use volunteer pilots to search for Cuban rafters and others in \nneed of rescue. They drop bottled water, protective clothing, and other \nneeded supplies to those refugees.\n  Castro has harassed thousands of Cuban journalists and thousands of \nnonviolent political dissenters. Recently:\n  July 11, 1995: Cuban police initiate a widespread crackdown on \nindependent journalists;\n  February 16-24, 1996: Castro cracks down on the nonviolent Concilio \nCubano, a coalition of 131 prodemocracy dissident groups; and\n  On February 24, Castro murdered four U.S. citizens over international \nwaters.\n  The Brothers have rescued more than 5,000 men, women, and children \nrefugees from the waters of the Straits of Florida.\n  First flight: May 15, 1991.\n  Total flights: Over 1,780.\n\n\n     some will accuse brothers to the rescue of being provocateurs\n\n  To be sure, there were instances where the organization's commitment \nexceeded its charter. On several occasions, they have penetrated Cuban \nairspace and dropped leaflets.\n  Two such occasions were:\n  June 1994--returning from Guantanamo Bay, dropped Brothers to the \nRescue bumper stickers on Eastern Cuba; July 13, 1995--dropped leaflets \non Havana.\n  These were leaflets--their impact on Cuban citizens was the power of \ntheir ideas.\n  These actions, however, were taken to provide the Cuban people with \ninformation they are badly lacking--information on their basic human \nrights. Each leaflet reproduced one of the Universal Articles on Human \nRights. This is information the Cuban people do not have because the \nCastro regime refuses to allow a free press, or the free exchange of \nideas.\n\n\n                  making the brothers' mission our own\n\n  Changes are afoot in Cuba. The best way we can take advantage of \nthose changes and bring democracy, prosperity, and an end of the Castro \nregime to Cuba is to make the Brothers to the Rescue mission our own.\n  The Brothers are committed humanitarians, They reach out to all \npeople in need.\n  Last week, I had the privilege of meeting with some of the family \nmembers and friends of the lost pilots. One of them recounted a story \nabout Mario De La Pena, a 24-year-old Miami resident who had flown with \nBrothers to the Rescue for several years.\n  Last Christmas Eve, Mario was returning home from a mission when he \nspotted a man stranded in the water.\n  The man was not a Cuban rafter, but Mario dropped supplies anyway. \nMario flew home to join his family for Christmas Eve, but the thought \nof this man trapped in the Straits of Florida during Christmas haunted \nhim.\n  The next morning, he woke up early and flew back to check on the \nstranded boater.\n  To his relief, the man was fine. He was soon rescued, and later that \nday, Mario saw the man on television, jubilant and relieved. Mario's \nfriends tell me that this rescue, and the others he participated in, \nwere among the biggest thrills of his life.\n  The United States must continue to support people-to-people \nhumanitarian efforts to free Cuba. We must continue our support for \nthose non-governmental organizations working to encourage democracy in \nCuba.\n  The Brothers rescue people in danger.\n  The determination to rescue Cubans from Castro's enslavement was \nembodied by Armando Alejandre, who also lost his life on February 24. \nArmando didn't just look for rafters in the Straits of Florida. He \ncarried food and supplies to Cuban refugees stranded in the Bahamas. \nAnd he never passed on an opportunity to criticize the Castro regime \nfor its brutal suppression of rights.\n  The enslaved people of Cuba are in danger of further abuses by the \nCastro regime. We must rescue them.\n  The fallen Brothers pilots were brave men. They took enormous risks \nto bring hope to the Cuban people.\n  Another one of last weekend's victims was a young man named Carlos \nCosta. His sister tells me that he was terrified of the small Cessna he \nflew for Brothers to the Rescue. The winds in the Straits of Florida \nviolently buffeted his plane and frightened Carlos and his passengers. \nYet he volunteered to fly his rescue plane every week. He flew on \nChristmas and other holidays.\n  We must also be willing to take risks to hasten Castro's fall from \npower. We\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nneed a tougher, more ambitious Cuba policy.\n  The Brothers were tireless, searching every mile of the Straits of \nFlorida for Cuban rafters.\n  Some of the most determined were those pilots who had once been \nrafters themselves. Pablo Morales was one of those pilots. He fled Cuba \non a raft in 1992 and quickly became an active volunteer in Brothers to \nthe Rescue.\n  He returned to help others on February 24--Castro sentenced Pablo \nMorales to death in these same Straits of Florida.\n  We must be as vigilant as Pablo was. We must not rest until we have \nsearched for every possible way to force Castro from power.\n\n\n                seizing the day--more pressure on Castro\n\n  Fidel Castro has once again shown that he is a brutal dictator. We \nmust reiterate our commitment to ending his stranglehold on Cuba.\n  How? There are three ways:\n  First, enact Helms-Burton.\n  This will tighten the economic chokehold on Castro, and sharpen his \nisolation from his own people.\n  This will continue the work of the Cuban Democracy Act, which began \nour effort to sanction and isolate the Castro regime with one hand, and \nreach out to the Cuban people with the other.\n  Helms-Burton will help us in our goal of building democratic \nsentiment among the Cuban people.\n  Second, work with our allies to bring international pressure to bear \non the Castro regime.\n  Last month, I visited Chile to assess the shape of United States-\nChilean relations. And though Chile maintains diplomatic relations with \nthe Castro government, I was pleased to return with a firm commitment \nthat Chile will support the U.N. resolution condemning Castro's human \nrights abuses.\n  Third, assess our preparedness for dealing with Castro in the future.\n  We must maintain a clear understanding of what our objectives are: To \nsupport the legitimate aspirations of the Cuban people to replace Fidel \nCastro with a democratic, human rights-friendly government that brings \nabout the political and economic reconstruction of Cuba.\n  In the future, we cannot afford to wait 48 hours to issue a response. \nThat is an unacceptable delay. Our Government needs to develop an \nanticipatory stance. We need contingency plans that can be implemented \nswiftly and judiciously.\n  We must be committed to a response which is proportional to the \noffense.\n  As the Helms-Burton and other sanctions take hold, we must anticipate \nthe potential for further escalation of attacks against U.S. citizens \nand U.S. interests. This means making certain that our borders are \nsecure from Castro's terror.\n  I continue to be concerned about incidents such as that which \noccurred in 1994, when a Cuban defector landed a Cuban military plane \non the United States naval station near Key West, FL. He landed that \nplane unchallenged. Castro has made repeated threats against a major \nnuclear power facility in the southern portions of my State.\n  We must expand our efforts through television and Radio Marti to \nreach out to the people of Cuba.\n  Mr. President, this past weekend, the remaining members of Brothers \nto the Rescue led another mission in the Straits of Florida. This time, \ntheir goal was not to rescue but to celebrate the memories and brave \nacts of those four fallen pilots.\n  As they have for the past 5 years, the boats and planes dispatched on \nthis mission encountered tremendous obstacles. Mother Nature greeted \nthem with rough seas, black skies, pounding rain, and fierce winds.\n  But when the flotilla stopped to lay wreaths and hold religious \nservices in memory of their fallen colleagues, the black clouds \ndisappeared. For a moment, the Sun came out and shone down on the boats \ngathered below, as if to smile upon their mission.\n  Mr. President, for the last 5 years, Brothers to the Rescue has been \na ray of light in the black clouds hovering over the Cuban people. If \nwe are to turn that ray of light into permanent sunshine, the United \nStates must salute their mission by making it our own.\n  I urge my colleagues to do that by supporting the Helms-Burton Cuba \nsanctions bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, increasingly an anachronism in the affairs \nof the world, Fidel Castro has burnished his credentials as the Western \nHemisphere's most vicious dictator. Unfortunately for the four downed \nBrothers-to-the-Rescue pilots and their families, and the members of \nConcilio Cubano, he has again turned to terrorism to assert his control \nover the Cuban people.\n  All of the overtures made by the Clinton administration, some Members \nof Congress and the business community have failed to pacify Fidel \nCastro. Only weeks ago he arrested more than 50 Cuban citizens in \nanticipation of a conference by the dissident coalition Concilio \nCubano. Apparently, Castro felt so threatened by a peaceful assembly of \nfree Cubans that he disregarded the concern of the international \ncommunity. To his relief, the Concilio Cubano conference was canceled.\n  Determined to maintain control over the information and views to \nwhich his countrymen are exposed, Fidel also seeks to limit dissent \nfrom abroad. He has always been too weak to directly confront the \nUnited States and terminate our efforts to bring freedom to the people \nof Cuba. But Fidel Castro can no longer even muster the strength to \nterrorize our friends in Latin America. He has been reduced to lashing \nout at unarmed Americans guilty only of straying too close to his \nMarxist paradise.\n  Fidel Castro cannot have it both ways. He cannot cultivate a new \nrelationship with the United States and U.S. business and still run \nroughshod over the rights of his people. He is a member of a dwindling \ncircle of friends. Fidel still believes in building a utopian socialist \nsociety. A fraudulent nationalist, he believes his people incapable of \nthe exercise in self-government we have witnessed from Haiti to Russia. \nFine--he can believe what he wants to. But he should not expect to have \nhis egomaniacal dreams of totalitarianism and socialism subsidized by \nAmericans.\n  This is why I support the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \nAct. It makes the choice for Cuba clear.\n  The bill codifies the existing embargo of Cuba. Many of the actions \ntaken in response to Fidel's outrages, including President Clinton's \nrecent response, have been done by Executive order. By including them \nin this bill, we have ensured that they will not be overturned without \na genuine democratic transition in Cuba.\n  The bill also builds on the current embargo in important ways. It \nattempts to freeze foreign investment in Cuba by denying United States \nvisas to those who improve on investments in confiscated property; by \ngiving, with the approval of the President, United States citizens the \nright to sue those who invest in confiscated property; and by barring \nCuba from international financial institutions.\n  The bill also restricts assistance to Russia in proportion to the \nassistance Russia offers Cuba. This is an especially important \nprovision. It is high time that we make a concerted attempt to enlist \nthe support of our allies and friends in the efforts to end the Castro \ndictatorship.\n  The bill provides for a lifting of the embargo in response to \ndemocratic change in Cuba.\n  Castro has a choice. He can continue to isolate his nation, or by \nallowing his people to exercise their God-given rights, he can bring \nhis nation the benefits of a relationship with the United States.\n  I do not know how long it will take before the pressure of the \ntightened embargo has its intended effect. It may still be years away. \nI do know, however, that one day democracy will come to Cuba, and that \nin the meantime, Americans should do everything in their power to \nwithhold support from a government that so thoroughly denies its people \ntheir basic rights. I believe the bill before us does that.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will keep my remarks brief, as I know \nthere are so many of my colleagues who wish to add their voices in \nsupport of this conference report. As a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and as an original cosponsor and conferee on this landmark \nlegislation, I rise in the strongest possible support for the Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act.\n  Before going further, I would like to join so many other Americans in \nexpressing personal outrage at the most\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nrecent crimes of the Castro regime. Just 11 days ago, Cuban dictator \nFidel Castro ordered the shooting down of two unarmed civilian small \nplanes over international waters, murdering four American citizens. I \nextend my deepest sympathy to the victims' families. They deserve \njustice for Castro's murderous, tyrannical act, and this legislation is \na first step in process.\n  For 36 years, Castro has ruled Cuba with an iron, totalitarian hand. \nBut as he steadily impoverished and brutalized the Cuban people, his \nkey source of support came from massive subsidies from the old Soviet \nUnion. But since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, those subsidies \nhave ended, the ideological underpinnings of his tyranny have \nevaporated, and his regime has come under pressure as never before.\n  Castro has tried to compensate for the loss of Soviet aid by \ndeveloping a hard-currency tourist industry. To build that industry, he \nhas sold off at fire-sale prices confiscated American property to \nforeign companies for development. The purpose of this bill, among \nother things, is to deter these kind of actions by foreign companies \nwho may be tempted to invest in Castro's Cuba at the expense of \nuncompensated Americans.\n  This bill accomplishes that in two ways. In title IV it applies \nmandatory travel restrictions on top Cuban Government and foreign \nindividuals who participate in trafficking in confiscated American \nproperty. Permanent exclusion from the United States is a serious \nsanction that will give any multinational firm second thoughts about \ntaking possession of stolen U.S. property.\n  In title III, the bill permits American citizens to bring suit \nagainst foreign persons who traffic in their confiscated property in \nCuba. To obtain the administration's support for this bill, in \nconference we granted the President renewable 6-month waiver authority. \nBut this still achieves the main goal of this title by creating an \nenvironment of uncertainty that foreign firms will want to avoid.\n  All would-be foreign traffickers in confiscated United States \nproperty in Cuba will be put on notice that if they would always be \nwithin 6 months of having legal action taken against them in the United \nStates for their actions. And this presupposes that the President will \neven initially invoke his waiver authority, which in the current \nclimate is not, I believe, a foregone conclusion.\n  This bill also:\n  Calls for an international embargo against Cuba.\n  Prohibits any United States loans to foreign individuals who purchase \nUnited States-owned property confiscated by the Cuban government.\n  Requires the United States to vote against multilateral bank loans to \nCuba until the country has had a democratic election.\n  Disapproves of Russia's $200 million in loans to Cuba in exchange for \ncontinued access to intelligence-gathering facilities in Cuba.\n  Calls on the President to develop a plan for providing support to \nCuba during that country's transition to a democratically elected \ngovernment.\n  Also permits during the transition period Eximbank financing, \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation-supported investment projects, \nTrade and Development Agency assistance, counter-narcotics assistance, \nand Peace Corps assistance.\n  Fully terminates the United States trade embargo upon President's \ncertification of a democratic government in Cuba, and provides for \nextension of most-favored-nation status.\n  Mr. President, with Castro's regime facing its gravest crisis ever, \nit is important to understand that his decision to kill four innocent \nAmericans in cold blood is not an isolated act. This action came on the \nheels of yet another brutal crackdown on the Cuban people just the week \nbefore. From February 15 to 18, Castro ordered arrested 50 leaders of \nthe Concilio Cubano, an pro-democracy umbrella group similar to \nPoland's Solidarity movement.\n  The arrest was Castro's answer to their attempt to simply hold a \nmeeting to discuss the future of democracy in Cuba. Many of these pro-\ndemocracy leaders have already been convicted by the Castro regime, and \nhave joined the thousands of Cuban political prisoners that today \nlanguish in Cuba's gulags.\n  I would like to recognize the stalwart leadership of the sponsor of \nthis legislation and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Chairman Helms. I also congratulate the leadership \nof the chairman of our Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Senator \nCoverdell, who is managing this conference report today. Together, they \nhave been unswerving in their commitment to supporting the efforts of \nthe Cuban people to bring freedom and democracy to that long-troubled \nisland nation.\n  I would also note that in both the House and Senate this has long \nbeen a bipartisan cause, and I hope and expect that this conference \nreport will receive overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle. \nThe bipartisan nature of this bill is further demonstrated from the \nfact that last week, after Castro's brutal action against innocent \nAmericans, President Clinton himself gave his support to this \nlegislative initiative. Now, we will be able to move forward together \nto strengthen our Nation's resolve to see an end to 36 years of \ntotalitarian rule just 90 miles from our shores.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the efforts of all \nthose who worked on this bill over the past year. I urge my colleagues \nto join in supporting the conference report we will soon be adopting.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conferees on H.R. \n927, the ``Liberatad bill'' were able to reach an agreement with the \nadministration that will offer a tough, united response to the recent \ndestruction of two small planes and four American lives by Cuban MiG's. \nWhile I would have preferred a compromise which eliminated titles III \nand IV of the conference report, the agreement moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  I believe all of us are united in our desire to see a peaceful \ntransition to democracy in Cuba, Mr. President. The downing of the \nplanes heightened the concerns of many of us that we should take \nfurther steps to bring about this transition. There are many \ndifferences in how we reach our goal of a democratically elected \ngovernment in Cuba. While I supported the Senate version of the Helms-\nBurton legislation, I had some problems with the possible inclusion of \ntitles III and IV of the House bill in a conference agreement. \nFortunately, the conferees added waiver authority to enable the \nPresident to waive title III, and, in effect title IV, for national \nsecurity reasons or if necessary to promote a democratic transition.\n  Because election pressures may make a waiver difficult, I would like \nto remind my constituents what my concerns with titles III and IV are. \nIn my judgment, these titles will cause more harm to our own country \nthan to serve their intended purpose of limiting foreign investment in \nCuba and thereby exacerbating Cuba's economic problems, which would \nincrease pressures for a new government.\n  To remind my colleagues, there was concern about titles III and IV in \nthe Senate, and neither of these titles was included in the Senate \nversion of the bill. Modified versions of both titles are included in \nthe conference report, along with the waiver authority.\n  My primary concern with title III is its extraterritorial reach. I \nhave concerns with laws which attempt to impose our own laws and \nstandards on other countries that they face costly lawsuits if they \nseek to invest in Cuba on properties which ownership 37 years ago may \nbe difficult to verify, is unwise, in my judgment. This kind of U.S. \nattempt to infringe on the sovereignty of other nations should concern \nus.\n  Some of our allies have communicated to us that they do not view \ntheir investment in Cuba any differently than our own efforts to invest \nin Vietnam or China, which also could be on disputed properties. It is \npossible that one or more of these countries could reciprocate against \nus in the future, in injuring United States companies and jobs.\n  While I sympathize with anyone who has had property confiscated in \nany country, I believe the foreign claims settlement process is the \nright way to pursue property claims for United States citizens. There \nare many certified claimants now eligible for claims against the Cuban \nGovernment for confiscated properties, which will be pursued once a \ntransition has occurred in\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nCuba. This bill was designed to help Cuban-Americans, who were not \nUnited States citizens at the time of the takeover, receive similar \nbenefits through the courts. Now, those citizens would have the right \nto pursue their claims in Cuba once a transition occurs, which would be \na parallel effort to that of our own certified claimants. Title III \nwould provide a private right of action in Federal courts to all United \nStates citizens, including the Cuban-Americans who were not citizens at \nthe time of confiscation. This is a radical departure to our \ntraditional use of the courts and is contrary to international law. \nDespite efforts to narrow this right of action, this change will create \na precedent in our courts that would allow this right to be extended to \nnaturalized citizens of over 85 countries where we have had similar \nproperty disputes. This would result in a flood of lawsuits at a time \nwe are striving for tort reform.\n\n  One inconsistency in title III is that only properties valued over \n$50,000 at the time of confiscation can be involved in the lawsuits. I \nam not sure how this would accomplish the bill's authors' goal of \nlimiting foreign investment in Cuba. And again, despite this attempt to \nlimit the right of action, I still believe a court precedent is created \nfor an expanded right of action in the future.\n  The language which would terminate the right of action for new cases \nonce a democratically elected government is in power combined with the \nPresident's current authority under the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act to nullify any claims and judgments against the \nCuban Government after a transition also concerns me. This sounds \nattractive, but many legal experts have concluded that these citizens \nwould have private property rights under the takings clause of the \nfifth amendment. So what will happen is that Cuba won't have to pay any \njudgments--the United States taxpayers will pay. They will pay treble \ndamages for property confiscated from people who weren't citizens at \nthe time. United States citizens who were certified claimants for years \nwill be only partially reimbursed from funds negotiated from the new \nCuban Government.\n  Title IV forces the President to restrict visas for any foreigner who \ntraffics in any property under dispute. Fortunately, this language was \nmade prospective, for new investments. Further, it would not kick in if \ntitle III is waived. It is further limited since visas are not \ncurrently required for residents of all countries which may be subject \nto this restriction in the future. However, this title could affect \nmultinationals with thousands of employees globally in the future, most \nof whom would have had nothing to do with decisions to invest in Cuba. \nIn a global economy it could be counterproductive to limit this type of \naccess.\n  Mr. President, I support this conference report but hope that the \nPresident will exercise his authority to waive title III.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of \nthe Cuban Libertad Act.\n  We were all troubled by the announcements that two civilian aircraft \nbelonging to the Brothers to the Rescue, Organization had been shot \ndown by a Cuban MiG-29. However, this event, described by the President \nand other world leaders as ``abominable'' and ``abhorrent,'' was not an \nisolated incident. Rather, it was the most recent act of aggression \nperpetrated by Castro's tyrannical regime.\n  In the last few years, the Castro government has taken a hard-line \nposition and has continued to tighten the crackdown on dissent, \narrested human rights activists, and staged demonstrations against \ntheir regime's critics.\n  Mr. President, the harassment, intimidation, and beatings of \nactivists was well documented.\n  Dissidents and political prisoners were routinely subjected to a \nvariety of actions. For example, sleep deprivation in prisons was used \nto coerce statements from inmates. In addition, prison conditions were \ncharacterized by habitual beatings, severe overcrowding and a lack of \nfood, and medical care.\n  Arbitrary arrests, detention, and exile are routine methods of \ndiscouraging dissidents from speaking out against the Government. \nFreedom of expression is severely restricted. One person was arrested \nfor wearing at t-shirt which said, ``Abaja Fidel,'' which means ``Down \nWith Fidel.'' This individual was taken to a police station, beaten and \nheld incommunicado for 8 days. He was finally tried and sentenced to \nprison for 6 months.\n  Mr. President, 1994 was also a period of tyranny on the high seas. In \nApril and July of that year, the Cuban Government was implicated in the \nsinking of two vessels which resulted in the deaths of a number of \npeople, including children.\n  President Clinton has referred to the attack in the press as, ``An \nappalling reminder of the nature of the Cuban regime: repressive, \nviolent, scornful of international law.''\n  I couldn't agree with him more. It is another action taken by Castro \nthat shows nothing but disregard for human life, let alone \ninternational law, norms, and values.\n  This action requires more than just a rhetorical response. Therefore, \nI am pleased that we will be voting today on the conference report to \nthe Cuban Libertad Act, or Helms-Burton Act, as it has been referred to \nin press accounts.\n  President Clinton announced a series of actions he proposed in \nresponse to this unwarranted attack. These included; ensuring that the \nfamilies of the pilots are compensated; imposing restrictions on Cuban \nnationals traveling in the United States; suspending United States \ncharter flights into Cuba; and, passing the Helms-Burton Act.\n  This bill includes a number of provisions which would: strengthen \ninternational sanctions against the Castro Government in Cuba; develop \na plan to support a transition government leading to a democratically \nelected government in Cuba; and enact provisions addressing the \nunauthorized use of United States-citizen-owned property confiscated by \nthe Castro government.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that President Clinton has committed to \nsupport and sign this legislation.\n  Mr. President, some Senators and Members have concerns about the \nramifications of this legislation. I respect those concerns and am \npleased that the sponsors of the legislation have done such an \nexcellent job of working on addressing some of those concerns. \nCertainly, some concerns that I had with respect to certified claimants \nunder title III have been addressed. I appreciate the efforts of \nChairman Helms, and his staff.\n  In closing, I would just reiterate that this bill is a response to \nfar more than the recent attack on civilian aircraft. It is a response \nto the continued aggression of Castro's regime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are again debating U.S. foreign \npolicy toward the Communist regime of Fidel Castro. We are here to \nstrengthen the policy that the majority of both parties have supported \nfor over 30 years.\n  And, we are here to show that as long as Mr. Castro and his brutal \nregime remain, he shall see no easing of that policy.\n  That policy has been one of economic containment and diplomatic \nisolation. That policy has worked. It has isolated a brutal regime and \nrestrained its ability to undermine stability around the world.\n  Unfortunately, this policy has not forced Castro from power, nor \neliminated his ability to cause mayhem about the world. Castro was \nstill able to send his forces to Angola, prolonging that war as a \npayback to Castro's Soviet masters. Our containment policy did not \nprevent Castro's henchmen from conspiring with Latin American drug \nbosses to smuggle cocaine poison into our country. And, our policy did \nnot prevent Castro from shooting down two unarmed airplanes in \ninternational airspace last week, killing four American citizens.\n  But, Castro's behavior should never surprise us. His regime is built \non oppression; his currency is flagrant disrespect for basic human \nrights.\n  Now that Fidel Castro's tab at the Moscow cafe has been closed, we \nsee how desperately his regime is to survive. Without rubles and oil, \nthe dictator of Havana stands without the slightest shred of a \nfunctionary economy. Without his Soviet sponsors, Emperor Castro has no \nclothes. Our embargo has ensured that the United States has not in any \nway participated in granting a figleaf of legitimacy to the aging \nstrongman.\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\n  I say let us strengthen our embargo. If Castro wishes to use foreign \ninvestment to replace the rubles from his Communist masters, let us at \nleast ensure that the firms that would succor the Castro regime do not \ndo so with property stolen from U.S. citizens. Foreign investors are \nfree to take the place of the Kremlin powerbrokers, but they cannot \ntrade in stolen property without consequence.\n  In recent years, the debate over U.S. policy toward the autocratic \nCastro regime and, in particular, the debate over maintaining the \nembargo have included the introduction of two arguments.\n  One argument suggests that, now that we are in a post-cold-war world, \nwe need not maintain a cold war policy toward Cuba.\n  A second argument we have heard suggests that if we can engage \nauthoritarian states like China and Vietnam, we should be able to \nengage in the Cuban regime.\n  Regarding the first argument, we are constantly reminded that we now \nlive in the post-cold-war world. In this new world, we are told, we \nneed to revisit so many of the crises and flashpoints that we saw \nthrough the bipolar lens of cold war competition.\n  Derivative of this approach is the notion that we must learn to give \nup our neuralgic distaste for the few remaining Communist regimes, and \nwe must recognize that the basic security and political notions of the \ncold war no longer provide the touchstones for U.S. policy. A specific \npoint of this rationale is that our Cuba policy must no longer be \ncontainment.\n  The problem with this argument is simple: The cold war may be over, \nbut Fidel Castro still rules. While I admit that the Cuban regime is a \ncold war anachronism, which certainly belongs on the scrap heap of \nhistory, the harsh political reality is that Castro and his secret \npolice remain as the dictatorship of Cuba.\n  With the conclusion of the cold war, we saw the end of our global \ncompetition with Communist states and the collapse of totalitarian \nregimes before the popular will of newly freed peoples.\n  Throughout Central Europe, the withdrawal of Soviet support combined \nwith the decay of Communist client governments. Faced with the \nuprisings of the people demanding freedom, the dictators fled and \nfreedom won the day. The result was the transformation of a part of \nEurope that had been frozen in time and oppression for nearly 50 years.\n  The United States welcomed these nations to the democratic fold, for \nwe were no longer threatened by their hostile diplomatic postures, \ntheir support for terrorists, and their dedication to undermining \ndemocracies around the world.\n  But the end of the cold war brought no popular revolution to Cuba. \nCastro denounced the last Soviet leaders as having failed the Communist \ncatechism. The evaporation of Soviet subsidies brought more misery for \nthe Cuban people, and Castro, no doubt thinking more of Ceausescu than \nof Havel, clamped down even more. Human rights have not improved in \nCuba.\n  No talk about looking at Cuba from a post-cold-war perspective will \nchange this dismal fact. The Cuban people are not free. They are not \nfree to choose their own government; they do not have an independent \njudiciary; they cannot work in a free economy. They are never free from \ntheir political jailers. Those brave ones who dare attempt political \ndiscourse continue to be harassed and jailed by Castro's police, as we \nsaw 2 weeks ago when dozens of members of Concillio Cubano \nwere arrested, interrogated, and jailed.\n\n  The second argument suggests that if we can engage China and Vietnam, \nunder the hope of moderating and influencing their policies, we can do \nthe same for Cuba.\n  I am not sympathetic to the analogy with Vietnam, mostly because I am \nnot sympathetic to opening relations with Vietnam.\n  I believe that Vietnam had much more to gain from recognition by the \nUnited States than we did, and that, as a result, we should have been \nable to extract more concessions before we granted the valuable \ndiplomatic asset of recognition. For recognition from Washington, we \nshould have gained from Hanoi more openness on the POW-MIA issue, and \nmore concessions on human rights.\n  It's clear the authorities in Hanoi recognized that they were getting \naway with a lot: Less than a month after recognition, they jailed a \nhandful of elderly Buddhist monks. We recognized their dictatorship, \nand the jailers kept jailing. In all the debate over Vietnam, I never \nheard adequate reasoning for why we should, at this time, open our \nEmbassy there. So, from my perspective, Vietnam hardly justifies as a \nreason to adjust our Cuba policy.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe we can compare countries. Cuba is not \nChina, which has the world's largest population, a booming economy, a \npredominant position in Asia, and a nuclear arsenal. Global foreign \npolicy for this country must take into account this Asian giant, and \nUnited States national security must account for the role of China.\n  Cuba has 11 million people, a supine economy, and has become largely \nirrelevant in Latin America. With no Communist sponsors, it no longer \nprovides a major security threat.\n  While I don't believe it can threaten stability in the region--unless \nCastro unleashes another wage of refugees--we have seen that the regime \nis a threat to international civility. When MiG's are dispatched to \nshoot down Cessnas, you know that the regime is showing its true \ncolors, and those are not the colors of a civilized nation.\n  Mr. President, containing the Castro regime has worked. We must \nremain vigilant rather than provide sustenance. We must tighten the \nembargo, rather than engage in the ``Lax Americana'' policies of \nPresident Clinton.\n  Mr. President, this bill addresses the role the United States will \nplay during the transition from the Castro dictatorship. In this \nmanner, this legislation provides some forward thinking that I believe \nwas lacking in some of our policies conducted during the cold war. This \nbill looks to a post-Castro regime, and outlines our responsibility to \nprepare for the inevitable.\n  It is one of the many paradoxes of a current historical myopia that \nmany view the cold war from simply a security perspective. The result \nis that we hear the reasoning that says, ``now that we defeated the \nSoviet Union, we need not concern ourselves with an island run by a \nbunch of ragged and increasingly isolated Communists.''\n  But, the cold war was not just fought for security reasons alone. It \nwas fought over ideals: the ideals of humankind's right to liberty, to \ndemocratic government and to freedom from oppression. These are the \nfruits that many of the formerly captive nations of Central Europe now \nenjoy; these are the fruits denied to captive citizens of Castro.\n  But, in Castro's Cuba, the instruments of oppression remain. And, \nthis is why this body now debates the merits of the bill presented by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, which \nstands for continuing a firm and resolute policy toward the dictator \nCastro.\n  And, this is why, today, I believe that we should declare that we \nstand for a policy that recognizes that the Cuban dictatorship remains \nin place, and that this brutal reality demands of us that we remain \nvigilant in our opposition to the Castro regime, determined to outlast \nit, and dedicated to help the Cuban people when the dictatorship falls.\n  Because fall it will, as so many of those rusted and despised statues \ndedicated to Communists ideals fell all over Central Europe and the \nnewly independent states when the victors of the cold war were finally \nfreed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Libertad bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we consider this conference report less \nthan 2 weeks after a tragic day for the cause of democracy in Cuba. On \nFebruary 24, Fidel Castro's brutal regime shot down two unarmed \nAmerican aircraft belonging to Brothers to the Rescue who were flying \nover international waters.\n  This unprovoked ambush was a gross violation of international law and \nan affront to standards of human decency. It was a cowardly attack, \ndemonstrating clearly that Fidel Castro will resort to any means--no \nmatter how vile and repugnant--to hold on to power.\n  I was appalled by this despicable incident and I would gladly vote \nfor legislation that directly addresses this attack as well as \nlegislation that would\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nfoster the democratization of Cuba. Unfortunately, the bill before us \ntoday will not carry out those objectives.\n  The conference report would deny a United States travel visa to \nanyone with a stake in certain companies that do business in Cuba. This \nprovision threatens to seriously damage relations with many of our \nclosest allies, including Canada, whose citizens could be denied entry \ninto the United States.\n  The measure creates a new cause of action in U.S. courts allowing \ncitizens to sue any foreign national who traffics in confiscated Cuban \nproperty. This alone could result in a huge logjam in our Federal \ncourts. But by establishing an arbitrary $50,000 claim threshold, the \nlegislation denies legal recourse to many Americans whose homes or \nshops were confiscated by the Castro regime. There is no logical \njustification for this discriminatory treatment. It winds up helping \nthe wealthiest and hurting middle-class Americans. It makes sense to \nadopt measures to punish Fidel Castro and his thugs for their \nreprehensible action. It makes no sense, however, to do so in a way \nthat will hurt many Americans and punish our best allies.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \nexpress my opposition to the legislation currently under consideration. \nWhile the Helms-Burton legislation seeks to hasten the end of the \nCastro regime in Cuba--a goal that is shared by every Member of this \nbody--I am concerned that it will in fact do more to damage our larger \nforeign policy goals than bring about a democratically elected \ngovernment in Cuba.\n  The shootdown by the Cuban military of two unarmed United States \ncivilian aircraft engaged in humanitarian activities in international \nairspace is reprehensible. This clear violation of international law \nrequired a strong U.S. response--a response which was delivered by the \nClinton administration immediately following the attack. Charter \nflights between the United States and Cuba were suspended, steps were \ntaken to compensate the victims' families from Cuban assets frozen in \nthe United States, and the United States led a successful campaign in \nthe U.N. Security Council to strongly deplore the unprovoked attack on \nthese unarmed aircraft.\n  Mr. President, there is now great pressure for those of us in the \nSenate to voice our distaste for the Castro regime by passing the \nHelms-Burton legislation. I will vote against this bill, not because I \nam opposed to trying to tighten sanctions on Castro's Government, but \nbecause I believe that provisions of the Helms-Burton bill would have a \ndetrimental effect on relations with our closest allies.\n  Last fall, I voted in favor of the Senate version of this bill which, \nin my opinion, represented a bipartisan approach to strengthening \neconomic sanctions on Cuba. The Senate bill included provisions which \nsought to include the international community in our efforts to ratchet \ndown the pressure on the Castro regime while holding out the promise of \nUnited States assistance to a post-Castro Cuban Government striving to \nachieve democratic, free-market reforms in Cuba. I still support this \napproach, and believe our policy should continue to move in this \ndirection. However, the bill that we have before us today includes \nprovisions not in the version that passed the Senate. Titles III and IV \nof Helms-Burton will open the floodgates to new lawsuits in U.S. courts \nand will put us in an adversarial position in our relations with our \nallies throughout the world.\n  Provisions of title III and IV which give United States citizens the \nright to sue foreign companies that operate in Cuba are viewed by our \nallies as an attempt by the United States to act unilaterally to \ndictate to them a Cuba policy. This will undoubtedly lead to resentment \nand resistance to future United States policy efforts in connection \nwith Cuba. Rather than alienating our allies, our policies toward Cuba \nshould seek to be inclusive.\n  It is far too easy to vote in favor of Helms-Burton as an emotional \nresponse to Castro's unlawful shootdown of United States civilian \naircraft, but to do so would ignore the negative impact this \nlegislation will have on our foreign policy objectives both in Cuba and \nin a larger sense. Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to \nseparate our current anger at the Castro Government from these \nproceedings. I say this not to minimize the gravity of Cuba's actions, \nnor would I necessarily rule out further action against Castro, but \nrather because I believe that the legislation before us will hurt our \nability to exact change in Cuba. By straining our relations with our \nclosest allies, it is my fear that we will further isolate ourselves \nfrom the international community on this issue, and that in the future \nwe will be unable to work on a multilateral basis to bring about a \ndemocratic Cuba.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by urging my colleagues to fully consider \ntheir vote today in the larger context of how this legislation will \naffect U.S. foreign policy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on February 24, the Cuban regime shot \ndown and killed four men, American citizens, apparently flying over \ninternational waters, off the coast of Cuba. No matter how one judges \nthe intent of these four Brothers to the Rescue--and some have pointed \nout that in the past Brothers to the Rescue violated Cuban airspace and \nwent so far as to overfly Havana and drop anti-Castro leaflets over the \nCuban capital--the fact is that they were flying in small, unarmed \ncivilian aircraft. They certainly did not represent a real, physical \nthreat to Cuban security. But the Castro government--no respecter of \nhuman rights, of international law, or of common decency--had its MiG \nfighters shoot down those two defenseless Cessnas. I join my \ncolleagues, the U.S. Government, and the international community in \ndeploring this act of brutality.\n  As appalling as this act was, Mr. President, it should not surprise \nus. Castro is a dictator who, for 37 years, has ruthlessly trampled on \nthe rights of the Cuban people. The State Department and all reputable \nhuman rights organizations point to the routine use of torture, \nbeatings, economic coercion, and suppression of legitimate protest by \nthe Castro regime.\n  Only 2 weeks ago, a small pro-democracy group, the Concilio Cubano, \nwas prevented from holding a meeting and two of its members were \nsummarily thrown into prison after kangaroo court proceedings. That \nCastro would have his military lash out callously and viciously at a \nperceived threat, then, is pretty much what we could expect.\n  What surprises me, Mr. President, is how a small, poor island like \nCuba continues to elicit the most knee-jerk response from Washington. \nCertainly, the administration did the right thing in seeking an \ninternational condemnation of these intentional murders. I also support \nPresident Clinton's order requiring restitution by the Cuban \nGovernment--drawing on frozen Cuban assets--for the families of the \nvictims, and the increased use of Radio Marti--and notably not that \nproven failure, TV Marti--to bring uncensored news and information to \nthe Cuban people. The rush to punish, however, must stop at that point \nwhere ill-considered policies undermine U.S. national interest, or lead \nto a misguided and ineffective policy altogether. That's what this bill \ndid before the shootdown, and what it's going to do regardless of the \nshootdown.\n  In seeking to pound the final nail in Castro's coffin, H.R. 927 \nmisses its target, causing pain for all but Castro. Very briefly, allow \nme to enumerate the most obvious flaws:\n  Title I instructs the President to seek a mandatory international \nembargo against Cuba. This is untenable: The United States is regularly \noutvoted at the United Nations by margins along the lines of 140 to 2 \nwhen we seek to defend our unilateral trade embargo. It is all the less \nlikely to pass given that our closest allies object vociferously to the \nother provisions of this bill.\n  Title I also requires the President to make it clear to the Cuban \nGovernment that:\n\n       The completion and operation of any nuclear power facility, \n     or b) further political manipulation of the desire of Cubans \n     to escape that results in mass migration to the United \n     States, will be considered an act of aggression which will be \n     met with an appropriate response. . . .\n\n  What does this mean? Are we threatening, in fact, to bomb or disable \na nuclear energy facility in Cuba? I should hope not, and suggesting it \nas a policy undermines U.S. credibility.\n  Another fault of the bill is section 102, which codifies the trade \nembargo\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nas law. By this provision, Congress deprives the executive branch of \nthe right to modify, ease or even strengthen the embargo. It would \nrestrict the President's ability to react quickly to events within Cuba \nor on the international scene as related to Cuba. Mr. President, I am a \nstrong supporter of the Congress' constitutional prerogative to advise \nand consult closely with the White House on matters of foreign policy. \nBut I do not support leaving Congress alone to legislate United States \nforeign policy, and in fact fear that we do a disservice to the country \nif we try.\n  With title III, Mr. President, the bill steps beyond domestic \npolitics and into offending accepted norms of international law. This \nsection, which grants to persons, including those not U.S. citizens at \nthe time of the alleged taking, a cause of action in U.S. Federal court \nagainst individuals and foreign entities trafficking in expropriated \nCuban properties. This procedure not only threatens to clog U.S. \ncourts, but also defies logic. Their cause of action is rightfully in \nsome, future, Cuban court, not the United States judiciary.\n  Furthermore, contrary to the assertions of supporters of this bill, \nan international claims settlement procedure already provides an \neffective mechanism for asserting claims, which is why most certified \nclaimants oppose this bill. Moreover, this provision will not benefit \nthe little guy who lost property in Cuba, since there is a threshold \nlevel of $50,000 in controversy, a tremendous amount in 1959 Cuba. \nFurther, to mollify critics, a filing fee of perhaps $4,500 will be \nimposed. Of course, very few beyond corporate interests can afford to \npursue such a costly litigation.\n  If that was not bad enough, title IV of this conference report takes \nthe extraordinary step of mandating the exclusion from the United \nStates of third-party nationals who traffic in such property. Canadian \nand European business executives, and their governments, are \nunderstandably upset at the prospect of their citizens being kept out \nof the United States because they do business with Cuba. There is an \ninternational consensus that countries such as Iran pose a threat to \nglobal stability, and therefore travel by its officials should be \nlimited. But people doing business in Cuba are not threats to our \nsecurity, and accordingly should not categorically be denied access to \nthe United States. Of course, most of our allies don't need visas and \nwill enter anyway, undermining the force of the statute. But it looks \ntough --and is more or less pointless.\n  Mr. President, this bill's myopic focus on Cuba is one that I find \nparticularly disturbing. Cuba is not significant on the world scene; \nwhatever geostrategic threat it may have posed disappeared 5 years ago, \na fact our own military acknowledges.\n  In China, by comparison, we find a country bordering on superpower \nstatus. The Chinese Government regularly takes steps which threaten \ninternational security in fact: Nuclear equipment sales to Pakistan; \nsaber-rattling across the Taiwan strait; human rights violations on a \nvery brutal scale. China's policies on intellectual property even \nviolate major United States financial interests. Why are we not \nimposing sanctions on China? Sadly, I know that a bill proposing the \nsame sanctions on China that we are today imposing against Cuba would \nfail--indicating that to the United States Congress fossilized cold war \nfantasies are more powerful than the real national security goals of \n1996.\n  Mr. President, Cuba is a pariah. Certainly we as a nation have the \nright to limit our relations, economic and otherwise. Although some \nmight note that after 35 years of embargo, Castro remains entrenched \nand that the policy needs careful review, I am not advocating a \nloosening of the embargo. That cannot take place absent an improvement \nin the atrocious human rights situation in Cuba. But I think we should \nbe consistent in our foreign policy. If we sanction Cuba, then why not \nthose current and former Communists--including those which are actual \nthreats to international security, such as China, or with whom we met \nin battle at the cost of 55,000 United States soldiers, such as \nVietnam? If we choose, instead, to engage such countries in dialog and \nwith economic relations to effect change, then why not Cuba?\n  Instead, we shoot ourselves in the foot. This bill will not topple \nCastro; it will only give him cause to tighten his grip in the face of \nthe Yanqui threat. It increases our isolation internationally and \nhobbles our ability to influence events in Cuba in a positive manner. \nIt is an expensive resolution which will bring United States-Cuba \npolitics into our courts. Helms-Burton damages the United States \nnational interest and hurts innocent Cubans and I will vote against it.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we consider instituting the provisions of \ntitle III of the Cuban Sanctions Act, I am troubled that in a rush to \nexact retribution for the heinous act of shooting down United States \nunarmed civil light aircraft by Cuban MiG fighters, we will accomplish \nnothing more than antagonizing our worldwide trading partners.\n  First, monetary restrictions and filing procedures currently in the \nlanguage, prevent compensation to by the vast majority of Cuban exiles \nand benefit only large business concerns which look to use the offices \nof the U.S. Government to practice international tort law through \nlegislation. This course of action can only lead to the muddying of the \nlegal trade policies and agreements which we have long supported.\n  Second, though we are unarguably the leader in free trade throughout \nthe world, this action will isolate us from our loyal and historic \ntrading partners. Even as we contemplate this drastic course of action, \nour trading partners have vociferously objected to its long-term \nramifications. Some of our closest allies are considering equally \nharmful measures in response and you know that once we start down this \ntype of road, it will be extremely difficult to halt until an economic \ndisaster occurs.\n  Third, the further starving of the Cuban people in an attempt to \nforce a change in their government is not the way to promote a \ndemocratic movement. In order to win the hearts and minds of a \nsubjugated people one doesn't beat them even more. We want to see them \nchange their government from within and view us as a benefactor and not \nas a martinet.\n  I too, want the Cuban Government to change. I too, want the Cuban \nGovernment to bear full responsibility and consequence for their \ntotally unwarranted and illegal actions. I don't believe that \nunilaterally attacking world wide trading policies and harming our \nrelationships with our allies and partners is the way to do it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I must strongly condemn the Cuban \nGovernment for its gross violation of international law in shooting \ndown two small, unarmed civilian aircraft last Saturday, resulting in \nthe presumed loss of four American lives. This was a cowardly, cold-\nblooded act by Cuban authorities. There is no excuse for this violent \nact and no explanation that Cuba can offer which justifies such blatant \ndisregard for international norms.\n  I must note that Cuba's action on Saturday came on the very date that \nthe Cuban Council, an alliance of human rights and dissident groups, \nhad asked to hold a first-ever conference of such groups in Cuba. \nBeginning on February 15, the Cuban Government responded to the \ncouncil's request, a request made in accordance with Cuba's \nConstitution, by retaining and arresting more than 50 people active in \nthe council. I must also strongly condemn the Cuban Government of Fidel \nCastro for this crackdown.\n  By these actions, the Cuban Government has once again demonstrated \nits fundamental disregard for internationally recognized humanitarian \nnorms. These actions also sadden me because they have extinguished \nsummarily the pin-pricks of light which were beginning to show, for the \nfirst time in many, many years, in our relations with Cuba. Recently, \nthere had been an increased number of exchanges and visits, activities \nwhich I continue to believe are crucial to creating space for a \ndemocratic change in Cuba.\n  The legislation before the Senate today, however, is not an \nappropriate, or even a relevant, response. As I noted during our \nconsideration of this bill last October, instead of promoting \ndemocratic change in Cuba, this legislation, namely title III, creates \na potential windfall for a small group of people at the expense of the \ngreater interests of the United States. This bill alienates major \nallies and trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, and\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nFrance, with its clear extra-territorial application. Further, the \neffects of this legislation risk destabilizing Cuba to the point where \nwe could face another exodus of boat people. We must ask ourselves: Are \nwe ready to deal with such a crisis anew in order to serve the \ninterests of a deep-pocketed few? I say we are not. The Presidential \nwaiver provision for title III is not enough to overcome my deep \nreservations. This bill also carries with it a high human cost and I \nshould note that the Cuban-American community is far from monolithic in \nits support for this bill.\n  I am also deeply concerned by this bill's codification of the \nExecutive orders and regulations that implement the existing embargo. \nIn spite of Cuba's recent actions, codifying the embargo takes us in \nthe wrong direction, making our eventual and necessary rapprochement \nall the more difficult. I also believe that a mandatory visa ban on \nofficers and majority shareholders companies which are trafficking in \nsuch properties is an unnecessarily petty provision. I will vote \nagainst this legislation.\n\n\n        draconian helms-burton cuba sanctions bill goes too far\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today we will be voting on legislation \nto codify permanently some of the most far-reaching, harshest economic \nand political sanctions the United States has ever imposed by law upon \nanother country. While I support the goal of pressing Cuba toward \ndemocratic rule, this bill is not the way to get there.\n  Let me be clear: Cuba's recent shocking attack against unarmed \ncivilian aircraft, apparently in international waters, was an \noutrageous breach of international law, even considering the unwise \nacts of the Cuban-American pilots who had been consistently warned of \nthe dangers. This action, and Cuba's detention of members of the Cuban \nCouncil--journalists, human rights activists, and others--has been met \nwith widespread condemnation, both here and abroad. Cuba must respect \ninternational aviation law, internationally recognized human rights, \nand democratic freedoms if it is to reenter the community of nations.\n  The President has responded with a series of firm economic and \npolitical steps, unilaterally and multilaterally. This bill simply \npiles on, in a way that I don't believe is in U.S. long-term interests. \nI know that in the wake of the air tragedy, it will pass by \noverwhelming margins in both Houses, and will be signed by President \nClinton, despite his earlier strenuous opposition. While there are \nelements of the bill which I support, including its authorization of \nassistance to democratic organizations, human rights groups, and \ninternational observers, as a whole it embodies a fundamentally flawed \npolicy.\n  It's true that the people of Cuba have for too long been denied basic \npolitical rights, including the right to speak freely, to criticize \ntheir Government, and to associate with one another as they wish. And \nfor too long, Cubans have been unable to improve their standard of \nliving through much-needed economic reforms. I would of course support \nand vote for legislation if I thought it would achieve that goal.\n  But unfortunately that's not the case. Instead we have before us the \nso-called Helms-Burton legislation, and we have to decide if it is \nlikely to move us toward the twin goals of greater economic opportunity \nand greater political freedom in Cuba. Unfortunately, the answer, I \nbelieve, is no. So while I share the goal of my colleagues who support \nthis bill--a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba--I do not believe \nthis bill will get us to that goal. There are several major areas of \nconcern that I want to focus on.\n  First, as I observed, I fear that the burden of harsh sanctions often \nfalls on innocent Cubans, not on the Government or on elites. Its \nprovisions to enact into law prohibitions on families in the United \nStates sending any significant funds to their own family members in \nCuba, to all but cut off travel between the United States and Cuba so \nfamily members can at least visit one another, and to prohibit \ninvestments in open telephone communication between the United States \nand Cuba are especially unfair and counterproductive.\n  Its provision to place in law a prohibition on sales of food and \nmedicines to Cuba--even to nongovernmental organizations, like churches \nor relief groups--is wrong, and likely to do further real harm to those \nwhom proponents claim most to want to help. As is so often the case \nwhen ideology presses all other considerations into the background, the \nreality of people's lives--those innocent Cubans who will be most \ndirectly affected, and who struggle to maintain their families under \nCuba's repressive government--is dismissed as inconsequential.\n  Second, I do not believe it is in our national political or economic \ninterest to codify into law, and then tighten, this already harsh U.S. \nembargo. I will offer a few examples later of the reasons why, \nincluding my concerns, as one who represents a State which borders \nCanada, about its impact on United States-Canada relations, on \nMinnesota firms which do business with our Canadian neighbors.\n  Third, even if it were judged to be in our interest, I don't believe \nit will have the desired effect on Fidel Castro's government that its \nproponents intend. In fact, it could backfire on us, prompting Castro \nto become more repressive, and worsening social and political tensions \nthere which could in turn lead to violence, and another major outflow \nof refugees to the United States. It was not long ago we had thousands \nof Cubans coming across the Florida Straits in leaky boats, who were \nstopped and then held at Guantanamo Naval Base for many months, at a \ncost of millions of dollars. Is that what Americans want to see again? \nI don't think so. But that very well could happen.\n  Ultimately, additional harsh sanctions could undermine, not bolster, \nopposition-backed hopes for political and economic liberalization there \nby enabling Fidel Castro to play the nationalist card, using the U.S. \nsanctions as a rationale for tightening his grip on power. We have seen \nin Russia, Vietnam, Eastern Europe, and to some degree even in China \nthat the process of political and economic reform in these places has \nbeen accelerated by a more open exchange of ideas, people, information, \ntechnology, and other goods and services--not by increasing the \nisolation of these people from the outside world.\n  North Korea is a good example of what happens when we isolate \nCommunist states; a disaster for United States policy. In Cuba, as \nelsewhere, ensuring an open flow of Western, democratic ideas, \ninformation, and technology could be critical to helping to transform \nthose societies. This bill flies in the face of almost all of our \nrecent positive experience in helping to transform collapsing Communist \nstates around the world.\n  The bill could also prompt our allies and trading partners to \nretaliate, putting limits on U.S. firms which trade abroad, and \neliminating the good-paying U.S. jobs that depend on such trade. Many \nare already voicing loud complaint, and some have threatened such \nretaliation. Over 50 countries now have substantial business interests \nin Cuba. Should we refuse visas to businesspeople--and their families--\nfrom Britain, France, Germany, Japan, or other of our trading partners \nwho want to do business and create jobs within the United States, if \nthey hold an interest in a Cuban business? Under this bill, in many \ncases we would have to do just that.\n  Americans expect a tough, firm response to Cuba's recent actions. But \nthey also expect common sense, something which has been in short supply \nin America's policy approach to Cuba for a long time. Usually, if a \npolicy doesn't work, you try something else. United States-Cuba policy, \nlike the shop-worn Communist policies of the Cuban Government itself, \nhas been frozen in ideological amber for too long, driven as much by \ndomestic political concerns as by responsible foreign policy.\n  Let me offer a few examples that I think highlight why this bill is \nnot in our own national interest. Russia is now moving toward elections \nthat could determine the fate of the reform movement there for years to \ncome. United States aid has played a key role in helping the Russians \nto dismantle their nuclear arsenals, open up their economy, and become \na more open and democratic society. But this bill would require \nsubstantial reductions in United States aid to any country, like \nRussia, that provides assistance to Cuba. The way I read it, we \ncouldn't provide key assistance, including that designed\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nto bolster Russia's ability to buy United States products, if they \nprovide aid, however unrelated, to the Cubans. This is true not only of \nRussia, but of any of our allies or trading partners whose firms have \nlong been doing business in Cuba.\n  The tight and inflexible strictures this bill places on assistance to \na transitional government there would also not be in our political \ninterest. When the transition to a post-Castro, more democratic Cuba \nbegins, we must be ready to move quickly to help to ensure its success, \nas we did in Haiti. The new rules proposed by this bill could leave us \non the sidelines in a rapidly-moving transition--a dangerous place to \nbe during such an unstable period.\n  As in Haiti, the United States needs the flexibility to respond to \nchanging circumstances, sometimes even to overnight changes. But it \ntakes months for Congress to act on simple bills declaring National \nAuto Safety Week, or National Ice Cream Day. It's unrealistic to think \nwe would move quickly to provide aid to a new government. We should be \nthere with resources, ideas, and the diplomatic flexibility to react \njust as the transition begins--not panting up to the finish line once \nit's over.\n  Nor is this bill in our economic interest. Its provisions to \neffectively impose a boycott on third-party countries and businesses \nwho are not the primary target of Cuba sanctions are especially unwise. \nFor example, should Minnesota farmers who sell grain to Russian joint \nVenture partners be penalized because Russia trades with Cuba?\n  Should Minnesota businesses who may be working in partnership with \nCanadian firms be subject to multimillion dollar lawsuits simply \nbecause their Canadian partner happens to sell computers, or medical \nequipment, or anything else, to a Cuban humanitarian organization? I \ndon't think so. But this bill would do that, exposing firms in my State \nto huge potential liabilities for something they have little or no \ncontrol over. That's not common sense, and it would endanger jobs and \ntrade for Minnesotans.\n  There are other objections that have been raised about the legal \nimplications of this bill. As Senators Dodd, Pell and others have \nobserved, the bill would open U.S. courts to potentially thousands of \nnew property claims. This provision was dropped from the original \nSenate bill. Current law provides for a means of addressing property \nclaims, through a Claims Settlement Commission. This bill would give \nspecial rights under United States law to a particular class of people, \nCuban citizens who can make a claim that their properties were \nnationalized in the late 1950's by the Cuban Government, and who later \nbecame U.S. citizens by means of very generous United States \nimmigration laws--more generous than for virtually any other group. Why \nare we giving these special rights to Cubans who became citizens? Why \nnot give the same rights to Bulgarians, Russians, Poles, Vietnamese, \nChinese, Hmong, Lao, too, who may have had unresolved property claims \nwhen they were citizens of their own countries? Providing access to \nU.S. courts for claims filed on behalf of those who weren't even U.S. \ncitizens, and thus not entitled to U.S. court review when the claims \noriginally arose, sets a precedent which I am sure we will regret, and \nwhich will likely be very expensive. Who pays to give this special \ntreatment to this special group? U.S. taxpayers pay. Of course, this \ndisparate treatment not only raises legal questions. It also raises \nconstitutional questions, especially about equal protection of the law, \nwhich its proponents have brushed aside.\n  Don't let anyone confuse the issue by leaving the impression that \nthis bill is designed to protect small Cuban landholders who lost their \nhomes and offices when Cuba overthrew the brutal Batista regime. These \nregular folks get left out. As is so often the case, the big corporate \ninterests who reportedly helped to draft the bill, like the rum \nmanufacturers and sugar processors, many of whom supported the brutal \nand corrupt Batista regime in the 1950's, and the big families that \ncomposed Cuba's elites for decades, are the ones who would most benefit \nfrom the new legal rights accorded by this bill. But they cloak \nthemselves in the rhetoric of protecting the little guy who lost his \nshack on the beach in Havana, in order to persuade Congress, and other \nAmericans, to protect their economic interests.\n  Mr. President, it's clear that we must send a strong message to the \nCuban Government, and that we must do all we can to help accelerate a \ndemocratic transition there. But this bill would harm innocent Cubans \nfar more than it would serve to pressure the Cuban Government. It could \nundercut the very efforts at political and economic reform that its \nproponents support, escalating social tensions, and prompting another \noutflow of refugees to U.S. shores.\n  Given the new frictions it will cause with our allies, and the other \nproblems I've discussed, I do not believe it is in America's long-term \ninterests. I know it will pass today. But I would be less than honest \nif I took the politically expedient route and voted with many of my \ncolleagues who want to simply send a strong signal, whatever the \nvehicle, whatever the potential costs and unintended consequences, \nwhatever the troubling legal precedents it sets. This bill does not \nmeet the Minnesota common sense test. It does not meet the fairness \ntest. It will not, in my view, have the effect its proponents hope. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I gather there has been an agreement \nbetween the forces supporting and opposing this measure. Pursuant to \nthat agreement, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 6 minutes \nfrom time that had been allotted to the opponents of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act. I am pleased and proud to say I am an \noriginal sponsor of this legislation which passed the Senate, passed \nthe House, and languished in a conference committee because of a \ndispute over certain provisions of the bill. But, as so often happens, \ndictators like Castro, if given the time, will show their true \ninclination and will, by their acts, provide the best evidence and the \nbest support for action by great and free nations like ours against \nthem. So it was, painfully, tragically, in the case of Cuba and Castro, \nover the last few weeks.\n  This is in the context of attempts by many in our country, well-\nintentioned attempts, to open some lines of communication with Castro \nto see if that might tame this beast, if that might make this tiger \ninto a pussy cat. Just a few weeks ago, a distinguished group of \nvisiting Americans had pictures taken with Castro, all looking very \nfriendly. But what is happening on the ground at the same time in Cuba? \nIn response to the deterioration of the economy and the continued \nsuppression of the human rights of Cubans, I gather for the first time \nin three decades, the disparate opposition groups, that is groups \nopposed to Castro--and it is not easy, as we all know, to be opposed to \nCastro in Cuba--come together, form this group, Concilio Cubano, and \nbegin to discuss peaceful, nonviolent ways to oppose the dictatorial \nregime of Castro.\n  What is the response of that government, of Castro's government, to \nthis group? He arrests its leaders, the leaders of the opposition, and \nputs them in jail. Think about the contrast. A distinguished group of \nAmericans visiting, holding peaceful discussions, and at the same time \nthe courageous domestic opposition to Castro--finally beginning to come \ntogether against the force of this state--gets locked up; all that in \nthe week or so before this next tragic incident.\n  They were four Americans. Sometimes we are too sensitive about things \nsaid in the media, but it struck me at the outset, when these planes \nwere shot down, they were described as being piloted by representatives \nof the Cuban exile community. There is a Cuban-American community that \nhas left Cuba. But these are not Cuban exiles in the sense that the \nterm suggests, that they are somehow the other. They are us. These are \nCuban-Americans who have attained citizenship and are proud of their \nextraordinarily productive community in Florida.\n  So, four Americans in these unarmed planes were shot down, without \nappropriate warning under international\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nlaw: an outrageous act; an act of murder--let us call it that, plain \nand simple. An act of murder of civilians by a military government has \nnow dislodged this bill from the conference committee and brought it to \nthe floor, and I am grateful for the support that has been given to the \nbill.\n  The act of cowardice represented by that military attack \ndemonstrates--as clearly as we could ask for it, much more clearly than \nany of us could argue on this floor or had argued before on behalf of \nthis bill--that the Cuban Government's opposition to freedom is as \nstrong as ever. The Castro regime remains hostile to the United States \nand the people of Cuba. This crackdown on the opposition, the shootdown \nof these planes, the litany of outrageous dictatorial acts that my \nfriend and colleague from Florida has stated, show us once again that \nCastro is not redeemable. Forget it. Do not have idealistic dreams that \nthis man, who comes out of the Stalinist era of communism, can suddenly \nbecome a freedom fighter.\n  In supporting the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, we are \nacting in the best traditions of America's foreign policy because we \nare acting in the interests of human rights. We are acting in the \ninterests of human rights. We are acting on behalf of the suppressed \npeople who have lived too long under Castro's domination in Cuba. They \nhave no less a right to live in freedom than the other peoples of the \nworld toward whom we have extended ourselves, or against whom we have \nimposed economic sanctions to try to raise the liberty of the people \nwho live within those countries.\n  There are those who say that Castro denies human rights. That is \ntrue. And it is in the tradition of America, the best tradition of our \nforeign policy, to stand for human rights.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the previous agreement, I wonder if I \nmight ask for 3 more minutes from the time of the opponents to the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to yield to the Senator from Connecticut \n2 minutes, if I might.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Connecticut gratefully accepts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the point is this. The opponents of the \nbill and others may say, ``Yes, Castro denies human rights, but he does \nnot represent a threat to the United States.'' He does not, in a \nfundamental sense of our existence and security. But so long as there \nis a hostile government in Cuba, the fact is that enemies of the United \nStates will find a partner. So long as there is a hostile government in \nCuba 90 miles from our shore, those who wish us ill will find an ally. \nFor that reason of our own national security, as well as the faithful \nsupport of the best principles of our country, human rights, I think \nthe Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act is a strong step in the \nright direction.\n  Keep the pressure on. Bring Castro down. Let us move together on a \nbipartisan basis. The President strongly supports this legislation. \nGreat majorities of both parties in this Congress support the \nlegislation. Let us pass it and send the strongest possible message of \nhope to those who live under tyranny in Cuba and, hopefully, the \nstrongest possible message that will bring fear to that individual who \nhas tyrannized this proud people and that great island for much too \nlong.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nfrom President Bill Clinton to Majority Leader Bob Dole in support of \nthe conference report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Cuban regime's decision on February 24 \n     to shoot down two U.S. civilian planes, causing the deaths of \n     three American citizens and one U.S. resident, demanded a \n     firm, immediate response.\n       Beginning on Sunday, February 25, I ordered a series of \n     steps. As a result of U.S. efforts, the United Nations \n     Security Council unanimously adopted a Presidential Statement \n     strongly deploring Cuba's actions. We will seek further \n     condemnation by the international community in the days and \n     weeks ahead. In addition, the United States is taking a \n     number of unilateral measures to obtain justice from the \n     Cuban government, as well as its agreement to abide by \n     international law in the future.\n       As part of these measures, I asked my Administration to \n     work vigorously with the Congress to set aside our remaining \n     differences and reach rapid agreement on the Cuban Liberty \n     and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act. Last week, we \n     achieved that objective. The conference report is a strong, \n     bipartisan response that tightens the economic embargo \n     against the Cuban regime and permits us to continue to \n     promote democratic change in Cuban.\n       I urge the Congress to pass the LIBERTAD bill in order to \n     send Cuba a powerful message that the United States will not \n     tolerate further loss of American life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nof endorsement of the conference report by the U.S. Cuba Business \nCouncil be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S.-Cuba Business Council,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Council Member: As you know, the U.S.-Cuba Business \n     Council has closely monitored congressional and Executive \n     Branch action on the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n     Act of 1995 [H.R. 1868], known as the LIBERTAD Act or the \n     Helms-Burton bill. The LIBERTAD Act has undergone significant \n     change since the bill was originally introduced. Council \n     members have inquired as to how the Council views the \n     potential impact of this bill on the U.S. business community.\n       The measure, in its current form, addresses many of the \n     concerns expressed by the Executive Branch, the business \n     community and legal scholars. As modified, we believe that \n     the LIBERTAD Act is fundamentally consistent with the goal of \n     current U.S. policy on Cuba designed to foster a democratic \n     change with guarantees of freedom and human rights under the \n     rule of law. Congressional action on the bill may take place \n     as early as this week.\n       Chapter I of the bill includes measures to strengthen the \n     embargo against Cuba. Questions have been raised about the \n     ``extra-territoriality'' of these provisions. As currently \n     drafted, LIBERTAD Act is consistent with U.S. obligations \n     under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and does not involve secondary \n     boycotts.\n       Chapter II establishes a framework for trade with, and \n     economic assistance to, a transitional or democratic \n     government in Cuba. Some U.S. certified claimants have \n     expressed concerns that Section 737 of the bill may diminish \n     the pool of available assets for American property claimants \n     by conditioning U.S. assistance to Cuba on resolution of \n     claims held by those who were not U.S. citizens at the time \n     of confiscation. Section 737 of the LIBERTAD Act has been \n     significantly modified to address such concerns. As amended, \n     this section protects the rights of certified U.S. claimants \n     by conditioning assistance to a transitional government in \n     Cuba on U.S. Presidential certification that the Cuban \n     government is taking appropriate steps to resolve property \n     claims involving U.S. claimants as described in Section \n     620(a)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n       A key element of the LIBERTAD Act involves measures under \n     Chapter III to defend U.S. property rights and discourage \n     foreign investors from trafficking in confiscated U.S. \n     properties. Under these provisions, foreign firms trafficking \n     in stolen U.S. property in Cuba would risk action by U.S. \n     claimants against their U.S.-based assets [(Chapter III) \n     Sections 741-744] and invite U.S. action to revoke entry \n     visas of foreign corporate executives trafficking in \n     confiscated U.S. properties.\n       We believe these measures will enhance the leverage of U.S. \n     claimants seeking to discourage prospective foreign investors \n     from trafficking in their confiscated properties in Cuba, \n     facilitate the rapid and effective resolution of claims \n     disputes, and level the playing field for U.S. firms \n     preparing to participate in the economic development of a \n     democratic Cuba.\n       Some U.S. claimants have expressed concerns about allowing \n     Cuban American claimants to file suits against traffickers or \n     to obtain default judgements against the Cuban government. \n     Sections 742 and 744 of the LIBERTAD Act have also been \n     modified to clarify that the bill does not authorize the \n     President to espouse the claims of naturalized U.S. citizens \n     in any settlement with Cuba and will not dilute the pool of \n     assets available to U.S. claimants. As modified, the LIBERTAD \n     Act significantly narrows and limits the filing of suits to \n     effectively target foreign firms trafficking in confiscated \n     U.S.-owned property.\n       In the new version of LIBERTAD, it is not possible to \n     obtain a default judgement against the current government of \n     Cuba. Moreover, the right of action to sue a trafficker in \n     stolen U.S. assets applies almost\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\n     exclusively to commercial property. Claimants must provide \n     suspected traffickers with 180 days notice before filing \n     legal action and the case must involve property worth more \n     than $50,000. The Cuban government claims a total of 212 \n     joint ventures on the island. Few of those enterprises are \n     likely to have U.S.-based subsidiaries or other assets. Thus, \n     only a handful of cases against foreign firms in the U.S. \n     would qualify for consideration in U.S. courts. Accordingly, \n     the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of \n     enforcement of the LIBERTAD Act would be less than $7 \n     million. Furthermore, under current law the President could \n     halt such suits through his authority under the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act once a transition regime is in \n     power in Cuba.\n       On balance, the Council considers the LIBERTAD Act, in its \n     current form, to be consistent with the Council's mission \n     statement and beneficial for the U.S. business community, \n     protection of U.S. property rights, and the economic \n     development of a free market, democratic Cuba.\n       Please contact me or USCBC Executive Director Tom Cox in \n     our Washington office (202) 293-4995 if you need further \n     information on issues relating to this measure. I look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Otto J. Reich.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to remind all listening to this \ndebate that we are not talking about normal business transactions. We \nare talking about a dictator, a murderer, a violator of human rights, \nand an evil force in our hemisphere. That is the basis of this \nconference report.\n  It was suggested that we have not had appropriate time to deal with \nthis legislation. It has been before the Senate for 13 months. There \nhave been two subcommittee hearings on the measure and, of course, \nextensive negotiations between the White House and the committee \nitself.\n  It has been suggested that it violates NAFTA. The administration has \nconfirmed our finding that this document does not violate NAFTA.\n  It has been suggested that we have a $50,000 cap denying the \nresidential owners with smaller claims the opportunity to be benefited \nby the act. That is a result of the opponents' complaint that the \nnumber of claims under the original bill would crowd the court system. \nSo we have acceded to their demand to limit the number of cases. We are \nperfectly willing to open these legal remedies to those with claims \nvalued at less than $50,000 and welcome legislation to lower this cap.\n  It had been suggested that it is a violation of 40 years of \ninternational law, that no nationalized citizens have ever had rights \nunder an international claims settlement. I would suggest the \nopposition read the 1992 annual report of the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission of the United States. You will find the precedents for our \nefforts to provide compensation to naturalized citizens.\n  It has been suggested that we are going to chill the business \ncommunity, that this just deals with business transactions. I want to \nremind all listening, and the opposition, that the bill is directed at \npeople who engage in the business of exploiting stolen--I repeat \nstolen--property confiscated by Fidel Castro and his regime.\n  Mr. President, until the Soviet aid was cut off, joint ventures were \nnot the key issue that they have become. In 1981, there was one \ntransaction of this type. But by 1993, there were 60; and in 1994, \nthere were 74. Yet, just the introduction of the Helms-Burton \nlegislation has cut the number of new joint ventures in half.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na chart titled ``Cuban Economic Association with Foreign Capital \nParticipation'', showing joint ventures in Cuba by country and year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         CUBAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH FOREIGN CAPITAL PARTICIPATION                         \n                                              [By country and year]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Country                           1988   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpain..................................................      1  .....      3      9     10     14     10      47\nMexico.................................................  .....  .....      2      3      3      4      1      13\nCanada.................................................  .....  .....  .....      2      8     16  .....      26\nItaly..................................................  .....  .....  .....      1      5      4      7      17\nFrance.................................................  .....      1  .....      3      5      2      2      13\nHolland................................................  .....  .....  .....      1      2      3      3       9\nOffshore...............................................  .....      1      3     10      5     12  .....      31\nLatin America..........................................  .....  .....      2      3     11      9      4      29\nOther..................................................  .....  .....      1      1     11     10      4      27\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n  Total................................................      1      2     11     33     60     74     31     212\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Cuba, Inversiones y Negocios 1995-96, CONAS, Havana, 1995, p. 18.                                       \n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it has been stated that our allies, \nsome 58 countries, are going to be intimidated. I hope they are chilled \nby this. I hope they are. We are saying ``quit dealing and assisting \nthis dictator by giving him hard currency in exchange for the use of \nour stolen property.''\n  Mr. President, let me say that I think the argument that \ninternational law, which protects these types of transactions, has a \nhigher standing than our country's interest in defending our property \nowners is flawed. I think the pursuit of perfecting international law \nto protect our citizens from a rogue regime is legitimate and good \nsound public policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes and fifty-one seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding that no one chooses to speak on \nthe measure. So I will make a closing comment and then yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I think we owe the authors, \nSenator Helms and Congressman Burton, the cosponsors, and the White \nHouse--all who participated extensively to perfect this conference \nreport that I believe will soon become law--a great deal of support. \nThey need to be complimented extensively for the vast work they have \ndone to perfect this legislation over the last 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will send a signal \nworldwide about this rogue regime, that it is not in the interest of \nbusiness, or individuals, to be predators over confiscated and stolen \nproperty. I think the effects that I just alluded to moments ago are \nvery positive, and I hope that all will take note and that there will \nbe no more transactions in stolen property.\n  I hope that we give comfort to those who have had their lifelong \npossessions confiscated by the Cuban Government, that we will begin to \nsignal hope to them, that there may be light at the end of the tunnel, \nand that they will be compensated for that which was lost.\n  I hope to the Cuban people we will be saying that the United States \nstands here ready to be an ally and ready to be an assistant to the \ntransition to democracy and to the transition to a democratic \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, I see the author of the bill has arrived on the floor. \nI yield whatever time is remaining to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you for recognizing me, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me first say with the friendliest of intent to our \nneighbors to the north, Canada, who have overspoken themselves in \ncriticism of the United States--and particularly of this bill--\ndeclaring that they think it is all right for them and others to \ncontinue to deal with Castro. Let me remind them that Castro has had a \nmurderous regime from the very beginning. More Cuban citizens have been \nkilled, murdered, locked up, imprisoned, robbed--you name it--than \nanybody can imagine.\n  They advocate making a deal with Castro.\n  That is precisely what Neville Chamberlain advocated about dealing \nwith Hitler. Mr. Chamberlain went to Munich, was wined and dined by \nHitler. When he came back, he declared, ``We can do business with \nHitler. We can make a deal. We can have peace in our time.'' Well, \nNeville Chamberlain was wrong; one man, Winston Churchill, rebuked \nChamberlain and declared that he was wrong. Winston Churchill was \nright.\n  Furthermore, I will say to our critical friends in Canada that some \nof us in the United States are a bit weary about Canada's flagrant \ntransshipment of Cuban sugar and other things which are brought into \nCanada and then unlawfully shipped into the United States.\n  So, if the Canadians want to discuss what's right, what's moral, they \nshould bear in mind that all of us become a part of what we condone. \nAnd by their advocacy in this matter, by their opposition to this bill, \nthe Canadians are condoning Fidel Castro. Shame on them.\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\n  Mr. President, about a year ago, on February 9, 1995, I introduced \nlegislation to hasten the day when Fidel Castro no longer can inflict \nterror and hardship upon the people of Cuba. Today, the Cuban people \nhave reason to hope that Castro's days are indeed numbered: The Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act is on its way to the White House \nfor the President's promised signature.\n  So, we are today one step away from seeing the long-awaited \nlegislation signed into law. This conference report has broad \nbipartisan support, and the President has endorsed the bill and is \nurging all Members of Congress to support it.\n  The Libertad Act may very well persuade Fidel Castro to withdraw his \nstranglehold on the Cuban people. It is difficult to see how Castro can \nsensibly continue to hope that his dictatorship can survive the tough \nprovisions of this legislation, for example, the strengthening of all \ninternational sanctions by putting into law all the scores of Cuban \nembargo Executive orders and regulations enacted and imposed since \nPresident Kennedy. Simply stated, the embargo cannot and will not be \nlifted until Castro has departed and a democratic transition is \nunderway in Cuba.\n  In short, it is time for Mr. Castro to wake up and smell the coffee.\n  Most importantly, the Libertad Act forces foreign investors to make a \ndecision, a choice: They can trade with the United States or they can \ntrade with Cuba, but not with both without paying a serious price. This \nlegislation specifically creates a right of action for American \ncitizens to sue those who traffic in property stolen from them by the \nCastro regime. The bill also makes it mandatory that the Secretary of \nState deny entry into the United States to individuals who are \nenriching themselves with confiscated American properties.\n  Mr. President, it may be hard to believe but there are still a few \nvoices calling for the United States to lift the embargo. In the past 2 \nweeks, those arguments have been completely, totally, and utterly \ndiscredited. For during these past 2 weeks, the Castro regime \ndeliberately, intentionally, and in violation of international law, \nblew two unarmed civilian planes out of the sky. Castro has launched \nthe most brutal crackdown on dissidents in more than a decade. There \nhave been wholesale arrests in the middle of the night, followed by \nshow trials; there have been illegal searches that have shown what \nFidel Castro is--a brutal dictator.\n  These atrocities have not surprised the Cuban people who, for three \ndecades now, have witnessed brutal atrocities every day of their lives \nunder Castro's tyrannical regime.\n  Fidel Castro has also launched a crackdown on members of the \nindependent news media in Cuba. Since early 1995, Castro and his agents \nhave arrested and jailed journalists who made the mistake of trying to \nmake objective reports regarding Cuban Government activities.\n  They arrested Olance Nogueras Roce for trying to protect the health \nand well-being of his fellow Cubans by detailing the perilous \nviolations of safety regulations and the faulty construction of the \nCuban nuclear powerplant.\n  Perhaps the most despicable attacks made by Castro, Mr. President, \nwere against Cuba's blossoming religious community. After years of \npersecution and open hostility by the Castro regime, the Cuban people, \nespecially the young people, are flocking to the church in record \nnumbers. But, fearful that the church will tell the truth about Fidel \nCastro, his security agents have closed churches, arrested clergy, and \nharassed church-goers. Freedom to worship is nonexistent in Castro's \ndictatorship.\n  So, Mr. President, this conference report recommending that the \nLibertad Act become law is more desperately needed by the people of \nCuba than ever before. The enactment of the Libertad Act will give \nthese beleaguered Cuban people hope.\n  This is the light at the end of the tunnel for which the Cuban people \nhave prayed--those poor souls locked in Castro's gulags, those \ndesperate people who attempt to cross the dangerous straits to Florida, \nthe journalists and clergy who have sought the freedom to shed light on \nCastro's lies, and the average Cuban citizen struggling to survive \nunder Castro's tyranny. Now that they are about to have this new law on \ntheir side, surely it will be only a matter of time before the Cuban \npeople enjoy the freedoms that too many Americans take for granted.\n  Mr. President, earlier I mentioned that President Clinton supports \nthe Libertad Act. I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter \nto the distinguished majority leader be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Cuban regime's decision on February 24 \n     to shoot down two U.S. civilian planes, causing the deaths of \n     three American citizens and one U.S. resident, demanded a \n     firm, immediate response.\n       Beginning on Sunday, February 25, I ordered a series of \n     steps. As a result of U.S. efforts, the United Nations \n     Security Council unanimously adopted a Presidential Statement \n     strongly deploring Cuba's actions. We will seek further \n     condemnation by the international community in the days and \n     weeks ahead. In addition, the United States is taking a \n     number of unilateral measures to obtain justice from the \n     Cuban government, as well as its agreement to abide by \n     international law in the future.\n       As part of these measures, I asked my Administration to \n     work vigorously with the Congress to set aside our remaining \n     differences and reach rapid agreement on the Cuban Liberty \n     and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act. Last week, we \n     achieved that objective. The conference report is a strong, \n     bipartisan response that tightens the economic embargo \n     against the Cuban regime and permits us to continue to \n     promote democratic change in Cuba.\n       I urge the Congress to pass the LIBERTAD bill in order to \n     send Cuba a powerful message that the United States will not \n     tolerate further loss of American life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. \nCoverdell, of Georgia.\n  I yield the floor. I yield such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask that all time be yielded and the \ndebate be concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1479-5", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1506-S1510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the conference report to accompany H.R. 2546, the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2546) making appropriations for the Government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against the revenues of said District for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 15 minutes \nallotted to each side.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my remarks will be very brief. This \nafternoon--after the vote on the Cuba resolution--the Senate is \nscheduled to vote on a third motion to invoke cloture on the D.C. \nappropriations bill. The first motion was rejected by a vote of 54 to \n44. Last Thursday, the Senate rejected a second cloture motion by a \nvote of 52 to 42. Today, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion as \nwell.\n  The time has arrived for the Senate to move beyond single issue \npolitics to address the urgent needs of our Nation's Capital. It is \nclear that there is a significant--and unresolvable--difference of \nopinion on the scholarship program proposed in the conference report.\n  Repeated attempts to move this report have failed, and I am certain \nthat the question of vouchers will not be settled on this particular \nlegislative\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nvehicle. I believe it is time now to move forward with the many other \nreforms that will begin to put the District on a sound fiscal and \noperational footing. As Chairman Jeffords and others have indicated, \nthe District is about to experience a serious cash shortage. If the \nremainder of the Federal payment is not released within the next 2 \nweeks, the city will be unable to pay its bills or to provide essential \nservices. The debate over the scholarship program has been a robust and \ninformative one but it is time to move on. So I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the cloture motion.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I honestly hope this is the last time \nthat we are called upon to debate the D.C. appropriations conference \nreport. It is time to get beyond our differences and come to agreement. \nThis conference agreement represents the best consensus that can now be \nachieved. To those who believe that by delaying or defeating this \nconference report they can somehow ensure a better deal, I can tell you \nthat this is highly unlikely. I do not know what the House reaction is \ngoing to be, but I do know that we negotiated long and hard on this \nconference report which essentially gave total local control on the \nquestion of vouchers and, to my mind, brought it out of the specter of \nbeing a national test on your feelings on this issue.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government still owes the District \ngovernment more than $254 million, of which $219 million is the \nremaining portion of the Federal payment. There are real human \nconsequences to this delay. District vendors are carrying the city's \ndebt. The city owes more than $300 million to its vendors. Partially as \na result of not receiving the Federal payment, the city has taken steps \nto conserve cash including delaying payments to vendors. Many of these \nindividuals are small businessmen who depend upon prompt payment to \nmeet their own payroll and business expenses. When one of their \ncustomers is late, it causes a hardship. Some have gone out of \nbusiness. Some have had to lay off employees, and some, like snowplow \noperators, refuse to do further business with the city. And let us hope \nwe do not get another snowstorm. But it is still too early to be sure \nof that.\n  Mr. President, each year we make an appropriation of $52 million to \nthe District's retirement fund for police, firefighters, teachers, and \njudges, who were formerly Federal employees when the District \ngovernment was a Federal agency. As a result of the delay in enacting \nthis bill, the Federal Government has not paid $35 million of this \namount for those pensioners. These funds are invested for the future \nbenefit of retirees. Through the end of January, the retirement fund \nestimates that it has lost over $2 million in interest proceeds as a \nresult of not having these funds to invest. That is not fair.\n  I do not know what more can be said to convince Senators that this is \nthe best deal possible under the circumstances and that the District \ndesperately needs the money. Last week, the Chairman of the D.C. \nControl Board, Dr. Andrew Brimmer, visited me and gave me a letter \nconcerning the effect of delay in enacting the D.C. bill. He stated \nthat without the remainder of the Federal payment, the District could \nrun out of cash this spring. He also noted that without the bill being \nenacted, the District cannot spend $42 million in new Federal grants \nidentified after the 1996 budget was prepared. That authority is \ncontained in the conference agreement.\n  In closing, Dr. Brimmer states:\n\n       The Authority has begun to make significant progress toward \n     the goal of restoring financial stability to the District \n     without sacrificing core public services or adversely \n     impacting our disadvantaged citizens. . . All this is \n     jeopardized by failure to enact the D.C. budget. I plead with \n     you and your colleagues to adopt the District's FY 1996 \n     appropriation bill without further delay.\n\n  The White House has issued a statement which threatens that the \nPresident's senior advisers would recommend he veto this bill in its \npresent form. The Mayor has written a letter to the President in which \nhe appeals to the President's good sense and judgment as he weighs the \nadvice of those senior advisers. The Mayor makes the case very well \nwhen he states, ``This appropriations bill is not a vouchers bill. It \nis a bill that only gives local officials the option to do so if they \nchoose.''\n  Mr. President, we have come to another vote on this conference \nreport. I hope my colleagues will heed the words of the mayor and the \nchairman of the control board and invoke cloture so that we do not have \nto wait for some other legislation to enact this bill. Time and the \nDistrict's need for cash are of urgent concern. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport the conference agreement so that we may discharge our \nobligations to the city.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue before us is not just the city \ngovernment of Washington, DC, because that general issue is not what is \nholding up this legislation. The issue is whether or not the children \nof the District of Columbia ought to have a better education and a \nbetter educational system. And if that educational system does not \nevolve, then that the poor of the District of Columbia would have the \nsame opportunity as the rich of the District of Columbia to make sure \ntheir children have an equal educational opportunity. And that revolves \naround whether or not school vouchers ought to be available to the poor \nof Washington, DC, so that they can have then the same educational \nopportunities as the rich of this city who choose to send their \nchildren to private schools.\n  Now, I have not historically promoted the wholesale move to school \nvouchers because I have in the past only supported a limited \ndemonstration program that would provide school vouchers to poor \nfamilies that reside in troubled school districts.\n  Obviously, the District of Columbia falls into that category. But it \nis certainly an idea, the idea of school vouchers, that deserves a \nchance. And more importantly, it may give many poor children in the \nDistrict of Columbia a chance for a better education.\n  How ironic. We have been told that the President's advisers may \nsuggest a veto. How ironic that this very same President, when he was \nGovernor of Arkansas, supported a voucher program. Thank goodness for a \ncandid story in the Post explaining why the President of the United \nStates now has a different view. The Washington Post last Sunday showed \nwhy President Clinton flip-flopped on school vouchers and why the other \nside of the aisle is in lockstep behind him in opposition to this bill. \nYou see, it is the special interests. Now, in Iowa, special interest \nwhen it comes to education means children or, if it is not education, \nit means the elderly or the disabled veterans, but here in Washington \nthe special interests are fellows waving big checkbooks. The special \ninterest in this case is the National Education Association which \nprovided $4.4 million to Federal office seekers, virtually all of them \nDemocrats, according to the Washington Post story.\n  So I do not want to hear from the other side of the aisle how they \nare voting to save education when they vote against cloture. They are \nnot voting for the children's interest of the District. They are voting \nfor the special interests of the District.\n  Incredibly, many people in the White House and in Congress who oppose \nthis small effort to give children of working families a chance send \ntheir own children to the most expensive private schools in the city. I \nhope as they drive their sons and daughters to their elite academies \nthat they can roll up the tinted windows of their cars and, thus, will \nnot have to look at the children who have no chance, and they can shut \nout the noises of those children asking for a chance.\n  The Post story recounts that President Clinton told the NEA after he \nwas elected that he would not ``forget who brought me to the White \nHouse.''\n  No, President Clinton has not forgotten his big special interest \nfriends. Unfortunately, it is the children of the poor struggling to \nget a good education who have been forgotten by this White House if \nthey, in fact, veto this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the right thing for the children of the \nDistrict and vote for this bill and give\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nthem a chance for a better education tomorrow and a better future as a \nresult thereof.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor some very explicit and appropriate comments on the situation that \nwe are in. I hope that my colleagues will heed his words.\n  I yield the floor, seeing there are speakers on the other side, I \nbelieve, ready to go.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 13 minutes, \n6 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, just to sum up where we are in the U.S. Senate, and \nreally speaking to the people who live in the District, we are seeing a \nthird vote on an issue in which I believe our good Republican friends \nare basically playing politics with the children of the District of \nColumbia.\n  It is an interesting fact that 2 years ago, the majority cut $28 \nmillion out of funding for education in the District. This last year, \nthey cut some $14 million out, and then $8.5 million out of title I.\n  So that is the background, and now what they are doing is asking $42 \nmillion over the period of the next 5 years for a very narrow program, \nwhich has been rejected 8 to 1 by the District of Columbia, and that is \nthe voucher system that is not going to give the choice to the \nindividual, it is going to give the choice to the school.\n  That is something that our Republican friends do not seem to \nunderstand. Only 2 percent of the children in the District would be \nable to qualify for this particular program. Who is going to make the \njudgment? Do you think the parents are? Of course, they are not. It is \ngoing to be the schools that are making the judgment about which \nchildren they are going to take.\n  So, on the one hand, we have seen the commitment to try and enhance \nthe academic achievement and accomplishment for all of the children 2 \nyears ago, and that was cut back, and then you see the commitment to \nenhance opportunities for all of the children, and that is cut back.\n  Now we are faced with a conference proposal that effectively \nundermines the first elected school board for the District of Columbia \nby not funding them. Do you hear that, Mr. President? I hope all of our \nRepublican colleagues understand, local control. How often we hear, \n``Let's have local control over school planning, local control over the \nallocations of resources.'' That is not this bill.\n  The officials elected by the District of Columbia selected their \nschool board, and that program is defunded. We have basically a Federal \noversight that is going to say to the District of Columbia, ``Use this \nmoney our way or you're not going to get it.'' That is real choice. \nThat is real choice. That is real choice for the citizens here.\n  So we ought to understand, this is the third time that we are being \nasked to vote on this, Mr. President, along with the other provisions \nof the legislation that provide an assault on the incomes of working \nfamilies here, unlike any other part of the country, where the changes \nin the worker protection under Davis-Bacon have been included, and the \nposition of the Congress on the issues of funding for abortions. We are \nmaking a judgment which the Supreme Court has recognized ought to be a \nState or a local judgment, but, oh, no, we are saying we know best, we \nknow what is really best for the education of the students, and we know \nwhat is in the best interest of the poor and needy women in the \nDistrict, and we know what is in the best interest of workers in the \nDistrict.\n  We will hear, as we have over the period of these past months, that \nwe in this body do not always know what is best for the people around \nthis country. How often we have heard that speech. Now you have the \nchance to say no to that judgment by rejecting this conference report \nand saying yes to workers, yes to needy women, yes to the parents and \nto the enhanced quality of education for the people of the District.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope for these reasons and the excellent reasons \nthat have been outlined by Senator Kohl earlier today and during the \nlast debates and my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, \nthat this conference report will not be considered; that we will send a \nvery clear message.\n  As Senator Kohl has pointed out, and it has not been controverted, if \nyou eliminated these kinds of restrictions that have no business \nwhatsoever being on this bill, this funding would be available this \nafternoon. But, no, we have voted on it. People understand where those \nvotes are, and we are being asked to go through this routine and what I \nthink is basically blackmailing the children and families of the \nDistrict of Columbia to achieve some purpose for the majority that the \nmajority might be able to explain to us. But we are asked to do that, \nMr. President.\n  I want to make it very, very clear to all the members of the District \nof Columbia, we stand strong to make sure that the District of Columbia \nis going to get its funding. It could get it this afternoon if they \ndrop these three proposals off the conference report. They could work \nthat conference report. All of us have been around this institution to \nknow the conferees would be able to get back together. Drop those \nthree, and they could get it this afternoon.\n  We have had the two votes, and still they want to have the third one. \nBut we will do everything we possibly can to work with our friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Vermont, who we admire both his commitment \nto the quality of education nationwide and also in the District of \nColumbia. We will work with him and the other Members of the House to \nmake sure the District of Columbia gets its payment, but on this \nproposal we should say no.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague. I yield 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I simply want to underscore what Senator \nKennedy has had to say. The Presiding Officer, as a new Member of this \nbody, may not be aware of this, but in addition to everything that \nSenator Kennedy had to say, one of the things that is happening in our \nworld that is really dramatic is the spread of democracy. It is in \nRussia, it is in Poland, it is in many countries of Africa now.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, that in all of the democracies of \nthe world, there is only one democracy where we deny the people in the \ncapital city the right to be represented in a democracy, in their \nparliament. That democracy, I regret to say, is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The District of Columbia has their own elected school board, and we \nmake all these speeches about local control, but we say to only one \nschool board--and it is not insignificant, it is a school board that \ndoes not have a vote in terms of having a U.S. Senator--we say to one \nschool board, ``You have to do this or you don't get this money.'' That \njust does not make sense. I add one other point, Mr. President. I have \nbeen around here now 22 years and, generally, we try and work out \ncompromises between the House and the Senate. These are provisions that \nwere not favored by a single Member of the Senate side. Democrats and \nRepublicans capitulated to the House. I understand capitulating because \nyou have to do that sometimes. But the body does not need to do that. \nThe precedent is simply wrong.\n\n  So I hope that our vote on cloture will be the same. There is no \nreason for anyone to change his or her mind. This is not good policy, \nand I hope we will continue to resist the cloture motion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time back to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleagues for their \nkind words about our relationship, which I cherish. I thank them for \nvery eloquently making my arguments, because they have pinned it all on \nthe fact that we are shoving something at a city that has no \nopportunity with their elected officials to say no.\n  That is not the case. I wish they would read the bill. What it says \nis simply that we set up the operation, and there is a nonprofit \ncorporation set up to handle private funds and public funds. Then there \nwill be two voucher plans. One voucher plan nobody disagrees with. One \nis that every child that has problems with their education will have an \nopportunity to seek a\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nvoucher to go after school--or to go someplace to get the kind of \nremedial attention they need. Nobody disagrees with that. The bill \nfurther states that, however, the corporation can recommend that money \nwould go for tuition vouchers. However, there must be agreement upon \nhow much to spend on tuition vouchers, down to zero, and that is up to \nthe elected city officials, the District Council. They can say no \nmoney.\n  When we reached this agreement, I was fully aware there had been a \nreferendum that said, 8 to 1, ``We do not want any vouchers.'' That \nsimply means that I knew, and I am sure others that have agreed to this \nknow, that many people in the District are against it. To make the \npresumption that the city council does not remember this vote, that was \non the ballot, which said that the city voters do not want vouchers, 8 \nto 1, and they are going to say forget about that, forget about how you \nfeel now--of course, they are not. So I appreciate Senators on the \nother side making the argument strongly that we should not have \nanything that is locally controlled. This conference agreement gives \nthe city local control.\n  So how can you say you are against it because it does not have local \ncontrol when the whole thing is based upon local control?\n  The other issues, we have argued before, with respect to Davis-Bacon \nmay not be a problem. If it is, we will correct it. The abortion issue \nis a compromise between the language adopted in 1995, and which was \nadopted by the Senate this year and the more restrictive language of \nthe House bill. The conference agreement states that no funds, either \nfrom the local government or the Federal Government, can be used to \nperform an abortion unless it is to save the life of the mother or in \ncases of rape or incest. That was the best we could do.\n  Let us concentrate on the educational provisions now. Mr. President, \nwe have done everything in this agreement we can to protect the people \nof this city from a mandatory Federal program which would violate local \ncontrol. That is the case in this agreement.\n  In addition, we must remember that there are many other important \neducation reforms in this bill besides that one provision. We run the \nrisk, as I mentioned earlier, of ending up with nothing here, and all \nthe catastrophes that can come from that, including losing the funding \nfor the reforms.\n  I want to say briefly that I know there are several Members--enough \nto pass this bill--that are tortured by this vote right now, who want \nto support the cloture motion, but they know that the problem has been \nan agreement by the unions to hold the line. The White House is putting \npressure on and saying they will veto it if it is presented in its \npresent form. I urge those Members to look at the facts and get the \ngrit to be able to do what you know you should do to help the city and \nto, most of all, help the kids get the education they need in this \ncity.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the explanation of the Senator from \nVermont. But I do not think that that ought to be very satisfying to \nthe parents of the school district in the District of Columbia. \nEffectively, what the Republican Congress has done is this: They have \ncut $52 million in the last 2 years on the one hand, and they are \ngiving $42 million back on the other, if it is used as explained by the \nSenator from Vermont, and that is whether it is vouchers or after-\nschool vouchers. But if they do not spend it for the vouchers, they \nlose it. They lose it. They do not get the money.\n  You have had these draconian cuts that we have seen in the last 2 \nyears, and they are dangling the money in front of the District now and \nsaying the only way you can use this money is if you use it for the \nprograms of after-school vouchers and the other vouchers.\n  What do you say to the school that says they would like just a few \nmore hundred thousand dollars for the literacy program, or they would \nlike to have an in-school after-school program? It would not be just \nthe kids that get the vouchers, but all the children. You are saying no \nto that group of parents that want to have an after-school program and \nuse some of the money. We otherwise would have gotten another $42 \nmillion for the after-school program. What if the teachers and parents \nsay we would like to have more technology, computers? Oh, no, we have \nto permit 2 percent of the school children to go to some other schools. \nWe cannot say that in your school you might be able to get some \nadditional resources for technology.\n  Those are the things that are out there, parents, and under this \nproposal, you are denying it. You have had significant cuts in the last \n2 years. You are offering them a lot of money this way, but it has to \nbe used not the way the District of Columbia wants to use it, which has \nrejected vouchers in recent years by 8 to 1--if they had wanted \nvouchers, they would have had it before this year. They never have. So \nyou are saying we know best, and you are going to use the money this \nway, or you are going to lose it.\n  That is unacceptable. We say that the schools know best and the \nparents, who may want to be able to develop after-school programs. \nSchools and parents want to have literacy and technology, and schools \nand parents want to have enhancement of math and science. But we are \nsaying, no, you cannot do that. You have to use it our way, or you lose \nthe money. That is the issue.\n  That is unacceptable, Mr. President. I hope that we will defeat the \ncloture motion and move toward providing the funding to the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I point out that we have never cut the school budgets \nof the city. The city has recommended reductions, some of which were \naccepted. We have never imposed cuts. So, again, let us get the facts \nstraight.\n  In addition to that, this $5 million is the only thing at risk here. \nAll of that can be used if the city council and the scholarship \ncorporation agree. It can all be used for the kind of vouchers that no \none opposes, for remedial instruction. Local control is total here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as the Senate today again attempts to \nlimit debate on H.R. 2546, the fiscal year 1996 District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, I would like to address what seems to be the \nprincipal roadblock to Senate approval. That issue is the proposed \ndiscretionary educational voucher program.\n  The conference report on H.R. 2546 would authorize school vouchers \nfor as many as 1,500 low-income children at up to $3,000 each. These \nvouchers could be used for one of two purposes: Either for supplemental \neducational services such as remedial training after school, or as \ntuition scholarships to assist with the costs of private education.\n  As proposed, the voucher demonstration is not mandated. It is \nauthorized first as a choice for the District of Columbia Council. No \nvoucher program could go forward until it was approved by the District \ngovernment.\n  Furthermore, should the District decide to implement the voucher \ndemonstration, the D.C. Council could specify the type of vouchers \nwhich would be available. For instance, all of the demonstration funds \ncould be targeted to supplemental educational services with no tuition \nassistance alternative.\n  Mr. President, this legislation respects home rule by giving the D.C. \ngovernment the discretion to choose the type of program it may wish to \nprovide, or reject the program outright. It would also give up to 1,500 \nD.C. families the ability to make important choices to improve their \nchildren's education.\n  I strongly support the bill, and I strongly support the discretionary \nschool voucher demonstration. This is consistent with my support of a \nsimilar voucher demonstration proposal during the 1994 debate on the \nGoals 2000 legislation.\n  The American education system should provide an environment which \nfosters innovation and experimentation. Here is an opportunity to test \nthat environment in the Nation's Capital. I urge my colleagues to join \nin voting in favor of educational choice for the District of Columbia.\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand, the vote is set for 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senate is taking a historic step today. \nWe will soon vote on the conference report on the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity Act of 1996. It is a tragedy it took the brutal \nattack on unarmed American citizens in international airspace to \novercome resistance to tightening the economic noose around Castro. \nMany of us believed legislation should have been enacted much sooner. \nFifty-nine Senators voted for cloture on this bill last October. Though \nwe were forced to delete a critical section to overcome the filibuster \nlast year, that section has been restored in the conference report \npending in the Senate.\n  Castro still has a few supporters in the United States. The tired \nrhetoric defending his dictatorship is the last stand of the old left. \nBut their voices are irrelevant. Their voices are drowned out by the \noverwhelming and uncontestable evidence of Castro's true nature. Castro \nis clearly determined to cling to power at all costs, but his days are \nnumbered. Enactment of the Libertad bill will weaken, and eventually \nend, Castro's desperate dictatorship.\n  There has been much said in the debate this morning about this bill. \nThe key provisions deserve special mention. First, the Helms-Dole-\nBurton Libertad bill codifies all regulations implementing the embargo \non Cuba. This will ensure no more mixed signals will be sent from the \nUnited States--the Cuban embargo stays in place until a transition \ngovernment is in place.\n  Second, the Libertad bill requires entry to the United States be \ndenied to all individuals who traffic in stolen property in Cuba. Entry \ninto the United States is a privilege, not a right. Enactment of this \nbill will guarantee that the privilege of entry to the United States is \nnot extended to those who profit from property stolen from American \ncitizens.\n  Third, effective August 1, 1996, the Helms-Dole-Burton bill creates \nlegal recourse in American courts against firms and individuals who \nprofit from property confiscated from Americans. Limited authority to \nsuspend this provision is included in the conference report, but only \nfor 6-month periods, only with advance notice to Congress, and only if \nthe President certifies that such a suspension will expedite democratic \nchange in Cuba.\n  There are many other important provisions in the bill: Authorization \nto support democratic and human rights groups in Cuba, tough conditions \non aid to the former Soviet states if they provide aid to Cuba, \nmandatory reductions in United States assistance and credits to any \ncountry which support completion of the nuclear reactors in Cuba, and \ntough requirements for United States Government action on American \nfugitives in Cuba.\n  The Libertad bill is a comprehensive package which will cutoff \nCastro's foreign economic lifeline. The Libertad conference report will \nspeed up democratic change in Cuba. It sends a clear message: The time \nof Fidel Castro has come and gone. It has been a long, hard road to get \nto the point of final Senate action. I wish we could have been here \nmuch sooner. I wish we could have acted without facing veto threats and \nfilibusters.\n  But today, these differences are behind us. President Clinton has \nendorsed the Helms-Burton bill--in its toughened form. President \nClinton has asked all Members of Congress to support this legislation. \nIn a letter to me this morning, he wrote:\n\n       The conference report is a strong, bipartisan response that \n     tightens the economic embargo against the Cuban regime and \n     permits us to continue to promote democratic change in Cuba. \n     I urge Congress to pass the Libertad bill in order to send \n     Cuba a powerful message that the United States will not \n     tolerate further loss of American life.\n\n  There can be no doubt that the signal from the United States is \nstronger when the Democratic White House and Republican Congress speak \nwith the same voice. There can be no doubt that the signal from the \nUnited States is unmistakable: Democracy yes, dictatorship no.\n  Now that the White House is on board with a tougher approach to the \nCastro regime, I hope they will enact unilateral steps to increase \npressure on Castro--steps they could take today. The Clinton \nadministration should beef up enforcement of the embargo, including \nopening a Treasury Department office in Miami. The Clinton \nadministration should also instruct the FBI to crack down on Cuban \nagents in the United States including tougher restrictions on so-called \ndiplomats and stronger steps to counter Cuban spies in Miami. The \nadministration should also require strict compliance with the Foreign \nAgents Registration Act to ensure all of Castro's lobbyists are \npublicly disclosed. Measures like these will help demonstrate a genuine \nchange of heart by the White House.\n  Let there be no mistake: Castro's dictatorship will end. From Poland \nand Prague, from Moscow to Managua, from Kiev to Kazakhstan, Communist \ntyrants have fallen to the will of people. Castro stands alone as the \nlast dictator in the hemisphere. When the history of the fall of Castro \nis written, today's action will have a central place. The atrocity over \nthe Florida Straits--the murder of martyrs of February 24--has \ngalvanized opposition to Castro. And it has overcome obstacles to \npassing their Libertad bill before us today.\n  There is a long list of people who worked hard on the legislation \nbefore us. Senator Helms made enactment of this legislation a priority \nwhen he assumed the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nSenator Mack of Florida was critical in mobilizing Senate support for \nthe bill.\n  In the House, Congressman Burton played a critical role in \nshepherding the legislation to the overwhelming vote last September. \nCongressman Diaz-Balart and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen were tireless in \ntheir work for the bill--in the House and in the Senate. Congressman \nMenendez of New Jersey was central in getting the Clinton \nadministration to see the light on the legislation last week. All of \nthese Members deserve credit for the Libertad conference report. \nWithout their efforts, we would not be where we are today. Enactment of \nthis legislation will end the debate over how to foster democratic \nchange in Cuba. Enactment of this legislation will send a signal to our \nallies and our adversaries that the United States is united in opposing \nFidel Castro. And enactment of this legislation will bring the end of \nFidel Castro's reign of terror much closer. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Libertad bill to send the strongest possible message to the \nhemisphere's last dictator.\n  The signals are clear. It is now nonpartisan, bipartisan, call it \nwhat you will. I hope with an overwhelming vote that Castro will \nfinally get the message. And I think the administration has finally \ngotten the message. After cozying up to Castro in 1994 and 1995, they \nnow see the error of their ways. And I am happy that they are now on \nboard.\n  I particularly want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Helms, for his tireless efforts throughout the past \nseveral months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1510-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1510-S1511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, apparently the White House press secretary \nmade some statements this morning that I think probably he should not \nhave made. I am not certain it helps the cause of counterterrorism to \ntalk publicly about the type of equipment we are sending to help our \nallies. I support, and I am certain all of my colleagues support, \nUnited States efforts\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nto support Israel's fight against the killers of Hamas. I have pointed \nout that continued United States aid to the Palestinian authority is \ndifficult to justify unless Arafat takes concrete action against \nterrorists who threaten the peace process. Congress has had many \ncontentious delays in extending the Middle East Facilitation Act in the \npast. We could have a continuing resolution in the Chamber maybe next \nweek or maybe even this week, sometime very soon, and unless and until \nArafat does more to crack down on terrorism, I would assume--I am not \nsuggesting I am going to plead it, but I assume there might be an \neffort by some to cut off aid to the Palestinian authority, and that is \nthe point I made. It seems to me it is up to Mr. Arafat to take some \ndecisive action. It is not enough to say that he regrets it and it is \nintolerable. I think we need action not only from Arafat but some \naction from Syria which has been a safe haven for terrorists the last \ndecade or so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1510-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1996--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The following outline describes the basic steps \n     in the estimation.\n       Estimation of the impact of the funding cut starts by \n     determining how many of the couples who depend on U.S funded \n     family planning programs will lose their access to \n     contraceptives.\n       Population censuses and estimates indicate an estimated 829 \n     million women of reproductive age are living today in \n     developing countries other than China (which receives no U.S. \n     family planning program support).\n       Surveys of women in developing countries show that roughly \n     247.5 million of these women and their partners use modern \n     methods of contraception to lengthen the time between the \n     births of their children or to avoid having more children \n     than they already have.\n       Because of their poverty, 190.5 million, or 77%, of the \n     couples in developing countries outside of China who are \n     using modern contraceptive methods rely on public-sector \n     family planning programs for their contraceptive method.\n       The United States contributes about 17% of all public funds \n     spent on family planning in developing countries other than \n     China, accounting for 32.4 million couples using modern \n     contraceptive methods. [Of these couples, 12.6 million are \n     estimated to be protected by contraceptive sterilization or \n     long-lasting methods including hormonal implants (such as \n     Norplant) and intra-uterine devices (IUDs).]\n       On an annual basis, 19.8 million couples depend on U.S. \n     supported programs to obtain contraceptive supplies, such as \n     pills, condoms or injectables, or to start use of a long-term \n     method, such as voluntary sterilization, hormonal implants or \n     IUDs.\n       A cut in program resources of 35% means that 12.9 rather \n     than 19.8 million couples will be able to be served in a \n     year's time, leaving 7.0 million couples without access to \n     contraceptive supplies or services.\n       The second step is estimating what effect losing U.S. \n     supported family planning services will have on the couples \n     who were depending on them for contraceptive care.\n       There are few other contraceptive choices in developing \n     countries for women who lack access to modern contraceptives. \n     A conservative estimate is that of the 7.0 million women \n     losing services because of U.S. funding cuts 2.8 million will \n     turn to traditional methods and 4.2 million will use no \n     contraceptive.\n       Because pregnancy rates are so much higher among couples \n     relying on no method or on a traditional method than if they \n     use a modern contraceptive, 4.0 million more unwanted \n     pregnancies are expected in developing countries due to the \n     drop in family planning program resources.\n       About 40% of these unintended pregnancies are likely to end \n     in induced abortion, even though it is often not legal and \n     performed in unsafe conditions--accounting for 1.6 million \n     abortions among the expected additional unwarranted \n     pregnancies.\n       Some 47% of these unintended pregnancies are likely to end \n     in unwanted births with the remaining 13% resulting in \n     spontaneous abortions or miscarriages--accounting for 1.9 \n     million unwanted births among the expected additional \n     unwanted pregnancies.\n       Maternal mortality rates in developing countries are high, \n     about 4.1 deaths per 1,000 women giving birth, leading to an \n     estimated 8,000 additional deaths due to pregnancy among the \n     women facing additional unintentional pregnancies.\n       In summary, it is estimated that, in a year's time as a \n     result of a 35% cut in AID funding, there will be:\n       7.0 million couples in developing countries who would have \n     used modern contraceptive methods will be left without access \n     to these methods.\n       As a result, there will be 4.0 million more women \n     experiencing unintended pregnancies, leading in turn to:\n       1.9 million more unplanned births, and\n       1.6 million more abortions (the remainder of the unintended \n     pregnancies ending in miscarriages); and\n       8,000 more women dying in pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nEstimate of number of additional abortions resulting from a 35-percent \n cut in USAID funding for family planning services for all developing \n                       countries excluding China\n\n1.

Parker Mauldin and Vincent C. \n     Miller, 1994. Contraceptive Use and Commodity Costs in \n     Developing Countries, 1994-2005. Technical Report Number 18. \n     New York; United National Population Fund, p. 17. This source \n     gives the total number of modern method users in the \n     developing world in 1995 as 460,673,000. Modern method users \n     in China (213.2 million) were subtracted to estimate users in \n     the rest of the developing world. The estimate for China is \n     based on contraceptive prevalence of 83 percent of MWRA \n     (World Contraceptive Use 1994, United Nations Department of \n     Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, \n     Population Division, New York.) The number of MWRA in China \n     is estimated to be 256.9 million, based on a 1990 estimate in \n     World Contraceptive Use 1994 of 222.7 million and an annual \n     growth rate of WRA of 2.9 percent (World Population \n     Prospects).\n       7. For individual countries figures are from DHS reports \n     for users of reversible methods.\n       For the developing world excluding China the figure is \n     based on an estimate of users supplied by government sources \n     for all developing countries of 86.3% from Contraceptive Use \n     and Commodity Costs in Developing Countries, 1994-2005, p. \n     30. Assuming that all users in China are supplied by the \n     public sector, the estimate for all developing countries \n     excluding China becomes 74.4%: (460.6 million users 86.3% \n     public--213.2 Chinese users)/247.5 million users in LDC-\n     China.)\n       8. According to Contraceptive Use and Commodity Costs in \n     Developing Countries, 1994-2005, p. 30, 4.4% of all private \n     sector services are provided by NGOs. Other private sector \n     services, such as social marketing, are also subsidized. We \n     have estimated that 10% of all private sector services are \n     subsidized by the public sector.\n       9. Modern users relying on public sources=Modern method \n     users [6] percent public [7] + modern method users [6] \n     percent private percent of private sector subsidized [8]. \n     Percent private=1-percent public [7].\n       10. Estimates for individual countries are from Population \n     Action International (unpublished tabulations).\n       For the developing world excluding China estimates are \n     based on three different approaches.\n       The first approach is based on the following assumptions \n     and calculations by Population Action International: total \n     family planning expenditure in the developing world is $4-5 \n     billion, expenditure in China is $1 billion, USAID \n     expenditure in FY 1995 was $547 million, thus USAID \n     expenditure is 14-18% of all expenditure outside China.\n       The second approach is based on commodities distributed. In \n     FY 1995 USAID provided 608 million condoms, 3.1 million IUDs, \n     52.5 million cycles of oral contraceptives, 14.8 million \n     vaginal foaming tablets, 82 thousand units of Norplant and \n     2.9 million units of Depo-Provera. (NEWVERN Information \n     System, special tabulation provided by JSI). This translates \n     in 19.6 million couple-years of protection for these methods \n     alone. According to Contraceptive Use and Commodity Costs in \n     Developing Countries, 1994-2005, p. 24, total couple-years of \n     protection for all methods except sterilization is 212.4 \n     million. Chinese users account for 46 percent of all modern \n     method users (213.2/460.7), so the remaining countries have \n     54 percent of these couple-years of protection, or 115 \n     million. The USAID figure of 19.6 million is 17 percent of \n     115 million.\n       The third approach assumes that official development \n     assistance accounted for 25% of total funds spent on family \n     planning; private payments by users accounted for another 25% \n     and governments of developing countries funded the remaining \n     50% (R. Bulatao, 1993. Effective Family Planning Programs, \n     Washington, DC: World Bank). Thus, 75% of funds are from \n     public sources. USAID contributes about 50% of all foreign \n     assistance family planning dollars. Thus it contributes 17% \n     of public funding for family planning: 50%25%/75%=16.7%.\n       11. Modern method users relying on public sources [9]USAID \n     share of funding [10]. This estimate coincides well with an \n     estimate based on commodities distributed. USAID provided \n     19.6 million couple-years of protection based on all methods \n     other than sterilization (see 10 above). In the developing \n     world, 56 percent of users rely on these methods, the other \n     44 percent use sterilization (Contraceptive Use and Commodity \n     Costs in Developing Countries, 1994-2005, p. 20). If the same \n     ratio applies to USAID-supported users, then total USAID-\n     supported users would be 19.6 million/0.56 or 35 million.\n       12. Figures for individual countries are from DHS. They \n     refer to sterilization users. In countries with significant \n     reliance on the IUD, 70 percent of IUD users have also been \n     included as long-term use (based on an average duration of \n     use of about 3.5 years). For all developing countries the \n     estimate is calculated as the weighted average for the 18 \n     countries with the largest USAID programs (weighted by the \n     number of USAID-supported users).\n       13. Calculated as 1/(45--mean age at sterilization). \n     Estimates of mean age are from DHS and/or AVSC. Average for \n     all developing countries is from John Stover, et \n     al., Empirically Based Conversion Factors for Calculating \n     Couple-Years of Protection, The EVALUATION Project, 1996, \n     draft.\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\n       14.

This is an estimate of the percent people who lose \n     their family planning services due to USAID budget cuts that \n     would adopt traditional methods as an alternative. Since the \n     people losing their services are committed users, many would \n     adopt traditional methods. However, traditional methods \n     require the active participation of both partners, so many \n     would probably not adopt these methods. One approach to \n     estimating this figure has been developed by The Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute. This approach uses DHS data to \n     determine traditional method use as a proportion of all women \n     either using a traditional method or having an unmet need for \n     family planning. The average of 36 developing countries for \n     which data are available shows that 20 percent of these women \n     use traditional methods (Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1995. \n     Hopes and Realities; Closing the Gap Between Women's \n     Reproductive Aspirations and their Reproductive Experiences, \n     AGI, New York, Appendix Table 7). This is likely to be an \n     under-estimate since there are many reasons other than lack \n     of access for women to have an unmet need (lack of knowledge, \n     religious objections to family planning, spouse opposes \n     family planning, fear of side effects). Therefore, to be \n     conservative, we have doubled this figure to 40 percent.\n       18. Users left unprotected [18] x percent adopting \n     traditional methods [19].\n       19. Failure rates for withdrawal and periodic abstinence in \n     developed countries are reported to be around 20% \n     (Contraceptive Technology, 16th Revised Edition, Robert A. \n     Hatcher, et al., New York: Irvington Publishers, Inc. 1994, \n     p. 652). For developing countries there is very little \n     information. One study used DHS data to calculate that 16% of \n     users of withdrawal had a birth in the first years of use \n     (Lorenzo Moreno and Noreen Goldman, 1991. ``Contraceptive \n     Failure Rates in Developing Counties: Evidence from \n     Demographic and Health Surveys.'' International Family \n     Planning Perspectives, 17(2), June 1991, pp. 44-49.) The \n     number of pregnancies (rather than births) due to traditional \n     method failure would be even higher (Elise F. Jones, \n     ``Contraceptive Failure and Abortion.'' International Family \n     Planning Perspectives, 17(4), December 1991, p. 150) Also, \n     this study was based on respondent recall. There is a \n     tendency, especially with traditional method users, to forget \n     or not report use immediately before a pregnancy. Therefore, \n     we assume that the annual pregnancy rate among traditional \n     method users is about 40%. For users of modern methods the \n     pregnancy rate is about 10%. (It is estimated to be about 14% \n     in the U.S. among users of reversible methods. [Elise F. \n     Jones and J.D. Forrest, 1992. ``Contraceptive failure rates \n     based on the 1988 NSFG,'' Family Planning Perspectives, \n     24:12-19.] but this number is high because there is little \n     use of the IUD. For USAID-supported users, the IUD accounts \n     for about half of all couple-years of protection provided by \n     reversible methods.) Therefore, the additional pregnancy rate \n     due to users switching from modern methods to traditional \n     methods is 30% (40%-10%).\n       20. New traditional method users [20] x failure rate [21].\n       21. The annual pregnancy rate for those couples using no \n     method is 85% (Contraceptive Technology, 16th Revised \n     Edition, Robert A. Hatcher, et al., New York: Irvington \n     Publishers, Inc. 1994, p. 652). Subtracting the 10% pregnancy \n     rate for couples using modern methods (note 19) leaves an \n     additional pregnancy rate of 75%.\n       22. (Users unprotected [18]--new traditional method users \n     [20] x pregnancy rate [23].\n       23. Unwanted pregnancies from traditional method failure \n     [22] + unwanted pregnancies from users left unprotected [24].\n       24. Estimated to be 40%. Estimates are based on the \n     following information:\n       The number of unintended pregnancies is the sum of \n     abortions, unintended births and unintended pregnancies that \n     end as spontaneous abortions (estimated as 10% of abortions + \n     20% of unintended births).\n       The main source of data on abortions is World Health \n     Organization, 1994. Abortion: A tabulation of available data \n     on the frequency of unsafe abortion, Geneva: WHO. These \n     figures are also supported by S.K. Henshaw, 1990. ``Induced \n     abortion: A world review'', Family Planning Perspectives, 22, \n     76-89 and The Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1994. Clandestine \n     Abortion: A Latin American Reality, New York: AGI.\n       The number of unintended births is obtained by applying \n     regional average proportions of all births that are \n     unintended, to UN estimates of the total number of births in \n     each region. Estimates of the total number of births that are \n     unintended are obtained from DHS surveys done in the late \n     1980s/early 1990s. The weighted average for countries that \n     have surveys, in a given region, is assumed to apply to the \n     region as a whole. These proportions are based in women's \n     reports of the wantedness status of each birth in the five \n     years prior to the survey. Regional distributions of all \n     pregnancies by planning status were published in chart form \n     in Hopes and Realities: Closing the Gap Between Women's \n     Reproductive Aspirations and their Reproductive Experiences, \n     p. 25). These data were used to recalculate the distribution \n     of unintended pregnancies by pregnancy outcome (that is, \n     excluding wanted births and that proportion of wanted \n     pregnancies that end as spontaneous abortions).\n       Country or region specific numbers were used for the \n     individual countries. For Peru estimates are from: The Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute, 1994. Clandestine Abortion: A Latin \n     American Reality, New York: The Alan Guttmacher Institute. \n     Other country estimates are based on regional data (The Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute, unpublished tabulations).\n       25.

Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a short interview that appeared this morning in USA Today. \nIn it, textile businessman Roger Milliken outlines the inaccuracies in \nthe present-day argument that only free trade can improve our Nation's \neconomy. With a plethora of hard facts, Mr. Milliken debunks this myth \nby focusing on the real problem: America does not have real trade \ntroubles with nations that accept and sell products from America. \nAmerica's trade problems are with countries like Japan and China that \nwon't let American products into their markets.\n  Across the Nation, columnist and now Presidential candidate Pat \nBuchanan has opened up the wound of disinvestment in America. Unlike \nthe Washington pundits and experts, people across America know that \ntrade matters. Hard-working people have a tremendous disaffection with \nour trade policies and that unsettledness is bound to grow.\n  Mr. President, Roger Milliken hit the nail on the head of trade in \nthis interview. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Mar. 5, 1996]\n\n              Textile Magnate Critiques Recent Trade Deals\n\n       Roger Milliken, the South Carolina textile magnate, is a \n     leading advocate of protectionist trade policies and a major \n     contributor to GOP presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan \n     and other conservative politicians and causes. In a rare \n     interview, Milliken tells USA Today's Beth Belton why he \n     thinks recent trade deals have been a mistake.\n       Q: You're against free trade, right?\n       A: Stop right there. We do believe in free trade. We have \n     plants offshore. We have one in Japan and 11 in Europe. But \n     the products we make are all sold in those countries. We \n     don't take advantage of low labor costs to bring products \n     back and destroy U.S. jobs.\n       Q: But you are against the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement. Do you have plants in Canada or Mexico?\n       A: No. And we wouldn't consider either country because I've \n     studied history, and I've found that no country has ever \n     remained a major economic factor in the world that has lost \n     its own manufacturing. . . . We have a manufactured goods \n     trade deficit of $174 billion, and if you use Clinton \n     administration figures that every $1 billion of exports \n     supports 20,000 jobs, it's not far-fetched to say that if we \n     didn't have a deficit, we would have 3.4 million more \n     manufacturing jobs in the U.S. than we have.\n       Q: The USA has been losing manufacturing jobs for decades, \n     and many economists say technology, not trade is the reason. \n     You disagree?\n       A: Technology companies in this country pay lower wages \n     than textile companies. The biggest piece--$52 billion--of \n     our $174 billion goods trade deficit is in autos and auto \n     parts. The second is textiles and apparel--$37 billion. We're \n     talking about year-round, full-time jobs. Most of the U.S. \n     jobs created now are in the tourist trade or part-time fast-\n     food jobs. These jobs don't pay benefits. They don't hold the \n     family together. The turnover rate in the fast-food business \n     is 250%. There's nothing steady or stabilizing to the economy \n     about that.\n       Q: But don't statistics from your home state, South \n     Carolina, show trade is helping create manufacturing jobs?\n       A: I take total exception to that. Four weeks ago in \n     Spartanburg County, where I live, five textile plants closed \n     down permanently. That's 800 jobs. Sure, the state gained \n     6,000 jobs last year because foreign companies invested in \n     South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\n     That's absolutely terrific. But if we put in more \n     protectionist laws, more of those jobs would be coming here. \n     Foreign companies would have to locate here to get U.S. \n     business.\n       Q: Has NAFTA increased export demand for cloth and other \n     products?\n       A: It's not true, and it's worse than that because what \n     everybody isn't told is that the textile industry today is \n     operating six days a week instead of seven, or five days \n     instead of six. Most of them have cut off the third shift or \n     are closing one day a month because imports are hurting \n     demands here.\n       Q: What's the solution?\n       A: I'd like to see us withdraw from the World Trade \n     Organization. The U.S. has one vote. Cuba can cancel our \n     vote. Or St. Kitts, an island in the (Caribean). . . .We also \n     want higher tariffs. Our opponents say that would prompt \n     retalization. I don't know how anybody retaliates against \n     their best customer. I would love to retaliate against some \n     of my best customers who treat us badly.\n       Q: Why are you speaking out now?\n       A: We're a private company and we like to stay private, but \n     we're fighting for our industry. We have 14,000 employees in \n     the U.S., and one of my jobs is to fight for preservation of \n     those jobs.\n       Q: Didn't some in the textile industry support passage of \n     NAFTA?\n       A: It was a split vote in the industry. There were some who \n     believed the industry might benefit. They believed no textile \n     plants would go to Mexico. But already we see plants setting \n     up there, where all-in costs are $2 an hour compared to $12 \n     an hour in the U.S.\n       Q: Have you had to downsize?\n       A: No, but I have to tell you we're running on curtailed \n     schedules and the industry has had to close 12 plants in an \n     economy that's growing all over. We ought to be a growing \n     industry. We ought to be creating jobs.\n       Q: What about plans to expand?\n       A: We plan to continue expanding. Last year, we bought a \n     company in Japan that makes fabric for auto interiors. When \n     you deal with international auto companies, one of their \n     requirements is that you be located in parts of the world \n     where they can exchange products.\n       Q: You don't often give interviews. Why?\n       A: The media emphasize the growth in exports and the jobs \n     created by exports. There are figures collected by the \n     government that are put together very skillfully. But there \n     is no way to look at government figures to find out how many \n     jobs have been lost to imports. I hear a lot of talk about \n     the growth of exports but hardly anyone talks about the \n     growth of imports, which in percentage terms are slightly \n     less. But in absolute numbers, the U.S. imports three times \n     as much as it exports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1514-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to affirm the rights of Americans to use and sell \nencryption products, to establish privacy standards for voluntary \nescrowed systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n            The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Burns, Dole, \nPressler, and Murray in introducing a bill that is pro-business, pro-\njobs and pro-privacy.\n  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 would enhance the \nglobal competitiveness of our high-technology industries, protect the \nhigh-paying good jobs in those industries and maximize the choices in \nencryption technology available for businesses and individuals to \nprotect the privacy, confidentiality and security of their computer, \ntelephone, and other wire and electronic communications.\n  The guiding principle for this bill can be summed up in one sentence: \nEncryption is good for American business and good business for \nAmericans.\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified last week at a hearing on economic \nespionage and quoted Secretary of State Warren Christopher as saying \nthat ``Our national security is inseparable from our economic \nsecurity.'' I could not agree more. Yet, American businesses are \nsuffering a double blow from our current encryption policies. First, \nAmerican firms lose billions of dollars each year due to the theft of \nproprietary economic information, which could be better protected if \nstrong encryption were more widely used. Second, government export \nrestrictions tie the hands of American high-technology businesses by \nbarring the export of strong encryption technology. The size of these \ncombined losses makes encryption one of the critical issues facing \nAmerican businesses today.\n  Moreover, the increasing use of and dependency on networked computers \nby Americans to obtain critical medical services, to conduct research, \nto be entertained, to go shopping and to communicate with friends and \nbusiness associates, raises special concerns about the privacy and \nconfidentiality of their computer transmissions. I have long been \nconcerned about these issues, and have worked over the past decade to \ncreate a legal structure to foster privacy and security for our wire \nand electronic communications. Encryption technology provides an \neffective way to ensure that only the people we choose can read our \ncommunications.\n  A leading encryption expert, Matt Blaze, told me in a recent letter \nthat our current regulations governing the use and export of encryption \nare having a ``deleterious effect on our country's ability to develop a \nreliable and trustworthy information infrastructure.'' It is time for \nCongress to take steps to put our national encryption policy on the \nright course.\n  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act would accomplish three \ngoals:\n  First, the bill encourages the use of encryption by legislatively \nconfirming that Americans have the freedom to use and sell here in the \nUnited States any encryption technology that they feel is most \nappropriate to meet their privacy and security needs. The bill bars any \ngovernment-mandated use of any particular encryption system, such as a \nkey escrow encryption system.\n  Second, for those Americans who choose to use a key escrow encryption \nmethod, the bill establishes privacy standards for key holders and \nstringent procedures for how law enforcement can obtain access to \ndecoding keys and decryption assistance. These standards would subject \nkey holders to criminal and civil liability if they released the keys \nor divulged the identity and information about the user of the \nencryption system, without legal authorization. Commenting on these \nprovisions, Bruce Schneir, who has literally written the textbook on \nencryption, said in a recent letter to me that the bill ``recognizes \nthe special obligations of keyholders to be vigilant in safeguarding \nthe information entrusted to them, without imposing hurtles on the use \nof cryptography.''\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\n  Finally, the bill loosens export restrictions on encryption products. \nUnder the bill, it would be lawful for American companies to export \nhigh-technology products with encryption capabilities when comparable \nencryption capabilities are available from foreign suppliers, and \ngenerally available encryption software, including mass market products \nand encryption that is in the public domain. According to Mr. Schneir, \nthe bill ``removes the strangle-hold that has encumbered the \ndevelopment of mass-market security solutions'' which are so vital to \nthe development of our information infrastructure.\n  Senator Murray took a leading role in the last Congress on reforming \nour export restrictions on encryption, and I commend her for continuing \nto give this important issue her committed attention again in this \nCongress.\n  Current export restrictions allow the export of primarily weak \nencryption software programs. So weak, in fact, that a January 1996 \nreport by an ad hoc group of world-renowned cryptographers and computer \nscientists estimated that it would take a pedestrian hacker a matter of \nhours to break and a foreign intelligence agency a matter of \nnanoseconds to break. No wonder that foreign buyers of encryption \nproducts are increasingly looking elsewhere for strong security. This \nhurts the competitiveness of our high-technology industry.\n  A recent report by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which is a \ngroup of major American computer companies estimated that U.S. \ncompanies stand to lose between $30 and $60 billion in revenues and \nover 200,000 of high-technology jobs by the year 2000 because U.S. \ncompanies are handicapped in the global market by outdated export \nrestrictions.\n  Even the Commerce Department reported in January that U.S. export \ncontrols may have a ``negative effect on U.S. competitiveness'' and \n``may discourage'' the use of strong encryption domestically since \nmanufacturers want to make only one product for export and for use \nhere.\n  Although American companies account for almost 75 percent of the \nglobal market for prepackaged software, the rest of the world is \ncompeting strongly in the market for encryption software. Shortsighted \ngovernment policy is holding back American business. Almost 2 years \nago, I chaired a hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology \nand the Law on the administration's Clipper Chip key escrow encryption \nprogram. I heard testimony about 340 foreign encryption products that \nwere available worldwide, 155 of them employing encryption in a \nstrength that American firms were prohibited from exporting.\n  In 2 short years, those numbers have increased. According to a survey \nof cryptographic products conducted by Trusted Information System, as \nof December 1995, 497 foreign products from 28 countries were available \nwith encryption security. Almost 200 of these foreign products used \nstrong encryption that American companies are barred from selling \nabroad. This study draws the obvious conclusion that ``As a result, \nU.S. Government restrictions may be succeeding only in crippling a \nvital American industry's exporting ability.''\n  At the Clipper Chip hearing I chaired in 1994, I heard a number of \nreports about American companies losing business opportunities due to \nU.S. export restrictions. One data security company reported that \ndespite its superior system, it had been unable to respond to requests \nfrom NATO and foreign telecommunications companies because it cannot \nexport the encryption they demanded. This cost this single American \ncompany millions in foregone business. Another major computer company \nlost two sales in Western Europe in a single year totaling about $80 \nmillion because the file and data encryption in the integrated system \nthey offered was not exportable.\n  Our current export restrictions on encryption technology are fencing \noff the global marketplace and hurting the competitiveness of this part \nof our high-technology industries. While national and domestic security \nconcerns must weigh heavily, we need to do a better job of balancing \nthese concerns with American business' need for encryption and the \neconomic opportunities for our high-technology industries that \nencryption technology provides.\n  American businesses are not only suffering lost sales because of our \ncurrent export restrictions, but are also suffering staggering losses \ndue to economic espionage. FBI Director Freeh testified that the White \nHouse Office of Science and Technology Policy puts the amount of that \nloss at $100 billion per year. At a hearing last week on economic \nespionage, we heard from one witness who had to close down his software \ncompany, with a loss of 25 jobs, after China bribed an employee to \nsteal the source code for the company's software.\n  We have bills pending before Congress to enact new criminal laws to \npunish people who steal trade secrets or other proprietary information \nand who break into computers to steal sensitive information. But new \ncriminal laws are not the whole answer. Criminal laws often only come \ninto play too late, after the theft has occurred or the injury \ninflicted.\n  We must encourage American firms to take preventive measures to \nprotect their vital economic information. That is where encryption \ncomes in. Just as we have security systems to lock up our offices and \nfile drawers, we need strong encryption systems to protect the security \nand confidentiality of business information.\n  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that, without strong \nencryption, financial losses by the year 2000 from breaches of computer \nsecurity systems to be from $40 to $80 billion. Unfortunately, some of \nthese losses are already occurring. One U.S.-based manufacturer is \nquoted in the Project's report, saying:\n\n       We had a multi-year, multi-billion dollar contract stolen \n     off our P.C. (while bidding in a foreign country). Had it \n     been encrypted, [the foreign competitor] could not have used \n     it in the bidding time frame.\n\n  New technologies present enormous opportunities for Americans, but we \nmust strive to safeguard our privacy if these technologies are to \nprosper in this information age. Otherwise, in the service of law \nenforcement and intelligence needs, we will dampen any enthusiasm \nAmericans may have for taking advantage of the new technologies.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nmatter, and ask unanimous consent that the bill, a summary of the bill, \nand three letters of support from Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneir, and \nBusiness Software Alliance, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Encrypted Communications \n     Privacy Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to ensure that Americans are able to have the maximum \n     possible choice in encryption methods to protect the \n     security, confidentiality, and privacy of their lawful wire \n     or electronic communications; and\n       (2) to establish privacy standards for key holders who are \n     voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt such \n     communications, and procedures by which investigative or law \n     enforcement officers may obtain assistance in decrypting such \n     communications.\n\n     SEC. 3.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments \n     made by this Act constitutes authority for the conduct of any \n     intelligence activity.\n       (b) Certain Conduct.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments \n     made by this Act shall affect the conduct, by officers or \n     employees of the United States Government in accordance with \n     other applicable Federal law, under procedures approved by \n     the Attorney General, or activities intended to--\n       (1) intercept encrypted or other official communications of \n     United States executive branch entities or United States \n     Government contractors for communications security purposes;\n       (2) intercept radio communications transmitted between or \n     among foreign powers or agents of a foreign power as defined \n     by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; or\n       (3) access an electronic communication system used \n     exclusively by a foreign power or agent of a foreign power as \n     defined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996--Summary\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act many be cited as the \n     ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996.''\n       Sec. 2. Purpose. The Act would ensure that Americans have \n     the maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect \n     the\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\n     security, confidentiality and privacy of their lawful wire \n     and electronic communications. For those Americans who choose \n     an encryption method in which another person, called a ``key \n     holder,'' is voluntarily entrusted with the decryption key, \n     the Act would establish privacy standards for the key holder, \n     and procedures for law enforcement officers to follow to \n     obtain assistance from the key holder in decrypting encrypted \n     communications.\n       Sec. 3. Findings. The Act enumerates fifteen congressional \n     findings, including that a secure, private and trusted \n     national and global information infrastructure is essential \n     to promote citizens' privacy and meet the needs of both \n     American citizens and businesses, that encryption technology \n     widely available worldwide can help meet those needs, that \n     Americans should be free to use, and American businesses free \n     to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and \n     products, and that there is a need to develop a national \n     encryption policy to advance the global information \n     infrastructure and preserve Americans' right to privacy and \n     the Nation's public safety and national security.\n     Sec. 4. Freedom to Use Encryption\n       (a) Lawful Use of Encryption. The Act legislatively \n     confirms current practice in the United States that any \n     person in this country may lawfully use any encryption \n     method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length or \n     implementation selected. The Act thereby prohibits any \n     government-mandated use of any particular encryption system, \n     such as a key escrow encryption system.\n       The Act further makes lawful the use of any encryption \n     method by United States persons in a foreign country. This \n     provision is consistent with, though broader than, the \n     Department of State's new personal use exemption published in \n     the Federal Register on February 16, 1996, that permits the \n     export of cryptographic products by U.S. citizens and \n     permanent residents who have the need to temporarily export \n     the cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief \n     periods of time. For example, under this new exemption, U.S. \n     citizens traveling abroad will be able to take their laptop \n     computers containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many \n     versions of which contain an encryption program otherwise not \n     exportable.\n       (b) General Constructions. Nothing in the Act is to be \n     construed to require the use of encryption, a key escrow \n     encryption system, or a key holder if a person chooses to use \n     a key escrow encryption system.\n       Sec. 5. Encrypted wire and electronic communications. This \n     section of the Act adds a new chapter 122, entitled \n     ``Encrypted Wire and Electronic Communications,'' to title 18 \n     of the United States Code to establish privacy standards for \n     key holders and to set forth procedures that law enforcement \n     officers must follow to obtain decryption assistance from key \n     holders.\n       (a) In General. New chapter 122 has five sections.\n       Sec. 2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the \n     new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap \n     statute in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510. Definitions are provided for \n     ``encryption'', ``key holder'', ``decryption key'', and \n     ``decryption assistance''. A ``key holder'' may, but is not \n     required to be, a Federal agency.\n       This chapter applies only to wire or electronic \n     communications and communications in electronic storage, as \n     defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510, and not to stored electronic \n     data. For example, encrypted electronic mail messages, \n     encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile \n     transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted \n     file transfers over the Internet would be covered, but not \n     encrypted data merely stored on computers.\n     Sec. 2802. Prohibited acts by key holders\n       (a) Unauthorized release of key.--Key holders will be \n     subject to both criminal and civil liability for the \n     unauthorized release of decryption keys or providing \n     unauthorized decryption assistance.\n       (b) Authorized release of key.--Key holders are authorized \n     to release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance \n     with the consent of the key owner, as may be necessary for \n     the holding or management of the key, or to investigative or \n     law enforcement officers upon compliance with the procedures \n     set forth in subsection (c).\n       (c) Requirements for release of decryption key to \n     investigative or law enforcement officer.--To obtain access \n     to a decryption key or decryption assistance from a key \n     holder, an investigative or law enforcement officer must \n     present to the key holder the same form of lawful process \n     used to obtain access to the encrypted content. For example, \n     to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption assistance \n     for, an encrypted telephone conversation that is the subject \n     of a court-ordered wiretap under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518, a law \n     enforcement agent must present a court order to the key \n     holder to obtain the decoding key. Likewise, to obtain the \n     decryption key to, or decryption assistance for, an encrypted \n     stored wire or electronic communication, a law enforcement \n     officer must present a court warrant, order, subpoena or \n     certification, depending upon what process was used to \n     obtain access to the stored communication.\n       Key holders may only provide the minimal key release or \n     decryption assistance needed to access the particular \n     communications specified by court order or other legal \n     process. Released keys or other decryption assistance may \n     only be used in the manner and for the purpose and duration \n     expressly provided by court order or other legal process.\n       A key holder who fails to provide the decryption key or \n     decryption assistance called for in the court order, subpoena \n     or other lawful process may be penalized under current \n     contempt or obstruction laws.\n       (d) Records or other information held by key holders.--Key \n     holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other \n     information (not including decryption keys) pertaining to key \n     owners, except with the owner's consent or to an \n     investigative or law enforcement officer, pursuant to a \n     subpoena, court order or other lawful process.\n       (e) Criminal penalties.--Key holders who violate this \n     section for a tortious, malicious or an illegal purpose, or \n     for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private \n     commercial gain, will be subject to a fine and up to 1 year \n     imprisonment for a first offense, and fine and up to 2 years' \n     imprisonment for a second offense. Other reckless and \n     intentional violations would subject the key holder to a fine \n     of up to $5,000 and up to 6 months' imprisonment.\n       (f) Civil damages.--Persons aggrieved by key holder \n     violations may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages \n     or statutory damages of $5,000, whichever is greater.\n       (g) Defense.--A complete defense is provided if the \n     defendant acted in good faith reliance upon a court order, \n     warrant, grand jury or trial subpoena or statutory \n     authorization.\n       Sec. 2803. Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is \n     required to include in her report to the Administrative \n     Office of the U.S. Courts under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(2), the \n     number of orders and extensions served on key holders to \n     obtain access to decryption keys or decryption assistance. \n     The Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \n     is required to include this information, and the offenses for \n     which the orders were obtained, in the report to Congress \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3).\n       Sec. 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice. \n     Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for the \n     purpose of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the \n     communication of information in furtherance of a federal \n     felony crime to a law enforcement officer, would be subject \n     to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first \n     offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or \n     subsequent offense.\n     Sec. 2805. Freedom to sell encryption products\n       (a) In general.--The Act, legislatively confirms that it is \n     lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption \n     algorithm, key length or implementation used, domestically in \n     the United States or its territories.\n       (b) Control of exports by Secretary of Commerce.--\n     Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of \n     Commerce with control of exports of hardware, software and \n     technology for information security, including encryption for \n     both communications and other stored data, except when the \n     hardware, software or technology is specifically designed or \n     modified for military use.\n       No export license may be required for encryption software \n     and hardware with encryption capabilities that is generally \n     available, including mass market products (i.e., those \n     generally available, sold ``as is'', and designed for \n     installation by the purchaser) or encryption in the public \n     domain and generally accessible. For example, no licenses \n     would be required for encryption products commercially \n     available without restriction and sold ``as is'', such as \n     Netscape's commercially available World Wide Web Browser, \n     which cannot be exported. Similarly, no license would be \n     required to export software and corresponding hardware placed \n     in the public domain and generally accessible, such as Phil \n     Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy program, which has been \n     distributed to the public free of charge via the Internet.\n       In addition, the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the \n     export of encryption software to commercial users in any \n     country to which exports of such software has been approved \n     for use by foreign financial institutions, except when there \n     is substantial evidence that the software will be diverted or \n     modified for military or terrorists' end-use or re-exported \n     without requisite U.S. authorization. Finally, the Secretary \n     of Commerce must authorize the export of computer hardware \n     with encryption capabilities if the Secretary determines that \n     a product with comparable security is commercially available \n     from foreign suppliers without effective restrictions outside \n     the United States.\n       Significantly, the government is authorized to continue \n     controls on countries that pose terrorism concerns, such as \n     Libya, Syria and Iran, or other embargoes countries, such as \n     Cuba and North Korea, pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy \n     Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n       (b) Technical Amendment. The Act adds new chapter 122 and \n     the new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 6. Intelligence activities.

As a member of the \n     computer security and cryptology research community, I have \n     observed firsthand the deleterious effect that the current \n     regulations governing the use and export of cryptography are \n     having on our country's ability to develop a reliable and \n     trustworthy information infrastructure. Your bill takes an \n     important first step toward creating regulations that reflect \n     the modern realities of this increasingly critical \n     technology.\n       Unlike previous government encryption initiatives such as \n     the technically-flawed and unworkable ``Clipper'' chip, your \n     bill re-affirms the role of the marketplace in providing \n     ordinary citizens and businesses with a full range of choices \n     for securing their private information. In particular by \n     freeing mass-market cryptographic software and hardware from \n     the burdensome export controls that govern the international \n     arms trade, the bill will help the American software industry \n     compete, for the first time, in the international market for \n     high-quality security products.\n       Law enforcement need not fear the widespread availability \n     of encryption; indeed, they should welcome and promote it. \n     Encryption thwarts electronic predators by preventing \n     unauthorized access to private data and computer systems, and \n     the use of strong cryptography to protect computer networks \n     is becoming as natural and necessary as the use of locks and \n     burglar alarms to protect our homes and businesses. While \n     criminals, too, might occasionally derive some advantage from \n     the use of cryptography, the benefits of widely-available \n     encryption technology overwhelmingly favor the honest user. \n     By recognizing that those who hold decryption keys on behalf \n     of others are in a special position of trust, your bill is \n     respectful of the privacy of law-abiding citizens without \n     introducing impediments to the government's ability to \n     investigate and prevent crime.\n       I have also examined the new provision designed to \n     discourage the use of cryptography by criminals in the \n     furtherance of a felony, and hope to see your carefully-\n     worded language reinforced by a narrow interpretation in the \n     courts, consistent with your intent.\n       Again, thank you for your continued leadership in this \n     area, and I look forward to doing whatever I can to help you \n     bring encryption regulations in line with the fast-changing \n     reality of this emerging technology.\n           Sincerely,\n     Matt Blaze.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    March 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Leahy. I would like to thank you for \n     introducing the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act. As a \n     member of the computer and information security research \n     community, I am keenly aware of the vital role of \n     cryptography in fostering the development of our information \n     infrastructure.\n       As the author of the book, ``Applied Cryptography'', I have \n     unusual insights into the absurdity of cryptography export \n     restrictions. It is not without irony that one may export my \n     book in paper format, but not electronically. Presumably no \n     rational person believes that the current restrictions \n     actually prevent the spread of cryptography. I believe you \n     recognize this, as evidenced from the strong stance taken in \n     your bill.\n       As the bill recognizes, we can no longer afford to hold on \n     to the obsolete notion that cryptography is the sole province \n     of government communications; the growth of modern networks \n     has irrevocably pushed it into the mainstream. I applaud your \n     leadership towards codifying these principles in a balanced \n     and responsible way. In particular, the bill:\n       Removes the regulatory strangle-hold that has encumbered \n     the development of mass-market security solutions; Recognizes \n     the futility of applying regulations intended to control the \n     international arms trade to even the most mundane and \n     commonly available software; Encourages public confidence in \n     encryption by allowing the marketplace to provide a full \n     range of choices for privacy and security needs; Recognizes \n     the special obligations of keyholders to be vigilant in \n     safeguarding the information entrusted to them, without \n     imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography; Allows the \n     United States to continue its leadership role as a \n     technological innovator; Acknowledges the pivotal role of \n     cryptography in electronic commerce.\n       I continue to have concerns that the new criminal \n     obstruction provision will discourage law abiding citizens \n     from using cryptography. I hope that legislative history and \n     further discussion will demonstrate the narrow intent of this \n     crime.\n       Overall, your bill takes very necessary strides towards \n     ensuring that the protections we take for granted in \n     traditional media keep pace with technology, and I commend \n     your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Schneier.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1996,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As President of the Business Software \n     Alliance (BSA), I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the Encryption Communications Privacy Act of 1996 which I \n     understand you will introduce tomorrow. BSA represents the \n     leading publishers of software for personal computers and the \n     client server environment including Adobe, Autodesk, Bentley, \n     Lotus Development, Microsoft, Novell, Sybase, Symantec and \n     the Santa Cruz Operation.\n       We have had an opportunity to review the legislation and \n     find it a significant step toward placing the U.S. software \n     industry on a level playing field with our foreign \n     competitors. Currently, we are only allowed to export weak \n     (40-bit) encryption. Your legislation would allow us to \n     export generally available software which offers security at \n     prevailing world levels. While many would prefer export \n     restrictions being lifted in their entirety, this legislation \n     at least would place us on an equal footing with our foreign \n     competitors which is critical to the continued success of the \n     U.S. software industry in the global market place.\n       As you well know, today, America's software industry is the \n     envy of the world. U.S. software companies hold an estimated \n     75% worldwide market share for mass market software with \n     exports accounting for more than one-half of revenues for our \n     companies. According to a 1993 study by Economists Inc., the \n     American mass market software industry was the fastest \n     growing industry in the U.S. between 1982 and 1992 and had \n     become larger than all but five manufacturing industries. \n     This translates into jobs here in the U.S.\n       The continued growth and success of our industry is \n     directly threatened by existing U.S. government export \n     controls. For that reason, our companies have consistently \n     made this one of its top policy issues. As importantly, the \n     availability of easy to use, affordable encryption will be \n     essential to the successful development of the Global \n     Information Infrastructure (GII). As more and more \n     transactions are being done on-line, consumers are \n     increasingly demanding software with strong encryption \n     capabilities. In two studies, 90% of the respondents believe \n     information security is important. In one study 37% of the \n     respondents said that they would consider purchasing foreign \n     software with otherwise less desirable features if that \n     software offered data security not available in a U.S. \n     program. Additionally, a recent study shows there are nearly \n     500 foreign encryption products from 28 countries currently \n     available. U.S. export restrictions simply put U.S. industry \n     at a competitive disadvantage. Your bill would address this \n     issue by allowing U.S. industry to export generally available \n     software with strong security features.\n       As you may know, the Administration has attempted to \n     address this issue with a ``64-bit key escrow encryption \n     proposal.'' Under that proposal, in order to be allowed to \n     export software with strong security features, U.S. industry \n     would be required to build a back door into the program with \n     a spare key held by a U.S. government certified agent. After \n     careful and serious deliberation by our members, we concluded \n     that the Administration's approach is fatally flawed and \n     cannot be the basis for progress in this area. We simply have \n     not found a market for such a product. Any resolution must be \n     market driven. Your bill takes a very different approach. It \n     reaffirms Americans right to chose the encryption they use, \n     either with key escrow or without. For those who chose \n     voluntarily to use key holders, your legislation provides \n     standards so that their privacy is not violated. Your \n     legislation allows the market to work. We wholeheartedly \n     endorse this market driven approach.\n       The digital information age and the Global Information \n     Infrastructure present opportunities and challenges to \n     computer users concerned about privacy at home and in their \n     businesses, as well as for the U.S. government. From that \n     point of view, we are all in a similar position. Information \n     security policies for the electronic world are fundamental to \n     the success of the GII and we are pleased to support your \n     legislation which is pro-market, pro-competition, pro-privacy \n     and pro-progress.\n       We look forward to working with you toward the enactment of \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert W. Holleyman II,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Leahy today \nas an original cosponsor of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act. \nSenator Leahy is truly a leader on this issue, and I've had the \npleasure of working on encryption policy with him over the past 3 \nyears. I'm excited to once again join him in this effort to make sense \nout of our national export control policies, and to promote export \nopportunities for American software and hardware producers.\n  As many of my colleagues know, with help from Congresswoman Cantwell \nin the 103d Congress, I was able to persuade the administration to \nstudy the extent to which U.S. companies are stymied by our country's \ncurrent encryption and export control policies.\n  The Department of Commerce released that report last month. And let\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nme just say that there are some findings in this report that we should \nbe aware of, and concerned about. For instance, the report acknowledges \nthere are tremendous international growth opportunities for software \nexporters in the next 5 to 10 years. Unfortunately, the report also \nfinds that most U.S. companies don't pursue international sales because \nour export control laws are too cost prohibitive.\n  Mr. President, there are legitimate national security concerns \nunderpinning the Export Administration Act. However, these outdated \nlaws are no longer relevant to the post-cold-war world we now lived in. \nToday's national security controls should target those items that \nreally need to be controlled in order to maintain national security. \nSimply, they should make better sense; it doesn't make sense to tell a \nU.S. software producer they can't export a product that is already \nwidely available on the world market.\n  Senator Leahy's bill seeks a balanced approach to implementing \nviable, safe, and secure encryption technology on both domestically \nsold products and exported products. It protects our privacy concerns, \nand it lays out the appropriate procedures law enforcement officials \nshould use when obtaining encrypted materials. And, most important, it \nprotects industry ingenuity and prohibits mandatory key escrow.\n  Mr. President, I introduced the Commercial Export Administration Act \nin the 103d Congress. I am pleased Senator Leahy is incorporating my \nlanguage into his bill. My language reduces regulatory redtape and \nmakes it easier to export generally available mass-marketed commercial \nsoftware. Washington State is home to some of the most innovative \nsoftware producers in the world, and they are eager to export their \ngoods. Unfortunately, our export controls keep Washington State's \ncompanies from penetrating the world market. Senator Leahy's bill, \nhowever will fix this problem.\n  We are hearing a lot on the Presidential campaign trail about the \ndamage that comes from trade--how trade hurts our economy and our \nworkers. That's nonsense. My Washington State friends and neighbors \nknow full-well that trade is essential to our State's success. One out \nof every five jobs in Washington State is trade related; and these are \nhighly skilled, family wage jobs that pay 15 percent higher than the \nnational average. Moreover, Washington State's small- and mid-sized \nhigh-technology companies provided over 98,000 jobs in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I mention this because our bill will increase exports \nand enable our high-technology companies to grow further. Higher growth \nmeans more jobs--plain and simple. A recent study revealed that in 1995 \nU.S. exporters lost $60 billion in international sales, and it \nestimates the industry will lose 200,000 potential jobs by the year \n2000. Given the increase in international competition, we can no longer \nafford to persist in holding U.S. companies back from potential world \nsales.\n  This legislation makes good sense. First and foremost, it ensures \nevery American's right to use any appropriate encryption available on \nthe market. It also sets out necessary guidelines that should accompany \nany policy regarding the use of key escrow. And finally, it paves the \nway for new, streamlined export policies.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is badly needed, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 1588. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel Kalypso; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                      JONES ACT WAIVER LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprovide a certificate of documentation for the vessel Kalypso.\n  The Kalypso (vessel number 566349) is a 36-foot recreational vessel \nowned by Ronald Kent of Anchorage, AK. It was built in Largo, FL, in \n1974. The vessel was apparently at one time owned by a non-U.S. \ncitizen, and it is therefore ineligible for documentation under the \nJones Act. Mr. Kent intends to use the vessel for charter fishing and \nsightseeing in Prince William Sound, AK.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsements for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel Kalypso (vessel number 566349).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1589. A bill to provide for a rotating schedule for regional \nprimaries for Presidential elections, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                  the presidential primary act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, reacting to a proposal which I am about to \nintroduce in bill form, a columnist and cartoonist on the Seattle Post \nIntelligencer wrote, in yesterday's edition of that newspaper:\n\n       My English friend, Carolyn, having recently arrived in the \n     United States from London, asked me to explain how Americans \n     decide who will be their President.\n       We were at a social occasion just before I headed up to New \n     Hampshire to witness the process firsthand. The longer I \n     rambled on, detailing the haphazard series of primaries and \n     caucuses, the influence of media expectations and money, the \n     nearly endless campaigns that begin almost as soon as the \n     winner of the previous round has been inaugurated, the more I \n     thought how bizarre it must sound to a person from another \n     country. . .\n       To the extent that the word ``system'' implies rationality \n     and forethought, we really do not have a system for choosing \n     nominees for president of the United States.\n\n  This bill also reflects a cartoon that this same individual had in \nthe newspaper about 3 or 4 weeks ago. In that cartoon, several of the \nFounding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander \nHamilton are ``Brainstorming at the Constitutional Convention.'' Ben \nFranklin turns to his colleagues in jest and rattles off an idea for a \nPresidential election system, with the following statement:\n\n       ``The President shall be chosen from among those persons \n     who can hone complex ideas into simplistic sound bites, \n     defame the character of their opponents, hide their own \n     blemishes from an intrusive swarming press corps and''--get \n     this!--``win the most votes from a tiny number of citizens in \n     a remote corner of New England!\"\n\n  While this was simply a newspaper cartoon figure, it nonetheless \ncomes all too close to describing the way in which we pick nominees for \nPresident of the United States at the present time.\n  A relatively small handful of voters in two or three States are wooed \nfor more than a year while the rest of the country is ignored, and the \ninfluence of their votes, or even their sound bites on radio and on \ntelevision, has a disproportionate impact on the way in which we \nnominate our Presidents. At the same time, it means that the candidates \nmust have very narrow platforms, appealing to this not highly \nrepresentative group of American citizens.\n  It also has the paradox, or had the paradox this year, of requiring \nmajor candidates to ignore States that somehow or another are deemed to \nbe less influential. We saw an example this year when most of the \ncandidates skipped primaries and caucuses in Louisiana and Delaware for \nfear of upsetting States that, for an extended period of time, had gone \nearlier than they did.\n  This is absolutely ridiculous, and we need a new and better system. \nWe need a system that empowers and enfranchises all of the citizens of \nthe United States equally; that treats the nominating process in both \nparties as being vitally important to the future of democratic \ninstitutions in the United States; that does so fairly; that causes the \ncampaigns to speak about major national and regional issues on a much \nbroader focus than they have at the present time. So, this is the time, \nit seems to me, when all of this is green in our memories, that we \nshould begin the process toward a new system.\n  As a consequence, the bill that I am introducing today, together with \nmy distinguished friend and colleague, the junior Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman], creates a simple system of regional \nprimaries. There will be four\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nregions, each including either 12 or 13 States, all required to hold \nprimaries respectively on the first Tuesday in March--incidentally, \ntoday--the first Tuesday in April, and in May, and then in June, with \nthe regions rotating first position, second position, third position, \nfourth position over four cycles, or 16 years. So the people in each \nregion would go first once every four Presidential elections and last \nevery fourth Presidential election.\n\n  The delegates would be bound for at least two ballots on the vote for \nthe candidate to carry their State, or their congressional district, \nand leave the rules as to how the votes are divided to be determined by \neach individual State.\n  So the people of each State will have an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in and to influence the nomination in that process. Instead \nof 4 or 5 percent of the people of the United States having a \ndisproportionate impact on the outcome, all of the people of the United \nStates will have an equal opportunity, and, equally significant, the \ncandidates for President will have had the campaign in all corners of \nthe United States and in every State to be affected.\n  I believe, Mr. President, it will probably give a slightly greater \nadvantage to those candidates who are not independently wealthy or do \nnot have huge campaign chests because, with 12 or 13 primaries going on \nat the same time, they could attempt to establish a niche in one or two \nor three of those States and become well known, win one or two, and be \nmajor candidates by the time the second round comes around.\n  Not at all incidentally, Mr. President, it would place the nomination \nprocess a little bit closer to the national convention, and that \nperhaps would slightly shorten the entire process.\n  I think, in summary, Mr. President, that we should do everything we \npossibly can to improve the nomination system for President and see to \nit that all of our people have equal opportunity to participate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the emergency salvage timber sale program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n         the public participation in timber salvage act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect serious problems with a law passed by this Congress at the \nbeginning of last year. This law was intended to bypass environmental \nsafeguards to speed up tree harvesting in national forests.\n  Mr. President, this law, commonly known as the salvage rider, has not \nworked. Instead, it has reopened old wounds in the Pacific Northwest, \nand sparked major controversy throughout the region. It has once again \ncast political uncertainty over working families, and blatantly cut \nregular people out of decisions over their own forests.\n  In short, what was billed as a commonsense approach to removing dead \ntrees has turned out to be another case of legislative overkill on the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, it doesn't have to be this way. My bill will defuse a \ntense situation, provide certainty for workers, and restore a role for \nthe public in forest management. Let me explain how.\n  The salvage rider has three problems: It allows large, old-growth \ntimber sales previously declared illegal to be harvested without regard \nto fish and wildlife concerns; it could relegate the Northwest forest \nplan to the trash heap; and it cuts the public completely out of any \nfinal decision to harvest trees in national forests.\n  First, my bill resolves the old-growth issue by suspending timber \nsales commonly referred to as section 318 sales, and requiring the \nForest Service to provide substitute timber volume or buy these sales \nback from the purchaser. In either case, the purchaser is held \nharmless, and so are the sensitive old-growth areas.\n  Second, my bill expedites implementation of the Northwest forest plan \nby making sure resources are available to complete recommended \nwatershed analyses. The primary goal of this provision is to protect \nthe scientific validity of option 9, so that timber sales can move \nahead and private land owners can proceed with their habitat \nconservation plans.\n  This is a very important point: The State of Washington and every \nmajor timber land owner in the region are working on comprehensive \nhabitat conservation plans. Every single one of these groups assume \nfull implementation of option 9 as the basis of fish and wildlife \nprotection in their own plans. If option 9 goes belly up, all of these \nhabitat plans are worthless.\n  Third, my bill establishes a permanent, reasonable salvage program. \nThe key work is permanent. I propose moving away from ad hoc forest \nplanning by Congress, switching gears with every swing of the political \npendulum. Instead, we should put a long-term program in place, \nsomething everyone can plan around, year in and year out.\n\n  Let me be very clear: This is not about salvage logging; this is \nabout public input and accountability. Salvage logging is appropriate--\nand sometimes necessary--is done right. My bill sets up a program that \nallows the agencies to target salvage logging on an expedited basis \nwhen needed, under the full scrutiny of the public eye. If the agencies \ncan defend their proposals, then they will go forward unimpeded.\n  Mr. President, I remember what it was like last spring. There was a \nnew feeling in Congress; the people had called for change, so the \nleadership was running through bills left and right in the heat of the \nmoment. A lot of things passed that might not have stood up under \ncloser scrutiny, and this was one of them.\n  The irony here is thick: The salvage rider gave the Federal \nGovernment more power, and less accountability. As a result, the public \nhas no say in how their own national forests are managed. I don't think \nthe people wanted that kind of change.\n  People say this issue is too controversial to resolve, and that over \nthe years it has become too polarized. To watch the debate, you might \nthink that's true. Any person's idea is immediately rejected by someone \nelse. And that may be the case with my bill. But if we keep rejecting \neverything, we will be left with nothing, except more chaos.\n  With all the controversy, people ask me, ``why bother?'' I'll tell \nyou why: Because I care deeply about the Northwest. I care deeply about \nwhat government is saying to people about tough issues; more often than \nnot, we're telling people that someone, somewhere, has to lose. That's \nnot what I'm about. Most of all, I care deeply about the kind of legacy \nwe're leaving for our children in this world.\n  We simply cannot continue the way of divide and conquer.\n  There are several ideas out there about how to proceed on this issue, \nfrom doing nothing at all, to repealing the salvage rider outright. My \nbill cuts a middle path. It says to workers: Salvage logging is \nsomething we should always be able to do. It says to conservationists: \nYou will have an opportunity to hold the administration to its word. It \nsays to large landowners: Your habitat planning efforts will pay off.\n  In my view, people ought to be willing to settle for this as a \nresponsible approach.\n  Mr. President, I intend to pursue this matter on the continuing \nresolution when it comes before the full Senate. It is my understanding \nthat the CR will contain limited language on this issue, but I do not \nbelieve it will solve the problem. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to explain further some of the \nconcepts contained in this bill.\n\n\n      replacement volume for section 2001(k) Sales, Section 102(b)\n\n  The Secretary and contract holder/sale purchaser should immediately \nbegin negotiations to locate alternative volume agreeable to both \nparties. Because these purchasers have owned these contracts for half a \ndecade, the Secretary should make every effort to find and plan \nenvironmentally sound timber sales or modifications of the existing \nsale. The Secretary should direct agency personnel to make substitute \nvolume a priority.\n  New sales or modifications of existing sales must comply with all \napplicable law, forest and regional plans, and standards and \nguidelines. Specifically, they must comply with the Northwest forest \nplan and, when developed, the plan--or plans--implementing the Interior \nColumbia Basin ecosystem management project. Furthermore, they must \ncomply with Forest Service and BLM standards and guidelines, including \nPACFISH, INFISH, and Eastside screens.\n\n\n                   bidding rights, section 102(c)(2)\n\n  This bill contains provisions allowing for purchasers holding timber \nsale contracts for sales that do not comply with environmental or \nnatural resource laws to exchange the value of those contracts for \nbidding credits. Such a concept has operated for mineral rights in at \nleast two other natural resource laws--see Public Law 97-466, 96 Stat. \n2540; and Public Law 96-401, 94 Stat. 1702.\n  This bill authorizes monetary credits based on the negotiated value \nof the purchaser's timber sale contract. The bidding credits extend to \nthe purchaser and his or her successors and assigns to use in whole or \npart payment for future timber sales on Forest Service sales where the \ncredits originated therefrom or on Bureau of Land Management sales, \nwhere the credits originated therefrom.\n\n\n        salvage sales initiated under the rider, section 103(a)\n\n  Sales initiated under section 2001 (b) or (d) are all those begun \nsince passage of the Emergency Timber Salvage Act, on July 27, 1995. \nTitle III of this bill applies to sales where its provisions are \ntimely. For example, if a sale has been advertised, this law does not \nrequire the agency to host an interdisciplinary team meeting with \npublic participation. All sales that have not been awarded are subject \nto appeal under the provision of title III.\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n            appeal of awarded salvage sales, section 103(b)\n\n  In section 103(b), I address sales that have been awarded to timber \nsale purchasers under the salvage and Northwest forest plan provisions \nof the rescissions bill. I give the public an opportunity to appeal \nimmediately and thereby suspend sales that are causing environmental \ndamage. The administration insists that it is complying with all \nenvironmental laws, and I want to give the public an opportunity to \nprove that is the case.\n  However, the agencies were required by the law at the time these \nsales were awarded--section 2001 of Public Law 104-19--to take \nprocedural short cuts. I do not believe the purchasers should be denied \ntheir contract rights while the public challenges the agencies for \nobeying the law's procedural timelines. On the other hand, I do not \nwant any sales that cause environmental harm to go forward. Thus, I try \nto strike a balance between these competing needs by limiting appeals \nto substantive complaints.\n  I understand that often substantive claims are raised in the context \nof procedural laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act. Some \ncourts have suggested that NEPA is a purely procedural statute. The \nterm ``procedural'' in this bill is not meant to eliminate claims \nregarding environmental harm, even if they could be characterized as a \npurely procedural challenge. Let me give some examples.\n  Where an agency had documentation in which a biologist recommended a \nsale not go forward, but the agency allowed the sale to be awarded to a \npurchaser, then such documentation could be the basis for an appeal and \nwould not be considered a procedural challenge. Another example would \nbe where the agency went forward with a sale prior to obtaining the \nconcurrence from the National Marine Fisheries Service or the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service regarding whether an activity will or will not \njeopardize a species under the Endangered Species Act. This should not \nbe characterized as a procedural challenge. A final example would be \nthat section 2001 of Public Law 109-14 required the agencies to, in \ntheir discretion, file only environmental assessments, not \nenvironmental impact statements. Because both EA's and EIS's should \ndisclose the effects of a sale on the environment, a challenge could \nnot be made simply because the agency published such information in an \nEA, rather than an EIS. However, if the documentation, no matter what \nits title, failed to disclose the effects on the environment, it would \nbe open to challenge.\n\n\n              Funding to Implement Title III, Section 304\n\n  In this bill, the agencies are given discretion at the forest \nsupervisor's and district manager's levels to combine several funds and \naccounts to implement this bill. The intent is to provide adequate \nfunds for such activities as salvage timber sales, stewardship \nprograms, watershed restoration, including road decommission, and data \ninventory and collection. This fund may not be used to carry out any \nactivities that violate the forest plans, agency standards and \nguidelines, or the intent of this bill. This flexibility of funding \nwill allow the agency to address critical salvage situations, correct \nan apparent agencywide problem with inadequate inventory of forest \nresources, and address a backlog of stewardship and restoration \nprojects.\n\n\n           Pilot Program for Harvest Contracting, Section 306\n\n  The legislation authorizes a pilot program to change the way salvage \ntimber sales are undertaken on Forest Service and BLM lands. The Forest \nService currently sells timber by planning and preparing the sale, \noffering the sale to bidders, and administering the timber harvest. \nHarvest contracting or stewardship contracting is an alternative to the \ncurrent method, entailing a two-step process: A timber harvest contract \nor contracts to cut and remove wood, and log sales from the collected \nand sorted wood.\n  There are several advantages to harvest contracting, including \nallowing the agencies to better implement ecosystem management, \nproviding an opportunity to improve tree health without a large \ncomponent of merchandise timber, eliminating below-cost timber sales, \nand reducing timber theft.\n  Specifically, harvest contracting would improve ecosystem management \nby basing contracts on the work performed and the resulting conditions \nof the forest. This would eliminate incentives for purchasers to \ninappropriately harvest large, lucrative trees. This pilot project \nencourages harvest so smaller, less valuable trees that have \nproliferated in many years of the West due to fire suppression and \nhistoric timber practices, such as highgrading. These young, dense \nstands are expensive to harvest, but many scientists believe it is \nimportant to remove them in order to restore health to timber stands.\n  The primary financial benefit is that gross timber sale revenues \nwould be substantially higher because purchasers would not have road \nconstruction or logging costs--they would simply buy the wood from the \nlog yard. Because the agencies may not be as efficient as a private \nenterprise, the agencies should consider contracting the log marketing \nbusiness to a private business.\n  A secondary financial benefit would be the elimination of many \nopportunities for timber sale fraud and theft. Under harvest \ncontracting, the scaling system would be eliminated and the contractor \nwould not benefit from cutting trees designated to be left standing \nbecause of the fixed contract price and, in fact, might be penalized \nfor not performing to contract specifications. That is why the bill \ncontains a provision limiting the ability of the contractor who \nperforms the contract from also selling the harvested wood.\n  Finally, this pilot project should benefit timber workers in several \nways. First, salvage timber sales or thinning sales that were \npreviously uneconomical to harvest would be offered, providing jobs for \nloggers and other resource experts. Second, timber companies would be \npurchasing wood after seeing its quality and knowing the exact board \nfootage, rather than hypothesizing about the quantity of wood contained \nin a standing timber sale and not knowing how weather or timber markets \nmight affect the ability to harvest or make a profit from the wood. \nThird, companies would not be subject to changes or delays in ability \nto harvest based on legal or political changes as they held long-term \ntimber sale contracts; they would simply purchase wood.\n\n  While harvest contracting appears to offer many benefits from many \ndifferent aspects, it remains untested on a large scale. This bill \nrequires the Forest Service and BLM to establish pilot programs. This \nshould provide guidance as to the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks \nof the concept.\n  In addition, Senator Max Baucus has introduced a bill, S. 1259, that \nalso establishes a demonstration program to use stewardship \ncontracting. The concepts contained in this bill were developed by a \ngroup of conservationists, forest product industry representatives, and \ncommunity leaders. This should also offer guidance as how to implement \nthis pilot program.\n\n\n                   Forest Timber Stand Study Title IV\n\n  The Forest Service has initiated a similar study to that required in \nthis bill. The Western Forest Health Initiative should be used as a \nfoundation for the requirements of this bill. There is no need for the \nagencies to be duplicative, rather this bill's provisions should be \nsupplemental to the work done in the WFHI.\n\n\n                      Collaborative Decisionmaking\n\n  Early drafts of this bill included use of collaborative \ndecisionmaking. The concept was dropped from the bill because it was \ntoo difficult to described in legislative language. However, this \ndecisionmaking process was very effective when it was used to plan and \ndevelop timber salvage sales after the wildfires of 1994 on the \nWenatchee National Forest. The process was developed by Steve Daniels \nand Gregg Walker, of Oregon State University, as a tool to support \necosystem-based management of forest.\n  Collaborative learning is a framework designed for natural resource \nmanagement situations that have the following features: Multiple \nparties and issues, deeply held values and cultural difference, \nscientific and technical uncertainty, and legal and jurisdictional \nconstraints. The key notions that define collaborative learning are: \nRedefining the task away from solving a problem to one of improving a \nsituation; viewing the situation as a set of interrelated systems; \ndefining improvement as desirable and feasible change;\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nrecognizing that considerable learning about science, issues and value \ndifferences--will have to occur before implementable improvements are \npossible; and promoting working through the issues and perspectives of \nthe situation.\n  Because of its success on the Wenatchee National Forest, I recommend \nthe agencies consider use of collaborative decisionmaking procedures to \nincrease valuable and productive participation by various interest \nparties.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S.J. Res. 50.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution that disapproves of the administration's certification of \nMexico. I am joined by my colleagues Senator Helms, Senator McConnell, \nand Senator Pressler in presenting this resolution and urge its \nimmediate passage.\n  As a result of the amount of drugs that are found to have come into \nthe United States through Mexico, we know that Mexico has failed to \nstem the international drug trade. If this administration does not want \nto recognize Mexico's failure, then it is up to Congress to do so. I \nwill speak on this issue in more detail tomorrow. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 50\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That pursuant \n     to subsection (d) of section 490 of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), Congress disapproves the \n     determination of the President with respect to Mexico for \n     fiscal year 1996 that is contained in the certification \n     (transmittal no.   ) submitted to Congress by the President \n     under subsection (b) of that section on     , 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, today marks the sixth annual \ncelebration of National Sportsmanship Day. Designed to promote ethics, \nintegrity, and good sportsmanship in athletics, as well as in society \nas a whole, National Sportsmanship Day was established by the Institute \nfor International Sport at the University of Rhode Island.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the Institute for International Sport \ngained national attention 3 years ago as the sponsor of the inaugural \nWorld Scholar-Athlete Games in Newport, RI. More than 1,600 student-\nathletes from 108 countries participated in athletic and scholastic \ncompetitions. In 1995, the institute sponsored the Rhode Island \nScholar-Athlete Games, which served as a model for similar contests \nacross the country.\n  Schools and colleges from across the United States are encouraged to \nparticipate in National Sportsmanship Day. This year, some 6,000 \nschools representing all 50 States and 61 nations are expected to take \npart in the celebration. Working with material provided by the \ninstitute, classrooms around the globe will take this opportunity to \ndebate questions related to gender equity, competition, and fair play. \nIn addition, for the third year in a row USA Today is sponsoring a \nnational essay contest.\n  Another key component of National Sportsmanship Day is the Student-\nAthlete Outreach Program. This program encourages high schools and \ncolleges to send talented student-athletes to local elementary and \nmiddle schools to promote good sportsmanship and serve as positive role \nmodels. These students help young people build self-esteem, respect for \nphysical fitness, and an appreciation for the value of teamwork.\n  National Sportsmanship Day is recognized by the President's Council \non Physical Fitness and Sports. In a letter to the institute, Florence \nGriffith\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nJoyner and Tom McMillen, cochairs of the President's Council, point out \n``the valuable life skills and lessons that are learned by youth and \nadults through participation in sports.'' I will ask that the full text \nof the letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I am delighted that National Sportsmanship Day was initiated in Rhode \nIsland and I applaud all the students and teachers who are \nparticipating in this inspiring event today. Likewise, I congratulate \nall of those at the Institute for International Sport, whose hard work \nand dedication over the last 6 years have made this program so \nsuccessful.\n  I ask that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                           The President's Council\n\n\n                               on Physical Fitness and Sports,\n\n                                       Washington, DC, March 1996.\n       The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports is \n     pleased to recognize March 5, 1996, as National Sportsmanship \n     Day. The valuable life skills and lessons that are learned by \n     youth and adults through participation in sports cannot be \n     overestimated.\n       Participation in sports contributes to all aspects of our \n     lives, such as heightened awareness of the value of fair \n     play, ethics, integrity, honesty and sportsmanship, as well \n     as improving levels of physical fitness and health.\n       The President's Council congratulates the Institute for \n     International Sport for its continued leadership in \n     organizing this important day.

Mr. President, the Senate majority leader has said \nthat he intends to stop the big spectrum giveaway in the \ntelecommunications bill. The Senator from Kansas is referring to \nspectrum that the FCC has set aside for broadcasters to use to convert \nto digital television. He wants this spectrum to be put up for auction, \nwhich he believes will net billions of dollars in revenues for the \nFederal Treasury. And the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee has \nannounced that he will soon hold hearings on this issue.\n  I don't think the real question is not whether there should be \nauctions of broadcast spectrum. Rather, the question is when. Some, \nlike the majority leader, have proposed up front auctions of spectrum \nintended for the transition to digital television. Others, such as \nmyself, believe that the auctions should occur on the analog spectrum, \nafter the transition occurs.\n  I am a strong supporter of auctions as a means of allocating \nspectrum. As my colleagues know, I joined the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, in sponsoring an amendment last year which called for \nauctioning spectrum for a direct broadcast satellite license. The FCC \nconcluded the auction for this license earlier this year, netting \nnearly $700 million for the Federal Treasury.\n  I think if my colleagues will look through the rhetoric and focus on \nthe serious policy consequences of this debate, they will realize that \nthe very future of free over-the-air broadcasting is at stake. If up \nfront auctions are required for the digital spectrum, as suggested by \nsome of my colleagues, it is local television stations and the \nconsumers who rely upon them as their only source of television that \nwill be the losers.\n  At issue in this debate is the current plan of the FCC to allocate an \nadditional 6 MHz of spectrum to broadcasters. The purpose of this \nallocation is to allow broadcast television to convert their broadcast \nsignals from analog to digital, which will be a necessity in the \ndigital world that is rapidly approaching the video industry, and in \nfact, is already here with direct broadcast satellite. Digital \nconversion will permit broadcast television to keep pace with the vast \nchanges in telecommunications technology, and thereby help to make \nbroadcast TV competitive.\n  The FCC is not planning on giving spectrum to the broadcasters. \nRather, it intends to loan the additional spectrum to broadcasters for \na period of years in order to permit a transition from analog to \ndigital. After a certain point, the broadcasters will return their \ncurrent analog spectrum--but not until Americans have become equipped \nwith digital televisions. That has been the plan for years. The process \nof converting to digital television was born by the FCC over a decade \nago. It is only in the rush of the moment when politicians are \nsearching for revenue to balance the budget, that this plan has come \ninto question.\n\n\n                       David and Goliath Auctions\n\n  Some believe that broadcasters should have to pay for this spectrum--\nrather than receive it on a loan basis. If the spectrum is placed up \nfor auction, there is very little chance that local broadcast stations \nwill have the resources to compete with the giant telecommunications \ncorporations that want the spectrum for subscriber-based services. The \nproposals talked about up to this point will permit anyone to bid for \nthe spectrum. Thus, the telecommunications giants like AT, MCI, the \nRBOC's, Microsoft, and others will be competing against local \ntelevision stations for the spectrum. The fact is, up-front auctions \nmean that broadcast stations will not have a chance at the digital \nspectrum, and therefore, will never have the opportunity to compete in \na digital world.\n  Everyone needs to realize how the cards will be stacked in this kind \nof auction. When we talk about broadcasters having to compete in an \nauction for this spectrum, we are talking about little Davids going up \nagainst Goliath telecommunications corporations. The auctions will be \nbetween small, locally owned stations bidding against large, national \ncorporations. The vast majority of broadcast stations in this country \nare small, locally owned stations and many of these stations have well \nunder $1 million in pretax revenues. Local broadcast stations cannot \nsuccessfully compete against other interests vying for the spectrum. \nThe other interests who plan to use the spectrum for more profitable \nsubscriber-based services will simply overwhelm the local broadcasters' \nefforts.\n  Even if we assume that broadcasters would win the licenses at an \nauction, this would not ensure that broadcasters will have the \nopportunity to compete with other digital-quality services. A costly \nfight for the spectrum could make digital conversion financially \nprohibitive. We are told that local broadcast stations are going to \nhave to invest nearly $10 million per station to convert to digital. \nInvesting in digital equipment and technology for small locally owned \nstations such as those in my home state of North Dakota is going to be \nchallenging enough. Add on top of the equipment costs a sizable fee for \nthe spectrum, and digital conversion for broadcasters will never become \na reality. Tomorrow's TV will be like today's AM radio when the rest of \nthe video world goes digital.\n\n\n                     Analog Versus Digital Auctions\n\n  The administration has a different and equally troublesome proposal \nto auction the analog broadcast spectrum. Under the administration's \nproposal, broadcasters would have to accelerate the giveback of the \nanalog spectrum after completing the conversion to digital. A 15-20 \nyear process would be crammed in a 10-year window under this approach. \nWhile I strongly support the notion that broadcasters should have to \ngive back the analog spectrum after converting to digital, and I \nfurther support the notion that this should be auctioned, the \nadministration's proposal is seriously flawed because the acceleration \nis totally unrealistic. Under this approach, broadcasters would be \nrequired to vacate the analog spectrum they are currently using by the \nyear 2005.\n  The consequences under this approach fall largely on the American \nconsumer. When the broadcasters stop sending analog signals, existing \ntelevision sets will be useless. Thus, under this approach, the \nadministration is asking that all Americans replace all existing \ntelevision sets with new, yet to be manufactured digital sets, within \n10 years. The cost to the American consumer will likely exceed any \nrevenue gained from this accelerated auction.\n  As I stated earlier, there really should be no question about whether \nor not broadcast spectrum should be auctioned. The timing of the \nauction is the question. It seems to me that the best\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\npolicy approach should guide this timing--not budget pressures. If we \nask ourselves what is the best policy--what is best for the public \ninterest and American consumers--we must conclude that broadcasters \nought to be given the opportunity to convert to digital television. \nOnce that conversion has been successfully completed, then the analog \nspectrum that is currently being used should be made available through \nan auction. If this process cannot realistically be completed within \nthe arbitrary 7-year budget cycle we have created for ourselves, then \nwe should not force ourselves into making a serious policy mistake.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Broadcast television is the universal video service in this country. \nIn many rural and remote areas, where cable is not available, it is the \nonly video service. Currently, a little more than one-third of \nAmericans do not subscribe to cable. That's 33 million TV households \nthat have no choice but to rely upon broadcast television. In addition, \nover 60 percent of all the TV sets in the United States--close to 138 \nmillion--are not hooked to cable.\n  If the FCC is permitted to move forward with its plan to allocate the \nneeded spectrum for digital conversion, consumers will continue to have \naccess to free television. Converting to digital will not give \nbroadcasters a leg up--it is a necessity in the new digital age. \nRather, it is consumers that will lose if this conversion does not \noccur. I am convinced that up front auctions for this spectrum will \nresult in fewer choices for consumers. In areas where cable is \navailable--and in homes where it is affordable--it will mean fewer \nchoices. But for one-third of the population, it will mean no choice.\n  In my judgment, this is too high a price to pay for the short-term \nrevenue gain in up front auctions. My concern is the future of free \nover-the-air television--not a financial giveaway to the broadcast \nindustry. I urge my colleagues to examine this issue carefully. It is \nnot the corporate welfare as some have claimed. Rather, it is a \nquestion of the survival of our local television stations and the \nuniversal service that only they can provide. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the proposal of up front auctions and the unrealistic \nacceleration of auctioning the analog spectrum. Let's not be tempted by \nthe revenue, instead carefully examine the policy implications behind \nspectrum auctions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1528-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          RECENT DEVELOPMENTS TOWARD PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, much has happened since the Irish \nRepublican Army broke its cease-fire with two bloody bombings in \nLondon. Those cowardly acts cast doubt on the viability of the entire \npeace process. But the people rose up en mass, as I had a feeling they \nwould. Tens of thousands demonstrated in the streets of Dublin and \nelsewhere, demanding that the perpetrators of the violence give them \nback their peace.\n  Responding to the will of the people, the Irish and British \nGovernments reached agreement on a way forward, including a date of \nJune 10 for full-party talks. The peace process is back on track and \nmoving ahead, and Sinn Fein and the IRA should waste no time in seizing \nthis opportunity. Their participation is needed if lasting peace is to \nbe achieved. As Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said in an eloquent \nspeech to the Dail Eireann on February 29, the ``fixed date surely now \noffers the basic assurances that the republican movement has sought. \nGiven the intolerable human cost, and the grave political damage caused \nby the violence to date, how can the IRA explain the continuation, for \none more day, of its renewed campaign?''\n  Mr. President, Foreign Minister Spring has been on a relentless quest \nfor peace in Northern Ireland for much of his distinguished career. I \nknow his hopes were dashed when the IRA ended its cease-fire, as were \nall of ours. But he did not lose hope. He persevered, and we all owe \nhim and Prime Minister John Bruton our support and admiration for their \ndetermination, their fairness, and their commitment to a better life \nfor all the people on that island.\n  I ask that Foreign Minister Spring's February 29 speech be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n  Statement by Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring, \n                     Dail Eireann, 29 February 1996\n\n       The British and Irish Governments have long shared a common \n     analysis and a common objective: a comprehensive political \n     settlement based on consent. We have also been united in \n     agreement that this objective can only be attained through \n     all party negotiations addressing comprehensively all the \n     relevant relationships and issues in an inter-locking three-\n     stranded process. The necessity for all-party negotiations is \n     also appreciated by all parties in Northern Ireland.\n       Where they, and we, have differed, has been on how to \n     proceed into such negotiations. Was it possible to ensure \n     that, on the one\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n     hand, all parties could enter into such negotiations freely, \n     on a basis of equality, and without prejudice to their \n     fundamental aspirations, and, on the other hand, that all \n     could negotiate in full confidence that there was a basic \n     commitment all round to exclusively peaceful methods and to \n     the democratic process?\n       This conundrum has dominated discussions between the two \n     Governments, and wider debate, for the last year. It has been \n     a difficult and frustrating period. Disputes over a wide \n     range of complex and interconnected, but ultimately \n     secondary, issues have been permitted to obscure the \n     fundamental point, that there is an overwhelming consensus \n     for peace, and for agreement between the people who share \n     this island. Debate about questions of substance has been \n     crowded out by debate about questions of procedure.\n       The appalling prospect that the peace process might run \n     into the sands has loomed before us. In their mass \n     demonstrations last Sunday, the people underlined their \n     determination that this could not be allowed to happen. Even \n     before yesterday's Communique was written, the wider Irish \n     public had demonstrated that the peace does indeed belong to \n     all the people.\n       The two Governments agreed at the end of November that is \n     was their firm aim to launch all-party negotiations by the \n     end of February--that is, today. A clear and unalterable \n     timetable leading to negotiations on 10 June has now been put \n     in place. The timescale now envisaged is consistent with the \n     implications of an elective process, the possibility of which \n     was signalled in the November communique.\n       The essential point agreed at the summit is that there is a \n     fixed date on which all-party negotiations will begin. This \n     is a firm and unambiguous commitment. Neither Government has \n     sought to enter any qualifications, to hedge or to \n     equivocate.\n       We now see a definite commitment that the two Governments \n     and the Northern parties will sit down together to begin to \n     fashion that lasting settlement which is required to underpin \n     peace and to allow for a new beginning in all three core \n     relationships.\n       The need for negotiations has been acknowledged on all \n     sides. We want them because, objectively, they are necessary. \n     They would be necessary even if the paramilitary \n     organizations had never existed, because there is a political \n     conflict that must be resolved.\n       Nor can the will of the people for negotiations leading to \n     an agreement founded on consent be thwarted by violence. The \n     Taoiseach and the Prime Minister resolved that neither \n     violence, nor the threat of violence, would be allowed to \n     influence the course of negotiations, or preparations for \n     negotiations. They also agreed that the IRA's abandonment of \n     its cessation of violence was a fundamental breach of the \n     declared basis on which both Governments had engaged Sinn \n     Fein in political dialogue. They reiterated what has already \n     been stated more than once in this House, that the resumption \n     of full political dialogue with Sinn Fein requires the \n     restoration of the ceasefire.\n       The vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and \n     South, who utterly repudiate the use of violence for any \n     purpose whatever, can be assured that there will be no \n     bending of the principle that violence has no place in any \n     political process.\n       Equally, the Governments have emphasized that they are \n     determined to press on in the search for political agreement, \n     irrespective of whether the republican movement makes it \n     possible for Sinn Fein to rejoin that quest or not.\n       Nevertheless, a fundamental objective of the peace process \n     has always been to offer a meaningful political alternative \n     to violence. Negotiations conducted on a fully inclusive \n     basis, and in the absence both of violence and of security \n     counter-measures, have always seemed more likely in the long \n     run to produce a stable agreement in which all could \n     acquiesce. It is the hope of the two Governments, \n     accordingly, that the negotiations will be fully inclusive, \n     with all parties being able to participate in them. We call \n     on Sinn Fein, and the IRA, to make Sinn Fein's participation \n     in the process of such negotiations possible.\n       On 15 February, the President of Sinn Fein said that ``the \n     absence of negotiations led to the breakdown. The \n     commencement of negotiations therefore provides the way \n     forward. Any new process must contain copperfastened and \n     unambiguous public assurances that all party talks will be \n     initiated by both Governments at the earliest possible \n     date.''\n       All-party negotiations will begin on 10 June. While many \n     would have wished for an earlier date, we wanted to be sure \n     that the appointed date was realistic and could be fixed \n     without doubt. This fixed date surely now offers the basic \n     assurances that the republican movement has sought. Given the \n     intolerable human cost, and the grave political damage caused \n     by the violence to date, how can the IRA explain the \n     continuation, for one more day, of its renewed campaign? It \n     is up to it to decide its own course. I cannot pretend to \n     know how the minds of its leaders work. But I expect that all \n     those with influence upon it will do what they can to point \n     out to it the straightforward and positive implications of \n     agreement on a fixed date and timetable for negotiations.\n       The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister both recognized that \n     confidence building measures will be necessary in the course \n     of all-party negotiations. Negotiations are a dynamic \n     process, depending on the interplay of personalities and \n     arguments, and not a matter of static calculation. As one \n     such measure, all participants would need to make clear at \n     the beginning of negotiations their total and absolute \n     commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence \n     set out in the Mitchell Report. These principles offer \n     essential guarantees that negotiations will not be affected \n     by violence or by the threat of violence, and that they will \n     address and, as part of their outcome, achieve, the total and \n     verifiable decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons.\n       All parties will also have to address, as a high priority, \n     the Report's proposals on decommissioning. Negotiations must, \n     in a nutshell, deal fully and satisfactorily with this issue.\n       But decommissioning is by no means the only item on the \n     agenda, nor should the commitments we seek be exploited to \n     avoid serious negotiation on the many other questions to be \n     addressed. The two Governments have been at pains to stress \n     that confidence is required all round if the negotiations are \n     to gain the momentum necessary for their success. The parties \n     must have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process \n     of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the \n     legitimate concerns of their traditions, and the need for new \n     political arrangements with which all can identify. \n     Negotiations must be for real, and must be undertaken in good \n     faith. Every participant has the right to expect that every \n     other participant will make a genuine effort to understand \n     opposing perspectives and to seek accommodation.\n       A heavy onus will rest on all of us. For all to gain, each \n     must be prepared to change. A flexible and accommodating \n     approach will be essential. For example, I was heartened by \n     the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party's recent paper, The \n     Democratic Imperative, displayed some understanding of the \n     basis of the nationalist requirement for meaningful North/\n     South links. I hope that all parties, including the \n     Unionists, will feel able, both before and throughout the \n     negotiations, to prove to others their determination to forge \n     a new and all-embracing accord.\n       The Unionist parties have stressed that for them an \n     elective process is of crucial importance in enabling them to \n     go to the table. Both Governments are of the view that such a \n     process would have to be broadly acceptable and would have to \n     lead immediately and without further pre-conditions to the \n     convening of all-party regotiations with a comprehensive \n     agenda.\n       As is reflected in the Communigue, the details of an \n     elective process are primarily a matter for the Northern \n     Ireland parties, which will be the participants in any such \n     process, and for the British Government, which will have to \n     introduce the necessary legislation, and to ensure that it is \n     speedily processed. The question of how elections are to be \n     integrated into the launch of negotiations, on the other \n     land, is one in which we have entirely legitimate interest, \n     as one of the participants in those negotiations. The Irish \n     Government is prepared to support any process which satisfies \n     the criteria set out by the International Body; it must be \n     broadly acceptable to the Northern parties, have an \n     appropriate mandate, and be within the three stranded \n     structure. It is on this basis that the Government has agreed \n     with the British Government on the approach outlined in the \n     Communique.\n       It is no secret that the Northern parties continue to \n     disagree on the form of any elective process, and on the \n     precise function of that process. There are significant \n     disagreements even between those who have advocated such a \n     process from the beginning. There is a range of possible \n     options consistent with the requirement that elections lead \n     directly and without pre-conditions into three-stranded all \n     party negotiations.\n       There are also numerous other significant details which \n     need to be resolved in advance of the launch of negotiations. \n     These are broadly grouped together under the rubric of ``the \n     basis, participation, structure, format and agenda'' of such \n     negotiations. Both Governments have had useful discussions \n     with the parties during the series of preparatory talks which \n     were initiated after last November's Summit. Nevertheless, \n     there is still much work to be done. For example, we need to \n     ensure that, irrespective of the form and outcome of any \n     elective process, there will be a way for all the relevant \n     players in the situation, including the loyalist parties, \n     which have played so crucial and constructive a role, to be \n     involved in resolving the conflict. There are several other \n     key points, and myriad lesser details on which it will be \n     necessary to be clear in advance.\n       It seemed to me for some time that the only practical way \n     to hammer out agreement on these issues, given both their \n     complexity and the number of participants involved, would \n     be through some form of concentrated and accelerated \n     dialogue, which would allow us all to bounce ideas off one \n     another and to explore common ground.\n       The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have now agreed that \n     the two Governments will conduct intensive multi-lateral \n     consultations on these lines with the relevant Northern \n     Ireland parties, in whatever configuration, or indeed \n     configurations, are acceptable to those concerned. These \n     consultations will begin on Monday next, 4 March. \n     Preparations at official level are already underway. The \n     Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I will meet in \n     Belfast on that day to launch the consultations and to agree\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n     on how we will make the best use of the time available, to \n     ensure that every effort is made to secure widespread \n     agreement among the parties on elections and the organisation \n     of negotiations, and to allow us to come to a view on the \n     question of a referendum. I would appeal to all parties to \n     cooperate fully in that process.\n       These consultations are to be strictly time-limited. They \n     will end on Wednesday 13 March. They will not be allowed to \n     drag on inconclusively, and in so doing to threaten the \n     timetable set out for the launch of negotiations. The \n     existence of a deadline will focus the minds of participants.\n       After 13 March, the two Governments will immediately review \n     their outcome. The British Government will bring forward \n     legislation for an elective process, based on a judgement of \n     what seems most broadly acceptable. Decisions will also be \n     announced as appropriate on the other matters relating to the \n     negotiating process which are to be addressed by the \n     consultations. The two Governments are of the shared view \n     that the parties must be given every opportunity to shape \n     these matters in an agreed fashion, but ultimately we are \n     prepared to make judgements and where appropriate to take the \n     necessary decisions on the basis of what we have learned in \n     the consultations.\n       In essence, we have mapped out a clear path to the \n     negotiating table. This combination of steps offers to all \n     parties a balanced and honourable way forward. It guarantees \n     negotiations, and it also guarantees that those negotiations \n     will be conducted on the basis of the principles of democracy \n     and non-violence. There is no reason for any party to refuse \n     to participate in negotiations. Equally, there is no reason \n     for the IRA, through a refusal to restore its ceasefire, to \n     deny Sinn Fein the possibility of full participation in \n     political dialogue and entry into the negotiations on a basis \n     of equality.\n       Negotiations are a necessary means to an essential end. We \n     must never forget what it is that we seek to attain through \n     them. It is important to remind ourselves of the ultimate \n     prize we seek to gain.\n       Political violence could be eradicated for-ever through a \n     draining of the swamp of inherited distrust and \n     incomprehension. Through partnership in agreed institutions, \n     unionism and nationalism could learn to respect one another \n     and to work together for the common good. Nationalists could \n     feel secure and valued within Northern Ireland: Unionists \n     could feel secure and valued on the island of Ireland. We \n     could achieve permanent agreement on the rules which would \n     order our relationships, through matching and reciprocal \n     guarantees which would transcend disputes about sovereignty. \n     The last ghosts which haunt the relationship between Britain \n     and Ireland would be laid to rest.\n       It is long past time that we began to work out together how \n     to reach this destination. Now we know when negotiations will \n     begin, and we must prepare ourselves for the task ahead. The \n     Irish Government, working on the foundations and with the \n     commitments of yesterday's communique, will approach that \n     task with the utmost urgency and resolve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1529-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOT'S COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor S. \n953, the Black Revolutionary War Patriot's Commemorative Coin Act. This \nlegislation, sponsored by Senators Chafee and Moseley-Braun, would \nallow the minting and sale of commemorative coins to finance the \nconstruction of a memorial in our Nation's Capital, honoring those \nAfrican-Americans who fought for our Nation's independence.\n  Mr. President, our Nation owes those African-American patriots who \nfought in the American Revolution a deep debt of gratitude. All \ntogether, over 5,000 African-American men and women served as guides, \nspies, teamsters, and sailors in pursuit of a free nation. These \nAfrican-Americans accounted for over 2\\1/2\\ percent of the total \nAmerican force. They served with distinction and honor.\n  In this month, designated as Black History Month, it is appropriate \nto remind ourselves of the service African-Americans have given to this \nNation's armed services. African-American service men and women have \nleft an indelible mark upon our Nation's history.\n  In researching the role of African-Americans in the American \nRevolution, I was surprised to learn that many of those patriots who \nserved were, indeed, slaves. How ironic it is that many of the patriots \nserving to found a nation based on the ideals of freedom were unable to \nenjoy this very freedom. We as a nation have struggled, and continue to \nstruggle today, to ensure that all Americans can enjoy the fruits of \nliving in a nation dedicated to democracy and freedom for all.\n  We have a long way to go to meet that ideal. It is my sincere hope \nthat the construction of the memorial to be built from the proceeds of \nthe sale of these commemorative coins, will inspire us to continue this \nfight for democracy and equality. We owe the patriots who fought in the \nAmerican Revolution no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1531-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DIANE KASEMAN\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to take the \nopportunity to acknowledge the 43 years of dedicated service of Diane \nKaseman, upon her retirement. A native of Rochester, NY, Diane began \nher distinguished career on March 27, 1953. Diane began her tenure here \non Capitol Hill as a receptionist for Representative Kenneth Keating. \nShe then moved to the Senate and worked for Senator John Sherman Cooper \nand has since served under the administrations of 11 separate Senate \nSergeants at Arms, where she has worked with the service and computer \nfacilities staff of the U.S. Senate.\n  Diane's accomplishments have not been limited to her professional \ncareer, as she has endlessly devoted herself to volunteer activities \nbenefiting not only her colleagues, but also many charitable \norganizations. In 1953, Diane actively sought and obtained approval \nfrom the Senate Rules Committee for the establishment of the Senate \nStaff Club. Founded in 1954 with 150 members as a social organization \nfor all Senate employees, the club has sponsored a variety of social, \ncivic, and charitable activities. Under the capable and dynamic \nleadership of Diane, the club's first treasurer, the Staff Club has \ngrown to over 3,000 members.\n  The organization has been responsible for a number of variety shows, \ndances, and dinners, however, an integral part of the club has been \ncharitable activities. Diane Kaseman has been instrumental in the \nsuccess of these efforts. In 1955 Diane helped to form a Senate \nhospitalization plan, which is still active under the jurisdiction of \nthe Secretary of the Senate. The Staff Club was asked by the Red Cross \nto become part of its blood donor drive in 1978 and has continued this \nsupport. Diane has been a driving force behind this noteworthy campaign \nand has dedicated many hours of hard work to ensure that the Senate \nblood drive meets its goal. As a result of her efforts, the Senate \nStaff Club has received four Outstanding Merit Awards for its \ncontributions.\n  Diane won the 22d Annual Roll Call Congressional Staff Award in 1953 \nas one of the founders of the Senate Staff Club. In 1981, Diane Kaseman \nreceived the Sid Yudain Award in recognition of ``her dedication to the \nwell-being of her coworkers and for the generous expenditure of her \ntime, talent, and personal resources in the service of the \ncongressional community.'' Diane was also commended by U.S. Capitol \nChief of Police James M. Powell for her unending assistance and \npatience during a special 5-week assignment in 1984 with the U.S. \nCapitol Police in establishing a system for providing security badges \nfor all employees of the Senate.\n  Diane's contributions have been vast and effectual. She enjoys \nvolunteering her time and special talents in helping others and has \ncontributed to the Red Cross, Children's Hospital, Walter Reed \nHospital, Saint Joseph's food drive, Hungary relief, Mexico's \nearthquake relief, and Help for Retarded Children, among others.\n  As U.S. Senator from New York, I am particularly pleased to \ncongratulate Diane Kaseman for her outstanding contributions and \ndedicated service of the past 43 years and wish Diane continued success \nin all her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1531-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1531-S1532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I have spoken on this floor many times \nabout the danger of antipersonnel landmines. In fact, I find that this \nis an issue on which I get thousands of letters and comments on my web \npage and over the Internet and telephone calls from all over the \ncountry and all over the world from people urging the ultimate banning \nof antipersonnel landmines and applauding steps that we took in this \nbody to vote to ban them.\n  Mr. President, the NATO peacekeeping operation has been underway in \nBosnia for less than 12 weeks. During that period, at lest 40 IFOR \nsoldiers have been wounded or killed by landmines. The first American \nkilled in Bosnia, Sgt. Donald A. Dugan, may have died from a landmine. \nHe was apparently trying to disarm it, when it detonated in his hand.\n  Sargent Dugan was 38 years old. He died trying to help end the most \nbrutal war in Europe in 50 years. He died so others, many of whom have \nlost parents, children, or brothers and sisters, could live.\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\n  The first American wounded in Bosnia was also the victim of a \nlandmine. Another American lost part of his foot from a mine. Three \nBritish soldiers were among those killed by landmines.\n  In the 3 years that the United Nations force was there, 204 U.N. \nsoldiers were injured by mines, and 25 died. As the snow melts and the \nground thaws, there will be more landmine casualties.\n  Since 1990 when the war started, thousands of civilians have been \ninjured and killed by landmines, and they will continue to suffer \ncasualties long after the NATO troops leave. The Army's advice is ``if \nit's not paved, don't step on it.'' That's great. That means that 99 \npercent of the land in Bosnia is too dangerous to walk on. The \nlandmines in Bosnia, like many other countries, will be cleared an arm \nand a leg and a life at a time for generations.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken often on this subject and I will \ncontinue to do so. Today I want to make just one point.\n  If there ever was an opportunity for American leadership to make the \nworld a safer place, this is it. On February 12, President Clinton--and \nI applaud him for it--signed the foreign operations bill which contains \nmy amendment to halt, for 1 year, U.S. use of antipersonnel landmines.\n  Some in the Pentagon have complained that since they use landmines \nresponsibly they should not have to stop using them.\n  Mr. President, no one is more proud than I am of our Armed Forces. \nOur men and women in uniform, whether they are in Bosnia, Korea, or \nhere in Washington, make every American proud for what they stand for, \nand their unmatched professionalism. I have voted for just about every \ndefense appropriations bill since I came to the U.S. Senate.\n  If I thought for a minute that getting rid of antipersonnel landmines \nwould put our troops or our national security in jeopardy, I would not \nbe speaking here today. On the contrary, I believe we have far more to \ngain. Antipersonnel landmines cannot be justified on military grounds \nor on moral grounds.\n  I have received calls and letters from combat veterans from every \npart of this country who experienced the horrors of landmines, and who \nagree with me that they made their job more dangerous, not safer. Some \nwere wounded by mines. Some saw troops under their command killed by \nmines, even by their own minefields when the battle changed direction.\n  I know landmines have some military use. But consider the cost. Over \n24,000 Americans were injured or killed by mines in World War II. There \nwere over 2,400 recorded landmine casualties in Korea, and over 7,400 \nin Vietnam. Twenty-one Americans died in the Persian Gulf from mines--\n20 percent of all our casualties there. Twenty-six percent of our \ncasualties in Somalia were from mines.\n  No matter how or what type of landmines are used, they are \nindiscriminate. They are triggered by the victim, and usually it is a \ncivilian. Our mines, and the mines of countless other nations, are \nkilling and maiming hundreds of innocent people each week.\n  Mr. President, we have a tremendous opportunity. The law signed by \nthe President will halt, in 3 years, our use of antipersonnel landmines \nexcept in very limited areas. We will not be alone. Canada and Belgium \nhave unilaterally halted their production, use, and export of these \nweapons, and 20 other nations have declared support for an immediate, \ntotal ban.\n  During the next 3 years, we can lead other nations to join with us in \nrepudiating this weapon. If the Congress, the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nthe Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador, all our Ambassadors in \nposts around the world--if we all speak loudly and with one voice, the \nmessage will be heard.\n  Mr. President, a recent Washington Post article entitled ``A Global \nBid To Ban Landmines,'' described how the Serbs used minefields in \ntheir campaign of ethnic cleansing, by forcing their Moslem captives to \nwalk through minefields, triggering the mines.\n  That many sound appalling, and it is. But it is little different from \nwhat millions of people are forced to do each day, in countries where \nsurvival means tilling the land, and the land is a minefield.\n  So Mr. President, we remember Sgt. Donald Dugan for his sacrifice for \npeace in Bosnia. Let us also remember him by renouncing these cowardly \nweapons that have claimed the lives of so many innocent people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1532-5", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1533-S1534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each one of us has been horrified at what \nwe have seen on our television sets with the tragedies in Israel. I was \nat my home and reading the recent account--what I thought was the most \nrecent account of bombing in Israel--when I got a call from somebody in \nmy office who started referring to the terrible bombing in Israel. I \nsaid, ``I am reading about it right now.'' He said, ``No; not the one \nthat is in this morning's paper, the one that happened within the last \nfew minutes.''\n  The shock that fell on everybody in my office, on everybody in my \nfamily, and on the family members of those in my office--one of whom \nlives with his wife and daughter in Israel.\n  I believe that we are witnessing a determined, relentless suicidal \nattempt to destroy the peace process in the Middle East. It may be \npredictable. We have seen these attempts before. Fanatical extremists \nhave tried time and again to intimidate and destroy the forces for \npeace; unfortunately, on both sides. But so far they have failed.\n  I think that Israel today faces its greatest challenge with the \nhandshake on the White House lawn. When Prime Minister Rabin was \nassassinated by a Jewish fanatic I thought we had reached the low \npoint. But the situation has only deteriorated since then. At least 60 \npeople, innocent civilians, have been killed in the past 9 days alone. \nThe people responsible in an almost obscene perversion seem to take \npride in claiming responsibility for the slaughter of men, women, and \nchildren.\n  So our sympathies--and I believe this can be said of all Americans--\nand our prayers are with the victims and their families.\n  The White House has said that they will provide counterterrorism \nassistance to Israel, and the Palestinian authority--and the Congress, \nof course--is going to support whatever can be done to stop these \natrocities. But we know there are no guarantees. If someone is prepared \nto sacrifice his life to commit murder, there are real limits on what \nwe can do to prevent that.\n  Prime Minister Peres has said he will take all necessary steps to \nfight back. He has no alternative. To stand by and not do whatever he \ncan would be inconceivable, and I know the Prime Minister's \ndetermination is to do all that is possible that he, his government, \nand his great country can do.\n  Chairman Arafat has condemned the attacks and has pledged to fight \nback, as he should have done long, long ago. He should be taking all \nnecessary measures to track these people down and stop them before they \nstrike again. Those who would urge Prime Minister Peres to turn his \nback on the peace process should also understand that is exactly what \nthe terrorists want. They want the war to go on because they know that \nif peace prevails--as we all pray it will--then they lose.\n\n  Real opportunities for peace come rarely. It took great courage and \nyears of patient work to get to this point. Prime Minister Rabin gave \nhis life for it, as have dozens of others. There is no other way than \nto search and continue searching for peace.\n  So I express my sorrow and my horror at what has happened to this \nbrave country. I hope that now steps can be taken to stop terrorists \nfrom striking again and stop those who would plan even more terrorism \nbut also let the peace process go forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for his eloquence. We come to the \nSenate floor all too often to talk about tragedy and needless loss of \nlife. The Senator talked about the tragedy in Israel; needless tragedy. \nWe see it in England. We see it here at home. We saw it in Oklahoma \nCity, in New York City. Terrorism must be--and will be--\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nstopped because people in this world want peace, and they want life as \nthey choose to live in peace.\n  Tragedy also comes too often in the course of our lives here in \nAmerica in our hectic life.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a young man named \nBrian Ohleyer, who was killed yesterday in a tragic automobile accident \nin northern California. Brian was in his twenties. He was a light in \nevery life that he touched, in every community that he was a part of, \nin every school that he went to, and in every job he had. And he \nbrought light to my life. He was my friend.\n  Brian's future was as bright as you could imagine--a wife, Elle, whom \nhe adored; a career that he loved; a mom and dad, brother and sister, \nnephews and nieces whom he treasured, which made up the happiest and \nwarmest of families. Brian was blessed, and he blessed everyone that he \ntouched.\n  And then came yesterday, a truck crashing into all his dreams and the \ndreams of everyone who loved him. The news was like a stab in the \nheart. News like this strikes too many Americans. And when it happens, \nwe have to reach out to one another. In the days ahead, we will reach \nout to this family.\n  I talked to Michael Luckhoff, the general manager of KGO Radio in San \nFrancisco, Brian's employer. He said Brian was a shining star, a \nwonderful, polite young man--a superstar, he said. He said he was the \nfuture, a gem among gems, liked by everyone, a pacesetter, a breath of \nfresh air.\n  I am here to say that when we lose someone like this, all we can do \nis pray that this tragedy does not happen to anyone we love. All we can \ndo is remember the best and brightest memories. And what I am going to \ndo, because this young man was a model of what a young person should \nbe, full of life and expectation, playing by the rules, just the best, \nI am going to name my internship program after Brian, and all the \ninterns that come in my office will learn about him and they will be \nBrian Ohleyer interns. Maybe in that small way I can do my part in \nkeeping his spirit alive.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  I am moved by the remarks of the junior Senator from California. Let \nme follow with just a few remarks about recent events in the Middle \nEast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/05/senate-section/article/S1534-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1534-S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On September 13, 1993, the world watched with hope and \nfear when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader \nYasser Arafat signed the Declaration of Principles on the White House \nlawn and began a new era in the Middle East. As much as we hoped there \nwould be an end to terrorism, bloodshed, and occupation, I think just \nabout everyone knew the road to peace would not be that simple.\n  We had reason to cheer though because now the battle lines would be \ndrawn differently. Rather than Arab versus Jew, the peace process \ncreated a new alliance, moderate versus extremism, where Israelis, \nPalestinians, and others were joined to pursue a peaceful and \nprosperous Middle East.\n  While there were some very tenuous periods during 1994--continued \nterrorist attacks, such as the disastrous bombing in the center of Tel \nAviv, and the bomb attack in Beit Leid where over 20 soldiers were \nkilled, the massacre of 28 Palestinians in Hebron by an extremist \nIsraeli named Baruch Goldstein--nonetheless, Mr. President, the peace \nprocess was progressing. By late 1995, in fact, it seemed relations \nbetween Arafat and Rabin were warming.\n\n  Israelis themselves, Mr. President, were becoming more confident that \nthis was the path to take. On November 4, 1995, 150,000 Israeli \nsupporters attended a Tel Aviv peace rally to demonstrate their depth \nof commitment to the peace process.\n  Then, of course, as we all sadly know, extremism struck again. This \ntime a Jewish radical gunned down Prime Minister Rabin in an effort, of \ncourse, to kill the peace process.\n  I think it is important to note that this, too, was a terrorist \nattack, an attack in the vein of a new Middle East where extremism and \nviolence of any stripe lashes out against any sign of peace and \ntolerance.\n  Of course, with the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin, the world \nlost one of its great leaders and great men. He possessed so many \nattributes that made him an extraordinary figure. As a soldier, he \nhelped build Israel, and as Prime Minister, he paved the way for a \npeace that can only come from Israel's strengths. With this, he earned \nthe trust and confidence of Israelis who knew that Rabin would not take \nrisks for peace that outweighed the dangers of continued war.\n  He recognized the day had passed when one people in the Middle East \ncan really think seriously about dominating another people; when most \nIsraelis, Palestinians, Jordanians, and others saw that they must co-\nexist if there is to be any security or prosperity in the region.\n  Rabin put his full weight behind the peace process as the only way to \nprotect Israel's security. His achievements were illustrated again, \nsadly, during the funeral, an event that in itself helped solidify the \nprocess the assassin had tried to stop. The huge United States \ndelegation, which I was fortunate to be part of, testified to the depth \nof support that the United States has and will offer Israel. The fact \nthat President Mubarak and King Hussein not only set foot in Jerusalem \nbut also eulogized Prime Minister Rabin at his funeral spoke to the \ncommitment for peace with a strong Israel. The more than 40 heads of \nState and representatives from over 80 countries who were there also \nsignaled international investment in the peace process as well as the \ntremendous personal tribute to Rabin that it represented.\n  I think Prime Minister Peres has been equally determined in this \nquest. He has continued implementation of the Oslo II Agreement, \nexpanded relations with Jordan, pursued preliminary peace talks with \nSyria and he has also cemented ties with other countries.\n\n  We had hoped that the extremists in the Middle East would have been \nweakened. But as their ranks have been withering, their hatred was \nintensifying. Israel, with some cooperation from Palestinian leader \nYasser Arafat, has continued its war against terrorism, and it is \nwidely assumed that that led to the January assassination of the \nengineer, the so-called engineer, Yahyia Ayash, the Hamas technician \nwho masterminded the bus explosions in Israel.\n  Mr. President, in the last 9 days, we all know we have seen 4 \ndevastating bombs, all delivered by fanatics on a suicide mission, \nexplode during commuter rush hours in urban centers in Israel, \nmurdering at least 59 people and injuring many more. The horrific \nimages we see on television cannot even compare with the terror any \nIsraeli must now feel when they get on a bus to go to work, pick up \ntheir shopping, send their kids to school. This is a real source of \ninsecurity and pandemonium in Israel now.\n  What makes this problem so challenging is how does Israel stop a \nsuicide bomber? There are young Hamas supporters who are willing to \nblow themselves up as long as they can take a few Israelis with them. \nAt first they said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of \nthe engineer. Now it is because of Israel's announced war on Hamas. It \nis really a war against any kind of Western or modern presence in the \nMiddle East and against the peace process. Prime Minister Peres has \nresponded forcefully and decisively. He has pledged that Israel will \ntake all measures necessary to fight the war against terrorism. Last \nnight, they arrested a man from Ramallah who they believe orchestrated \nthree of the last four attacks. A strict closure, a drastic effort to \nfully separate Israelis and Palestinians, will be in effect, I expect, \nuntil the election at the end of May.\n  I am also very proud of President Clinton's efforts and commitments \nto crack down on the supporters of terrorists. I feel confident the \nUnited States will continue to support Israel, be it through strict \nenforcement of the ban on contributions to Hamas or through more \nintelligence sharing with Israel to avert would-be attacks, or \nwhatever. But the next steps are really with the\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nPalestinians. The protest demonstration by tens of thousands of \nPalestinians in Gaza against the bombers who struck on Sunday in \nJerusalem was exactly the kind of support the peace process needs. \nWhile moderate Palestinians may feel their lives are in danger by \nopenly opposing Hamas, the peace process could potentially fail if they \ndo not speak out against extremism and demonstrate their investment in \nthe process.\n  Mr. Arafat must do all he can in his power now to prevent further \nattacks. Political agreements, such as that which he made with Hamas 2 \nweeks ago, are simply and clearly insufficient. Hamas may now be \nsplintered into several camps and Arafat must counter all of them. He \nmust also recognize that merely arresting people, though a good first \nstep, is hardly sufficient. There must be an aggressive policy of hot \npursuit and follow-through in the Palestinian justice system if peace \nis to be sustained.\n  Mr. President, it is with great disappointment that I say it may be \nunrealistic to think that Arafat can control the extremists in the \nHamas, even if he puts all of his efforts into it. For that reason, it \nis time again Israel not only join with Arafat in the fight, but also \npursue its own means where necessary to protect its citizens.\n  The peace process is in danger. But, as Leah Rabin appealed to us \nyesterday, it is far from over. In the context of the bombings and \natrocities of the last 9 days, there should be a suspension of \nimplementation or further negotiations. Israel is in no position to be \ntalking further peace when the current situation gives its citizens no \nsecurity.\n  But that is the genius of the Oslo process which Rabin left: Israel \ncan go at its own speed, and it should focus on the fight against \nterrorism now.\n  Mr. President, this has been a very difficult period and leaves the \npast and the future in a very confusing posture. But we do know that \npeace is the only alternative to this war and insecurity. I hope the \nforces of peace will prevail over the destructive and powerful--but \nminority--forces of hate.\n  Israel and the Palestinians are too invested in the peace to throw it \naway now. Even more compelling is that if they did throw it away, war \nwill continue in this and many other forms. For that reason, they must \nput all their efforts into fighting these forces.\n  The United States also has a continued interest in Israel's security, \nand the world has a humanitarian interest in halting this mindless \nviolence. I think and hope all parties will rise to the challenge. We \nmust counter the horrific forces of extremism that took Prime Minister \nRabin's life, and fight and extinguish the forces such as Hamas that \nundermine the future of the Middle East.\n  In Rabin's vision of the Middle East, one nation will not stand in \nopposition to the rights and dignity of another. To achieve this, and \nto carry on Rabin's lifelong work, violent extremism, such as that \nwhich killed Rabin--and President Sadat before him--must be confronted, \ncondemned, and stopped.
