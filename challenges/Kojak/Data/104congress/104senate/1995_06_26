Mr. President, in recent weeks we in the Senate have been \ntreated to a political pony show on the floor of the Senate by those \nwho seem to think it is their duty to wake up crabby and then share \nthat mood with the rest of us. They come to the floor and parade around \nin political harness day after day complaining mostly about the \nPresident's budget or the lack of it. But more generally, they complain \nabout anything they think they can blame on Democrats--spring rains, \nhigh winds, new diseases, cultural disorders.\n  And we have been patient in recent weeks while watching all of this \nand have been polite enough not to ask those who come to the floor, \n``Where is the budget?'' that is required to be submitted to the Senate \nby the majority party. We have not asked that question because we have \nknown where their budget is. It is 71 days late, 71 days beyond when \nthe law requires the Congress to have passed a budget. These folks that \nhad a plan for everything in the first 100 days apparently did not have \na plan to meet their responsibility to have a budget by April 15. So it \nis 71 days later, and we are now told that this Thursday the budget \nwill come to the floor of the Senate.\n  Where has it been? In conference, we are told. In conference with \nDemocrats? No. Conference committees are usually between two parties. \nBut not this one. This is in conference huddling behind closed doors, \nhatching new ideas about how to give the wealthy another tax cut and \nhow to have the middle-income taxpayers in this country pay for it. Now \nthey have figured it out, and they are going to unveil it here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  So close your eyes just for a moment while I describe it and ask \nyourself: Is this not a curtain call to a play you have seen before? It \nis the let-them-eat-cake budget. They bring to the floor a budget that \nsays let us have tax cuts for the very wealthy, let us have spending \ncuts for the very poor, and let us spend more money for defense and \nspend it on things that the Secretary\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nof Defense says we do not need. This budget says we cannot afford star \nschools, but we must begin immediately building star wars. It says \ncollege should be made more expensive for young people and middle-\nincome families and health care should cost more for the elderly and \nthe poor. And all of this when finished, they claim, will produce a \nbalanced budget.\n  Sound familiar? Well, this kind of budget represents the same old, \ntired ideas swaddled in designer clothes for the 1990's. America has \nseen this fashion show once before. It was about $4 trillion ago in \ndebt. This is a budget with phony figures, bogus promises, and twisted \npriorities. I know they will explain it this week in sweet language and \nseductive promises. But as they do, remember the words of Emerson who \nsaid, ``The louder he talked of his honor the faster we counted our \nspoons.''\n  One hundred years from now historians will look back at 1995 and none \nof us will be able to explain what we did in 1995 because we will not \nbe here. But they will be able to view a little bit about how we felt, \nwhat we felt the priorities were in our country by what we spent the \npublic resources on.\n  This budget will surely cause future historians to scratch their \nheads and wonder how a country deep in debt with the wealthy getting \nwealthier and the poor getting poorer could develop a budget which says \nthat the rich have too little and the poor have too much and the \nsolution is to simply cut our revenue by offering tax cuts to the most \naffluent and cutting back on our commitment to kids, the veterans, and \nto the elderly.\n  There is still time, it seems to me, for all of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to have conference committees in which both parties \nconference and in which we establish real priorities that make sense \nfor our country, that invest in our future, and that fight for the \neconomic interests of the job creators and the workers in our country. \nWe can do that. But it will not happen with the priorities established \nin the budget we are about to debate this week. This does not \nrepresent, sadly enough, a new direction. It is tired, failed old \npolitical dogma long since discredited. And we will have a lot of \ndebate about this budget.\n\n\n                           U.S. Trade Policy\n\n  But let me go beyond the budget to the source of our Federal budget. \nEven more important than the way we spend our public resources is the \nkind of economy America has with which to produce these public \nresources. What kind of a private sector, what kind of initiatives that \ncreate jobs and opportunities and economic growth in our country, can \nproduce a country that advances our Nation and its people?\n  During the 50 years since World War II we have seen it in two \ndistinct economic stories in America. The first 25 years after the \nSecond World War we saw a country in which opportunities were abundant \nin America for working families. America saw its working families' \nincomes grow, real growth; opportunities expand, real opportunities.\n  So for 25 years people in this country received the fruit of an \neconomy that worked and expanded. In the second 25 years we have seen a \ndifferent kind of story. We have struggled as international competition \nhas become tough and sharper.\n  We have seen in the last 20 years that the American families now have \nless income than they had 20 years ago, if you adjust for inflation. \nThey have fewer opportunities than they had before.\n  Why is all of that happening? Because there is another deficit no one \nis talking about: the trade deficit. This nation has a record trade \ndeficit; last year it was the highest deficit in human history.\n  What does that mean? It means American jobs going overseas, \nopportunity leaving our country. Frankly, there have not been more than \ntwo or three of us in this Chamber regularly talking about this trade \ndeficit which shrinks opportunity in America.\n  You can make the case--not necessarily accurately--that a budget \ndeficit is simply money we owe to ourselves, but you cannot make the \nsame case on the trade deficit because the trade deficit must be repaid \nwith a lower standard of living in our country.\n  It is interesting that today, on Monday, the stock market is at \nrecord highs, corporate profits at record levels, and last week the \nU.S. Department of Labor reported that real hourly wages dropped by 3 \npercent in 1994. A record decline in hourly compensation in this \nNation.\n  Is it not interesting, the disconnection here?\n  They are having a high old time on Wall Street; corporate profits are \ndoing fine. There is happiness in the boardroom. But what about around \nthe dinner table with the American family whose real wages are \ndecreasing? And the question today is: Why? What causes that \ndisconnection?\n  I would like to go through a few charts that show what is happening \nin this country. First of all, our trade policy is a trade policy that \ninjures our country from within and ships American jobs overseas.\n  I am not someone who believes we ought to erect walls around our \ncountry, but I do believe we ought to protect our economic base with \ngood jobs, with good income, and expanded opportunities abroad.\n  Here are the trade deficits. All you have to do is look at the red \nlines, our trade losses, and these lines represent jobs. You will see \nwhere we are headed--the largest trade deficit in human history last \nyear in this country.\n  Who are these deficits with? Well, I brought a chart to show what is \nhappening with bilateral trade balances.\n  Everything on this side of the chart is a deficit, and we have a few \nsurpluses with very small trading partners. Japan: big deficit; China: \nbig deficit; Canada: big deficit; Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Venezuela. \nOver a $160 billion merchandise trade deficit last year.\n  Who do we have a surplus with? Well, the Netherlands, Argentina, \nBelgium--all very small surpluses. But the fact is we are being \nbuffeted by very large trade deficits. In fact, these are last year's \nnumbers. The first quarter of this year showed an all-time record high \ntrade deficit--$45 billion in the first quarter.\n  Now, it is not an accident that these trade deficits are exploding. \nOur manufacturing and other productive sectors are withering. Good jobs \nare being replaced. Americans are working for less.\n  Why is that happening? It is happening because more and more \ncorporations, the artificial persons we recognize in law, are \ninterested in international, global profits, not American profits.\n  How do you do that? You simply find a foreign location where it is \ncheap to produce and send your products here. Produce your shoes in \nIndonesia and sell them in Pittsburgh. Produce your shirts in China and \nsell them in Bismarck.\n  That is the disconnection that is happening in this country, a \nwholesale movement of American jobs overseas to produce where it is \ndirt cheap, produce where you can hire 12-year-old kids to work for 12 \ncents an hour for 12 hours a day and then ship your product back into \nour marketplace, back into America.\n  I ask you, is that fair competition for an American business to have \nto compete with? The answer is no. Is that fair competition for any \nAmerican worker to have to compete with? The answer is no.\n  We fought for 50 years in this country for higher standards, saying \nyou ought to have to pay a living wage; you ought to have a safe \nworkplace for your workers; you ought not to dump pollution into the \nair and chemicals into the water.\n  Those are battles we have had, and we have put them behind us in our \ncountry. We have a minimum wage; we have a safe workplace; we have \nOSHA; we have pollution laws; and, yes, they are a nuisance, but the \nfact is we now have cleaner air and cleaner water than 20 years ago. \nWhy? Because we succeeded.\n  However, those who control our economic output, the agents of \nproduction, all too often say, well, that is fine, but if that is the \nway you want to be, if you want to force us to pay living wages to \npeople, if you want to force us not to degrade the environment, if you \nwant to force us to have safe workplaces, then we will go elsewhere \nwhere we are not encumbered, where we are not a nuisance. And the plant \nleaves America and a job goes somewhere else and an American family is \nout of work. But the plant produces a product that then comes back to \nAmerica and undercuts the manufacturer who stayed\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\nhere, undercuts the worker who toils here. And that is the dilemma.\n  Let me turn to China. I wish to talk about a couple of countries and \njust take a look at what is happening with our trade with these \ncountries.\n  China: In 1987, we had a surplus with China; this year, a $30 billion \ndeficit with China. This country has to say to China: We are sorry; you \nare friends of ours. We like you to be a trading partner, but we are \ntired of being a cash cow for hard currency for China. If you want to \nship all your goods to America, then start buying more from America.\n  Do you know that when you send wheat to China, we have to subsidize \nit below the cost of production to get the Chinese to buy it? That is \nan example of the absurd trade policy in this country. So American jobs \nare now in China. The agents of production believe they can produce \ncheaper in China and sell it back in New York and Cincinnati. And maybe \nthey can. But is that fair trade? Is that what we ought to subject the \nAmerican worker and the American business to in the name of \ncompetition? It is not fair where I come from.\n  Mexico. Well, we just had a Mexican trade agreement called NAFTA. In \n1992, we had a big trade surplus with Mexico. This year, we are going \nto have a big deficit, more than $15 billion. The same is true with \nCanada. It seems to me that we ought to be able to win a trade \nagreement now and then. For the last 20 years have we sent our folks \nout to negotiate trade agreements, and we have lost.\n  Japan: a $65 billion trade deficit. Now, the President, to his \ncredit, for the first time in a long time, has stood up and said to the \nJapanese: We are sorry, but we are going to insist you open your \nmarkets and if you do not there will be consequences.\n  I mentioned NAFTA. When we debated NAFTA here in Congress, the \nprophets of nirvana said if we just pass this NAFTA with Mexico, we \nwill have all these new jobs in America. They predicted 170,000 new \njobs in America, and some predicted many, many more. Guess what? This \nyear, our trade deficit with Mexico means we will lose 200,000 jobs \noverall.\n  The surge of wholesale imports from Mexico this year results in part \nbecause of the devaluation of the peso, but also because the trade \nagreement with Mexico was negotiated in a way that was, in my judgment, \njust fundamentally incompetent. It did not serve America's economic \ninterests.\n  You can see our actual experience with NAFTA on this chart. Here you \ncan see the rapidly growing trade deficits in the same high-skilled \nmanufacturing sectors where we were supposed to see more U.S. exports \nand more jobs. The charts show just the opposite has happened since \nNAFTA in our trade with Mexico in scientific instruments, electric \nequipment, autos, and auto parts.\n  This is not as was advertised. NAFTA was advertised as a plus for \nhigh-skill jobs in this country. They are still low-wage jobs in \nMexico, but they are sending to us electronics, electronics parts, \nautos, auto parts. These used to be the good jobs in our country.\n  So we see the promises from all of these trade agreements. We see the \npromises about China, the promises about Japan. We see the promises \nwith NAFTA, the promises with GATT, and they do not work.\n  Every single year, we go deeper in debt on trade. And what does that \nmean? It means fewer jobs with less income here in this country. The \nquestion is, what are we going to do about it? When are we going to \ndecide in this country that we are going to stand up for our economic \ninterests? This issue is not about the profits of international \ncorporations who produce anywhere in the world and ship their products \nhere. This issue is about American jobs. The American economic engine \nruns with good jobs that pay good income. As a country we cannot \nadvance by seeing corporate profits reach record highs but, at the same \ntime, see the earnings and benefits of American families cut back. Last \nweek I saw a memo from one of this country's larger financial \ninstitutions, also involved in international competition. That company \ndecided to get rid of 80 percent of its clerical workers and then \ncontract out to workers who will not receive benefits. If you can hire \npeople without benefits, you can save a lot of money.\n  Well, that is fine, but it seems to me that is a giant retreat from \nwhat we ought to be doing in this country. This country is not just \nabout profit. It is also about advancing the standard of living of the \nAmerican people.\n  I am a big fan of the private sector, the private market, the free \nmarket. I am a big fan of those who create jobs and opportunity in this \ncountry. I am a big fan of those who want to wean themselves from post-\nSecond World War trade policies, that were largely foreign aid, and \ndecide that we are going to insist, with every trading partner in this \nworld--hold up a mirror--``treat us well because we are going to treat \nyou like you treat us.''\n  We, Uncle Sam, the United States of America, demand fair trade. We \ndemand fairness for our workers. We demand fairness for our businesses. \nWe are sick and tired of being pushed around, sick and tired of one-way \nfree trade, sick and tired of American jobs moved overseas so the \nproducts of those jobs can be shipped back to us to be viewed on the \nmarket shelf by someone who is unemployed. That is not what I view to \nbe an adequate future for our country.\n  What can we do about all this? We can finally begin to decide that \nthe trade policy we followed after World War II does not work any \nlonger. There is nothing at all wrong with standing up for American \neconomic interests. It is not inconsistent with fostering free trade or \nexpanded trade to stand up for economic interests in our country. We \nshould and we must decide as Americans when we expand trade agreements, \nwhen we expand trade opportunities, to insist with others in our world \nwho are our competitors, and are skilled, true competitors, that they \ntreat us fairly.\n  We were perfectly able, in the first 25 years after the Second World \nWar, to extend a hand of foreign aid and trade policy to Western Europe \nand the Pacific rim. When I walked to school in a town of 300 people I \nknew every single day--because it was evident all around me--that the \nUnited States was the biggest, the best, the most, and we won in \ninternational competition just by waking up in the morning.\n  But it has changed. The Japanese are tough. The Germans are shrewd. \nThey are good competitors. China is able to produce some things at much \nless cost than we do. So the question is, are we going to recognize \nthat change and develop public policies that protect the economic \ninterests of our country, or are we going to be willing to continue to \nbe washed away in a sea of red trade ink that compromises American jobs \nand compromises American income?\n  I indicated some weeks ago that I was going to give a series of four \nor five discussions on the floor of the Senate on the subject of trade, \nwhere we are and where we ought to be heading. This is the second time \nI have come to the floor to discuss this.\n  You see what is happening in our country with respect to income in \nthe past half century. In the first 25 years, every portion of the \nincome group--the green bars on the chart--experienced significant real \nincome gains; in the past 25 years, losses in real income for the \nbottom 60 percent.\n  It does not take, it seems to me, someone to be out in the work force \nlosing their job to understand this. The evidence is clear. It ought to \nbe clear to everybody. We now see a circumstance where the American \nfamilies have to increase the number of people in the households \nworking in order to add income. The chart shows that families reached \nhigher income not by individuals earning more, but by putting more \nfamily members into the work force. That is the only way they can add \nany income, because the income per capita per worker is declining in \nour country.\n  And one last chart. This shows more graphically than any what has \nhappened with respect to real income in our country, real hourly \ncompensation. Income during the first 25 years after World War II, the \ngreen line, goes steadily up, and in the second 25 years, the red line, \nreal income is down.\n  If we do not wake up in this country and decide to do something about \nthis, this country's economy is not going to be the economic engine \nthat produces the resources to even allow us to debate priorities in a \nbudget.\n  Budget represents the priorities of public resources. Adequate public \nresources must come from a healthy,\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\ngrowing, vibrant economy, and it darn sure is not growing much when you \nhave trade policies that move America's strength overseas.\n  I will return to the floor with other presentations on trade, along \nwith proposed solutions. I appreciate your indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9013-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CARL MUNDY, COMMANDANT OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of this \ncountry's most distinguished military leaders, Gen. Carl E. Mundy, 30th \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. General Mundy is retiring after 38 \ndistinguished years of service to our country during which he has \nserved this Nation honorably in a number of very important posts. Among \nthese are the commanding general of the Fleet Marine Force Atlantic, \nthe II Marine Expeditionary Force, and the Allied Command Atlantic \nMarine Striking Force. General Mundy has received numerous decorations \nfor his service including the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the \nPurple Heart which he received while serving in the jungles of Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, General Mundy is a leader, visionary, and a warrior. \nAs he completes his watch, he leaves behind a Corps of Marines that is \nready to respond instantly to the Nation's ``911'' calls, relevant to \nmeet the defense needs of the Nation into the next century, and capable \nof meeting the requirements of today's national military strategy.\n  As Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Mundy has been a central \nfigure in shaping the post-cold-war military. He has acted as a \nprincipal author on a number of key Department of Defense white papers. \nAmong these papers, ``From the Sea'' and ``Forward . . . From the \nSea,'' have been instrumental in outlining the future role of naval and \nmarine forces. He has been a tireless spokesman for the Department of \nDefense and has traveled extensively throughout the country to speak to \ncitizens on key issues related to national security.\n  Mr. President, it is with deep regret that I wish General Mundy and \nhis wife, Linda, farewell. He has always provided us the benefits of \nhis great wisdom. He has continuously lived up to the Marine Corps \nmotto: Semper Fidelis.\n  Mr. President, General Mundy is truly one of the few, one of the \nproud. He is, and always will be, a U.S. marine. Our Nation is proud of \nhim, and we wish him well in the future.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHARTER\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, the victorious \nnations of World War II gathered in San Francisco to sign the charter \nthat created the new United Nations. It was a time of enormous hope and \npromise, and the world's expectations ran high. No country had more \ninfluence in shaping that international organization than the United \nStates. From the details in the charter to the name of the new \norganization itself, American leadership--then at its strongest on the \nheels of victory in the war--was everywhere in evidence. Just as \nAmerican hesitation doomed the League of Nations a quarter-century \nearlier, so American leadership in 1945 gave the world the United \nNations.\n  I would like, Mr. President, today to express a strong belief that \nAmerica must again lead in the significant reforms that are now \nnecessary to save this valuable organization for generations to come.\n  There is much criticism of the United Nations, and much of that is \nwell-deserved. The Secretariat has ballooned into a collection of \nbloated, often ill-operated bureaucracies. The structure of the \nSecurity Council reflects a bygone era. The Trusteeship Council has \noutlived its usefulness.\n  There is mismanagement, waste, and general lack of accountability. \nToo often, there is no focus and no real sense of priorities.\n  But there also is much muddled thinking in America's approach to the \nUnited Nations. In much of the country--including Washington--there is \nmuch misunderstanding and confusion about the organization's purposes \nand structures. The standards by which we judge its success or failure \nhave become unrealistic. And there are some who would take us again \ndown the failed path of the League of Nations and sacrifice a valuable \ninternational organization for domestic political gain. I believe we \nmust fix the United Nations, and only the United States can provide the \nleadership to get the job done. There are several reforms that I think \nwe can achieve without amending the charter.\n  First, we should lead those reforms that can be accomplished without \namending the charter. I have joined with Congressman Lee Hamilton, the \nranking member of the International Relations Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, in putting forward some thoughts on reforms that can \nbe accomplished without opening the Pandora's box of amending the \ncharter. Let me summarize some of the suggestions:\n  First, focus on the core agencies. The United Nations today has more \nthan 70 agencies under its umbrella. We would finance only a handful of \nagencies that serve core purposes of the organization, for instance the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the World Health \nOrganization, and the High Commission on Refugees. Other agencies \nshould be abolished, merged, or financed at the discretion of one or \nmore of the core agencies.\n  Second, peacekeeping. This is a difficult one, Mr. President. In the \nheady days of the cold war, and after the cold war, expectations for \npeacekeeping grew far out of control. But the truth is that \npeacekeeping has inherent limits, and many of the failed hybrid \noperations we have undertaken--such as nation building in Somalia--\nwhich probably ultimately turned out to be better than was assumed at \nthe time that the forces were withdrawn, and peace enforcement in \nBosnia--which has ignored those limits. Future peacekeeping should be \nlimited to classic operations.\n\n  Third, conferences. Conferences have come to dominate far too much of \nthe United Nations time, resources, and attention. The United Nations \nshould get out of the conference business and focus itself on more \nmeaningful activities. Otherwise, we run the risk of just being a \ntraveling road show from summit to summit.\n  Last, accountability. Today, the United Nations is accountable to no \none. We should significantly strengthen the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral and give it some real teeth. The member states should also \nreform the process by which they select the Secretary-General, to \nensure that his or her accountability and selection is primarily one of \nskills and ability to administer the Organization.\n  I think this is enormously important and probably very difficult to \nachieve. It is one of the more sensitive areas to deal with, and yet it \nis the key to making much of it work as it should.\n  I think we should take the lead in reforms that would require \namending the charter. I, for one, believe membership in the Security \nCouncil should be reformed to better reflect the realities of \ncontemporary international politics.\n  Nations such as Japan and Germany, which pay large portions of the \nU.N.'s bills and are powerful international players, should have \npermanent seats on the Council; and, of course, the Charter's reference \nto them as enemy states should be struck. The number of nonpermanent \nmembers should be expanded to better accommodate major regional powers.\n  We should also eliminate the Trusteeship Council established to \nhandle\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nthe problems of decolonization. It has outlived its purpose. Rather \nthan search for a new purpose for this Council, we should ask whether \nit should exist at all.\n  Mr. President, the other major area for reform is in our thinking \nabout what the United Nations is and what its role should be in \nAmerican foreign policy. We cannot expect the United Nations to be \nclearer in purpose than is its most powerful member state.\n  At its core, the United Nations is a collection of sovereign states \nand is beholden to them for guidance, funding, and, ultimately, \nlegitimacy. The political decisions that drive the Organization and \ndefine its proper role in international politics must be made in \nnational capitals, not in New York.\n  I have grown increasingly concerned about the tendency toward a fuzzy \nmultilateralism that has come to mark U.N. policy toward the United \nNations. We have shown a penchant for dumping difficult problems in the \nlap of the United Nations and then complaining when no solution is \nforthcoming. The tragedy in former Yugoslavia may be the most dramatic \ncurrent example of this phenomena. The truth is, we cannot so easily \nwash our hands of difficult decisions.\n  The United Nations is not a substitute for American leadership in \ninternational affairs. Rather, it is one avenue available to exercise \nthat leadership.\n  I believe we must own up to the truth about our role in the United \nNations. The United Nations has many failures, but we fool ourselves if \nwe merely point fingers at New York and blame the United Nations for \nits shortcomings. The United States is first among equals in the U.N. \nsystem. The failures of the United Nations are, in reality, our own.\n  We would do well to reflect honestly on that unavoidable truth. On \nthis golden anniversary, we must decide whether we will continue to \nmuddle along, or whether the United States once again will assume its \nunique mantle of leadership at the United Nations. I, for one, believe \nwe must lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9016-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING THE SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY TEAM\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on Saturday South Africa defeated \nheavily favored New Zealand in the world rugby championship. I rise \ntoday to congratulate the South African rugby team, as well as the \npeople of South Africa, on this historic victory.\n  For years, because of its apartheid policies, South Africa has stood \non the outside of international sports competitions. From the Olympics \nto the World Cup, South Africa--a country of intense sports fans--had \nbecome isolated and banned from many competitions. And more than most \nother sports, rugby had become closely associated with the former white \ngovernment and its apartheid policies.\n  After this history, the image of President Nelson Mandela--a man \nimprisoned for 27 years in his fight against apartheid--handing the \nWorld Cup trophy to the white captain of the rugby team is indeed a \npowerful symbol of the dramatic changes in South Africa. Throughout the \ncountry, whites and blacks alike celebrated the victory of the \nSpringboks, the mascot of the national team.\n  Mr. President, I join with the international community in \ncongratulating the people of South Africa on winning the rugby World \nCup. It has been a dramatic and historic time in South Africa. This \nvictory, bringing together all South Africans, exemplifies the progress \nto date and the hope for the future of a great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9017-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9017-S9023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CYBERPORN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is an article from Time magazine \nand an article from the Spectator magazine that I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this morning I want to speak on a topic \nthat has received a lot of attention around here lately. My topic is \ncyberporn, and that is, computerized pornography. I have introduced S. \n892, entitled the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act \nof 1995.\n  This legislation is narrowly drawn. It is meant to help protect \nchildren from sexual predators and exposure to graphic pornography.\n  Mr. President, Georgetown University Law School has released a \nremarkable study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity. This study raises important questions about the \navailability and the nature of cyberporn. It is this article I ask to \nhave printed in the Record.\n  Later on, on this subject, some time during the middle of July, I \nwill be conducting hearings before the full Judiciary Committee to \nfully and completely explore these issues. In the meantime, I want to \nrefer to the Carnegie Mellon study, and I want to emphasize that this \nis Carnegie Mellon University. This is not a study done by some \nreligious organization analyzing pornography that might be on computer \nnetworks.\n  The university surveyed 900,000 computer images. Of these 900,000 \nimages, 83.5 percent of all computerized photographs available on the \nInternet are pornographic. Mr. President, I want to repeat that: 83.5 \npercent of the 900,000 images reviewed--these are all on the Internet--\nare pornographic, according to the Carnegie Mellon study.\n  Now, of course, that does not mean that all of these images are \nillegal under the Constitution. But with so many graphic images \navailable on computer networks, I believe Congress must act and do so \nin a constitutional manner to help parents who are under assault in \nthis day and age. There is a flood of vile pornography, and we must act \nto stem this growing tide, because, in the words of Judge Robert Bork, \nit incites perverted minds. I refer to Judge Bork from the Spectator \narticle that I have permission to insert in the Record.\n  My bill, again, is S. 892, and provides just this sort of \nconstitutional, narrowly focused assistance in protecting children, \nwhile also protecting the rights of consenting adults to transmit and \nreceive protected pornographic material--protected, that is, under the \nfirst amendment.\n  Also, according to the Carnegie Mellon University study, cyberporn is \nreally big business. Some computer networks which specialize in \ncomputer pornography take in excess of $1 million per year.\n  Later this week, I am going to introduce the Antielectronic \nRacketeering Act of 1995 which will target organized crime which has \nbegun to use the awesome powers of computers to engage in criminal \nactivity.\n  As we all know from past debates in this body, organized crime is \nheavily involved in trafficking illegal pornography. The Antielectronic \nRacketeering Act will put a dent into that.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to give this study by \nCarnegie Mellon University serious consideration, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 892. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From the Spectator, Feb. 4, 1995]\n\n                    An Electronic Sink of Depravity\n\n       New York.--If last year it was merely modish to be seen \n     speeding down the information superhighway, this year it is \n     fast becoming essential, at least in America. Hitch your \n     wagon to cyberspace, says the new Speaker of the House, Mr. \n     Newt Gingrich, and your democracy will become absolute, with \n     all America joined together for the first time into one vast \n     and egalitarian town meeting.\n       Mr. Gingrich made this all clear two weeks ago when he \n     unveiled a new system for bringing Congress to the \n     electronically connected populace, which in honour of \n     President Jefferson is called ``Thomas''. Anyone with a \n     computer and a modem at home or in the office (or even up in \n     the skies, courtesy of USAir's new back-of-the-seat \n     telescreens) may now, with only the click of a few buttons, \n     find the text of any bill, any resolution, any government \n     statement.\n       Mr. Gingrich is hugely excited by this idea--going so far \n     as to suggest, and not at all facetiously, that perhaps every \n     citizen be given a thousand-dollar tax deduction to allow him \n     to buy himself a laptop computer. Thus will all America be \n     conjoined, he argues, and thus will its democracy be ever \n     strengthened as in no other country on earth.\n       Fine, say I, and not just because I will become richer by \n     $1,000. For the last three years or so I have been a \n     dedicated and enthusiastic user of the Internet. (The \n     Internet--``the net'' to those in the know--began innocently \n     enough 20 years ago as a vast worldwide network of computers, \n     linked together by government-funded telephone\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\n     lines, with high-powered government-funded ``exchanges'' to \n     speed calls on their way, which enabled universities and \n     governments to swap information. Five years or so ago, its \n     controllers opted to make it more democratic, and now anyone \n     is able to connect to it; tens of thousands of new \n     subscribers join every day, and the net is becoming truly \n     global, with at least 20 million regular users.)\n       I am a typical enough user. I send electronic mail--e-\n     mail--to everyone who is similarly hooked up (it is lightning \n     fast and essentially free); and I browse through the world's \n     libraries and data-bases to do research for whatever book I \n     happen to be writing. I bask happily in the \n     Panglossian principle that the Internet seems to enshrine. \n     By virtue of the net, I have complete freedom to explore \n     and trawl for anything I want in what has become by custom \n     an untrammelled, uncontrolled, wholly liberated ocean of \n     information. The Internet seems and sounds to be something \n     almost noble. One can understand why the US Congress named \n     its own portion of the net after Jefferson: all knowledge \n     there is is on hand for all the people--just the kind of \n     thing the great man would have liked.\n       But this week, while I was peering into an area of the \n     Internet where I have hitherto not lingered, I discovered \n     something so appalling as to put all such high-minded \n     sentiments into a quite different perspective.\n       I had stumbled, not entirely accidentally, into a sinkhole \n     of electronic but very real perversion. The first thing I \n     read, almost as soon as I entered it, was a lengthy, very \n     graphic and in stylistic terms quite competently composed \n     narrative that presented in all its essentials the story of a \n     kidnapping, and the subsequent rape, torture, mutilation and \n     eventual murder of the two victims. That author called \n     himself by a code-name, Blackwind; and while it is quite \n     likely that he is American, almost as certain that he is \n     well-educated and quite possible that he is at least a \n     peripheral member of the academic community, we know, and are \n     allowed to know, nothing else about him.\n       His anonymity is faultlessly safeguarded by a system of \n     electronics which has been built into the Internet, and which \n     even the police and the other agents of the state are unable, \n     technically or in law, to penetrate. This is, from their \n     point of view, highly regrettable. Blackwind's offerings--and \n     the very similar stories currently being published on the \n     Internet by scores of men who are in all likelihood as \n     deranged as he seems to be--should be subject to some kind of \n     legal sanction, and for one very understandable reason: the \n     victims of the story he has written are small children.\n       One is a six-year old boy named Christopher, who, among \n     other indignities, suffers a castration--reported in loving \n     detail--before being shot. The other is a girl named Karen, \n     who is seven years old and is raped repeatedly by no fewer \n     than nine men, before having her nipples cut off and her \n     throat slashed.\n       At the moment of my writing this, I find that there are \n     perhaps 200 similar stories presently circulating and \n     available on one of the so-called ``newsgroups'' on the \n     Internet. The choice of tales is endlessly expanded and \n     refreshed by new and ever more exotic stories that emerge \n     into this particular niche in the other every day, almost \n     every hour. You want tales of fathers sodomizing their three-\n     year-old daughters, or of mothers performing fellatio on \n     their prepubescent sons, or of girls coupling with horses, or \n     of the giving of enemas to child virgins? Then you need do no \n     more than visit the newsgroup that is named \n     ``alt.sex.stories'' and all will reliably be there, 24 hours \n     a day, for everyone with a computer and a telephone, anywhere \n     on (or above) the face of the earth.\n       There are about 5,000 separate newsgroups on the net, each \n     one of them presenting chatter about some scintilla of human \n     knowledge or endeavour. I have long liked the system, and \n     found it an agreeable way to discover people around the world \n     who have similar interests. I used to tell others who were \n     not yet signed up to the net that using newsgroups was like \n     going into a hugely crowded pub, finding in milliseconds \n     those who wanted to talk about what you wanted to know, \n     having a quick drink with them before leaving, without once \n     having encountered a bore.\n       And so, with an alphabetical list running from `ab.fen'--\n     which shows you how much fun you can have in Alberta--down to \n     something in German called `zer.zmetz.Wissenschaft.physlk', \n     the enthusiasms of the world's Internet-connected population \n     are distilled into their electronic segments. Alberta-philes \n     can chat with each other, as can German physicists, and those \n     who would bore these are left to chat among themselves. In \n     theory, an admirable arrangement.\n       By Jeffersonian rights it should be uplifting to the \n     spirit. In reality it is rather less so. In far too many \n     groups the level of discussion is execrable and juvenile. \n     Arguments break out, insults are exchanged, the chatter \n     drifts aimlessly in and out of relevance. This is a reality \n     of the electronic world that few like to admit. It is \n     prompting many browsers to suspect, as I do, that a \n     dismayingly large number of users of this system are not at \n     all the kind of sturdy champions of freedom and democracy and \n     intellect that Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Gore would like them to \n     be.\n       More probably, to judge from the tone and the language in \n     many of the groups, they are pasty-faced and dysfunctional \n     men with halitosis who inhabit damp basements. And it is for \n     them, in large measure, that the newsgroups whose titles \n     begin with the code-letters `alt.sex' seem to exist.\n       There are 55 of these, offering manna for all diets. Some \n     are fairly light-hearted; `alt.sex.anal', for example \n     contains much spirited chat about amusing uses to which you \n     can put the colonic gateway; `alt.sex.voyeurism' seems to \n     contain reasonably harmless chatter between a whole worldful \n     of civic-minded Peeping Toms, who like to advise one another \n     which public loos in which national parks have eye-sized \n     knotholes in their doors. There is also `alt.sex.nasal.hair', \n     into which I have not thus far been tempted.\n       There are a number of the groups, though, which are not so \n     amusing. There is `alt.sex.intergen', where the last letters \n     stand for `intergenerational', which is the current \n     paedophile bulletin-board; and there is my current target, \n     `alt.sex.stories'. I came across it by accident, and I \n     double-clicked my mouse to open it, briefly enthralled. It \n     did not take many seconds before I realized I had been ill-\n     prepared for what was on offer.\n       There is a kind of classification system. Each story entry \n     lists a title, an author (invariably either a pseudonym, or \n     posted via an anonymous computer that has laundered the words \n     and made the detection of the author impossible), and a \n     series of code-words and symbols that indicate the \n     approximate content.\n       Blackwind's many offerings--there were about 200 stories in \n     all, with Blackwind contributing perhaps 15 of them--\n     usually fell into the categories that are denoted by the \n     codes `m-f, f-f, scat.pedo.snuff', meaning that they \n     contain scenes of male-female sex, female-female sex, \n     scatological imagery, paedophiliac description and the \n     eventual killing of the central victim. You quickly get, I \n     think, the drift. Others are more horrifying still--those \n     that end with the invariable `snuff' scene, but whose \n     enticements on the way include `best', `torture', `gore' \n     or `amputees', and which refer to sex with animals, \n     bloodlettings, sadistic injury, and the limitless erotic \n     joy of stumps.\n       It is important to note that no one polices or, to use the \n     Internet word, `moderates', this group, (Some of the more \n     obscure and non-sexual newsgroups do have a volunteer, \n     usually a specialist in the field, who tries to keep order in \n     what might, if unchecked, become an unruly discussion.) On \n     `alt.sex.stories' there is only one man, a Mr. Joshua Laff of \n     the University of Illinois at Urbana, who oversees the group, \n     in a somewhat lethargic way. He helpfully suggests the code-\n     words for the various kinds of perverse interests. He \n     indicates to people who want to talk about sex stories, \n     rather than actually contributing them, that they would be \n     better advised to post their gripes on \n     `alt.sex.stories.discussion', next door, and so on.\n       But Mr. Laff has no admitted scruples about what is \n     permitted to go out over the air. So far as he is concerned, \n     the First Amendment to the Constitution protects all that is \n     said on `alt.sex.stories' as free speech. What is \n     demonstrated on these thousands of electronic pages is a \n     living exhibition of the birthright of all who are fortunate \n     enough to be born in the land that has given us the National \n     Rifle Association, the Reverend Jimmy Swaggart, and \n     Blackwind.\n       In truth, Mr. Laff and those who support the published \n     existence of such writings are technically right. No obscene \n     pictures are published--these could be banned in law. No \n     obscene truths are proffered, so far as we know--no \n     confessions of real rapes, nor of actual acts of pedorasty. \n     And since all the stories are prefaced with warnings that \n     those under 18, or those of sensitive disposition, should \n     read no further--devices that presumably attract precisely \n     those they purport to deter--so, the authors seem to agree, \n     their ramblings do no harm at all.\n       Most individual states legislate firmly or less so against \n     printed pornography: but so far no one has successfully \n     prosecuted the Internet--not least for the reason that with \n     so amorphous, so global and so informal a linking of \n     computers, who out there can be held responsible? People like \n     Blackwind simply open accounts at what are known as \n     `anonymous posting systems', and their words become filtered \n     through two or three computers in such a way that the \n     original source can never be known, and the perpetrator of \n     any possible crime becomes impossible to find. And, anyway, \n     those who endlessly cry First Amendment! Here we want to say \n     that the publishing of more words, even those from so clearly \n     depraved an individual as Blackwind, can do no harm at all.\n       Commonsense would argue otherwise. A long and graphic \n     account of exactly how and at what hour you wait outside a \n     girls' school, how best to bundle a seven-year-old into your \n     van, whether to tell her at the start of her ordeal that she \n     is going to be killed at the end of it (Blackwind's favoured \n     modus operandi), how best to tie her down, which aperture to \n     approach first, and with what--such things can only tempt \n     those who verge on such acts to take a greater interest in \n     them.\n       Surely such essays tell the thinker of forbidden thoughts \n     that there exists somewhere out there a like-minded group of \n     men for whom such things are really not so bad, the enjoyment \n     of which, if no one is so ill-starred as to get caught, can \n     be limitless. Surely it is naive folly--or, at the other end \n     of the spectrum, gross irresponsibility--to suppose \n     otherwise.\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\n       Such material is not, I am happy to say, universally \n     available. Some of the big corporations which offer public \n     access to the Internet--America On-Line, CompuServe, Prodigy, \n     Mr. Murdoch's Delphi--have systems in place that filter out \n     the more objectionable newsgroups. On America On-Line you may \n     read the ramblings on `alt.sex.voyeurism' and probably even \n     `alt.sex.nasal.hair', but you may read no `alt.sex.stories', \n     nor may you learn techniques for having real relationships, \n     as paedophiles like to say they have, with young children.\n       But for those with the wherewithal to find more robust and \n     uncontrolled access to cyberspace--and that means, quite \n     frankly, most of the world's computer users, be they 90 years \n     old or nine--all newsgroups are equally available, the evil \n     along with the excellent. The question we have to ask is \n     whether that should continue to be the case.\n       One might not mind so much if the material were being \n     confined to the United States, where most of it originates. \n     But in fact it manages to seep its electronic way everywhere, \n     from Wiltshire to Waziristan. And crucially, no mechanism is \n     yet in place allowing foreigners--whose laws might well be \n     far less tolerantly disposed to it--to filer it out.\n       A computer owner in Islington or Islamabad can have easy \n     and inexpensive access to material over the net which would \n     be illegal for him or her to read or buy on any British or \n     Pakistani street. In China, pornographers would be imprisoned \n     for publishing material that any Peking University students \n     can read at the click of a mouse; and the same is true in \n     scores of other countries and societies. The Internet, we \n     smugly say, has become a means of circumventing the \n     restrictive codes of tyrannics. But the reverse of this coin \n     is less attractive; it also allows an almost exclusively \n     American contagion to ooze outwards, unstoppable, like an oil \n     spill, contaminating everyone and everything in its path.\n       We cannot, of course, prevent: such things being thought. \n     We may not prevent them being written for self-gratification \n     alone. But, surely, science and the public can somehow \n     conspire and co-operate to see that such writings as are \n     represented by `scat.pedo.torture.snuff' and the like are \n     neither published nor read, and that they do not in \n     consequence have the opportunity to spread outwards as an \n     electronic contagion from the minds of those who, like \n     Blackwind, first create them.\n       The Jeffersonian model for universal freedom which Mr. \n     Gingrich so rightly applauds could not take into account the \n     barbarisms of the modern mind. Nor could it imagine the \n     genius by which such barbarisms can be disseminated as they \n     are today, in seconds, to the remotest and still most \n     innocent corners of the world. Someone, perhaps even the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, is going to have to \n     consider soon the implications, for ill as well as good, of \n     our venture out onto the information superhighway, or else \n     there are going to be some very messy electronic traffic \n     accidents.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From Time Magazine, June 1995]\n\n                    Cyberporn--On a Screen Near You\n\n                        (By Philip Elmer-Dewitt)\n\n       It's popular, pervasive and surprisingly perverse, \n     according to the first survey of online erotica. And there's \n     no easy way to stamp it out.\n       Sex is everywhere these days--in books, magazines, films, \n     television, music videos and bus-stop perfume ads. It is \n     printed on dial-a-porn business cards and slipped under \n     windshield wipers. It is acted out by balloon-breasted models \n     and actors with unflagging erections, then rented for $4 a \n     night at the corner video store. Most Americans have become \n     so inured to the open display of eroticism--and the arguments \n     for why it enjoys special status under the First Amendment--\n     that they hardly notice it's there.\n       Something about the combination of sex and computers, \n     however, seems to make otherwise worldly-wise adults a little \n     crazy. How else to explain the uproar surrounding the \n     discovery by a U.S. Senator--Nebraska Democrat James Exon--\n     that pornographic pictures can be downloaded from the \n     Internet and displayed on a home computer? This, as any \n     computer-savvy undergrad can testify, is old news. Yet \n     suddenly the press is on alert, parents and teachers are up \n     in arms, and lawmakers in Washington are rushing to ban the \n     smut from cyberspace with new legislation--sometimes with \n     little regard to either its effectiveness or its \n     constitutionality.\n       If you think things are crazy now, though, wait until the \n     politicians get hold of a report coming out this week. A \n     research team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, has counted an exhaustive study of online \n     porn--what's available, who is downloading it, what turns \n     them on--and the findings (to be published in the Georgetown \n     Law Journal) are sure to pour fuel on an already explosive \n     debate.\n       The study, titled Marketing Pornography on the Information \n     Superhighway, is significant not only for what it tells us \n     about what's happening on the computer networks but also for \n     what it tells us about ourselves. Pornography's appeal is \n     surprisingly elusive. It plays as much on fear, anxiety, \n     curiosity and taboo as on genuine eroticism. The Carnegie \n     Mellon study, drawing on elaborate computer records of online \n     activity, was able to measure for the first time what people \n     actually download, rather than what they say they want to \n     see. ``We now know what the consumers of computer pornography \n     really look at in the privacy of their own homes,'' says \n     Marty Rimm, the study's principal investigator. ``And we're \n     finding a fundamental shift in the kinds of images they \n     demand.''\n       What the Carnegie Mellon researchers discovered was:\n       There's an awful lot of porn online. In an 18-month study, \n     the team surveyed 917,410 sexually explicit pictures, \n     descriptions, short stories and film clips. On those Usenet \n     newsgroups where digitized images are stored, 83.5 percent of \n     the pictures were pornographic.\n       It is immensely popular. Trading in sexually explicit \n     imagery, according to the report, is now ``one of the largest \n     (if not the largest) recreational applications of users of \n     computer networks.'' At one U.S. University, 13 of the 40 \n     most frequently visited newsgroups had names like \n     alt.sex.stories, rec.arts.erotica and alt.sex.bondage.\n       It is a big moneymaker. The great majority (71 percent) of \n     the sexual images on the newsgroups surveyed originate from \n     adult-oriented computer bulletin-board systems (BBS) whose \n     operators are trying to lure customers to their private \n     collections of X-rated material. There are thousands of these \n     BBS services, which charge fees (typically $10 to $30 a \n     month) and take credit cards; the five largest have annual \n     revenues in excess of $1 million.\n       It is ubiquitous. Using data obtained with permission from \n     BBS operators, the Carnegie Mellon team identified (but did \n     not publish the names of) individual consumers in more than \n     2,000 cities in all 50 states and 40 countries, territories \n     and provinces around the world--including some countries \n     like China, where possession of pornography can be a \n     capital offense.\n       It is a guy thing. According to the BBS operators, 98.9 \n     percent of the consumers of online porn are men. And there is \n     some evidence that many of the remaining 1.1 percent are \n     women paid to hang out on the ``chat'' rooms and bulletin \n     boards to make the patrons feel more comfortable.\n       It is not just naked women. Perhaps because hard-core sex \n     pictures are so widely available elsewhere, the adult BBS \n     market seems to be driven largely by a demand for images that \n     can't be found in the average magazine rack: pedophilia (nude \n     photos of children), hebephilia (youths) and what the \n     researchers call paraphilia--a grab bag of ``deviant'' \n     material that includes images of bondage, sadomasochism, \n     urination, defecation, and sex acts with a barnyard full of \n     animals.\n       The appearance of material like this on a public network \n     accessible to men, women and children around the world raises \n     issues too important to ignore--or to oversimplify. Parents \n     have legitimate concerns about what their kids are being \n     exposed to and, conversely, what those children might miss if \n     their access to the Internet were cut off. Lawmakers must \n     balance public safety with their obligation to preserve \n     essential civil liberties. Men and women have to come to \n     terms with what draws them to such images. And computer \n     programmers have to come up with more enlightened ways to \n     give users control over a network that is, by design, largely \n     out of control.\n       The Internet, of course, is more than a place to find \n     pictures of people having sex with dogs. It's a vast \n     marketplace of ideas and information of all sorts--on \n     politics, religion, science and technology. If the fast-\n     growing World Wide Web fulfills its early promise, the \n     network could be a powerful engine of economic growth in the \n     21st century. And as the Carnegie Mellon study is careful to \n     point out, pornographic image files, despite their evident \n     popularity, represent only about 3 percent of all the \n     messages on the Usenet newsgroups, while the Usenet itself \n     represents only 11.5 percent of the traffic on the Internet.\n       As shocking and, indeed, legally obscene as some of the \n     online porn may be, the researchers found nothing that can't \n     be found in specialty magazines or adult bookstores. Most of \n     the material offered by the private BBS services, in fact, is \n     simply scanned from existing print publications.\n       But pornography is different on the computer networks. You \n     can obtain it in the privacy of your home--without having to \n     walk into a seedy bookstore or movie house. You can download \n     only those things that turn you on, rather than buy an entire \n     magazine or video. You can explore different aspects of your \n     sexuality without exposing yourself to communicable diseases \n     or public ridicule. (Unless, of course, someone gets hold of \n     the computer files tracking your online activities, as \n     happened earlier this year to a couple dozen crimson-faced \n     Harvard students.)\n       The great fear of parents and teachers, of course, is not \n     that college students will find this stuff but that it will \n     fall into the hands of those much younger--including some, \n     perhaps, who are not emotionally prepared to make sense of \n     what they see.\n       Ten-year-old Anders Urmacher, a student at the Dalton \n     School in New York City who likes to hang out with other kids \n     in the Treehouse chat room on America Online, got E-mail from \n     a stranger that contained a mysterious file with instructions \n     for how to download it. He followed the instructions, and \n     then he called his mom. When Linda Mann-Urmacher opened the \n     file, the computer screen filled with 10 thumbnail-size \n     pictures showing couples engaged in various acts of sodomy, \n     heterosexual intercourse and\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\n     lesbian sex. ``I was not aware that this stuff was online,'' \n     says a shocked Mann-Urmacher. ``Children should not be \n     subjected to these images.''\n       This is the flip side of Vice President Al Gore's vision of \n     an information superhighway linking every school and library \n     in the land. When the kids are plugged in, will they be \n     exposed to the seamiest sides of human sexuality? Will they \n     fall prey to child molesters hanging out in electronic chat \n     rooms? It's precisely these fears that have stopped Bonnie \n     Fell of Skokie, Illinois, from signing up for the Internet \n     access her three boys say they desperately need.\n       ``They could get bombarded with X-rated porn, and I \n     wouldn't have any idea,'' she says. Mary Veed, a mother of \n     three from nearby Hinsdale, makes a point of trying to keep \n     up with her computer-literate 12-year-old, but sometimes has \n     to settle for monitoring his phone bill. ``Once they get to \n     be a certain age, boys don't always tell Mom what they do,'' \n     she says.\n       ``We face a unique, disturbing and urgent circumstance, \n     because it is children who are the computer experts in our \n     nation's families,'' said Republican Senator Dan Coats of \n     Indiana during the debate over the controversial anti-\n     cyberporn bill he co-sponsored with Senator Exon.\n       According to at least one of those experts--16-year-old \n     David Slifka of Manhattan--the danger of being bombarded with \n     unwanted pictures is greatly exaggerated. ``If you don't want \n     them you won't get them,'' says the veteran Internet surfer. \n     Private adult BBSs require proof of age (usually a driver's \n     license) and are off-limits to minors, and kids have to \n     master some fairly daunting computer science before they can \n     turn so-called binary files on the Usenet into high-\n     resolution color pictures. ``The chances of randomly coming \n     across them are unbelievably slim,'' says Slifka.\n       While groups like the Family Research Council insist that \n     online child molesters represent a clear and present danger, \n     there is no evidence that it is any greater than the thousand \n     other threats children face every day. Ernie Allen, executive \n     director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children, acknowledges that there have been 10 or 12 ``fairly \n     high-profile cases'' in the past year of children being \n     seduced or lured online into situations where they are \n     victimized. Kids who are not online are also at risk, \n     however; more than 800,000 children are reported missing \n     every year in the U.S.\n       Yet it is in the name of the children and their parents \n     that lawmakers are racing to fight cyberporn. The first blow \n     was struck by Senators Exon and Coats, who earlier this year \n     introduced revisions to an existing law called the \n     Communications Decency Act. The idea was to extend \n     regulations written to govern the dial-a-porn industry into \n     the computer networks. The bill proposed to outlaw obscene \n     material and impose fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms \n     of up to two years on anyone who knowingly makes ``indecent'' \n     material available to children under 18.\n       The measure had problems from the start. In its original \n     version it would have made online-service providers \n     criminally liable for any obscene communications that passed \n     through their systems--a provision that, given the way the \n     networks operate, would have put the entire Internet at risk. \n     Exon and Coats revised the bill but left in place the \n     language about using ``indecent'' words online. ``It's a \n     frontal assault on the First Amendment,'' says Harvard law \n     professor Laurence Tribe. Even veteran prosecutors ridicule \n     it. ``It won't pass scrutiny even in misdemeanor court,'' \n     says one.\n       The Exon bill had been written off for dead only a few \n     weeks ago. Republican Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, \n     chairman of the Commerce committee, which has jurisdiction \n     over the larger telecommunications-reform act to which it is \n     attached, told Time that he intended to move to table it.\n       That was before Exon showed up in the Senate with his \n     ``blue book.'' Exon had asked a friend to download some of \n     the rawer images available online. ``I knew it was bad,'' \n     he says. ``But then when I got on there, it made Playboy \n     and Hustler look like Sunday-school stuff.'' He had the \n     images printed out, stuffed them in a blue folder and \n     invited his colleagues to stop by his desk on the Senate \n     floor to view them. At the end of the debate--which was \n     carried live on c-span--few Senators wanted to cast a \n     nationally televised vote that might later be \n     characterized as pro-pornography. The bill passed 84 to \n     16.\n       Civil libertarians were outraged. Mike Godwin, staff \n     counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, complained \n     that the indecency portion of the bill would transform the \n     vast library of the Internet into a children's reading room, \n     where only subjects suitable for kids could be discussed. \n     ``It's government censorship,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the \n     Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``The Amendment \n     shouldn't end where the Internet begins.''\n       The key issue, according to legal scholars, is whether the \n     Internet is a print medium (like a newspaper), which enjoys \n     strong protection against government interference, or a \n     broadcast medium (like television), which may be subject to \n     all sorts of government control. Perhaps the most significant \n     import of the Exon bill, according to EFF's Godwin, is that \n     it would place the computer networks under the jurisdiction \n     of the Federal Communications Commission, which enforces, \n     among other rules, the injunction against using the famous \n     seven dirty words on the radio. In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 \n     Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich Partners, \n     respondents were sharply split on the issue: 42 percent were \n     for FCC-like control over sexual content on the computer \n     networks; 48 percent were against it.\n       By week's end the balance between protecting speech and \n     curbing pornography seemed to be tipping back toward the \n     libertarians. In a move that surprised conservative \n     supporters, House Speaker Newt Gingrich denounced the Exon \n     amendment. ``It is clearly a violation of free speech, and \n     it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with \n     each other,'' he told a caller on a cable-TV show. It was a \n     key defection, because Gingrich will preside over the \n     computer-decency debate when it moves to the House in July. \n     Meanwhile, two U.S. Representatives, Republican Christopher \n     Cox of California and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, were \n     putting together an anti-Exon amendment that would bar \n     federal regulation of the Internet and help parents find ways \n     to block material they found objectionable.\n       Coincidentally, in the closely watched case of a University \n     of Michigan student who published a violent sex fantasy on \n     the Internet and was charged with transmitting a threat to \n     injure or kidnap across state lines, a federal judge in \n     Detroit last week dismissed the charges. The judge ruled that \n     while Jake Baker's story might be deeply offensive, it was \n     not a crime.\n       How the Carnegie Mellon report will affect the delicate \n     political balance on the cyberporn debate is anybody's guess. \n     Conservatives thumbing through it for rhetorical ammunition \n     will find plenty. Appendix B lists the most frequently \n     downloaded files from a popular adult BBS, providing both the \n     download count and the two-line descriptions posted by the \n     board's operator. Suffice it to say that they all end in \n     exclamation points, many include such phrases as ``nailed to \n     a table!'' and none can be printed in Time.\n       How accurately these images reflect America's sexual \n     interests, however, is a matter of some dispute. University \n     of Chicago sociologist Edward Laumann, whose 1994 Sex in \n     America survey painted a far more humdrum picture of \n     America's sex life, says the Carnegie Mellon study may have \n     captured what he calls the ``gaper phenomenon.'' ``There is a \n     curiosity for things that are extraordinary and way out,'' he \n     says. ``It's like driving by a horrible accident. No one \n     wants to be in it, but we all slow down to watch.''\n       Other sociologists point out that the difference between \n     the Chicago and Carnegie Mellon reports may be more apparent \n     than real. Those 1 million or 2 million people who download \n     pictures from the Internet represent a self-selected group \n     with an interest in erotica. The Sex in America respondents, \n     by contrast, were a few thousand people selected to represent \n     a cross section of all American. Still, the new research is a \n     gold mine for psychologists, social scientists, computer \n     marketers and anybody with an interest in human boards, they \n     left a digital trail of their transactions, allowing the \n     pornographers to compile data bases about their buying habits \n     and sexual tastes. The more sophisticated operators were able \n     to adjust their inventory and their descriptions to match \n     consumer demand.\n       Nobody did this more effectively than Robert Thomas, owner \n     of the Amateur Action BBS in Milpitas, California, and a kind \n     of modern-day Marquis de Sade, according to the Carnegie \n     Mellon report. He is currently serving time in an obscenity \n     case that may be headed for the Supreme Court.\n       Thomas, whose BBS is the online-porn market leader, \n     discovered that he could boost sales by trimming soft- and \n     hard-core images from his data base while front-loading his \n     files with pictures of sex acts with animals (852) and nude \n     prepubescent children (more than 5,000), his two most popular \n     categories of porn. He also used copywriting tricks to better \n     serve his customers' fantasies. For example, he described \n     more than 1,200 of his pictures as depicting sex scenes \n     between family members (father and daughter, mother and son), \n     even though there was no evidence that any of the \n     participants were actually related. These ``incest'' images \n     were among his biggest sellers, accounting for 10 percent of \n     downloads.\n       The words that worked were sometimes quite revealing. \n     Straightforward oral sex, for example, generally got a \n     lukewarm response. But when Thomas described the same images \n     using words like choke or choking, consumer demand doubled.\n       Such findings may cheer antipornography activists; as \n     feminist writer Andrea Dworkin puts it, ``the whole purpose \n     of pornography is to hurt women,'' Catharine MacKinnon, a \n     professor of law at the University of Michigan, goes further. \n     Women are doubly violated by pornography, she writes in \n     Vindication and Resistance, one of three essays in the \n     forthcoming Georgetown Law Journal that offer differing views \n     on the Carnegie Mellon report. They are violated when it is \n     made and exposed to further violence again and again every \n     time it is consumed. ``The question pornography poses in \n     cyberspace,'' she writes, ``is the same one it poses \n     everywhere else: Whether anything will be done about it.''\n       But not everyone agrees with Dworkin and MacKinnon, by any \n     means; even some feminist think there is a place in life--and \n     the Internet--for erotica. In her new book, Defending \n     Pornography, Nadine Strossen argues that censoring sexual \n     expression would\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n     do women more harm than good, undermining their equality, \n     their autonomy and their freedom.\n       The Justice Department, for it part, has not asked for new \n     antiporn legislation. Distributing obscene material across \n     state lines is already illegal under federal law, and child \n     pornography in particular is vigorously prosecuted. Some 40 \n     people in 14 states were arrested two years ago in Operation \n     Longarm for exchanging kiddie porn online. And one of the \n     leading characters in the Carnegie Mellon study--a former \n     Rand McNally executive named Robert Copella, who left book \n     publishing to make his fortune selling pedophilia on the \n     networks--was extradited from Tijuana, and is now awaiting \n     sentencing in a New Jersey jail.\n       For technical reasons, it is extremely difficult to stamp \n     out anything on the Internet--particularly images stored on \n     the Usenet newsgroup. As Internet pioneer John Gilmore \n     famously put it, ``The Net interprets censorship as damage \n     and routes around it.'' There are border issues as well. \n     Other countries on the Internet--France, for instance--are \n     probably no more interested in having their messages \n     screened by U.S. censors than Americans would be in having \n     theirs screened by, say, the government of Saudi Arabia.\n       Historians say it should come as no surprise that the \n     Internet--the most democratic of media--would lead to new \n     calls for censorship. The history of pornography and efforts \n     to suppress it are inextricably bound up with the rise of new \n     media and the emergence of democracy. According to Walter \n     Kendrick, author of The Secret Museum: Pornography in Modern \n     Culture, the modern concept of pornography was invented in \n     the 19th century by European gentlemen whose main concern was \n     to keep obscene material away from women and the lower \n     classes. Things got out of hand with the spread of literacy \n     and education, which made pornography available to anybody \n     who could read. Now, on the computer networks, anybody with a \n     computer and a modem can not only consume pornography but \n     distribute it as well. On the Internet, anybody can be Bob \n     Guccione.\n       That might not be a bad idea, says Carlin Meyer, a \n     professor at New York Law School whose Georgetown essay takes \n     a far less apocalyptic view than MacKinnon's. She argues that \n     if you don't like the images of sex the pornographers offer, \n     the appropriate response is not to suppress them but to \n     overwhelm them with healthier, more realistic ones. Sex on \n     the Internet, she maintains, might actually be good for young \n     people. ``[Cyberspace] is a safe space in which to explore \n     the forbidden and the taboo,'' she writes. ``It offers the \n     possibility for genuine, unembarrassed conversations about \n     accurate as well as fantasy images of sex.''\n       That sounds easier than it probably is. Pornography is \n     powerful stuff, and as long as there is demand for it, there \n     will always be a supply. Better software tools may help check \n     the worst abuses, but there will never be a switch that will \n     cut it off entirely--not without destroying the unbridled \n     expression that is the source of the Internet's (and \n     democracy's) greatest strength. The hard truth, says John \n     Perry Barlow, co-founder of the EFF and father of three young \n     daughters, is that the burden ultimately falls where it \n     always has: on the parents. ``If you don't want your children \n     fixating on filth,'' he says, ``better step up to the tough \n     task of raising them to find it as distasteful as you do \n     yourself.''\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  If it was not referenced, I would reference the graphic picture on \nthe front of Time magazine today, which I think puts into focus very \ndistinctly and directly what my friend from Iowa and this Senator has \nbeen talking about for a long, long time.\n  I would also reference for the Record and ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record, interestingly enough, simultaneously a \nsimilar story along the same lines that appeared in this morning's \nweekly edition of Newsweek magazine.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, July 3, 1995]\n\n                           No Place for Kids?\n\n\n                   A Parent's Guide to Sex on the Net\n\n                            (By Steven Levy)\n\n       When the annals of cyberspace are uploaded for future \n     generations, digital historians will undoubtedly include a \n     scene from the Senate chamber earlier this month: Nebraska \n     Democrat James Exon brandishing a thin binder now known as \n     the blue book. Inside were images snatched from the shadows \n     and thrust into the center of public discourse. Women bound \n     and being burned by cigarettes. Pierced with swords. Having \n     sex with a German shepherd. As Exon puts it, images that are \n     ``repulsive and far off base.'' Images from the Net.\n       Exon compiled his blue book to persuade his Senate \n     colleagues to pass his Communications Decency Act. Partially \n     moved by a private showing in the Senate cloakroom, they did \n     so, overwhelmingly. It is not clear whether the act, which \n     places strict limits on all speech in computer networks, will \n     find its way into law, but its Senate passage was a \n     transforming blow against the Internet empire. Even the most \n     vehement of the Internet's defenders now face a real problem: \n     how to maintain free speech when well-chronicled excesses \n     give the impression that much of cyberspace is a cesspool.\n       Indeed, most of the dispatches from the electronic world \n     these days seem to dwell on the dark side. The most prevalent \n     type of anecdote involves someone like Susan Tilghman, a \n     medical doctor in Fairfax, Va. Last fall she hooked the \n     family computer to America Online (AOL). Her sons, 12 and 15 \n     years old, enjoyed it so much that she and her husband sought \n     to find out why. Clicking on files their boys had read, the \n     astonished parents found ``pornographic pictures in full \n     color,'' says Tilghman, ``We were horrified.'' She pulled the \n     modem plus immediately.\n       Then there are the actual busts of online pornographic \n     rings. Just as in the physical world, traffic in obscene \n     material is illegal in cyberspace, and authorities are \n     beginning to prosecute zealously. The most recent raid \n     occurred last week in Cincinnati, targeting not only \n     purveyors of porn but more than 100 individuals who had \n     allegedly downloaded pornographic images of children via AOL.\n       Most disturbing of all are the tales of sexual predators \n     using the Internet and commercial online services to spirit \n     children away from their keyboards. Until now parents have \n     believed that no physical harm could possibly result when \n     their progeny were huddled safely in the bedroom or den, \n     tapping on the family computer. But then came news of cases \n     like the 13-year-old Kentucky girl found in Los Angeles after \n     supposedly being lured by a grown-up cyberpal.\n       These reports have triggered a sort of parental panic about \n     cyberspace. Parents are rightfully confused, faced with hard \n     choices about whether to expose their children to the alleged \n     benefits of cyberspace when carnal pitfalls lie ahead. As our \n     culture moves unrelentingly toward the digital realm, some \n     questions--and answers--are finally coming into focus.\n\n\n                  how much sex is there in cyberspace?\n\n       A lot. Brian Reid, director of the Network Systems \n     Laboratory at Digital Equipment Corp., reports that one of \n     the most popular of the thousands of Usenet discussion groups \n     is the ``alt.sex'' group. He estimates that on a monthly \n     basis between 180,000 and 500,000 users drop in. A glance at \n     some World Wide Web sites shows that while the digital home \n     of the Smithsonian Institution took seven weeks to gather 1.9 \n     million visits, or ``hits,'' Playboy's electronic \n     headquarters received 4.7 million hits in a seven-day period \n     last month.\n       And this week the Georgetown Law Journal will release a \n     survey headed by Marty Rimm, a 30-year-old researcher at \n     Carnegie Mellon University. In his paper, ``Marketing \n     Pornography on the Information Superhighway,'' Rimm \n     concentrated mostly on adults-only bulletin boards (the \n     equivalent of X-rated bookshops). He provides solid evidence \n     that there's loads of hard-core stuff in cyberspace. Rimm \n     wrote a computer program to analyze descriptions of 917,410 \n     dirty pictures (he examined about 10,000 actual images, to \n     check the realiability of the descriptions). His conclusion: \n     ``I think there's almost no question that we're seeing an \n     unprecedented availability and demand of material like \n     sadomasochism, bestiality, vaginal and rectal fisting, \n     eroticized urination . . . and pedophilia.''\n\n\n              how easy is it to avoid the sexual material?\n\n       Donna Rice Hughes (yes, that Donna Rice), spokesperson for \n     an anti-pornography group called Enough is Enough!, claims \n     that ``children are going online innocently and naively \n     running across material that's illegal even for adults.'' But \n     the way the Internet works, that sort of stuff doesn't tend \n     to pop up uninvited. ``When you watch TV it comes right to \n     you,'' says Donna Hoffman, associate professor of business at \n     Vanderbilt University. ``But on the Internet, you're in an \n     environment with 30 million channels. It's up to you to \n     decide where to go. You don't have to download the images on \n     alt.sex.binaries.''\n       Groups with ``binaries'' are the picture files, the ones \n     containing the most shocking images. To find them, one needs \n     a good sense of digital direction. Depending on the software \n     you have, you may need a mastery of some codes in the \n     notoriously arcane Unix computer language, or it can involve \n     a few well-chosen clicks of the mouse. In any case, there's \n     no way you get that stuff by accident.\n       Kids are very hungry to view sexual materials, and left to \n     their own devices they will\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\n     find that the Internet provides them with an unprecedented \n     bonanza. In predigital days, getting one's hands on hot \n     pictures required running an often impenetrable gantlet of \n     drugstore clerks and newsstand operators, and finding really \n     hardcore material was out of the question. Not so with the \n     Net. Frank Moretti, associate headmaster of the Dalton School \n     in New York City, which offers Internet access beginning in \n     junior high, thinks that we can deal with that. ``There's a \n     candy store around the corner from our school that has just \n     about every kind of pornographic image,'' he says. ``The \n     challenge is to help our children use self-discipline.''\n\n\n                 is the internet a haven for predators?\n\n       After years of online activity, ``there have been about a \n     dozen high-profile cases,'' says Ernie Allen, president of \n     the Arlington, Va.-based National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children. ``It's not a huge number, but it does \n     indicate that there are risks. But there are risks in \n     everything a child does. Our concern is the nature of the \n     technology. It creates a false sense of security.''\n       What parents should warn kids about is the classic scenario \n     described by Detective Bill Dworn, head of the Sexually \n     Exploited Child Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department: \n     ``The pervert can get on any bulletin board and chat with \n     kids all night long. He lies about his age and makes friends. \n     As soon as he can get a telephone number or address, he's \n     likely to look up the kid and molest him or her.'' In real \n     life, this hardly ever happens. Most online services have \n     policies to monitor chat rooms, particularly those designated \n     as ``kids-only.'' No guarantees, but not many kidnappers.\n       And if the child is propositioned? ``It happens, but it's \n     less upsetting if a child is prepared for it,'' says Sherry \n     Turkle, an MIT professor whose coming book, ``Life on the \n     Screen,'' includes data about the experiences of nearly 300 \n     kids on the Net. ``Better to warn the child and instruct him \n     to say, `I'm not interested,' and just leave.''\n       All the publicity about predators has tarnished the image \n     of chat rooms. But the talk areas may have value. ``Kids are \n     finding ways to experiment with self-presentation,'' says \n     Turkle. She's talked with kids about ``Net sex,'' where kids \n     dabble in interactive erotica like this:\n       I'm kissing you.\n       You fondle my hair.\n       I fondle your breast.\n       Sometimes there is conscious gender-swapping. Sometimes \n     things go farther than the kids intended. Still, Turkle \n     thinks that there may be benefits in this; after all, no one \n     gets pregnant in cyberspace. ``Adolescence used to be a \n     timeout, sexually speaking,'' she says. ``But in the age of \n     AIDS, sexual experimentation is a deadly game. The Internet \n     is becoming a way to play with identity, where adolescents \n     can develop a sense of themselves.''\n\n\n             can new laws successfully address the problem?\n\n       The Exon amendment is very broad. It could hamper \n     communication between adults--the essence of online \n     activity--and might not even solve the problems that kids \n     face. ``It would be a mistake to drive us, in a moment of \n     hysteria, to a solution that is unconstitutional, would \n     stultify technology, and wouldn't even fulfill its mission,'' \n     argues * * * Berman, director of the Center for Democracy and \n     Technology.\n       But Berman and others have a secret weapon: the House of \n     Representatives. ``There's a generational difference between \n     the House and Senate,'' says Berman. ``They understand the \n     technology and they're not afraid of it.'' The only question \n     was whether this pro-technology impulse, along with a \n     loathing for government regulation, would lead Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich and his minions to defy their allies in the \n     religious right, whose ``Contract With the American Family'' \n     calls for ``protecting children from exposure to pornography \n     on the Internet.''\n       The question was answered last Tuesday night when a caller \n     on a cable-TV talk show asked Gingrich what he thought of \n     Exon's amendment. ``I think it has no meaning and no real \n     impact . . .,'' the speaker said. ``It is clearly a violation \n     of free speech and it's a violation of the rights of adults \n     to communicate with each other.''\n       But that was not the worst news for would-be monitors of \n     cyberspace. Conservative Republican Chris Cox of California \n     has teamed with liberal Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon to \n     develop the grandiosely entitled Internet Freedom and Family \n     Empowerment Act. Basically, the bill would forbid the federal \n     government from creating any regulatory agency to govern the \n     Internet, relying instead on a variety of means (not yet \n     determined) to protect children. Cox hopes that such \n     legislation will encourage a free-market solution to cybersex \n     from . . . more new technology.\n\n\n                     can high-tech solutions help?\n\n       Ultimately, James Exon's greatest contribution to the \n     protection of children may not be his legislation but the \n     fear of it has created in Silicon Valley and its virtual \n     environments. Already parents can buy some sophisticated \n     software to block children's access to questionable material. \n     More is on the way; two weeks ago Microsoft, Netscape and the \n     Progressive Networks joined together to develop new \n     prophylactic devices. ``The Exon amendment certainly raised \n     consciousness,'' says Mike Homer of Netscape. ``But we \n     believe there is a variety of fairly straightforward tools \n     that would allow us to self-regulate.'' More than 100 \n     companies have called, asking to help. Another, paragraph \n     complementary, scheme in the works is KidCode, a means by \n     which the addresses on the World Wide Web will have voluntary \n     ratings embedded. ``Places that provide erotica on the \n     Internet are wild about the idea of voluntary ratings,'' says \n     Nathaniel Borenstein, designer of KidCode. ``They don't want \n     to sell to kids.''\n       Meanwhile, one solution has already hit the market: \n     SurfWatch, created by an eponymous Silicon Valley firm. Its \n     software works by matching a potential Net destination to a \n     proprietary list of forbidden sites. In addition, the $50 \n     software package looks for objectionable language. Once \n     parents or educators install it, they have at least one line \n     of defense. ``This is the kind of software that can offer the \n     individual choice as opposed to censorship,'' says SurfWatch \n     vice president Jay Friendland.\n       Last week a bogus press release circulated on the Net for a \n     fictional product called Babe Watch that ``looks exactly like \n     SurfWatch but instead of blocking access, actually goes out \n     and locates Web sites with good pictures of babes.'' \n     Undoubtedly a real-life version is in the works. ``If you're \n     a 16-year-old A-quality hacker, you'll be able to turn us \n     off,'' says Friendland.\n\n\n                     will the problem ever go away?\n\n       The bottom line when it comes to kids, sex and the Internet \n     is that no matter what laws we pass and what high-tech \n     solutions we devise, the three of them together will never be \n     less volatile than the first two alone. We can mitigate but \n     not eliminate the drawbacks of high tech; there's no way to \n     get its benefits without them.\n       It's a trade-off that Patricia Shao understands. About six \n     weeks ago, her 13-year-old daughter, visiting a friend, was \n     in an online-service chat room when they were propositioned \n     to have ``cybersex.'' Shao was shocked, and even more so when \n     her daughter casually told her, ``This is what happens when \n     we're online.'' ``They thought it was just a crackpot,'' says \n     Shao, a Bethesda, Md., marketing executive. Instead of \n     pulling the cyberplug, however, Shao took pains to educate \n     herself about online sex. She even engaged in some political \n     activism, signing on with a pro-Exon anti-pornography group. \n     And ultimately, Shao's family purchased its own America \n     Online subscription after her daughter's close encounter with \n     a pixilated stranger.\n       If there were more built-in programs like SurfWatch \n     available to her, Shao ways, she'd probably use them. But in \n     the meantime she is making do with the more old-fashioned \n     method of talking to her kids--and trusting them. ``I've \n     warned my children about the obscene material out there, and \n     I trust them not to access it.'' As careful parents will do, \n     she monitors the family online activity somewhat, by tracking \n     the hours they are logged on. But as with other passages--\n     going out alone, driving a car--ultimately, you have to let \n     kids grow up. Even if some of the growing up happens online.\n  Mr. EXON. The story Newsweek tells is not dissimilar. Alarming facts \nhave been brought out into the open even further with the publication \nin these two national magazines. The Newsweek article is entitled ``Sex \nOnline: What Parents Should Know.''\n  I very much appreciate having the time to take a look at the \nlegislation the Senator from Iowa has introduced. I do not know how it \nis significantly different from the measure that was introduced by \nSenator Coats and myself, known as the Decency Act, and approved on the \nSenate floor by a vote of 86 to 14, if I remember it correctly.\n  I simply say, this is an ongoing battle. If we have not done anything \nelse, I hope all will recognize today at least Americans know that \nthere is a real, real problem, primarily with regard to our children, \nour innocent children--at least as we like to think of them.\n  It seems to me all of the profit-making motives are now sizing the \nInternet to make money on, and I applaud the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the legislation that he just indicated he intended to \nintroduce with regard to crime taking over a more important part of the \nInternet. That happens wherever there is an exciting new development.\n  Once again, I emphasize this Senator has followed with keen interest \nthe development of the Internet. It so happens this Senator probably is \none of the few Members of this body who was on the original Internet. \nThe original Internet, the only thing like it, was the amateur radio \nnetwork that I became involved as a very young lad, 16 or 17 years old, \ngrowing up in Lake Andes, SD, and I communicated, dit-dit da-dit, with \npeople all over the United States. Of course you had to have a license \nto be an amateur radio operator; you had to pass certain tests. I guess \nno one ever thought about that first Internet being used for the \npurposes that this Internet is being used.\n  Nevertheless, as the senior member of the Armed Services Committee I \nwas very much involved in the Internet development. Some people wonder \nwhere\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\ndid the Internet come from? It came from and was borne by taxpayers' \ndollars, out of the national defense budget. It spread far beyond that \nat this time, and I certainly say and emphasize once again, I am a \nstrong supporter of the Internet, the information superhighway. But for \na long, long time, beginning seriously a little over a year ago, I \nbegan to develop legislation that would hopefully make the information \nsuperhighway a safer highway for kids and families to travel. The \nlegislation that was passed by the Senate on a 86 to 14 vote within the \nlast week or so was a follow-on to a proposal that I addressed and \nattached to the telecommunications bill out of the Commerce Committee \nlast year.\n  The concept of all of these has been to make a constructive \nsuggestion, recognizing constitutional rights. Like that portion \nreferred to by the Senator from Iowa, the measure crafted by myself and \nSenator Coats and our staffs, with the help of an awful lot of people, \ndoes provide protection, constitutional guarantees oftentimes supported \nby the courts in a whole series of areas including the laws that we \nhave always had regarding obscenity on the telephone lines and also \nlaws similarly against transportation of pornographic and obscene \nmaterials through the U.S. mail. Further, our law incorporates the \nprotections under the first amendment that have been argued out and \nthoroughly discussed and held by the courts under the Dial-a-Porn \nstatutes, which is another form of pornography.\n  It is safe to say, the issue has been engaged. I think that is for \nthe good. Once again, I cannot speak for my cosponsor, Senator Coats, \nor any cosponsor of the measure that passed the Senate, but this \nSenator simply says I am willing to listen to any improvements or \nchanges that should be made in this bill. But I certainly am not going \nto stand by and see it watered down to the place where it is totally \nmeaningless.\n  Therefore, I say I think we have accomplished a great deal by \nclearly, for the first time, illuminating and bringing this to the \nattention of parents of the United States of America. And parents still \nare required, I suggest, to play a key role in how we develop this and \nhow it is administered. But the parents, I think, cannot do it alone. \nTherefore, I hope we can continue to work together in a constructive \nfashion and not listen to the voices that simply say, ``I want what I \nwant when I want it on the Internet and I don't care what ill effect \nthat might have on kids.''\n  We have to continue to work together. I hope there is a way to solve \nthis problem for the good of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes here \nthis morning to oppose cuts for science education that were made June \n20, in the House Appropriations Committee, related to the Energy \nDepartment. Congress is engaged in an important process to reduce the \nFederal budget and I support that process. I recognize very difficult \nchoices will have to be made. But I want to be sure, to the extent I \ncan, that the process remains thoughtful and maintains our national \ncommitment to improvement in education and our national investment in \neducation, at the same time that we proceed toward a balanced budget. \nCuts being proposed for science education in the Department of Energy \nappropriation do not meet that test of thoughtfulness and support for \ninvestment in education.\n  In 1989, President Bush met with the 50 Governors throughout this \ncountry in an education summit in Charlottesville, VA. That was a \nhistoric occasion because for the first time the Governors and the \nPresident met together to discuss that important issue of how to \nimprove education in the country.\n  In 1990, they published goals for this country, and one of those \ngoals, which I believe was an extremely important goal for us to commit \nourselves to, was the goal of making this country first in the world in \nmath and science education by the year 2000. This is the backdrop \nagainst which we need to judge what we are doing in this appropriations \nprocess here in the Congress in these weeks.\n  I am told that the House appropriations bill, that I referred to \nbefore, significantly reduces the $160 million for science education \nembedded in various parts of the Department of Energy, and it \neliminates altogether the funding for two line items which are focused \nentirely on education. Those two line items are:\n  First, the University and Science Education Program in the Department \nof Energy Office of Science Education and Technical Information. The \nHouse appropriations mark for this program has reduced the funding from \nthe proposed $55 million, which the President asked for in his budget, \nto absolutely zero.\n  The second of these two line items is the Department of Energy \nTechnology Transfer and Education Program for Department of Energy \nOffice of Defense Programs. The House mark for this program was reduced \nfrom $249 million in fiscal year 1996--that was the proposed level--to \n$15 million, including a cut to zero funding for the $20 million line \nitem earmarked for science education at our three national weapons \nlaboratories.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, this is of concern to me because this \ndirectly affects two of those national laboratories in my home State of \nNew Mexico, Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.\n  First, let me describe the impact of the elimination of the Science \nEducation and Technical Information Program. This cut eliminates the \ncentral coordinating and evaluation mechanism for all of the Department \nof Energy education activities, which is the Office of Science \nEducation and Technical Information. In eliminating this office, \nCongress would eliminate the administrative infrastructure for other \nDepartment of Energy science education offices' programs, the only \nDepartment of Energy office in which education is not just an ancillary \nfunction.\n  In addition, this cut would eliminate the laboratory cooperative \nscience centers, which leverage the much larger investment in science \nand technology expertise residing in the Department of Energy \nLaboratory System. These centers connect thousands of students and \nteachers each year in high schools, colleges, and graduate programs \nwith scientists at our Department of Energy laboratories. The centers \nprovide training and mentoring, and hands-on laboratory experiences \nboth at the laboratories themselves and at local public schools and \nuniversities. They provide internships, faculty research opportunities, \nand professional development enhancements and lab-school partnerships. \nThey also help support the Department of Energy's scientists' \nparticipation in a variety of State and local systemic education reform \nactivities, such as the National Science Foundation's State systemic \nreform initiatives.\n  These cuts will weaken the pipeline of well-trained scientists \nsupported by the 73 percent of programs funds that go to universities \nto train future engineers, technicians, and scientists for current and \nfuture work force needs. They will eliminate Department of Energy work \nto support and strengthen the caliber of science and math education at \nthe secondary and at the college levels, and the 1996 priorities for \nwork force development, systemic education reform, science literacy, \nevaluation, and dissemination.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Energy education cuts will have a \nparticularly damaging effect for those who benefit from the education \nactivities of Sandia National Laboratory and Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in my home State of New Mexico.\n  First, they will suffer education cuts as part of the centers that I \njust described. Second, they will also suffer the loss of their part of \nthe additional $20 million for education programs concentrated at \nSandia, Los Alamos, and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, \nthe Nation's three weapons laboratories.\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\n  For Sandia National Laboratory, this would eliminate education \noutreach funding which in 1995 was $6 million from the Office of \nDefense Programs, $2.3 million from the Office of Science Education, \nand almost $2 million from other internal funds to reach a total of \nover $10 million.\n  This will mean the loss of K through 12 student enrichment programs, \nK through 12 teacher professional development programs, college and \nuniversity programs, and programs for educational technology.\n  For Los Alamos National Laboratory, it would eliminate educational \noutreach funding again for the 1995 fiscal year, which amounted to $6.3 \nmillion from the Office of Defense Programs, $1.3 million from the \nOffice of Science Education, $600,000 from other parts of the Office of \nEnergy Research, for a total of about $8 million.\n  This would mean the loss of nationally recognized model science and \nmath programs relied upon by the States that they serve for high-\nquality professional development for our teachers.\n  Together, these cuts in the two programs will hurt science education \nin the country, and it will especially hurt science education in my \nhome State of New Mexico. They will weaken the infrastructure support \nfor science education and work force preparation. These are the kinds \nof priorities that we need to protect. We need to reassert our \ncommitment to reaching the education goals that were established by \nPresident Bush and the Governors in 1989. We should not undermine those \ngoals by making these kinds of shortsighted cuts.\n  Mr. President, as we work to reach deficit reduction and to reach a \nbalanced budget, we need to make our priorities clear. One of our \npriorities needs to be retaining funding for science and math \neducation.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment or two to respond \nto something that was said earlier in morning business when the Senator \nfrom North Dakota gave his usual eloquent discourse on populism, and \nthe fact that he used phrases that Republicans have a philosophy where \nthe rich are paid too little and the poor are paid too much. That was \nin reference to a budget that will eliminate the deficit by the year \n2002.\n  It is always difficult to stand on the floor and defend an effort to \nreally do something about the deficit because those individuals who \nwant to continue the social programs, who want to continue business as \nusual, will stand up and make it look as if those of us who are trying \nto be fiscally responsible, those of us who recognize that it is not \nany of us in this Chamber but future generations that are going to have \nto pay for all of this fun we are having right now, that somehow we are \nnot acting responsibly. I think the elections of November 8, 1994, were \nvery clear warning signals that we are going to change, we are not \ngoing to have business as usual in America.\n  But the thing that disturbed me more than anything else that was said \nby the distinguished Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], was the \nreference to a national defense system, national missile defense \nsystem, star wars. This is the first warning sign that I have heard in \nthis cycle that we are going to have in fact opposition, people wanting \nto make it look like those of us who want to have a national missile \ndefense system, somehow we are looking up in the stars in a Buck Rogers \nkind of syndrome, that it is something that is very expensive and \nsomething we cannot have.\n  I would like to suggest, Mr. President, that we have an opportunity \nto prepare now to defend ourselves against a future national missile \nattack. It was not long ago that Jim Woolsey, who was the chief \nsecurity adviser to the President of the United States, President \nClinton, made the observation that our intelligence informs us that \nthere are between 20 and 25 countries that either have or are \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction--either nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological--and are developing the missile, the means of delivering \nthose warheads.\n  This is a very frightening thing, when we stop and realize that we in \nAmerica do not have a missile defense system. Most people think we do \nhave it somehow, but we do not.\n  Many of us can remember what happened back in 1972 when the ABM \nTreaty was agreed to, that back in 1972 it was a treaty predicated on \nthe assumption that there were two superpowers in the world, the Soviet \nUnion and the United States. I suggest, Mr. President, that there are \nmany of us who believe that the threat out there to the United States \nsecurity could be greater now than it was back then because at least \nthen we could identify who the enemy was. And now, as Jim Woolsey said, \nthere is a proliferation, a number of countries that have this \ntechnology, and many countries that have already demonstrated they are \nnot friends of United States are getting a missile system to deliver \nwarheads.\n  So I believe that we must be very cautious and not use the normal \npopulace, partisan patter that you hear around this Chamber so much \nwhen people start talking about star wars. It is not star wars. We have \nan ability--and we demonstrated that we are going to use the current \nAegis system that we have a $50 billion investment in--to have a high-\ntier missile defense system that we will be desperately needing in the \nvery near system.\n  So I hope my colleagues will refrain from taking political advantage \nof the situation we are in by not saying exactly what it is, and that \nis that there is a threat out there and the United States of America \ndoes not have a national missile defense system.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9024-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9024-S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today is the 50th anniversary of the signing \nof the U.N. Charter. Amid high hopes at the end of the Second World War \nin Europe, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco. \nFifty years later, the record of the United Nations is mixed, and the \nexpectations of its founders have not been met.\n  The United Nations has had some important accomplishments--on \ninternational air travel, eradicating smallpox, and sharing information \nabout global concerns ranging from weather to health. But the United \nNations at 50 is an organization at a crossroads--if the United Nations \nis to survive another 50 years, there must be fundamental change. if \nthe United Nations is to be more than a debating society with 185 \nmembers, there must be fundamental change. And if the United Nations is \never to fulfill the hopes of its founders, there must be fundamental \nchange.\n  Much was written this last weekend about the past and future of the \nUnited Nations. In my view, the best single piece was by Senator Nancy \nKassebaum and Congressman Lee Hamilton--one a Republican and the other \na Democrat, I might add. On each of the key issues facing the United \nNations, they made important points.\n  On peacekeeping, they conclude the United Nations has overreached. \nMuch criticism of the United Nations in the last 5 years has centered \non the failures of U.N. peacekeeping. The tragic record of Somalia and \nBosnia make one fact very clear--the United Nations is not capable of \nmounting serious military operations. Nor should it be. Monitoring an \nagreement between two or more parties is one thing the United Nations \ncan do. Imposing an agreement is something it cannot. The United \nNations should be limited to peacekeeping, not peace enforcing.\n  Senator Kassebaum and Congressman Hamilton also suggested the United \nNations focus on key agencies and functions--such as the International \nAtomic Energy Agency--and quit wasting time and money on the dozens of \nagencies which no longer serve a useful purpose--if they ever did. In \nmy view\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\nthe United States should push to abolish wasteful organizations--and \nwithdraw if we are unsuccessful. Examples of unnecessary or duplicative \nbureaucracies include the International Labor Organization, the United \nNations Industrial Development Organization, the U.N. Conference on \nTrade and Development, and many more.\n  The Kassebaum-Hamilton article suggests an end to U.N.-\nhosted conferences which cost millions and accomplish very little.\n\n  Finally, and most importantly, Senator Kassebaum and Congressman \nHamilton focus on the importance of accountability at the United \nNations. Last year, Congress tried to move the United Nations toward an \ninspector general. Progress has not been sufficient. An individual was \nappointed, but with limited powers, and under the authority of the U.N. \nSecretary General. I expect Congress to revisit the issue this year. \nMuch more needs to be done: Promotions based on merit, real \ninvestigations of U.N. waste, shutting down bloated bureaucracies. \nReforming the United Nations is a tall order--but the alternative is to \ngive up on an organization that could still live up to the ideas of \nsome of its founders.\n  Mr. President, the United Nations can be an important tool to advance \nAmerican interests--as long as America leads the way. The answer to the \nproblems of the United Nations is not getting the United States out of \nthe United Nations, it is getting common sense into the United Nations.\n  There are two very different U.S. approaches toward the United \nNations--one pursued by the Bush administration and one pursued by the \nClinton administration. In 1990-91, the United Nations gave valuable \nsupport for American and allied efforts to liberate Kuwait. But 2 years \nlater in Somalia, the United Nations changed the mission and began a \nvendetta against one Somali faction. Many brave Americans died in the \nensuing disaster. Nation building was complete failure, and the United \nNations finally left Somalia little better than when the humanitarian \nmission began.\n\n  The lesson is clear--if the United States is not in the drivers' seat \nat the United Nations, the United Nations will take us for a ride. If \nthe United Nations is to realize its potential--and if American support \nfor the United Nations is to continue--real reforms must begin now. No \nmore window dressing but real reform to build a foundation for future \nU.S. support for the United Nations. I expect the Congress will \ncontinue to lead the way to reform as it has before. And I expect to \nwork with Senator Kassebaum, Congressman Hamilton, and other interested \ncolleagues in this 50th anniversary year. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1995]\n\n                              Fix the U.N.\n\n              (By Nancy Landon Kassebaum and Lee Hamilton)\n\n       As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations \n     Charter this month, it is time to ask what we want the United \n     Nations to be and what we realistically can expect it to do. \n     These hard questions are neither academic nor abstract. Our \n     answers will determine whether the United Nations can be an \n     effective international forum or is merely a debating society \n     destined for irrelevance.\n       To mark this golden anniversary, we believe the United \n     States must lead a bold and broad effort to reinvent the \n     United Nations and give it new life. While it may be an \n     indispensable institution, the United Nations today is a \n     terrible mess. We need a decisive change of course that \n     produces a smaller, more focused, more efficient United \n     Nations with clearly defined missions.\n       For America, the U.N. is not a charity but an important \n     tool for advancing our vital national interests abroad. Our \n     foreign policy requires an effective United Nations, just as \n     we need a powerful military, vigorous diplomacy, solid \n     alliances, prudent foreign aid and healthy international \n     financial institutions. Taking away these tools one by one, \n     or sharply restricting their use, will inevitably diminish \n     our ability to build coalitions and construct the sort of \n     strong policy that Americans expect.\n       If the United States abdicates leadership at the United \n     Nations, we will weaken our ability to pursue our vital \n     national interests around the world. To allow the U.N. to \n     continue drifting would be to squander, in large part, the \n     opportunity that now exists for creating a more stable, \n     peaceful and prosperous world in the 21st century.\n       Clearly, the U.N. has fallen short of its potential. During \n     the Cold War, superpower rivalry paralyzed the Security \n     Council and marginalized the General Assembly. With its \n     central organs in deadlock, the U.N. shifted resources to \n     secondary activities staffed by a bloated bureaucracy more \n     intent on advancing its own goals than the cause of world \n     peace. Today, lines of authority are confused, blurred and \n     duplicated. Basic missions and activities have ballooned into \n     plodding exercises that produce mountains of paper and \n     little, if any, real results.\n       Despite this harsh assessment, we consider ourselves \n     friends of the United Nations. The U.N. detractors are far \n     less generous or forgiving, and they are prepared to draw the \n     purse strings to a close. If we fail to meet this urgent need \n     for bold reform, we will witness the slow death of the one \n     institution that can direct both the international \n     community's attention and its resources toward the common \n     problems before us and can provide the moral and legal \n     authority to build coalitions that serve our common \n     interests.\n       One way or another, change will come. Congress is prepared \n     to compel changes in the U.S. role at the United Nations by \n     continuing the piecemeal approach to U.N. reform that we have \n     employed for many years. We believe, however, that the time \n     has come for a comprehensive reorganization. Legislation now \n     before Congress would call upon the President to develop a \n     plan for the ``strategic reorganization'' of the United \n     Nations. We hope the president will join with us to seize \n     this opportunity. Reforming the United Nations is too \n     important and too complex a job for Congress to undertake \n     alone with only the blunt instruments at its disposal.\n       We propose several areas on which to concentrate reform:\n\n\n                         Focus on Core Agencies\n\n       Today the United Nations has more than 70 agencies under \n     its umbrella. They range from the high-profile International \n     Atomic Energy (IAEA) to the obscure U.N. Research Institute \n     for Social Development (UNRISD). At a time when we are \n     eliminating low-priority programs from our own foreign policy \n     institutions, we need to take similar bold steps at the \n     United Nations.\n       We must focus resources and energy on a handful of core \n     agencies that are most important and best reflect the range \n     of purposes of the U.N. system. These core agencies would be \n     an integral part of that system and would report directly to \n     the secretary general. Three agencies that already serve core \n     purposes of the U.N. system should be strengthened: the IAEA \n     to combat the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the \n     World Health Organization to deal with all important trans-\n     national health issues and the High Commission for Refugees, \n     which ought to be empowered to deal with all refugee and \n     humanitarian relief issues.\n       The United States should finance only core agencies rather \n     than the long list of U.N. organizations that now find their \n     way into appropriations bills. Other agencies should be \n     abolished, merged or financed at the discretion of one of the \n     core agencies. This prescription is dramatic, but we believe \n     that only triage can save the institution as a whole.\n\n\n                              Peacekeeping\n\n       Expectations for U.N. peacekeeping have grown far beyond \n     what is rational, and there has been a corresponding rise in \n     ambiguity about peacekeeping's nature and capabilities. \n     Peacekeeping is diplomacy with light arms. It is not designed \n     to fight wars. We believe that recent failures show that \n     ``peace-enforcement'' should be struck from the U.N.'s \n     vocabulary and that future peacekeeping should be limited to \n     classic operations in which ``Blue Helmets'' stand between \n     suspicious parties only after diplomacy has secured a peace \n     to be kept.\n       Peacekeeping is successful when it respects these \n     limitations, as it did in Namibia, Cambodia, Mozambique and \n     El Salvador. Situations that require more robust military \n     action are better handled directly by the member states, as \n     we learned in the effective response to Iraq's invasion of \n     Kuwait.\n\n\n                              Conferences\n\n       We fear that the United Nations is in peril of becoming \n     little more than a road show traveling from conference to \n     conference. If an issue is serious, a conference will not \n     solve it; if it is not serious, a conference is a waste of \n     time.\n       The number and cost of U.N. conferences have exploded--the \n     recent ``social summit'' in Copenhagen may have cost $60 \n     million--and they often focus on subjects usually reserved \n     for domestic politics. Conferences are seen by many as a \n     cheap way to placate narrow but vocal constituencies. But the \n     truth is they carry a steep price. The domestic backlash \n     against conference-produced agreements has been strong, not \n     because Americans oppose their noble purposes but because \n     people doubt that international agreements are the best means \n     for securing them. The price is paid in diminished public and \n     congressional support for the U.N. system as a whole and in \n     the diversion of scarce funds from more pressing needs.\n       We propose ending U.N.-sponsored conferences. To the extent \n     countries deem a specific international conference essential, \n     it should be organized and financed on an ad hoc basis, \n     outside the U.N. system, with user fees paid by countries \n     that choose to participate.\n\n\n                             Accountability\n\n       Today, the United Nations is accountable to no one. Despite \n     thousands of pages of\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\n     budget documents produced each year, we don't know how many \n     employees it has, how funds are spent or which programs work. \n     After a decade of ``no real budget growth,'' the budget has \n     almost doubled. Sexual harassment, mismanagement, and \n     cronyism are all too common at the U.N. Those engaged in such \n     practices are not punished, but those who report them are.\n       Congress tried to address these problems by mandating the \n     establishment of an inspector general at the United Nations. \n     To date, this office has been a disappointment. We are \n     prepared to take strong measures, including withholding \n     funds, until this office is strengthened and functions \n     properly. The U.N. must be accountable to the nations that \n     pay its bills.\n       We also believe the time has come to inject more \n     accountability into the Secretariat by reforming the process \n     by which the secretary general is selected. Unlike a head of \n     state, the secretary general is a chief administrative \n     officer--not a chief executive. Skills and administrative \n     ability, not nationality or political connections, should be \n     the decisive qualifications for the secretary general. It is \n     important that the selection process become more open and \n     transparent.\n       We offer these proposals to kick off a debate that must \n     occur soon. The United Nations as it exists today is not \n     sustainable. The Cold War excuses for inaction are gone. If \n     the United Nations does not begin to fulfill its true \n     potential, it will be left to suffocate in endless debates \n     over meaningless issues or will become a side show in the \n     realm of international politics. The danger of irrelevance is \n     imminent.\n       The preamble to the charter sets forth bold objectives To \n     ``save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . \n     to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to \n     establish conditions under which justice . . . can be \n     maintained, and . . . to promote social progress and better \n     standards of life in large freedom.'' These purposes remain \n     as important today as they were half a century ago. The task \n     for our generation is to ensure that the machinery of the \n     United Nations works. Today it does not.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9024-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            ADMINISTRATION VETO THREAT ON REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I stated on the floor last Thursday, I \nand other Senators, particularly Senators Johnston and Heflin, have \nbeen working to craft a bipartisan regulatory reform bill that we can \ntake up tomorrow. Senator Johnston and I placed a discussion draft in \nthe Record that incorporated many of the ideas included in various \nbills. We then worked through last weekend, and are still working, on \nfinal text that takes into acccount comments and suggestions by \nDemocrat and Republican Senators to improve the bill. I understand that \nat 6 o'clock today a group of us will meet with Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, to see if we can make further improvements.\n  So I must say I was surprised and dismayed, in the middle of these \nnegoatiations, to receive a letter last Friday night from the OMB \nAdministrator for Regulatory Affairs threatening a veto of any bill \nthat closely followed the discussion draft. Let me point out this was \njust a discussion draft.\n  The timing of this veto threat is not helpful, nor I suspect was it \nintended to be. For one thing, the letter relied on generalizations so \nbland as to be meaningless. But it also continued a pattern of \ndistortions of the regulatory reform bill which call for a response.\n  Among the list of complaints in this letter was a description of the \nbill as containing a ``supermandate,'' that is, a requirement to \nconsider costs that would override other statutory goals such as \npromoting health and safety and protecting the environment. One can \ndebate the merits of a supermandate, but it is irrelevant to this bill. \nThe text of the bill makes clear that it is intended to ``supplement, \nand not supersede'' other laws. This type of staff work does not serve \nthe President well.\n  But it is not the first time that President Clinton's rhetorical \nembrace of regulatory reform has been undermined by his own handpicked \nofficials publicly attacking any meaningful attempt to enact such \nreforms. One example stands out because it is an example both of the \ndistortions at play in this debate and, ironically, of the value of the \nreforms we propose.\n\n  At various times, the present Administrator of EPA has stated that \ncost-benefit analysis requirements would have prevented a rule getting \nlead out of gasoline and consigning a generation to lead poisoning. \nThis is false.\n  In fact, EPA refused to do a cost-benefit analysis initially in 1982 \nwhen a rule on lead phaseout was being considered. However, after a \ncost-benefit analysis was performed that showed the social benefits \noutweighed the costs of a quick phaseout of lead, EPA issued a new rule \nin 1984 providing for a quick phaseout of lead. That rule also \nintroduced a new concept--market-based mechanisms--that allowed trading \nin lead permits that sped up the phaseout of lead and reduced the \neconomic costs of the regulation.\n  So, not only has the Administrator gotten her facts wrong, she chose \nthe wrong example. Getting lead out of gasoline occurred precisely \nbecause a cost-benefit analysis supported doing so. And that analysis \nhelped produce a regulation to achieve that goal through market-based \nmechanisms that reduced the economic impact.\n  Both cost-benefit analysis and market-based mechanisms are at the \nheart of the reforms we propose. We should have a debate on these \nimportant issues, but that debate will not be furthered if President \nClinton continues to duck the issue and allow his officials to muddy \nthe debate with arguments that have nothing to do with the bill the \nSenate will actually consider.\n  I want to point out again, we are working, I think, in good faith, \nMembers of both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to see \nif we can put together a good regulatory reform bill; and hopefully one \nthat will be signed by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9026-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PRESIDIO TRUST\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor S. 594, \nlegislation which provides for the administration of the Presidio in \nCalifornia. I have discussed this legislation with my colleagues, \nSenator Campbell and Senator Feinstein, and feel that this legislation \nallows for the national recognition of the Presidio while also taking \ninto account concerns about the growing demand for Federal funding for \nNational Park Services. Through this innovative approach to managing \none of our Nation's finest landmarks, we can ensure the preservation of \nthe Presidio while also providing significant opportunities to the \nlocal community.\n  The unique history of the Presidio's operation as a military post \ndates back to 1776. Its designation as a national historic landmark in \n1962 recognized the importance of the post in many military operations. \nAfter the Army closed the post, the National Park Service took over the \nPresidio. When comparing our limited resources against the increasing \nnumber of national parks and historic sites which have become the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government, it becomes apparent that we \nmust find new ways to manage and preserve such important resources.\n  This legislation proposes a Presidio trust, ensuring the continued \npreservation of the post with assistance from the local community. This \ntrust, established within the Department of the Interior, would manage \nthe renovation and leasing of specific Presidio properties. The \nrevenues generated from these leases would then offset the cost of \nmaintaining the Presidio as a national park, reducing the need for \nFederal funding. In my view, this legislation represents the best \napproach to ensure the efficient management and preservation of the \nPresidio at the least cost to the taxpayer. The importance of public \nsector participation in this effort to maintain the Presidio sets this \ninitiative apart from others, and I am pleased to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9026-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9026-S9027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT WARREN BURGER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nMinnesotan--former Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Warren \nBurger, who passed away yesterday.\n  Warren Burger was a native of St. Paul, MN.\n  He got is first taste of law taking night classes at the University \nof Minnesota while working during the day selling insurance. Warren \nBurger later received his law degree from the old St. Paul College of \nLaw.\n  In his early career, he never gave much thought to pursuing a career \non the bench, one time telling friends, ``I never had a passion to be a \njudge.''\n  But he accepted the challenge when, as an assistant attorney general \nin the\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nJustice Department, President Eisenhower offered him a seat on the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  Thirteen years later, President Nixon elevated him to the High Court.\n  As Chief Justice for 17 years, Warren Burger lead the Court through a \ntumultuous period in American history--first Vietnam, and later \nWatergate.\n  The Burger Court could be tough, and the Chief Justice's own law and \norder reputation was well deserved, but Warren Burger's judicial \nopinions were fair and often reflected his conservative Midwestern \nupbringing.\n  Fortunately, his legacy did not end with his retirement from the \nbench in 1986.

Mr. President, during a recent visit to Cornell \nUniversity, the President of the Republic of China on Taiwan, Lee Teng-\nhui, recently outlined his views about democracy. In his speech, \nPresident Lee underscores a number of reasons for the close ties \nbetween the American people and the people of Taiwan. I commend the \nfull text of President Lee's remarks to my colleagues' attention and \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Always in My Heart\n\n                         (By Dr. Lee Teng-hui)\n\n       It is a great honor for me to be invited to deliver the \n     Olin lecture at my alma mater, Cornell University. It has \n     been a long and challenging journey, with many bumps in the \n     road, yet my wife and I are indeed very happy to return to \n     this beloved campus.\n       This trip has allowed both of us to relive our dearest \n     Cornell experiences. The long, exhausting evenings in the \n     libraries, the soothing and reflective hours at church, the \n     hurried shuttling between classrooms, the evening strolls, \n     hand in hand--so many memories of the past have come to mind, \n     filling my heart with joy and gratitude.\n       I want to thank you, President Rhodes, for your hospitality \n     and for your unflagging support of my visit here to my alma \n     mater.\n       I thank you, my fellow alumni, for your understanding and \n     support as I undertake this important sentimental journey.\n       I thank the many, many friends in the United States who \n     have been so supportive of my visit to your great country \n     again.\n       And I also want to thank the people of this academic \n     community, my professors and classmates, for the deep and \n     lasting influence that Cornell University has had on my life. \n     The support each of you has given means a great deal to me.\n       I deem this invitation to attend the reunion at Cornell not \n     only a personal honor, but, more significantly, an honor for \n     the 21 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan. In \n     fact, this invitation constitutes recognition of their \n     remarkable achievements in developing their nation over the \n     past several decades. And it is the people of my nation that \n     I most want to talk about on this occasion.\n\n\n                        Listening to the People\n\n       My years at Cornell from 1965 to 1968 made an indelible \n     impression on me. This was a time of social turbulence in the \n     United States, with the civil rights movement and the Vietnam \n     War protest. Yet, despite that turbulence, the American \n     democratic system prevailed. It was also the time I first \n     recognized that full democracy could engender ultimately \n     peaceful change, and that lack of democracy must be \n     confronted with democratic methods, and lack of freedom must \n     be confronted by the idea of freedom before it would be \n     possible to hasten the day of genuine democracy and freedom. \n     I returned to my homeland determined to make my contribution \n     toward achieving full democracy for our society.\n       Ever since I became president of the Republic of China in \n     1988, I have sought to ascertain just what the people of my \n     country want and to be always guided by their wishes. \n     Ancient China's Book of History from over 2000 years ago, \n     contains the phrase, ``Whatever the People desire, the \n     realm must follow.'' My criterion for serving as president \n     is that I do it with the people in my heart. And it is \n     obvious to me that most of all they want democracy and \n     development. Democracy entails respect for individual \n     freedom, social justice, and a sense of directly \n     participating in the destiny of their nation. Economic \n     development goes beyond attaining prosperity, it also \n     involves equitable distribution of wealth.\n       Today we are entering a new post-Cold War era, where the \n     world is full of many uncertainties. Communism is dead or \n     dying, and the peoples of many nations are anxious to try new \n     methods of governing their societies that will better meet \n     the basic needs that every human has. There are many pitfalls \n     in this search for a new rationale, and Man must strive to \n     make the right choices with all the wisdom and diligence he \n     can command.\n       Czech President Vaclav Havel said, ``The salvation of this \n     human world lies nowhere else but in the human heart.'' In my \n     heart, I believe that the Taiwan Experience has something \n     unique to offer the world in this search for a new direction. \n     This is not to say that our experience can be transplanted \n     entirely to fit the situation faced by other nations, but I \n     believe that, without a doubt, there are certain aspects of \n     this experience that offer new hope for the new age.\n\n\n                         the Taiwan experience\n\n       By the term Taiwan Experience I mean what the people of \n     Taiwan have accumulated in recent years through successful \n     political reform and economic development. This experience \n     has already gained widespread recognition by international \n     society and is being taken by many developing nations as a \n     model to emulate. Essentially, the Taiwan Experience \n     constitutes the economic, political and social transformation \n     of my nation over the years, a transformation which I believe \n     has profound implications for the future development of the \n     Asia-Pacific region and world peace.\n       It is worth remembering what we in the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan have had to work with in achieving all that we now \n     have: a land area of only 14,000 square miles (slightly less \n     than 1/3 the area of New York State) and a population of 21 \n     million. My country's natural resources are meager and its \n     population density is high. However, its international trade \n     totaled US$180 billion in 1994 and its per capita income \n     stands at US$12,000. Its foreign exchange reserves now exceed \n     US$99 billion, more than those of any other nation in the \n     world except Japan.\n       The Taiwan Experience bases peaceful political change on a \n     foundation of stable and continuous economic development. \n     Taiwan, under Presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-\n     kuo, experienced phenomenal economic growth. Currently, aside \n     from economic development, Taiwan has been undergoing a \n     peaceful political transformation to full democracy.\n       For many developing nations, the process of moving to a \n     democratic system has been marked by a coup d'etat, or by the \n     kind of ``political decay'' suggested by Professor Samuel P. \n     Huntington. In sort, it is not unusual for such a process of \n     transformation to be accompanied by violence and chaos. \n     However, the case of Republic of China on Taiwan is a notable \n     exception. Non-existent is the vicious cycle of expansive \n     political participation, class confrontation, military coup \n     and political suppression, which have occurred in many \n     developing countries. The process of reform in Taiwan is \n     remarkably peaceful indeed, and as such is virtually unique. \n     In addition to the ``economic miracle,'' we have wrought a \n     ``political miracle,'' so to speak.\n       The Taiwan Experience has regional and international \n     dimensions as well. In 1994, the indirect trade between \n     Taiwan and mainland China reached US$9.8 billion. Taiwan's \n     indirect investment in southern mainland China, made through \n     Hong Kong, amounted to nearly US$4 billion, according to \n     estimates from various quarters. Taiwan's trade and \n     investment have also been extended to members of the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Vietnam, Russia, and \n     countries in Central America and Africa.\n       Although the Republic of China on Taiwan has been excluded \n     from the United Nations, it has accelerated the formation of \n     an international network with economic ties as the key link. \n     Recently, it has even begun to launch a project to build \n     Taiwan into an Asian-Pacific Regional Operations Center, \n     aiming at further liberalization and globalization of our \n     economy.\n       I never allow myself to ever forget for a moment that \n     Taiwan's achievements have been realized only through the \n     painstaking effort and immense political wisdom of the \n     people. However, success comes from difficulty, and the \n     fruits of the Taiwan Experience are all the sweeter today \n     from a recognition of the arduousness of the process.\n\n\n                          Popular Sovereignty\n\n       We in the Republic of China on Taiwan have found that \n     peaceful transformation must take place gradually, and with \n     careful planning. Five years ago, on my inauguration day. I \n     pledged to initiate constitutional reform in the shortest \n     possible period of time. My goal was to provide the Chinese \n     nation with a legal framework that is in accord with the \n     times, and to establish a comprehensive model for democracy. \n     These goals have since been realized with the support of the \n     people.\n       Our constitutional reform was conducted in two stages. \n     First, all the senior parliamentarians last elected in 1948 \n     were retired. Then, in the second stage, comprehensive \n     elections for the National Assembly and the Legislature were \n     held in 1991 and 1992 respectively. This enabled our \n     representative\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\n     organs at the central government level to better represent \n     the people.\n       Last year, the governor of Taiwan province, and the mayors \n     of Taipei and Kaohsiung, the two largest cities in Taiwan \n     which used to be directly administered by the central \n     government as special municipalities, were directly elected \n     by the people for the first time. Next spring, the president \n     and vice president of the Republic will also be directly \n     elected by the people for the first time.\n       With the completion of constitutional reform, we have \n     established a multiparty system and have realized the ideal \n     of popular sovereignty. This has led to full respect for \n     individual freedom, ushering in the most free and liberal era \n     in Chinese history. I must reiterate that this remarkable \n     achievement is the result of the concerted efforts of the 21 \n     million people in the Taiwan area.\n       Today, the institutions of democracy are in place in the \n     Republic of China: human rights are respected and protected \n     to a very high degree. Democracy is thriving in my country. \n     No speech or act allowed by law will be subject to any \n     restriction or interference. Different and opposing views are \n     heard every day in the news media, including harsh criticism \n     of the President. The freedom of speech enjoyed by our people \n     is in no way different from that enjoyed by people in the \n     United States.\n       I believe that the precept of democracy and the benchmark \n     of human rights should never vary anywhere in the world, \n     regardless of race or region. In fact, the Confucian belief \n     that only the ruler who provides for the needs of his people \n     is given the mandate to rule is consistent with the modern \n     concept of democracy. This is also the basis for my \n     philosophy of respect for individual free will and popular \n     sovereignty.\n       Thus, the needs and wishes of my people have been my \n     guiding light every step of the way. I only hope that the \n     leaders in the mainland are able one day to be similarly \n     guided, since then our achievements in Taiwan can most \n     certainly help the process of economic liberalization and the \n     cause of democracy in mainland China.\n       I have repeatedly called on the mainland authorities to end \n     ideological confrontation and to open up a new era of \n     peaceful competition across the Taiwan Straits and \n     reunification. Only by following a ``win-win'' strategy will \n     the best interests of all the Chinese people be served. We \n     believe that mutual respect will gradually lead to the \n     peaceful reunification of China under a system of \n     democracy, freedom and equitable distribution of wealth.\n       To demonstrate our sincerity and goodwill. I have already \n     indicated on other occasions that I would welcome an \n     opportunity for leaders from the mainland to meet their \n     counterparts from Taiwan during the occasion of some \n     international event, and I would note even rule out the \n     possibility of a meeting between Mr. Jiang Zemin and myself.\n\n\n                    yearning to play a positive role\n\n       When a president carefully listens to his people, the \n     hardest things to bear are the unfulfilled yearnings he \n     hears. Taiwan has peacefully transformed itself into a \n     democracy. At the same time, its international economic \n     activities have exerted a significant influence on its \n     relations with nations with which it has no diplomatic ties. \n     These are no minor accomplishments for any nation, yet, the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan does not enjoy the diplomatic \n     recognition that is due from the international community. \n     This has caused many to underestimate the international \n     dimension of the Taiwan Experience.\n       Frankly, our people are not happy with the status accorded \n     our nation by the international community. We believe that \n     international relations should not be solely seen in terms of \n     formal operations regulated by international law and \n     international organizations. We say so because there also are \n     semi-official and unofficial rules that bind the \n     international activities of nations. This being so, we submit \n     that a nation's substantive contribution to the international \n     community has to be appreciated in light of such non-official \n     activities as well.\n       During last year's commencement, President Rhodes brought \n     up the old saying, ``Be realistic. Demand the Impossible!'' \n     Well, over the last four decades, we have been extremely \n     realistic while always trying to look forward, not backward, \n     and to work, not complain. Accordingly, we have created the \n     very fact of our existence and economic prosperity. We \n     sincerely hope that all nations can treat us fairly and \n     reasonably, and not overlook the significance, value and \n     functions we represent.\n       Some say that it is impossible for us to break out of the \n     diplomatic isolation we face, but we will do our utmost to \n     ``demand the impossible.'' Ultimately, I know that the world \n     will come to realize that the Republic of China on Taiwan is \n     a friendly and capable partner for progress!\n       If we view the recent economic, political and social \n     developments in the ROC in this light, we have a basis for \n     defining the status of my country in the post-Cold War and \n     post Communist era. Only in this way can we propose a new \n     direction for the new world order as we enter the 21st \n     century.\n\n\n                         close traditional ties\n\n       I want to once again express how grateful I am to be with \n     you. My gratitude extends not only to Cornell but also to the \n     United States as a whole. When we look back in history, we \n     can immediately realize how close the traditional ties \n     between our two countries are. Indeed, our shared ideals \n     for human dignity, and peace with justice have united our \n     two peoples in the closest of bonds.\n       The United States was extremely helpful in the early stages \n     of Taiwan's economic development. We have never forgotten \n     America's helping hand in our hour of adversity, so your \n     nation occupies a special place in our hearts. Today, as the \n     6th largest trading partner of the United States, the \n     Republic of China imports and exports US $42.4 billion worth \n     of goods through our bilateral trade. We also are the number \n     two buyer of US treasury notes. About thirty-eight thousand \n     students from Taiwan are studying in the United States. \n     Students who have returned have made important contributions \n     to our society.\n       The Republic of China's development has been partly \n     influenced by the experiences of its people while studying \n     abroad. I gained substantial know-how in the mechanics of \n     national growth and development from the faculty and students \n     I worked with here in America at both schools where I \n     studied. I had the chance to see democracy at its best in the \n     United States, and to observe its shortcomings as well. We in \n     Taiwan believe that we have much to learn from an advanced \n     democracy such as the United States; however, we also believe \n     we should develop our own model. The success of our \n     democratic evolution has provided tremendous hope for other \n     developing nations, and we wish to share our experience with \n     them. Our efforts to help others through agricultural \n     development have been well received, and we are eager to \n     expand our technical assistance programs to friendly nations \n     in the developing world.\n       Taiwan has grown from an agricultural exporting economy to \n     a leading producer of electronics, computers and other \n     industrial goods. We are ``paving the information highway'' \n     with disk drives, computer screens, laptop computers and \n     modems. We are poised to become a major regional operations \n     centers as well as to buy more American products and services \n     to develop our infrastructure.\n       We stand ready to enhance the mutually beneficial relations \n     between our two nations. It is my sincere hope that this \n     visit will open up new opportunities for cooperation between \n     our two countries.\n       It is for this reason that I want to publicly express my \n     appreciation and admiration to President Clinton for his \n     statesman-like decision. We are equally grateful to others in \n     the administration, to the bipartisan leadership in Congress, \n     and to the American people.\n\n\n                           Always in My Heart\n\n       Whatever I have done as president of my nation. I have done \n     with the people in my heart. I have thought long and hard \n     about what my people want, and it is clear that most of all, \n     they desire democracy and development. These wishes are no \n     different than those of any other people on this planet, and \n     represent the direction in which world trends will certainly \n     continue.\n       As I have spoken to you today, I have done so with the \n     people in my heart. I know that what my people would like to \n     say to you now can be expressed by this simple message:\n       The people of the Republic of China on Taiwan are \n     determined to play a peaceful and constructive role among the \n     family of nations.\n       We say to friends in this country and around the world;\n       We are here to stay;\n       We stand ready to help;\n       And we look forward to sharing the fruits of our democratic \n     triumph.\n       The people are in my heart every moment of the day. I know \n     that they would like me to say to you, that on behalf of the \n     21 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan, we are \n     eternally grateful for the support--spiritual, intellectual \n     and material--that each of you has given to sustain our \n     efforts to build a better tomorrow for our nation and the \n     world. In closing, I say God bless you, God bless Cornell \n     University, God bless the United States of America, and God \n     bless the Republic of China.\n       Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, is morning business concluded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is to be concluded.\n  Mr. DOLE. Leaders' time was reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that I may use part of my leader time, \nthat it not interfere with the ongoing debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9027-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9028-S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FBI AGENTS REMEMBERED\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today marks the 20th anniversary of the \nnumber of two fine young men who served their country in the Federal \nBureau of Investigation. They were Special Agents Jack Coler and Ron \nWilliams. They were murdered by Leonard Peltier, who is now serving two \nlife terms in Leavenworth Penitentiary.\n  Ron liked living in South Dakota and particularly enjoyed the Black \nHills.\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nAfter coming to my State in 1975, he purchased a home in a quite \nsection of Rapid City, my State's second largest city, Jack was a guest \nin South Dakota. His home was in Colorado. He was halfway through a 60-\nday temporary duty assignment in the Rapid City FBI office when he was \nkilled.\n  Special Agents Coler and Williams were law enforcement officers, \nserving our country, doing a job the Congress of the United States \nauthorized them to do. They were young men--Jack was 28 years old; Ron \nwas 27--at the very beginning of promising careers with a premier \nFederal law enforcement agency. They performed their duties with a \ngreat deal of pride.\n  Mr. President, the current issue of Outdoor magazine features an \narticle by Scott Anderson, entitled ``The Martyrdom of Leonard \nPeltier.'' Despite the rather sympathetic title, the article does a \nfairly good job of debunking the myth that has been created over the \nyears by the nonnative American, liberal Eastern establishment and \nHollywood elites. When the article does portray Peltier as victim, it \nis not in the way previously done, ad nauseam, as a victim of some \nGovernment conspiracy to frame Peltier for murder. Rather, Peltier is \nportrayed as a stooge of attorneys, newspaper and book publishers, \nprint and media journalists, and movie moguls who have used Peltier for \ntwo decades now to line their own pockets and advance their own liberal \nagenda and warped view of the world.\n  I particularly liked Mr. Anderson's comments about the book, ``In the \nSpirit of Crazy Horse,'' by Peter Mattiessen. Mr. Anderson is to be \ncommended for calling Matthiessen to task for writing what essentially \nis a work of fiction--subjected to two libel suits--not the work of \nfact he purported it to be. Unfortunately, over the years, \nMatthiessen's apologia for Peltier has been regarded biblically by \nthose who choose not to rely on the facts and the trial proceedings for \nwhat really happened 20 years ago today. Matthiessen's comic book \nversion of reality has been spun into various movies and pseudo-\ndocumentaries by the liberal establishment.\n  Mr. President, it seems all too predictable that Oliver Stone is \nusing that book to make a movie about Peltier. Let us not forget that \nthis is the same Oliver Stone who has distorted the collective public \nmemory by foisting upon us the movie ``JFK.'' I suspect that the \nAmerican people will learn very little about what really happened 20 \nyears ago today on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation if they rely on \nthe Stone version of the case.\n  Regrettably, should this pulp fiction eventually hit the big screen, \nI am sure we will see a resurgence of calls for a Presidential \ncommutation of Peltier's life sentences. I would hope that President \nClinton would hold to the recommendation of the man he appointed to a \n10-year term to head the FBI, Louis Freeh, who has said ``There should \nbe no commutation of his [Peltier's] two life terms in prison.'' \nPresident Clinton has spoken laudably of his respect for law \nenforcement during the debate on last year's crime bill and in the wake \nof the Oklahoma City bombing. The men and women of law enforcement are \nmore than worthy of his and other's words of praise. I hope he will \nalways remember what a supreme display of disrespect it would be to \nthese fine individuals if he caved in to the calls of the radical left \nand freed the man who murdered two of law enforcement's finest, 20 \nyears ago today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks \nthere be printed a copy of an open letter to the President, published \nin the Washington Post on July 15, 1994, which was written by the \nrepresentatives of more than 15,000 active duty and former FBI agents. \nIt is one of the most concise and accurate accounts of the facts of the \nmurders ever to appear in print. I would recommend its reading to all \nmy colleagues on the 20th anniversary of the deaths of Special Agents \nJack Coler and Ron Williams.\n  We should never forget the sacrifice made by these two fine men, nor \nforgive the man lawfully convicted and justly sentenced to spend the \nrest of his life behind bars for their murders.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 15, 1995]\n\n    Dear Mr. President: Leonard Peltier Murdered Two FBI Agents--He \n                          Deserves No Clemency\n\n       June 26, 1975, was a hot, dusty Thursday on the Pine Ridge \n     Indian Reservation in southwestern South Dakota when two \n     young FBI agents arrived from their office in Rapid City. It \n     was about noon when Special Agents Ronald A. Williams, 27, \n     and Jack R. Coler, 28, pulled into the Jumping Bull Compound \n     area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man \n     in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two \n     young ranchers in nearby Manderson, S.D.\n       Spotting a red and white Chevrolet Suburban van in which \n     they believed the fugitive suspect to be riding, the two \n     agents pursued it toward an open grassy bowl-like area. \n     Unknown to Special Agents Coler and Williams, one of the \n     three men in the vehicle was Leonard Peltier, a violent man \n     with a violent past, a fugitive wanted for attempted murder \n     of an off-duty Milwaukee policy officer. Knowing the two \n     vehicles pursuing him were occupied by FBI agents and \n     believing they were seeking to arrest him on the attempted \n     murder case, Peltier and his two associates abruptly stopped \n     their vehicles and began firing their rifles at the agents.\n       Out of range of the agents' revolvers, Peltier and his \n     friends continued firing. Other militants and radical members \n     of the American Indian Movement (AIM) joined them in shooting \n     at the disabled and trapped agents.\n       Surprised by the sudden violence, outmanned, outgunned and \n     at an extreme tactical disadvantage, Coler and Williams were \n     both wounded and defenseless within minutes. Coler sustained \n     a severe wound, the force of a bullet nearly tearing his \n     right arm off. Williams, wounded in the left shoulder and \n     right foot, removed his shirt during the hail of incoming \n     rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm of \n     Coler, who had fallen unconscious. Coler, a former Los \n     Angeles Police Department sergeant with two small sons, and \n     Williams, an affable, friendly former FBI clerical employee, \n     were at the mercy of Peltier and his associates. But there \n     was to be no mercy that day for the fine young law \n     enforcement officers.\n       Not satisfied with the terrible injuries they had \n     inflicted, Peltier and two other men walked down the hill \n     toward the ambushed officer. Three shots were heard. \n     Williams, kneeling and apparently surrendering, was shot in \n     the face directly through his outstretched, shielding hand. \n     He died instantly. Coler, still unconscious, was shot twice \n     in the head at close range. He died instantly after the \n     second shot. Before leaving the murder scene, Peltier and his \n     criminal associates stole the two dead agents' handguns and \n     the .308 rifle Coler was going after when shot.\n       The crime scene examination testified to the brutality of \n     the ambush. Coler and Williams had little chance to defend \n     themselves. They had fired only five shots. In contrast, \n     over 125 bullet holes were found in their two cars.\n       The investigation quickly focused on Leonard Peltier as the \n     executioner. The murder weapon was determined to be a .223-\n     caliber rifle. Witnesses identified Peltier as the only \n     person at the murder scene in possession of a weapon that \n     would fire a .223-caliber bullet, his weapon being a .223-\n     caliber AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Witnesses later testified \n     that Peltier had possessed this rifle before, during and \n     after the ambush. The murder weapons, with others used in the \n     attack, was hidden, AIM sympathizers later spirited it from \n     the area.\n       In September 1975, a stationwagon, heavily laden with \n     weapons and explosives, caught fire and blew up on the Kansas \n     Turnpike near Wichita. The murder weapon and Coler's stolen \n     .308 rifle were recovered from the wreckage. One of the \n     vehicle's occupants later testified that he had seen Peltier \n     carrying the recovered .233-caliber rifle by the two FBI \n     agent's cars on the day and at the time of their murder.\n       Following the June 26 murders, Leonard Peltier fled the \n     Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The FBI added him to its Ten \n     Most Wanted list. Then, in November, 1975, an Oregon State \n     trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which Peltier was \n     hiding. Peltier ran from the RV, fired at the officer and \n     escaped. Coler's revolver, stolen when he was murdered, was \n     found in a paper bag under the front seat of the RV. \n     Peltier's thumbprint was on the bag.\n       When later arrested in Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted \n     Police, Peltier remarked that, had he known the officers were \n     there to arrest him, he would have blown them out of their \n     shoes. These are not the comments of an innocent man and \n     portray the true character and violent nature of Leonard \n     Peltier.\n       During his trial in U.S. District Court in Fargo, N.D., in \n     April 1977, a jury convicted Peltier of the murders of Coler \n     and Williams. A judge sentenced him to two consecutive life \n     sentences. While incarcerated in the Lompoc, Calif., Federal \n     Prison, and with outside assistance, Peltier shot his way out \n     of jail, using a smuggled semi-automatic .223-caliber rifle \n     to make the escape. A fellow AIM member was killed by guards \n     during the escape. Several days later, after assaulting a \n     rancher and stealing his truck, Peltier was captured. He was \n     tried and convicted of the escape and of being a felon in \n     possession of a firearm. Separate consecutive prison terms of \n     two and five years were added to his two consecutive life \n     sentences.\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\n       Peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous \n     times. Each time, the federal courts have upheld earlier \n     court actions. The U.S. Supreme Court has twice denied \n     Peltier petitions for certiorari, without comment. The record \n     is clear. There are no new facts. The old facts have not \n     changed and Peltier is guilty as charged.\n       Twice on national television, Peltier has admitted to \n     firing at the two agents. He has openly stated that he feels \n     no guilt or remorse for the murders. One has only to review \n     his murderous misconduct when confronted by law enforcement \n     officers to be convinced of that fact. Leonard Peltier has \n     lived a life of crime. He has earned and deserves a lifetime \n     of incarceration. Leonard Peltier is a murderer without \n     compassion or feeling for his fellow man. In turn, he \n     deserves no compassion.\n       Mr. President, on many occasions you have described this \n     country's law enforcement officers as heroes and heroines. \n     You have said that we must work together to ensure that \n     hardened criminals who prey on the innocent receive \n     punishment commensurate with the harm--physical, emotional \n     and financial--that they have inflicted. We agree.\n       Peggy Coler, Special Agent Coler's widow, can't believe \n     anyone would consider freeing Peltier, the man convicted of \n     shooting her husband point-blank in the face while he lay \n     unconscious. Her son, Ron, four years old when his dad died \n     and now 22, can't understand how anyone could portray Peltier \n     as the victim of this tragedy. Peggy and Ron Coler are \n     against any thought of a pardon or commutation of Peltier's \n     sentence. We agree.\n       Special Agent Ron Williams' mother, Ellen Williams, worries \n     that Peltier's release into an unsuspecting society would \n     only add to the list of grieving loved ones. She is convinced \n     Peltier will commit violent acts against others. We agree.\n       Mr. President, it's time for Leonard Peltier to pay up. Our \n     judicial system is overwhelmed, overworked and has spoken in \n     this case, again and again. It's time to move on. Leonard \n     Peltier is a vicious, violent and cowardly criminal who hides \n     behind legitimate Native American issues. Leonard Peltier was \n     never a leader in the Native American community. Peltier is \n     simply a vicious thug and murderer with no respect or regard \n     for human life, especially when law enforcement officers are \n     involved. Our citizens, on and off the reservations, must be \n     protected from predators such as Peltier. Our laws must be \n     respected and obeyed or the penalty must be paid. The \n     punishment must also fit the crime--and it does here.\n       Mr. President, since Leonard Peltier couldn't fool the \n     federal courts, he is now trying to fool you and the public. \n     He is shading and hiding the facts--and playing on sympathy. \n     Don't let him get away with it, Mr. President. Sympathy is \n     appropriate only for the dead heroes and their surviving \n     families. Don't let their sacrifice be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9028-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, when President Truman addressed the \nopening session of the conference that met in San Francisco in April \n1945, he told the gathered delegates, ``You members of the conference \nare to be the architects of the better world. In your hands rests our \nfuture. By your labors at this conference we shall know if suffering \nhumanity is to achieve a just and lasting peace.''\n  Neither Truman nor any other realistic person then or later believed \nthat an organization of the international community could, by itself, \nbring about an end to war. And, of course, the United Nations has not \nbeen able to achieve that.\n  But in regretting what an organization has not done, we should not \noverlook its achievements, and those of its associated organizations.\n  Today marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of the United \nNations. It is the only world body which has endured for so long.\n  Commemorative ceremonies are taking place in San Francisco today to \nmark the occasion. The Senate and the Nation can be proud of the fact \nthat, among the delegates to those ceremonies is a man who was present \nwhen the original delegates began to meet, Senator Claiborne Pell of \nRhode Island.\n  It is a tribute to the enduring ideals of public service in our \nNation that many of those who served 50 years ago in San Francisco \ncontinued in long and distinguished careers of public service. We are \nfortunate that Senator Pell was able to return after 50 years.\n  The history of the world since the creation of the United Nations has \nbeen turbulent\n  The United Nations Organization often has been as unpopular as it has \nbeen admired in the United States and around the world. Its \nshortcomings have been criticized, and its errors have been magnified \nby those who opposed its creation and their political heirs.\n  Like every organization created and manned by human beings, it is far \nfrom perfect.\n  But the same observation can be made about every form of human \norganization, governmental and corporate, public and private. None are \nperfect; all can bear improvement. What's significant isn't how far an \norganization falls short of perfection, but how close it has come to \nachieving its goals.\n  It is a remarkable fact that in a century drenched with the blood of \ninnocents in wars both large and small, the United Nations has provided \na forum in which some of the world community's most dangerous \ndisagreements could be controlled, if not reconciled.\n  Those who argue that the organization is a failure because it hasn't \nstopped war forget that throughout the long history of humankind, \nnothing has successfully stopped war. Huge, tyrannical empires like the \nformer Soviet Union successfully curtailed wars among their component \nstates--but that's not a model for peace that any free people can \nadmire.\n  Today, when the painful costs of war in human life, human health, and \nhard-earned treasure is less visible to us in the fortunate nations of \nthe Western World, it is tempting to suggest that the United Nations' \nshortcomings are so great, its failures so substantial, that it serves \nno further purpose that is in the American national interest.\n  There are many voices willing to make that claim. But they are \nmistaken.\n  In the post-cold war world, our Nation is the only remaining \nsuperpower. Our global trading partnerships and our security interests \nalike mean that American must be involved with the world.\n  It is not in the American interest to unilaterally take on the \nmediation of each and every conflict that may arise between nations. \nYet a peaceful and stable world community is very much in our national \ninterest.\n  There is no body other than the United Nations that can serve as a \nmediating forum for the disputes and conflicts that inevitably arise \namong the members of the international community. With all its \nshortcomings, if the organization did not exist, we would be forced to \ninvent it.\n  In April 1945, when the idea of a world body was taking shape, \nPresident Truman observed, ``When Kansas and Colorado have a quarrel \nover the water in the Arkansas River, they don't call out the National \nGuard in each state and go to war over it. They bring a suit in the \nSupreme Court of the United States and abide by the decision. There \nisn't a reason in the world why we cannot do that internationally.''\n  In the wake of a half-century in which states have repeatedly gone to \nwar, not to the negotiating table, Truman's words sound sadly \nidealistic. We think we know better.\n  But perhaps it is we who are being foolishly cynical. Perhaps it was \nTruman, that Midwestern man of great common sense, who understood more \ndeeply what was at stake. He understood that if we did not strive to \ncreate a great organization, we would not achieve even a good one. He \nknew that if we approached the task with less than our ideals, we would \nreap much greater disappointment.\n  At a distance of 50 years, there is much many of us have forgotten \nabout the times in which the United Nations was forged, and about the \nforces that made men and women work for its creation. On the \nanniversary of its creation, it is a good time to think back and \nremember that we are all charged with the responsibility Truman \nexpressed 50 years ago: ``We must build a new world, a far better \nworld--one in which the eternal dignity of man is respected.'' That is \na task every bit as important for our generation as it was for \nTruman's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9030-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9030-S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN BURGER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, from the earliest days of our republic, \nthe Supreme Court has always been one of the most important \ninstitutions in the land. Sitting at the top of the judicial branch, \nnine individuals pass judgment on cases of constitutional importance \nthat are argued before them. Managing and administering this\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\nprocess is the Chief Justice, part referee, part historian, full time \njudge. It is a demanding job that requires patience, intelligence, and \ntact. I rise today to pay tribute to a man who excelled in that \nposition, Warren E. Burger, who regrettably passed away yesterday.\n  Warren Burger grew up on a farm in Minnesota, the Heartland of \nAmerica. He worked his way through college and law school, earning \ndegrees from the University of Minnesota and the St. Paul College of \nLaw, before beginning his career as an attorney. In 1953, President \nDwight D. Eisenhower made Mr. Burger an Assistant U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, beginning the Minnesotan's journey to the highest seat on the \nhighest court of the land. Before joining the Supreme Court, Warren \nBurger would also serve on the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  During the 17 years that he served as Chief Justice, the Court \ndecided many issues that had a tremendous impact on American society. \nThe results of many of the cases reviewed by the Burger Court came to \nbe known as landmark decisions, ones that are likely to be studied by \nlaw students, professors, and historians for decades, if not centuries \nto come. It is not exaggerating to say that the actions of Warren \nBurger and his court did much to change life in America.\n  In 1986 Warren Burger resigned as Chief Justice of the Court, ending \nhis two decade presence there, to chair the Committee on the \nBicentennial of the Constitution. I served on this committee and I \nworked closely with the former Chief Justice to promote this special \nanniversary in the history of our Nation. I found Chief Justice Burger \nto be a man of integrity, ability, and dedication, whose deep interest \nin American history made him an effective and enthusiastic spokesman \nfor this undertaking.\n  Mr. President, the Chief Justice and I differed on some issues, but \nhe was an outstanding man who served this Nation ably and selflessly. \nHe was a thoughtful adjudicator of cases, a strong advocate for the \njudicial branch, and most importantly, he cared for and believed deeply \nin the Constitution. He is a man who will certainly be missed by a host \nof friends, and I extend my deepest sympathy to the members of his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9030-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SERVICE, COMMITMENT, DEDICATION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to serve \nthe people of Missouri and of this great country. Those of us who were \nelected in 1994 came here with a mandate from the people to change the \nway Washington does business. We were asked to reopen the door of self-\ngovernment and to respect the liberties which have made our democracy a \nmodel for the world.\n  With this mandate before us, I want to share with my fellow Senators \nthe pledge that every Member of my office has taken. It is a pledge of \nservice, of commitment, and of dedication. It is a pledge we want to \nshare with the American people. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Oath of Office\n\n       We do solemnly swear that we will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; and that we will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same.\n\n         Statement of Belief, Purpose, Principle, and Practice\n\n       We dedicate ourselves to principled public policy. We \n     believe that Americans are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, and among these are life, liberty \n     and the pursuit of happiness. The power we exercise is \n     granted by Missourians and the American people; we serve to \n     secure their rights. Our commitment is to respect diverse \n     political views and serve all people by whose consent we \n     govern.\n       As people of liberty reach for opportunity and achieve \n     greatness, our nation prospers. A government that lives \n     beyond its means and reaches beyond its limits violates our \n     basic liberties, and the nation suffers.\n       We dedicate ourselves to quality service. America's future \n     will be determined by the character and productivity of our \n     people. In this respect, we seek to lead by our example. We \n     will strive to lead with humility and honesty. We will work \n     with energy and spirit. We will represent the American people \n     with loyalty and integrity. Our standard of productivity is \n     accuracy, courtesy, efficiency, integrity, validity, and \n     timeliness.\n       We hold that these principles are a sacred mandate. We take \n     responsibility for these standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9031-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

This outrageous debt--which will \nbe passed on to our children and grandchildren--averages out to \n$18,553.47 on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9031-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9031-S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO FRED DuBRAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to Fred DuBray, an exceptional South Dakotan, who \nrecently was awarded a Newsweek Achievement Award. Fred DuBray was \nrecognized by the weekly magazine Newsweek for his vision and \ncommitment to reviving the bison population in South Dakota and across \nthe country.\n  Mr. DuBray is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and is \nfounder and president of the InterTribal Bison Cooperative [ITBC].\n  Bison always have held a special place in the hearts of many Native \nAmericans, and in the history of the American continent. Often referred \nto as buffalo, bison play a significant role in tribal ceremonies and \nin other traditional customs of the Native Americans. Knowing what the \nbison mean to the Native American culture, Fred DuBray came up with the \nidea of reviving the bison population--and encouraging reservations to \nreap the economic benefits.\n  The InterTribal Bison Cooperative [ITBC], headquartered in Rapid \nCity, SD, has proven to be a great success. It has brought economic \ndevelopment to Native American tribes across the country, where other \neconomic projects had previously failed. In 1991, when it was founded, \nthe ITBC consisted of only seven Indian tribes. Since then, it has \nexpanded to include 36 tribes from 15 different States across the \ncountry.\n  Under Mr. DuBray's leadership, the ITBC has created more than 500 new \njobs through the production and distribution of bison meat and bison \nby-products. The number of consumers purchasing bison products has \nincreased dramatically over the past 4 years.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, rising bison has proven to be a \nprofitable venture for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. In fact, the \nCheyenne River Sioux recently received Federal assistance from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture for the purchase of a mobile meat processor.\n  This state-of-the-art technology will allow the tribe to slaughter \nbison in a traditional manner, while processing and packaging the meat \non the spot. The tribe also intends to allow other nearby tribes and \nprivate ranchers to benefit from the use of the mobile bison meat \nprocessor.\n  Fred's ingenuity is an inspiration to all Native Americans who, \nthrough creativity and hard work, are striving to achieve self-\nsufficiency, rather than dependency on Federal Government assistance. I \nam very proud of Fred DuBray's achievements, and I am very happy to see \nthat he is receiving well-earned recognition from Newsweek magazine.\n  My wife, Harriet, and I extend our congratulations to Fred DuBray for \nhis accomplishments thus far, and wish\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\nhim continued success in his future efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9031-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WARREN BURGER\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, a century-and-a-half ago, the great Daniel \nWebster said,\n\n       We may be tossed upon an ocean where we can see no land--\n     nor, perhaps, the sun or stars. But there is a chart and a \n     compass for us to study, to consult, and to obey. That chart \n     is the Constitution.\n\n  Today, Mr. President, the Senate joins with the rest of the country \nin mourning the passing of former Chief Justice of the United States, \nWarren Burger, a man who devoted his life to studying, consulting, and \nobeying the Constitution.\n  Chief Justice Burger's public life began in 1953, when he came to \nWashington to serve as an Assistant Attorney General in the Eisenhowewr \nadministration.\n  Prior to that time, he was a respected attorney and civic leader in \nhis home State of Minnesota. And when he arrived in Washington, he \nbrought with him a great deal of midwestern common sense, practical \nexperience, and an understanding of the importance of communities, \nneighborhoods, and families.\n  In 1956, President Eisenhower appointed Chief Justice Burger to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. He served \nthere with distinction until 1969, when President Nixon selected him as \nChief Justice of the United States.\n  During his 17 years as Chief Justice of the United States--a tenure \nwhich made him the longest serving Chief Justice in this century--\nWarren Burger authored over 244 majority opinions and assigned over \n1,000 others.\n  Like most Americans, I agreed with some of those opinions, especially \nthose that restored a sense of balance to our criminal justice system--\nand disagreed with others. But I never doubted Warren Burger's devotion \nto his country.\n  And I never doubted his devotion to making our judicial system and \nour courts run more efficently. Chief Justice Burger is due the credit \nhe has received for the leadership he provided in improving education \nand training of judges and court personnel, and in the implementation \nof technological advances.\n\n  He created the National Center for State Courts, the Institute for \nCourt Management, and the National Institute for Corrections, \ninstitutions which will continue to serve as his legacy for years to \ncome.\n  Chief Justice Burger also spoke bluntly about the need of the members \nof the legal profession to always maintain the highest degree of ethics \nand professionalism.\n  When Chief Justice Burger left the court, he assumed the chairmanship \nof the commission honoring the Bicentennial of the Constitution. And he \npresided over that celebration's activities with great dignity and \nability.\n  Warren Burger's devotion to increasing awareness of the Constitution \ncontinued until this year, when he published a book recounting 14 major \nSupreme Court cases.\n  Mr. President, I know all Senators join with me in extending our \nsympathies to Chief Justice Burger's son, Wade, his daughter, Margaret, \nand his two grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9032-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AUTHORIZATION TO THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 240, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 240) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 to establish a filing deadline and to provide certain \n     safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors are well \n     protected under the implied private action provisions of the \n     act.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Bryan Amendment No. 1469, to provide for a limitation \n     period for implied private rights of action.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on this \nissue from both sides of the aisle with great interest and have several \nobservations that I would like to share with you and the others in the \nSenate as we come to this point.\n  As is pointed out often to me, and sometimes as I have pointed out \nduring my political career, I am not a lawyer. I have not been blessed \nwith the experience of having gone through law school or passed the bar \nor practiced law or any of the other kinds of experiences that go with \nbeing an attorney, which so many of our colleagues in the Senate have. \nIndeed, a majority, Mr. President, of the Members of this body are \nlawyers.\n  I have not kept exact tally, but I believe that the vast majority, if \nnot 100 percent, of the people who have commented on this bill, have \nbeen lawyers.\n  No, I must correct myself. Mr. President, the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] is not a lawyer, and she has been very forthright in her \nopposition to this bill. So I would back away from that. But most of \nthe people who have spoken on this have been lawyers. And I have \nnoticed that they have addressed this issue on the basis of what will \nhappen in court if S. 240 were to pass.\n  They have argued that back and forth, with lawyers saying: Oh, no, if \nS. 240 were passed, why, then this is how the courts would be forced to \nrule. And then other lawyers have risen and said: You are wrong; if S. \n240 passes, the courts would not have that ruling at all; they would \nrule this way. Back and forth, so the argument goes between those who \nhave had the experience of a legal education.\n  I wish to share with the Senate my view of this, which is based not \non a legal background but upon direct experience and observation with \nwhat has been happening with strike suits as these have come to be \nknown.\n  My first experience is a vicarious one, but I do my best to make sure \nthat it is accurate. It is the experience that my father had after he \nleft the Senate and began his last career, which was back in the \nbusiness world serving on a variety of boards of directors.\n  I have told this story in the committee hearing, but I think it is \nappropriate to repeat here because it makes the point I intend to make.\n  One of the boards that my father went on after he left the Senate was \na board of a mutual fund. The compensation of the directors was tied to \nthe performance of the mutual fund. This is the kind of thing people \nare saying we ought to do with directors and chief executives, not just \nset a compensation and let it stay there, but have a compensation tied \nto the performance of the fund.\n  Once a year, the compensation of the directors would be adjusted as a \nresult of the better performance of the fund during the year, and since \nthe fund, at least during the time my father served\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\non the board, always did better each year, the compensation went up \neach year.\n  My father received a stack of legal papers suing him for looting the \nassets of that particular mutual fund. He was a little startled, and he \ncalled the general counsel of the mutual fund and said, ``What is this \nall about?''\n  ``Oh,'' said the general counsel, ``don't worry about that, Senator, \nit is just because `Bennett' comes before all of the other directors in \nour alphabetical list, and there is a lawyer in New York who every year \nsues us, sues all of the directors, for looting the fund by virtue of \nthe increase in compensation that comes as a result of the formula that \nwe have.'' He said, ``Because, as I say, your name is first \nalphabetically, you are the one filed with the papers. You notice it \nsays `Wallace Bennett, et al.' The `et al.' means all of the other \ndirectors. If we had another director whose name began with `A,' he \nwould be the one on whom the papers would be served. Don't worry about \nit. We'll take care of it.''\n  Dad said, ``How are you going to take care of it? This is a very \nimpressive lawsuit.''\n  ``Oh,'' he said, ``we have in the budget $100,000 to send to that \nlawyer in settlement of this lawsuit. We do this every year. He files \nthe lawsuit, we send him a check for $100,000, he goes away. It is a \nstandard kind of thing that we have built into our budget.''\n  ``Why in the world are we paying this man $100,000 simply to file the \nlawsuit?''\n  ``Well, Senator,'' he said, perhaps a little nonplused at my father's \nnaivete, ``the legal bills of our fighting this suit would be \nsubstantially in excess of $100,000. So the financially responsible \nthing for us to do for our shareholders is to settle it at the lowest \npossible price, and we found that this fellow will go away if we send \nhim $100,000. And, therefore, we do the financially responsible thing \nby sending him $100,000.''\n  Dad said, ``That's extortion, that's blackmail, that's like the \nprotection rackets, if you will, that the mafia runs when they come in \nand say in a particular storefront, `You need some protection from \nsomebody who might bomb this place.' ''\n  He said, ``Well, Senator, we have better things to do than respond to \nthese kinds of lawsuits. The cheapest way out of this dilemma is simply \nsend the man his $100,000 every year.''\n  We are told during this debate, ``Oh, these are hypotheticals.'' We \nare told, ``Oh, we have to look at what might happen here, what might \nhappen there.'' We are told, ``Oh, the proponents of the bill are \nraising scare tactics of the worst possible case, and that is not the \nnormal procedure at all.''\n  I can assure you, Mr. President, this was an actual case, an actual \ncircumstance where automatically the lawyer, by simply hitting the \nbutton on his word processor and turning out the same set of papers, \nreceived a check for $100,000 every year.\n  As I understand the case, to finish the story, that particular lawyer \nis no longer doing that, simply because he got greedy. He started to \noverreach and do this not only with the funds where my father was \nserving as a member of the board but other funds, assuming he would get \nthe same treatment. Finally, one of them, managed by Merrill Lynch, \ndecided to call his bluff and go to court with him.\n  Merrill Lynch had deeper pockets than the mutual fund on whose board \nmy father sat, and they decided to reach into those pockets and pay the \nlegal expenses necessary to close this operation down. So they called \nthe man's bluff. They forced him to come up with the legal fees \nnecessary to go to court, and he found he could not survive if he had \nto pay all the legal fees to actually prosecute the lawsuit and, thus, \nultimately the whole thing was shut down.\n  I cite that because of the rhetoric that has surrounded this bill. We \nare not talking about what will happen in court in a theoretical \nlawsuit when we are talking about the impetus behind the writing and \nfiling of this bill. We are talking about the fact that the vast \nmajority of these lawsuits never get to court and do not intend to go \nto court. They are filed not because the lawyer has discovered some \ngreat evil on behalf of the investor. They are filed because the lawyer \nknows full well that the company or mutual fund or pension fund, or \nwhatever it is that is being accused, will find it cheaper to settle \nout of court than go through the legal hassle of paying all the bills \nnecessary to resolve the issue in the courts.\n  During the hearing on this bill, Ralph Nader made the statement: No \none settles out of court unless he has something to hide, and \nchallenged me personally on that issue saying, no CEO who is \nresponsible would ever settle a lawsuit out of court unless he had \nsomething to hide, and he then proceeded to lecture me as to what my \nduty would be assuming, perhaps erroneously, that I was a lawyer.\n  I said to him and I say here on the floor today, again, I am not a \nlawyer but I was a CEO of a company who settled a suit out of court \nabout which we had nothing to hide. Indeed, all of the issues that were \ninvolved in that lawsuit were clearly on the public record, but the \nlegal bills to prosecute that lawsuit were bankrupting our company.\n  Now, the company at the time was very, very small, it was very \nfragile and our legal bills were running $25,000 a month. I spoke to \nour lawyer and said, ``What happens if we go to trial?''\n  Our lawyer said, ``They will then go to a minimum of $25,000 a \nweek.''\n  There was no way that company could survive the drain of legal bills \nof $25,000 a week. So I said, ``What will it take to settle?''\n  We signed an agreement settling that lawsuit that called upon us to \npay the other party $2,500 a month. Some of our shareholders did not \nlike it. They said, ``Oh, we think it is terrible we have to pay them \nanything, because we're convinced we're right.''\n  I said, ``Look, you can be convinced you're right all you want. The \nissue is, can we afford to continue to press our legal position at a \n$25,000 a month tab all the way into court and then $25,000 a week? \nSwallow your pride about saying we want our position absolutely \nvindicated, take the $2,500 a month settlement and put this behind us \nand get on with our business.''\n  It was one of the smartest business decisions we ever made.\n  I pointed this out to Mr. Nader in the hearing. I resent the \nsuggestion that the reason we settled out of court was that we had \nsomething to hide. And I say absolutely that settlements out of court \nare made, 90 percent of the time, on the basis of pure economics; it is \ncheaper to settle than to continue to litigate. And if it is, swallow \nyour position about making a point, do the wise economic thing and \nsettle this suit.\n  That is where these strike suits come from--lawyers who recognize \nthat reality. Settlements out of court are made on the basis of \neconomics. They are not made on any other basis. That is why so many of \nthese suits are filed. That is why the vast bulk of these suits are \nsettled out of court, and that is why this has become--as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], pointed out--a magnificent way for some \nlawyers to practice because, as the Senator said, this is a practice \nwithout clients. What could be more fun than to be a lawyer with a \npractice without any clients, and with, in the case that I have cited \nin my father's circumstance, a guaranteed $100,000 per year income \ndoing nothing more than mailing off a set of documents to a company \nthat will write out the check because it is easier to do that than to \ngo to court.\n  I point out to those who say, ``Oh, this is not very widespread,'' \nthat we had some testimony in the committee from a lawyer who says this \nis, in fact, never done. I asked him directly. I said, ``Are you \ntelling us that no lawyer ever files a strike suit solely on the belief \nthat he will get a settlement out of court and not have to litigate \nit?'' He said, ``Senator, no lawyer ever does that.'' At that point, \nthe credibility of that witness disappeared, as far as I was concerned, \nbecause I knew that it was done.\n  Well, this practice has created enough concern that we have a \nbipartisan basis of support for this bill. Indeed, the initial \nsupporter, the initial mover and shaker on this bill was the Senator \nfrom Connecticut [Mr. Dodd]--not known for his hard right-wing \npropensities and leanings. He is one of my good friends. We disagree \nabout a number of things. He is a liberal Democrat and I am a \nconservative Republican.\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\nBut I consider him one of the more thoughtful Members of this body. He \nwas the moving force behind this bill in the first instance. He knows \nthat these suits are filed for the purpose of getting settlements, not \never going to court. He was joined by Senator Domenici.\n  Senator Domenici told me over the weekend--we were in Utah together--\nhe has been accused of the fatal sin of being a moderate by some \nportions of the conservative press. I said, ``What did you do, plead \nguilty?'' This is one of the more thoughtful Members of the Senate, as \nwell. He is a careful lawyer. He understands all of the legal issues. \nHe has pushed this bill right from the very beginning, and he, along \nwith Senator Dodd, is the principal cosponsor of the bill in this \nCongress.\n  It is a smokescreen, in my view, to spend all of your time talking \nabout what may or may not happen in court if S. 240 passes, because \nthat ignores the fact that the purpose of S. 240 is to deal with those \npeople who file suits without any intention of going to court. We need \nto understand that as we are debating this bill.\n  Now, there have been some things said about this bill that I would \nlike to set straight. One of the myths that has come out of this debate \nis that if S. 240 had been law at the time of the failure of the \nLincoln Savings & Loan, Mr. Charles Keating would have gone scot-free \nand his victims would have been denied any kind of recovery. That is \nsimply not the case, Mr. President. The safe harbor provisions of S. \n240 would not have protected Keating and his codefendants.\n  Keating's statements that bonds were federally insured and as safe as \na bank deposit were fraudulent and obviously false and not covered by \nthe safe harbor. The safe harbor applies to forward-looking \nprojections, not to statements of fact that can be checked out in the \npast. For Keating to say the bonds were federally insured is not a \nforward-looking statement. Its very nature is a statement of past and \nexisting circumstances, and they did not happen to be true. That is one \nof the reasons Mr. Keating is now out of the savings and loan business \nand under the protection and custody of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wonder if we can get the time situation straightened \nout. Could I ask the Chair what time did we go on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We resumed the bill at 12:16.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween 12:16 and 2 o'clock be treated as equally divided between the \nSenator from Utah and myself. When he completes his statement, I will \nput down the amendment. But the time he is using would come out of his \nside, and there will still be time left, unless he is going to go on \nfor a very long time. I think that would equalize the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I know that the Senator from Maryland was scheduled to \nspeak first, but no one was here, so I started. I would be happy to \nyield now if the Senator wishes to speak.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield, I was going to offer an \namendment on which the time would be equally divided. I am happy to \nwithhold offering the amendment until the Senator completes his general \nstatement. But I did not want the general statement to go on without \ngetting this straightened out because there might not be much time left \nfor the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree that the time of my statement will be charged \nagainst our time on the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Thank you.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I shall conclude so that we can move to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  We should understand that this debate and conversation about what may \nor may not have been the case in the Keating circumstance had S. 240 \nbeen in place is, in fact, irrelevant to the purpose of this \nlegislation and to the direction that it will take in the future. The \nKeating codefendants could remain fully liable if S. 240 had been in \nplace. The aiders and abettors would still be held accountable. The \nKeating claims are within the current statute of limitations, and the \nother 10(b)(5) reforms do not affect the recoveries.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope as we examine this whole circumstance, we \nkeep in mind the purpose for which S. 240 was written in the first \nplace. It is to deal with those people who file lawsuits without any \nexpectation that they will ever come to trial but in the hope that the \neconomics of the circumstance will force people to settle with them \nshort of a trial, so that they can enjoy what, as I say, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico calls the ``perfect'' law practice--a law practice \nwithout clients and a law practice that does not require you to ever go \nto court, to ever hold discovery, to ever go through any procedure--\nsimply file a set of papers and wait, as the lawyer in New York did who \ndealt with my father, for the check to arrive in the mail. That kind of \nthing is bad--it is bad for investors, it is bad for the country. That \nis the reason we are supporting S. 240.\n  I now yield the floor to the Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n (Purpose: To amend the proportionate liability provisions of the bill)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1472.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 134, strike line 6, and insert the following:\n       ``(A) Net financial worth.--Each\n       On page 134, strike lines 9 through 15, and insert the \n     following: ``that the net financial worth of the''.\n       On page 134, line 23, strike ``50 percent'' and insert \n     ``100 percent''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to state the time \nsituation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 52 minutes. The \nmanager of the bill has approximately 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, before I turn to the provisions of the \namendment, I want to make a few comments with respect to what my \ndistinguished colleague from Utah said in his opening remarks on the \nconsideration of this legislation today.\n  It is very important to understand that there are parts of this bill \nthat Members are trying to amend and there are parts we are not trying \nto amend. There are parts which we think are desirable and worthwhile \nhaving. There are other parts that we think are excessive. They \noverreach. They go too far.\n  Those are the ones we are trying to correct. If we could get it \ncorrected, we would have a total package of which one could be \nsupportive.\n  Examples that are cited, many of them that are being cited, are, in \nfact, things we are prepared to try to correct with the provisions of \nthis legislation, that we are not opposing. It is very important that \nthat be understood.\n  The New York Times on Friday has an editorial headed ``Protection for \nCorporate Fraud.'' It says, speaking of the Senate security bill:\n\n       . . . goes far beyond their stated purpose of ending \n     frivolous litigation. The Senate securities bill sets out to \n     protect corporate officials from being sued when they issue \n     overly optimistic predictions of corporate profitability that \n     are simply innocent misjudgment. Sponsors cite cases for \n     opportunist shareholders who waited for a company's share \n     price to nosedive, then sued on the grounds that their \n     investment was based on fraudulent representations of the \n     company's health. But to solve this infrequent problem, the \n     bill would erect a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing \n     officials who peddle recklessly false information. It would \n     block suits against the accountants, lawyers, and other \n     professionals who look the other way when the companies they \n     serve mislead investors. The bill requires that suits be \n     filed within a short statute of limitations and threatens \n     plaintiffs who technically violate the court's procedures \n     with heavy fines, including payment of the defendant's legal \n     fees. These provisions would ward off frivolous suits. But \n     they just as surely ward off valid suits. Securities markets \n     work well when investors are confident that the data on which \n     they base\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\n     decisions is honest. The bill threatens that confidence.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that editorial be printed \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Baltimore Sun has an editorial ``Safe Harbors for \nFinancial Fraud.'' Let me quote very briefly from it:\n\n       In the wake of the Nation's savings and loan debacle, the \n     financial derivative shock to U.S. pension systems, the junk \n     bond manipulations of Mike Milken, one could expect Congress \n     to bolster the rights of investors in securities fraud cases. \n     Instead, Capitol Hill legislators are rallying to protect the \n     interests of corporate executives, securities dealers, \n     lawyers and accountants against the claims of victims of \n     financial crimes.\n\n  Further on it says:\n\n       Originally drafted to reduce the number of frivolous \n     investor lawsuits against corporations. . . .\n\n  And then it goes on to say:\n\n       But the sweeping protections included have fired the \n     opposition of investor groups, advocates for the elderly and \n     even the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n  It closes by saying:\n\n       The arsenal of weapons against investors in the legislation \n     shows that it is more about protecting the shadowy dealings \n     of corporate leaders and their professional confederates than \n     in limiting frivolous class action lawsuits.\n\n  This is the question. No one is protecting the frivolous class action \nlawsuit. The question is whether the provisions of the bill have gone \nbeyond that and are excessive. We submit that they are. Those are some \nof the provisions we are now trying to change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Baltimore Sun \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I made reference to an article that \nappeared in the New York Times on Sunday, authored by Mark Griffin, the \ndirector of the Utah securities division who is a board member of the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association, comprising the \nsecurities regulators from the 50 States. Mr. Griffin is chairman of \nthe Securities Litigation Reform Task Force of the North American \nSecurities Administrators Association. In other words, all of the 50 \nState securities administrators.\n  That article entitled ``Securities Litigation Bill Is Reform in Name \nOnly.'' Just to quote briefly:\n\n       What's in a name? In the case of the Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995, consumers will find a world \n     class misnomer. Now before the Senate, the bill is more \n     accurately described as securities litigation repeal. For \n     millions of middle-class American investors, the fate of this \n     bill--and the even more radical version passed by the House \n     of Representatives in March--could spell the difference \n     between recovering or losing billions of dollars from \n     securities fraud.\n       Securities litigation reform began with the intent of \n     putting some weights around the ankles of a few fleet-footed \n     lawyers; but the measure now dangerously close to Senate \n     passage would wind up being a noose around the neck of \n     defrauded investors. While everyone agrees on the need for \n     reasonable reform, numerous public-minded groups are strongly \n     opposed to radical steps in the Senate bill, S. 240, that \n     would snuff out key investor rights.\n       If securities litigation reform was the real goal here, the \n     widespread support that exists for reasonable steps to curb \n     lawsuit abuses would have ensured easy passage. But the bill \n     now before the Senate would rein in frivolous lawsuits only \n     by making it virtually impossible for consumers to pursue \n     rightful claims.\n\n  He goes on later to say,\n\n       The reality is that the main intent of this legislation, \n     despite what its proponents say, is to provide a shield for \n     all but the most extreme cases of fraud.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will come back to this article because I think it is \na perspective analysis of the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me turn to the amendment which I sent to the \ndesk, which deals with the issue of proportional liability and the \ndeparture from the concept of joint and several liability.\n  Let me recap very quickly the broader issue that was dealt with last \nand then the more narrowly focused amendment which I have offered and \nwhich I will then discuss. The bill changes the current system of joint \nand several liability to a new system of proportionate liability. Joint \nand several liability is the legal principle that says that each \nparticipant in a fraud may be held liable for all of the fraud victim's \nlosses.\n\n  Under the Federal securities laws as they now are--not as they are \nbeing changed in this bill but as they are right now--each participant \nin a securities fraud--a corporate executive, an outside accountant, \nlawyer, investment banker--may be held liable for all of a victim's \nlosses. In other words, if one of the fraud participants is bankrupt or \nif one of the fraud participants has fled the country, the other fraud \nparticipants make up the difference. So the burden, if one of the fraud \nparticipants is bankrupt or flees, does not fall on the innocent \ninvestor. It seems to me a rather simple concept. It is between those \nwho have participated in the fraud--perhaps in varying degrees but \nnevertheless participated in it--they should be held accountable and \nhave to sustain the burden before it is thrust upon the innocent \ninvestor. In fact, under the current system, the defrauded investors \nare able to recover their entire losses against any of the participants \nin the fraud. This bill will change that. The bill will change the \nsystem from joint and several liability to proportional liability for \nreckless defendants.\n  Who are reckless defendants under the securities laws as they now \nexist? The Federal securities law currently punishes two types of \npeople who participate in a fraud: People who plan the fraud who \nintended to deceive the investors, and people who acted recklessly, who \nknew nothing about the fraud and did nothing about it--who knew about \nthe fraud and did nothing about it.\n  The standard of recklessness used in the courts is not--last week, in \nfact, some of the people supporting this legislation talked about it as \nthough it was negligent or just by chance that one got involved. The \nstandard is--this is a quote out of the Sundstrand case:\n\n       . . . a highly unreasonable omission involving not merely \n     simple or even gross negligence but an extreme departure from \n     the standards of ordinary care and which present a danger of \n     misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the \n     defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been \n     aware of it.\n\n  The recklessness liability, under Federal securities fraud, is \nusually asserted against the fraud artist's professional advisers, his \nlawyers, accountants, appraisers, investment bankers, and so forth. \nUnfortunately, sometimes these people know about a fraud and do nothing \nabout it. In those instances, the law holds them jointly and severally \nliable in that fraud. The bill changes that. It changes that. And the \nreckless participant will be liable only for a proportionate share of \nthe investor's losses. If one of the fraud participants is bankrupt or \nfled the country or cannot be found, the losses will no longer be made \nup by other participants in the fraud. Instead, the innocent investor--\nthe innocent investor will not recover his losses, even when other \nparticipants in the fraud are available to pay. Reckless participants \nin a fraud will be favored over innocent victims of a fraud, over \nindividual investors, over State and local governments, over pension \nplans, over charitable organizations.\n  Securities regulators, Government officials, consumer groups, and \nothers oppose this provision. The Chairman of the SEC wrote the \nCongress saying:\n\n       The Commission has consistently opposed proportionate \n     liability.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association, which \nrepresents the 50 State securities regulators, wrote, urging the Senate \n``to lift the severe limitations on joint and several liability so that \ndefrauded investors may fully recover their losses.''\n  The Government Finance Officers Association, representing thousands \nof county treasurers, city managers, and so on, people who invest \ntaxpayer funds and pension funds, are opposed to this provision. They \nwrote, on June 8, in a letter that was printed last week in the \nRecord--and I ask unanimous consent their letter, along with the one \nfrom\n\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nthe North American Securities Administrators Association, again be \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. They wrote:\n\n       Fraud victims would find it exceedingly difficult to fully \n     recover their losses. S. 240 sharply limits the traditional \n     rule of joint and several liability for reckless violators. \n     This means the fraud victims would be precluded from fully \n     recovering their losses.\n\n  The National League of Cities, the Consumer Federation of America, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors have all opposed this version of \nproportionate liability that puts fraud participants ahead of fraud \nvictims. On Friday, we received a letter from the American Association \nof Retired Persons, which I would like to have printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                           of Retired Persons,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1995.\n     Re S. 240, the ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.''\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate will soon be voting on S. 240, the \n     Private Securities Litigation Act. While the American \n     Association of Retired Persons (AARP) supports efforts to \n     eliminate truly frivolous lawsuits, we cannot support this \n     bill as reported out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs Committee. As currently written, many aggrieved \n     investors with legitimate claims will be vulnerable to \n     abusive practices in the securities marketplace.\n       More than 28 million Americans over the age of 65 rely in \n     part on investment income to meet expenses. Though older \n     investors once relied heavily on federally insured products \n     such as certificates of deposit or savings accounts, lower \n     interest rates have prompted many, including those who are \n     not financially sophisticated, to invest in securities. In \n     addition, because of the increasing use of defined-\n     contribution (versus defined-benefit) pension plans, more and \n     more people are using securities products when planning for \n     retirement.\n       Older Americans fall prey not only to financial fraud, but \n     also are injured by some practices within the ``legitimate'' \n     investment industry. Some older investors are hit with hefty \n     fees or subjected to ``churning'' of accounts to maximize \n     profits for salespeople. Others routinely lose money in \n     regulated investments that are unsuitable to their needs, are \n     promoted in a misleading fashion, or are accompanied by \n     inadequate and unclear disclosures. This money may represent \n     a lifetime of savings, a lump sum pension payout, or proceeds \n     from the sale of a home. Financial losses for retirees can \n     mean a loss of basic support, with little opportunity to \n     recapture lost income.\n       As currently drafted, S. 240 will shield wrongdoers from \n     liability in a number of ways. As a result, the bill needs to \n     be improved to help strike a better balance between \n     protecting investors and eliminating claims without merit. \n     AARP urges you to support amendments which may be offered \n     calling for the following:\n       Maintenance of traditional joint and several liability \n     among defendants. Under the bill as currently drafted, \n     liability for reckless behavior would be narrowed to such an \n     extent that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for \n     small investors to be made whole for losses suffered. This \n     amendment would protect investors against jailed, missing, or \n     bankrupt malfeasors by restoring existing joint and several \n     liability; and\n       Replacement of the safe harbor provision in the bill with a \n     directive to the SEC to issue a rule which structures a safe \n     harbor that protects both legitimate businesses and \n     investors. S. 240 weakens current law by allowing an \n     expansive safe harbor for forward-looking corporate \n     statements that make exaggerated claims to attract investors, \n     even if these statements are made recklessly. Clearly, such \n     statements would harm investors greatly and should not be \n     immunized from liability.\n       If AARP can be of further assistance or if you have any \n     questions, please have your staff contact Kent Burnette at \n     (202) 434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That letter states:\n\n       As currently drafted, S. 240 will shield wrongdoers from \n     liability in a number of ways. As a result, the bill needs to \n     be improved to help strike a better balance between \n     protecting investors and eliminating claims without merit.\n\n  Last week, an amendment was offered by Senators Shelby, Bryan, Boxer, \nand I, to try to strike a better balance with respect to the broad \nissue of joint and several liability. That amendment was defeated. I \nvery much regret that was the case. The amendment that has just been \nsent to the desk is, therefore, not dealing with the broader issue of \njoint and several liability, which I have just outlined, but with a \nmore narrow aspect of it.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus very carefully on the fact situation. \nEven the authors of the bill that is before us recognize that it is \nunfair to favor reckless lawyers, accountants, and investment bankers \nwho participate in a fraud entirely over the individual investor \nvictimized by the fraud. In fact, the bill has two provisions, one that \nwould require reckless accountants and reckless lawyers to pay \ninvestors more than the proportionate share of the reckless advisers \nwhen a fraud artist is bankrupt or has fled the country, and another \nprovision designed to make up for the entire losses of so-called small \ninvestors.\n  Let me examine these two provisions, and the amendment goes to these \ntwo provisions. The first provision says that all the defendants shall \nbe jointly and severally liable for the uncollec-\n\ntible share of the small investor, but only under these very limited \ncircumstances--first of all, only if the net worth of the investor is \nunder $200,000. The committee report says that net worth includes all \nof the plaintiffs' financial assets including stocks, bonds, real \nestate, and jewelry.\n  How many investors are we talking about here? People who are able to \nbuy stocks, are going to have a net worth under $200,000, particularly \nwhen the net worth includes the value of their home? How many elderly \npeople who have saved for a lifetime have a net worth over $200,000? \nTheir home is usually paid for or close to it. They have some other \nassets. For such a person, $200,000 is not a large net worth. I guess \nthey would have to value the engagement ring, value the wedding ring, \nvalue the heirlooms. So it is a $200,000 net financial worth of the \nplaintiff.\n  The other provision says that the plaintiff will be held whole only \nif the recoverable damages are equal to more than 10 percent of the net \nfinancial worth of the plaintiff. Listen to this. You are only going to \nprotect--the bill supposedly makes an effort to protect the small \ninvestor. But the definition of the protection is that the investor's \nnet worth has to be under $200,000, and then you protect recoverable \ndamages only if they are equal to or more than 10 percent of the net \nfinancial worth.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me just give you this example. A \nretired person, a small investor, retired person has a $190,000 net \nworth. A fraudulent stock scheme is practiced upon this person, and he \nloses $17,000. The person who perpetrated the scheme, this scam artist, \nhas gone bankrupt. They flee the country, or whatever. The lawyer who \nadvised the scam artist knew about this or was reckless in terms of \nknowing about this fraud, the standard I quoted earlier. Under current \nlaw, that person would be jointly and severally liable and would have \nto pay all of the damages. Under this provision, since the damages are \nnot 10 percent of the net worth, the investor does not get that \nprotection.\n  What is the meaning of this provision in the bill, if it has that \nkind of exclusion that simply swallows up any meaning? Here is a small \ninvestor, $190,000 net worth, loses $17,000 which is not 10 percent of \nthe $190,000, and the small investor is not protected in that \nsituation, and the participants in the fraud are able to avoid having \nto make that small investor whole. If you really mean trying to provide \nsome protection for the small investor, this provision needs to be \ncorrected.\n  Clearly, as written, hardly anyone is going to be protected. And the \namendment that I have offered, one part of it, provides greater \nprotection to small investors, people of modest means. The bill says \nyou are protected only if you lose 10 percent of your net worth in a \nfraud. In other words, you have to lose $20,000 of a $200,000 net worth \nor $15,000 of a $150,000 net worth. My amendment deletes this 10 \npercent requirement. It says you do not have to lose 10 percent of your \nnet worth in the fraud. Regardless of how much you lose in the fraud, \nif your net worth is $200,000 or less, you are protected.\n  So you have the very small investor who ought to be protected, not \nthe reckless advisers to the corporate scam artists who participated in \nthe fraud.\n  So we strike the provision in the bill that requires that the damages \nbe\n\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nequal to 10 percent of the net worth. So you have someone with a \n$200,000 net worth. If they lose something to this scam artist, they \nare going to be protected, and all the defendants will continue to be \nheld jointly and severally liable in that instance. If you really want \nto talk about protecting small investors, you obviously have to make \nthat change.\n  The second provision that is in this legislation, in the course of \nchanging the joint and several liability scheme and shifting it to \nproportionate liability, even the authors recognize that was a very \nheavy weighting of the balance against the investors. So they said, \n``Well, in all instances we are going to require the reckless \nparticipants in the fraud to pay investors an additional amount over \ntheir proportionate share.''\n  The additional amount, though, that is provided for is 50 percent. \nLet me give you an example. A con artist perpetrates a fraud. He is \nassisted by the reckless conduct of his lawyer or his accountant who \nknows about the fraud but does nothing to stop it. When the fraud is \nexposed, the con artist skips the country. The reckless adviser is \nfound to be 10 percent responsible for the investor's losses.\n  Under the bill, there is an overage, and the reckless adviser could \nbe held liable for up to 15 percent of the investor's losses; in other \nwords, a 50-percent overage. So you give some additional marginal \nrecovery to the investor.\n  The extra 50 percent payment required under the bill, in my judgment, \ndoes not go far enough toward making the investor whole. So the other \npart of this amendment increases the additional payment the reckless \ndefendants pay, when the con artist is bankrupt or flees, from 50 \npercent of their proportionate share to 100 percent.\n  Under the example I gave a moment ago, a reckless adviser, a lawyer, \ninvestment banker, an accountant to the corporate swindler who did \nnothing to stop it was later found responsible for 10 percent of the \nfraud. As the bill is written, he could be held to 15 percent of it. \nThis amendment would raise that to 20 percent. It would allow investors \nto recover a little bit more of their losses in cases of fraud.\n  I note that just on Friday when we were debating this bill my \ndistinguished colleague from New York said in speaking about addressing \nthis problem that we were outlining at the time:\n\n       If the fraudulent defendant is bankrupt and cannot pay, we \n     would double the liability of the other defendants. So if a \n     defendant was found 5 percent negligent but the main \n     defendant is not able to pay, the 5 percent negligent \n     defendant would be held responsible for 10 percent of the \n     damages.\n  Well, that is what my amendment is trying to accomplish. The bill as \nwritten provides a 50 percent overage. So if you were 5 percent liable, \nunder the bill you would go to 7\\1/2\\ percent. I actually think that \nthis was, in effect, really the recognition of an appropriate increase, \nand this would double it. In that instance, you go from 5 to 10. If \nthey were 10 percent liable, they would go to 20 percent liable.\n  So those are the two amendments here. I disagree with abandoning the \njoint and several liability principle. That was voted on the other day. \nWhat we are now trying to do is to take the provision in the bill and \nto make it more reasonable with respect to the small investor. In some \nrespects, I regard this as the ``have-you-no-shame'' amendment in terms \nof the provisions that are in the bill. We have provisions in this bill \nthat if you are a very small investor with a net worth of under \n$200,000, you have to lose at least $20,000----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  You have to lose over $20,000 in order to be held whole by these \ndefendants who have participated in this fraudulent scheme. If you are \ngoing to recognize the concept of the small investor and the need to \nprovide some additional protection, do not render it meaningless by \nhaving this 10 percent requirement on losses. It is bad enough that you \nhave defined the small investor as $200,000 of net worth including, \nincluding the person's home--including the person's home. Now, that is \nan awful lot of people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 1 more minute.\n  And then, in addition, to require that they lose at least 10 percent \nof their net worth, more than $20,000--you take a person, they have \n$200,000 of net worth. They have a home worth $150,000, which is modest \nin today's markets in most places in the country--worth $150,000. They \nhave $50,000 worth of items for net worth which the bill has defined as \nincluding the jewelry and heirlooms and everything else. They are drawn \ninto a fraudulent scheme. They lose $19,500, not 10 percent of the \n$200,000, and you are not going to hold them harmless. You are going to \nput the fraudulent perpetrators, the perpetrators of the fraud, ahead \nof the innocent investor.\n  Mr. President, it is an outrage. At a minimum we need to change this; \notherwise, there is no shame left whatever.\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from the other side \nof the aisle has returned, and I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 23, 1995]\n\n                     Protection for Corporate Fraud\n\n       Two bills before Congress reveal how reckless the \n     Republicans have become in their zeal to reduce regulation. \n     The bills--which would ``reform'' laws governing securities \n     firms and banks--go far beyond their stated purpose of ending \n     frivolous litigation. What they would actually do is insulate \n     corporate officials who commit fraud from legal challenge by \n     their victims.\n       The Senate securities bill sets out to protect corporate \n     officials from being sued when they issue overly optimistic \n     predictions of corporate profitability that are simply \n     innocent misjudgments. Sponsors cite cases where \n     opportunistic shareholders waited for a company's share price \n     to nosedive, then sued on the grounds that their investment \n     was based on fraudulent representations of the company's \n     health.\n       But to solve this infrequent problem, the bill would erect \n     a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing officials who peddle \n     recklessly false information. It would block suits against \n     accountants, lawyers and other professionals who look the \n     other way when the companies they serve mislead investors. \n     The bill requires that suits be filed within a short statute \n     of limitations and threatens plaintiffs who technically \n     violate the court's procedures with heavy fines, including \n     payment of the defendant's legal fees.\n       These provisions would ward off frivolous suits. But they \n     just as surely ward off valid suits. Securities markets work \n     well when investors are confident that the data on which they \n     base decisions is honest. The bill threatens that confidence.\n       Banking legislation working its way through the House would \n     also cause damage, both socially and economically. It would \n     remove the Justice Department's authority to sue bankers and \n     realtors who systematically block blacks and other minorities \n     from renting apartments or getting mortgages. Apparently \n     Justice has been too vigilant fighting discrimination for the \n     G.O.P.'s taste. Astonishingly--in the wake of the fraud that \n     brought down savings and loan institutions during the \n     1980's--the bill would weaken regulatory oversight over bank \n     directors, requirements to provide independent audits and \n     prohibitions against preferential loans to bank officials.\n       The bill leaves few customer protections in place. It would \n     eliminate some requirements that banks report interest rates \n     on customer accounts in uniform, easy-to-compare terms. It \n     would also gut the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires \n     banks to lend money in the neighborhoods where they take \n     deposits or else possibly relinquish the right to merge or \n     open and close branch offices. The act requires reform \n     because enforcement is needlessly expensive. But the answer \n     is to clarify and tighten standards, the solution the \n     Administration has already taken.\n       The bill will make banks more profitable. But it will also \n     invite some of the sordid practices that contributed to the \n     $500 billion that the savings and loans failures cost \n     taxpayers.\n       The Administration has expressed opposition to many of the \n     banking provisions. But it has remained silent on the \n     securities bill. Apparently, powerful Democrats, like \n     Christopher Dodd of the insurance state of Connecticut, have \n     pressured the White House to remain mum.\n       President Clinton seems eager to run as a candidate who \n     could work with the Republican Congress but protect Americans \n     from G.O.P. excesses. He could demonstrate his worth by \n     vowing to veto the securities and banking bills--and any \n     others that would put the interests of deceptive executives \n     above those of ordinary voters.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 26, 1995]\n\n                    Safe Harbors for Financial Fraud\n\n       In the wake of the nation's savings and loan debacle, the \n     financial derivatives shock to U.S. pension systems, the junk \n     bond manipulations of Mike Milken, one could expect Congress \n     to bolster the rights of investors in securities fraud cases.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n       Instead, Capitol Hill legislators are rallying to protect \n     the interests of corporate executives, securities dealers, \n     lawyers and accountants against the claims of victims of \n     financial crimes.\n       Legislation approved by the House and awaiting a Senate \n     floor vote today would grant virtual immunity to these \n     participants in securities fraud lawsuits. Executives who \n     hype their companies' financial projections to jack up the \n     stock price would be sheltered from legal action.\n       Bondholders defrauded by Charles Keating and his S scam, \n     the largest in U.S. history, would find it almost impossible \n     to sue the co-defendants for relief under the pending bill. \n     They recovered $240 million from Keating's accountants, \n     lawyers and securities dealers, although still losing nearly \n     40 percent of their money.\n       Originally drafted to reduce the number of frivolous \n     investor lawsuits against corporations, the bill was pushed \n     by Silicon Valley companies whose fortunes are highly \n     volatile. But the sweeping protections included have fired \n     the opposition of investor groups, advocates for the elderly \n     and even the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       The number of federal securities fraud cases has nearly \n     doubled over the past decade. But the SEC, which polices \n     securities fraud, says that investor lawsuits are important \n     in accomplishing its mission. A study released last month by \n     the Congressional Research Service finds the number of \n     securities suits against companies ``exceptionally small.''\n       The loudest complaints have come from the elderly, whose \n     retirement assets are most vulnerable to fraud. Senior \n     citizens account for over 30 percent of securities fraud \n     victims, according to a study by the Gray Panthers.\n       The House bill includes the chilling proviso that the \n     losers of a fraud lawsuit must pay lawyer bills of those they \n     sued. The Senate measure would limit defendant responsibility \n     in lawsuits only to their degree of proven guilt, instead of \n     making all parties liable for fraud settlements.\n       The arsenal of weapons against investors in the legislation \n     shows that it is more about protecting the shadowy dealings \n     of corporate leaders and their professional confederates than \n     in limiting frivolous class action lawsuits. If the integrity \n     of the marketplace is to be truly protected, the Senate will \n     vote down this invitation to expanded investor fraud.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 1995]\n\n           Securities Litigation Bill Is Reform in Name Only\n\n                           (By Mark Griffin)\n\n       What's in a name? In the case of the ``Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995,'' consumers will find a world-\n     class misnomer. Now before the Senate, the bill is more \n     accurately described as securities litigation repeal. For \n     millions of middle-class American investors, the fate of this \n     bill--and the even more radical version passed by the House \n     of Representatives in March--could spell the difference \n     between recovering or losing billions of dollars from \n     securities fraud.\n       Securities litigation reform began with the intent of \n     putting some weights around the ankles of a few fleet-footed \n     lawyers; but the measure now dangerously close to Senate \n     passage would wind up being a noose around the neck of \n     defrauded investors. While everyone agrees on the need for \n     reasonable reform, numerous public-minded groups are strongly \n     opposed to radical steps in the Senate bill, S. 240, that \n     would snuff out key investor rights.\n       If securities litigation reform was the real goal here, the \n     widespread support that exists for reasonable steps to curb \n     lawsuit abuses would have insured easy passage. But the bill \n     now before the Senate would rein in frivolous lawsuits only \n     by making it virtually impossible for consumers to pursue \n     rightful claims. Here we see the financial world's equivalent \n     of the notorious Vietnam ``hamlet strategy'': we must destroy \n     this village in order to save it.\n       The reality is that the main intent of this legislation, \n     despite what its proponents say, is to provide a shield for \n     all but the most extreme cases of fraud. Have the members of \n     the Senate already forgotten the financial scandals of the \n     1980's that cost investors and taxpayers billions of dollars? \n     Is it really good public policy to erect protective barriers \n     around future wrongdoers who will be emboldened to emulate \n     Lincoln Savings and Loan and Prudential Securities?\n       At the heart of consumer concerns over this legislation are \n     two key problems.\n       Under current rules, public companies are prevented from \n     deceiving investors by reasonable restrictions on statements \n     concerning future corporate performance, known as ``forward-\n     looking statements.'' The original S. 240 created a limited \n     ``safe harbor'' for such statements, but the harbor was \n     changed to an ocean. So now the Senate is considering a \n     measure that protects any reckless or irresponsible statement \n     by a company about its future as long as the statement is \n     represented as forward-looking and notes that actual results \n     may differ.\n       The Senate bill narrowly defines as fraudulent only those \n     statements ``knowingly made with the expectation, purpose and \n     actual intent of misleading investors.'' As if this was not a \n     loose enough standard the bill require that each of the three \n     conditions be proven separately in court.\n       Consequently, S. 240 is a dagger aimed at the heart of what \n     makes possible strong public confidence in the markets: full, \n     fair disclosure mandated under Federal securities law. Arthur \n     Levitt, Jr., the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, \n     has noted: ``I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful \n     fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.''\n       Perhaps the clearest sign, however, that the bill's \n     proponents have sold middle-class investors down the river is \n     their refusal to lengthen the time in which consumers can \n     bring cases to court. The current rule derives from a 1991 \n     Supreme Court decision that created a statute of limitations \n     for Federal securities law cases of one year from discovery \n     of a misdeed or three years from the commission of the act in \n     question. This represented a serious reduction in the time \n     available for such lawsuits, since Federal courts previously \n     had relied on state standards for statutes of limitation.\n       Currently, 31 states permit longer than the ``1 and 3'' \n     standard for the filing of state securities cases. What \n     possible case can the backers of this bill make for keeping \n     the time limit as short as possible so that future swindlers \n     who cover their tracks carefully will get off the hook for \n     good?\n       Fortunately, efforts are under way to pull the measure back \n     toward the interests of small investors. Among the amendments \n     expected to be deliberated on the Senate floor this week are \n     measures that would: replace the expansive safe harbor for \n     forward-looking statements with a directive to the S.E.C. to \n     continue its rulemaking efforts in this area; lengthen the \n     statute of limitations for private securities fraud actions; \n     fully restore aiding and abetting liability under the \n     securities laws, an established concept that before it was \n     recently removed by a Supreme Court decision, made it \n     possible to sue even indirect participants in a fraud, and \n     lift the severe limitations the bill imposes on joint and \n     several liability, allowing investors to continue recovering \n     from all participants in the fraud.\n       The difference between reform and repeal of securities \n     litigation is an enormous one for middle-class investors in \n     America. Based on current payments to securities class-action \n     claimants, it should be expected that shutting the doors of \n     America's courthouses over the next five years to securities \n     fraud victims will result in 1.79 million investors losing \n     the right to recover approximately $2.87 billion. Even these \n     numbers may underestimate matters.\n       By loosening the Federal laws that now empower citizens to \n     go to court to restrain misconduct in our financial \n     marketplace, Congress has the potential to unleash a new, \n     painful era of financial fraud.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                Government Finance\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 13,000 state and local government financial officials \n     who comprise the membership of the Government Finance \n     Officers Association (GFOA) to bring to your attention \n     serious concerns we have with the Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act, S. 240, recently approved by the Senate Banking \n     Committee. As you know, the GFOA is a professional \n     association of state and local officials who are involved in \n     and manage all the disciplines of public finance. The state \n     and local governmental entities our members represent bring a \n     unique perspective to this proposed legislation because they \n     are both investors of billions of dollars of public pension \n     funds and temporary cash balances, and issuers of debt \n     securities as well.\n       We support efforts to deter frivolous securities lawsuits, \n     but we believe that any legislation to accomplish this must \n     also maintain an appropriate balance that ensures the rights \n     of investors to seek recovery against those who engage in \n     fraud in the securities markets. We believe that S. 240 does \n     not achieve this balance, but rather erodes the ability of \n     investors to seek recovery in cases of fraud.\n       The strength and stability of our nation's securities \n     markets depend on investor confidence in the integrity, \n     fairness and efficiency of these markets. To maintain this \n     confidence, investors must have effective remedies against \n     those persons who violate the antifraud provisions of the \n     federal securities laws. In recent years, we have seen how \n     investment losses caused by securities laws violations can \n     adversely affect state and local governments and their \n     taxpayers. It is essential, therefore, that we fully maintain \n     our rights to seek redress in the courts.\n       S. 240 would drastically alter the way America's financial \n     system has worked for over 60 years--a system second to none. \n     Following are the major concerns state and local governments \n     have with this ``reform'' legislation:\n       Fraud victims would face the risk of having to pay the \n     defendant's legal fees if they lost. S. 240 imposes a \n     modified ``loser pays'' rule that carries the presumption \n     that if the loser is the plaintiff, all legal fees should be \n     shifted to the plaintiff. The same presumption, however, \n     would not apply to losing defendants. The end result of this \n     modified ``loser pays'' rule is that it would strongly \n     discourage the filing of securities fraud claims by victims, \n     regardless of the merits of the cases. This is particularly \n     true for state and local governments that have lost taxpayer \n     funds through investments, involving\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\n     financial fraud in derivatives, for example, but who simply \n     cannot afford to risk further taxpayer funds by taking the \n     risk that they might lose their case and have to pay the \n     legal fees of large corporations. The argument is made that a \n     modified loser pays rule is necessary to deter frivolous \n     lawsuits, but we understand there are only 120 companies sued \n     annually--out of over 14,000 public corporations, and that \n     the number of suits has not increased from 1974.\n       Fraud victims would find it exceedingly difficult to fully \n     recover their losses. Our legal standard of ``joint and \n     several'' liability has enabled defrauded investors to \n     recover full damages from accountants, brokers, bankers and \n     lawyers who help engineer securities frauds, even when the \n     primary wrongdoer is bankrupt, has fled or is in jail. S. 240 \n     sharply limits the traditional rule of joint and several \n     liability for reckless violators. This means that fraud \n     victims would be precluded from fully recovering their \n     losses.\n       Wrongdoers who ``aid and abet'' fraud would be immune from \n     cases brought by fraud victims. As you know, aiders had been \n     held liable in cases brought by fraud victims for 25 years \n     until a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling last year eliminated such \n     liability because there was not specific statutory language \n     in federal securities law. If aiders and abettors are immune \n     from liability, as issuers of debt securities, state and \n     local governments would become the ``deep pockets,'' and as \n     investors they would be limited in their ability to recover \n     losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the state \n     securities regulators have recommended full restoration of \n     liability of aiders and abettors and GFOA supports that \n     recommendation.\n       Wrongdoers would be let off the hook by a short statute of \n     limitations. We had supported the modest extension of the \n     statute--from one year from discovery of the fraud but no \n     more than three years after the fraud to two years after the \n     violation was, or should have been, discovered but not more \n     than five years after the fraud was committed--that was \n     contained in an earlier version of S. 240. We are \n     disappointed that this extension was removed in the \n     Committee's markup of the legislation and hope it will be \n     restored when the full Senate considers the bill.\n       Under S. 240, corporations could deceive investors about \n     future events and be immunized from liability in cases \n     brought by defrauded investors. Corporate predictions are \n     inherently prone to fraud as they are an easy way to make \n     exaggerated claims of favorable developments to attract \n     investors. The ``safe harbor'' in S. 240 is a very broad \n     exemption and immunizes a vast amount of corporate \n     information so long as it is called a ``forward-looking \n     statement'' and states that it is uncertain and there is risk \n     it may not occur. Such statements are immunized even if they \n     are made recklessly. We believe this opens a major loophole \n     through which wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud \n     victims would be denied recovery.\n       Access to fair and full compensation through the civil \n     justice system is an important safeguard for state and local \n     government investors, and is a strong deterrent to securities \n     fraud. We believe. S. 240 as written does not provide such \n     access to state and local governments or to other investors. \n     Just as state and local government investors are urged to use \n     extreme caution in investing public funds, the Senate should \n     use extreme caution in reforming the securities regulation \n     system.\n       We hope you will work to bring about needed changes in the \n     legislation when it is considered by the full Senate. If \n     there is any way we can help in this effort, please do not \n     hesitate to call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Catherine L. Spain,\n     Director, Federal Liaison Center.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.\n     Re S. 240, the ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.''\n\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The full Senate may consider as \n     early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week, S. 240, the \n     ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' On \n     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators \n     Association (NASAA), we are writing today to express the \n     Association's opposition to S. 240 as it was reported out of \n     the Banking Committee. In the U.S., NASAA is the national \n     voice of the 50 state securities agencies responsible for \n     investor protection and the efficient functioning of the \n     capital markets at the grassroots level.\n       While everyone agrees on the need for changes to the \n     current securities litigation system, not everyone is \n     prepared to deny justice to defrauded investors in the name \n     of such reform. Proponents of the bill make two claims: \n     first, that they have modified the bill to satisfy many of \n     the objections to the earlier version; and second, that the \n     bill will not prevent meritorious claims from going forward. \n     Neither claim is accurate. First, the changes made to the \n     bill do little to resolve the serious objections to S. 240 \n     raised by NASAA and its members. In fact, it may be argued \n     that during the Banking Committee's deliberations the bill \n     was made less acceptable from the perspective of investors. \n     Second, it is NASAA's view that the bill succeeds in curbing \n     frivolous lawsuits only by making it equally difficult to \n     pursue rightful claims against those who commit securities \n     fraud.\n       The reality is that the major provisions of S. 240 will \n     work to shield even the most egregious wrongdoers among \n     public companies, brokerage firms, accountants and others \n     from legitimate lawsuits brought by defrauded investors. Do \n     we really want to erect protective barriers around future \n     wrongdoers?\n       NASAA agrees that there is room for constructive \n     improvement in the federal securities litigation process. The \n     Association supports reform measures that achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     providing relief to honest companies and professionals who \n     may unfairly find themselves the targets of frivolous \n     lawsuits. Regrettably, S. 240 as approved by the Senate \n     Banking Committee fails to achieve this necessary balance.\n       Although this bill has been characterized in some quarters \n     as an attempt to improve the cause of defrauded investors in \n     legitimate lawsuits, that simply is not the case. Attempts to \n     incorporate into the bill provisions that would work to the \n     benefit of defrauded investors were rejected when the Banking \n     Committee considered the bill. At the same time, the few \n     provisions in the original bill that may have worked to the \n     benefit of defrauded investors were deleted.\n       For example, during the Committee' deliberations: (1) the \n     rather modest extension of the statute of limitations for \n     securities fraud suits contained in the original version was \n     deleted; (2) attempts to fully restore aiding and abetting \n     liability under the securities laws were rejected; (3) a \n     regulatory safe harbor for forward-looking statements \n     contained in the original version of S. 240 was replaced with \n     an overly broad safe harbor for such information, making it \n     extremely difficult to sue when misleading information causes \n     investors to suffer losses; and (4) efforts to loosen the \n     strict limitations on the applicability of joint and several \n     liability were rejected, making it all but impossible for \n     more than a very few to ever fully recover their losses when \n     they are defrauded. The truth here is that this is a one-\n     sided measure that will benefit corporate interests at the \n     expense of investors.\n       As state government officials responsible for administering \n     the securities laws in our jurisdictions, we know the \n     important role private actions play in the enforcement of our \n     securities laws and in protecting the honesty and integrity \n     of our capital markets. The strength and stability of our \n     nation's securities markets depend in large measure on \n     investor confidence in the fairness and integrity of these \n     markets. In order to maintain this confidence, it is critical \n     that investors have effective remedies against persons who \n     violate the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.\n       When S. 240 is considered on the Senate floor, it is \n     expected that several pro-investor amendments will be offered \n     in an attempt to inject some balance into the measure. Among \n     the amendments we expect to be offered are those that would: \n     (1) extend the statute of limitations for private securities \n     fraud actions; (2) fully restore aiding and abetting \n     liability under the securities laws; (3) replace the \n     expansive safe harbor for foward-looking statements with a \n     directive to the Securities and Exchange Commission to \n     continue its rulemaking efforts and report back to Congress; \n     and (4) lift the severe limitations on joint and several \n     liability so that defrauded investors may fully recover their \n     losses.\n       On behalf of NASAA, we respectfully encourage you to vote \n     in favor of all such amendments when they are offered on the \n     Senate floor. If all four amendments are not adopted, we \n     respectfully encourage you to oppose S. 240 on final passage.\n       NASAA regrets that the Association cannot support the \n     litigation reform proposed as reported out of the Senate \n     Banking Committee. The Association believes that this issue \n     is an important one and one that should be addressed by \n     Congress. However, NASAA believes that is more important to \n     get it done right than it is to get it done quickly. S. 240 \n     as it was reported out of the Banking Committee should be \n     rejected and more carefully-crafted and balanced legislation \n     should be adopted in its place.\n       If you have any questions about NASAA's position on this \n     issue, please contact Maureen Thompson, NASAA's legislative \n     adviser.\n           Sincerely,\n     Philip A. Feign,\n       Securities Commissioner, Colorado Division of Securities, \n     President, North American Securities Association.\n     Mark J. Griffin,\n       Director, Utah Securities Division, Chairman, Securities \n     Litigation Reform Task Force of the North American Securities \n     Administrators Association.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have 29 minutes on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 28 minutes 25 seconds.\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak to the Senate about this reform \nmeasure and in my own way lead up to the amendment which is the subject \nmatter of today's discussion.\n  This new system--and that is what it is--builds a better system for \ninvestors in 12 very succinct, easy to understand ways.\n  First, it puts investors with real financial interests, not lawyers, \nin charge of the cases. It puts investors with real financial \ninterests, not professional plaintiffs with one or two shares of stock, \nin charge of the case.\n  Second, it requires notification to investors that a lawsuit has been \nfiled so that all investors can decide if they really want to bring a \nlawsuit. It is likely that people trusted to manage pension funds and \nmutual funds, that is, institutional investors, will get more involved \nunder this new system. Actually, at this point, for the most part, they \nsit on the sidelines and let the class action lawsuit affecting them \nproceed, managed by the lawyer that filed it and the plaintiffs that \nwere with them.\n  Third, this bill puts the lawyer and his clients on the same side. \nReforms that change the economics of cases, proportionate liability, \nsettlement terms and disclosure, are part of that.\n  Fourth, it prohibits special side deals where pet plaintiffs get \n$10,000, $15,000, or $20,000 for their part in a suit. It protects all \ninvestors, not just the lawyers' pet plaintiffs so that settlements \nwill be fair to all investors.\n  Fifth, it stops brokers from selling names of investors to lawyers.\n  Sixth, it creates an environment where those running our \ncorporations, CEO's or chairmen of the board, can and will talk about \ntheir predictions about the future without fear of being sued every \ntime they make a prediction that turns out to be not exactly what \nhappens to the company or somewhat off the mark. So it gives investors \na system with better disclosure of important information. And this has \nto do with safe harbor, which will be discussed later today as we \nproceed with this bill.\n  Seventh, it provides better disclosure of how much a shareholder \nmight get under a settlement and how much the lawyers will get so that \nshareholders can challenge excessive lawyers' fees.\n  Eighth, it prohibits secret settlements where attorneys can keep \ntheir fees a secret. This is a restriction on settlements under seal.\n  Ninth, limits the amount that attorneys can take off the top. Limits \nattorney's fees to a reasonable amount instead of the confusing \ncalculations which are currently part of this system we want to amend \nand modify.\n  Tenth, provides a uniform rule about what constitutes a legitimate \nlawsuit. So that it will no longer matter where a case is filed. \nInvestors in Albuquerque, N.M.; Atlanta, GA; New York City; or \nNashville, TN, will have the same rules as investors in any of the \nother cities. That is pleading reform. It stops fishing expeditions \nwhere lawyers can force thousands of dollars, worth of discovery money \nand demand thousands of company documents before a judge can decide if \nthe complaint really states a cause of action, so that it might be \ndismissed before the costs of discovery are ever incurred.\n  Eleventh, the last two make merit matter so that strong cases recover \nmore than weak cases. It makes sure that people committing fraud \ncompensate victims. It improves upon the current system so that victims \nwill recover more than 6 cents on a dollar.\n  Twelfth, it will weed out frivolous cases. It gives lawyers and \njudges more time to do a good job to protect investors in meritorious \ncases. High-technology company executives can focus on running their \ncompanies and growing their businesses. Investors will get higher stock \nprices and bigger dividends.\n  This Senate bill, S. 240, which is before us does exactly what \nChairman Arthur Levitt said the system should do--protect all \ninvestors, not just a few.\n  Having said that, obviously there are groups of Americans that may be \nconsidered to be more vulnerable than others in the American profile of \npeople, but let me talk a little bit about senior citizen investors and \nwhat we were able to find out about what they want and what they do not \nwant.\n  In March 1995, the National Investor Relations Institute commissioned \na poll of Americans age 50 and over who invest in either stock or \nmutual funds.\n  Eighty-seven percent said they worried that lawsuits are diverting \nresources that could be used on product research and business expansion \nto create jobs; 79 percent said defendants should only pay damage \nawards according to their percentage of fault, the very issue that is \npartially at stake in the Sarbanes amendment; 81 percent said they \nwould like to see mandatory penalties against lawyers who aid in \nbringing a frivolous suit; 70 percent said the lawyer of a frivolous \nlawsuit should pay the legal fees of both sides; 70 percent said at \nleast one member of their household was a member of the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons.\n  I state that because this is what they think when asked about these \nsubjects. Yet, the AARP seems somewhat on the other side, although it \nis hard to tell exactly what it is they want.\n  Those polls are correct. The Banking Committee record backs up the \nopinions of senior citizen investors.\n  Eighty-seven percent of senior citizen investors said lawsuits are \ndiverting resources that could be used on product research and business \nexpansion to create jobs. They are right. The Banking Committee hearing \nrevealed, and I can go through a whole series of situations where \nprecisely what that concern is, is revealed case by case by small- and \nmedium-size and startup American companies.\n  John Doerr, venture capitalist was involved in three law suits: \nSettlement, $66 million; legal fees to defend, $12 million; management \ntime, 20 person years, total over 10 years, $120 million.\n  The sum of $120 million will employ 200 first-rate engineers for a \ndecade, creating faster, cheaper better products.\n  John G. Adler, CEO Adaptec, litigation costs of the ``million dollar \nfishing expedition'' would have paid for 20 additional engineers.\n  Dennis W. Bakke, AES spent an amount equal to one-half its annual \nbudget for developing new power project throughout the world. Just one \nplant creates 1,300 jobs and $4 billion in economic activity.\n  D increased sevenfold over last decade. Adept Technology, the only \nU.S. robotics company, pays $450,000 for $5 million in D insurance. A \nsimilar Canadian company pays $40,000 for a $4 million policy.\n  The litigation tax represents a team of five or six engineers, a new \nproduct or new technology.\n  Ed McCracken, CEO Silicon Graphics: current system is ``uncontrolled \ntax'' on innovation that is ``impacting real creation of jobs.''\n  Seventy-nine percent of senior citizen investors say defendants \nshould pay the damage award according to percentage of default. They \nare right. Present and former SEC Chairmen Levitt, Breeden, and Ruder \nagree with them, so do former SEC Commissioners Beese and Sommer.\n  Under current law, someone who is only 1 percent responsible can be \nmade to pay the entire amount, the entire judgment, the entire award. \nBreeden, former SEC Chairman, called the present system ``inverted, \ndisproportionate liability.'' Parties who are central to perpetrating a \nfraud often pay little, if anything. At the same time, those whose \ninvolvement might be only peripheral and lacked any deliberation or any \nknowing participation in the fraud often pay most of the damage.\n  Joint and several is the engine that drives abusive securities \nlawsuits. Plaintiffs' class action lawyers know this and use it to \nextract settlements. We should not turn professionals into insurers. We \nshould not turn accounting firms, lawyers, and others who are the \nprofessionals involved in securities into insurers. Inclusion of deep \npocket defendants increase the likelihood of settlement. Including an \naccounting firm or underwriter, they might add about one-third to the \nexpected settlement value of the case. That is what the National \nEconomic Research Associate study said.\n  One accounting firm was sued for $200 million, paid $999,000 in \nsettlement, spent $8.4 million in defense in a case growing out of \ngross fees to that firm\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\nof $91,000. No auditors for high-technology companies; hard-to-find \ndirectors--all of these things are happening--no choice but to settle. \nThese are qualities that the current system is creating in our economic \nenvironment. No auditors for high-technology companies; hard-to-find \ndirectors; no choice but to settle.\n  These cases have a settlement rate between 85 and 95 percent. This is \nbecause no one can chance going to trial. The settlement rate for most \ncivil litigation is 40 to 45 percent, a huge difference in these kinds \nof cases. Limiting joint and several liability will significantly \nreduce the number of frivolous suits brought against defendants who \nhave done nothing wrong but are seen as deep pockets. One of the most \nactive plaintiff class action lawyers wrote:\n\n       Class actions are judicial monstrosities.\n\n  Enacting two-tiered liability will make sure we have fewer frivolous \njudicial monstrosities. This bill, S. 240, would retain current law for \ndefendants who engage in knowing fraud. So when we speak of safe harbor \nand proportionate liability, let us understand that in this new law, \ndefendants who engage in knowing fraud are liable for the entire amount \nand there is no safe harbor for them. Other defendants who have some \nculpability are responsible for their share of the judgment, with two \nexceptions, and they are two items we are speaking about on the floor \ntoday.\n  Small investors: All defendants are jointly and severally liable for \nsmall investors; that is, a net worth of $200,000 or less who lost 10 \npercent or more of their net worth.\n  In a very real sense, what we are doing there is providing some \ninsurance for them and saying that this system ought to provide that \nkind of insurance.\n  Also, in the case of insolvent codefendants, we say the solvent \ndefendants must make an additional payment up to 50 percent of their \nown liability.\n  All of these were efforts to make this bill unquestionably fair and \nfair-intentioned.\n  Let us move on to 81 percent of the senior citizen investors said \nthey would like to see mandatory penalties against lawyers who aid in \nbringing frivolous suits; 70 percent said the loser of a frivolous suit \nshould pay the legal fees of both sides. S. 240 makes a modest step to \ndo what the seniors want and what they want us to do. It makes the \njudges--and I repeat, it makes the judges--look closer at these cases \nand to discipline lawyers who file frivolous suits.\n  Whenever one of these lawsuits is finished, dismissed, settled, or \ntaken to trial, the judge is required to make a determination regarding \nall attorneys: Did the attorneys comply with rule 11? Did the case have \nsome basis? Did the defense have some basis? If not, the judge must \nimpose penalties, and if the judge finds that rule 11 was violated, the \ncase was frivolous and the case was thrown out of court on a motion to \ndismiss, the presumption is the class action attorney will pay the \nprevailing attorney's legal fees. That is a far cry from loser pay but \na small step in the direction of trying to get what 81 percent of the \nsenior citizen investors said, and that is bring some accountability to \nlawyers who file frivolous lawsuits in this area of the law.\n  Seniors in the poll thought Congress should go further. Frankly, I \nwould have preferred something stronger, but this is a good compromise \nand it ought to be retained and clearly will be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Seventy percent of the senior investors said at least one member of \ntheir households was a member of the AARP. AARP wrote the committee a \nletter on May 24. They oppose loser pay even though the poll showed \nseniors said it was a good idea. The bill has no loser pay provision. \nIt has the provisions I have just described.\n  They oppose proportionate liability, yet the seniors polled thought \nit was a good idea. Any attempt to raise scienter knowledge from the \nstandard of reckless to intentional omissions. The bill does not alter \nthe conduct actionable under the securities law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 additional minutes. They added to \ntheir opposition a concern about safe harbor which we will discuss \nlater.\n  I ask that as part of my discussion here this morning with the \nSenate, that these poll results in detail be printed in the Record. \nThey are only 2\\1/2\\ pages long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNew Poll Finds Senior American Investors Support Securities Litigation \n                                 Reform\n\n       Washington, March 22.--By an overwhelming margin, Americans \n     aged 50 and over who invest in stocks or mutual funds say \n     they favor legislation that would make it harder for lawyers \n     to file frivolous securities lawsuits against America's high \n     growth companies.\n       Nearly seven out of ten investors surveyed say they favor \n     legal reforms to crack down on lawsuit abuse. According to a \n     new survey conducted by Public Opinion Strategies for The \n     National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), eight out of \n     ten (81 percent) say they would like to see mandatory \n     penalties against lawyers ``who aid in bringing a frivolous \n     lawsuit''; more than two-thirds (70 percent) say the loser of \n     a frivolous suit should pay the legal fees of both sides; and \n     79 percent say defendants should only pay damage awards \n     according to their percentage of fault. Only 21 percent of \n     those polled oppose litigation reform.\n       The survey, completed shortly after a 325-99 bipartisan \n     vote by the House of Representatives for securities \n     litigation reform, was released in advance of Senate \n     consideration of reform measures.\n       It shows that older investors are concerned that excessive \n     lawsuits hurt American competitiveness. Some (87 percent) say \n     they worry that lawsuits are diverting resources that could \n     be used on product research and business expansion to create \n     jobs.\n       A similar number (88 percent) believe lawyers, not \n     shareholders, are the primary beneficiaries of securities \n     lawsuits.

Thompson, NIRI President & CEO, said the survey \n     demonstrates that many American investors are concerned that \n     lawsuits erode the value of their investment savings as they \n     near retirement age. More than one-third of those polled are \n     age 65 or older and 70 percent said that at least one member \n     of their household was a member of the American Association \n     of Retired Persons.\n       ``Frivolous lawsuits pose a direct threat to the financial \n     well being of those Americans who are investing for their \n     future, including retirement,'' Thompson said. ``These \n     lawsuits don't just target companies, they paste a bulls eye \n     on American investors.''\n       Survey respondents also say stock price declines are a \n     normal investment risk and not, by themselves, evidence of \n     fraud or grounds for a lawsuit. Only 15 percent say an annual \n     decline of 50 percent in a stock's value was grounds for a \n     lawsuit, and only one in ten believe a 10 percent decline in \n     a few days is grounds for legal action. However, 85 percent \n     say a company that knowingly provides false information to \n     investors should be sued.\n       The survey of 800 American investors aged 50 or above was \n     conducted by Public Opinion Strategies on March 18-21. The \n     survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent. \n     All those surveyed reported investments in stocks or mutual \n     funds. Copies of the full study can be obtained by calling \n     NIRI at 703-506-3570.\n       The National Investor Relations Institute, now in its 25th \n     year, is a professional association of 2,650 corporate \n     officers and investor relations consultants responsible for \n     communication between corporate management, shareholders, \n     security analysts and other financial publics.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 240 is good for small investors. \nInvestor empowerment increases control over lawsuits and settlements. \nThe current system involves class members who sign on the dotted line \nto claim their share of a settlement or recovery, usually amounting to \n6 to 8 cents on the dollar. Investors receive also insufficient \nsettlement information.\n  Lawyers often compromise the classes' best interests to maximize \nlawyer\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nfees. Example: In the Prudential Insurance case, the attorneys wanted \nto settle for $37 million. The California securities director, Gary \nMendoza, objected, and got the class $90 million. Then they wanted to \nbase their fees on the bigger settlement, even though they originally \nwere willing to settle the case for much less.\n  The bill shifts some of the power in these cases from the \nentrepreneurial class action attorneys to the people who have an \nexpertise in managing retirement funds and other members of the class \nwho are not ``pet plaintiffs.'' It also vests more power in the judges \nwho have to be the final arbiter of these cases, including the money \nthat goes to the lawyers.\n  It requires lawyers to actually locate plaintiffs who genuinely are \naggrieved before filing the suit. Notice of settlement proposals have \nto be sent to the class, be in a user-friendly format which they can \nunderstand, provide clear and specific information relevant to \ninvestors' decision whether to accept settlement, challenge legal fees, \nopt out or say no thanks.\n  Under the current system, individuals can be bound by the settlement \nwithout knowing anything about it. But under S. 240 investors will get \na phone number to call for information, and we can go on with more and \nmore details that make this a good bill for the investors of this \ncountry. Small investors, large investors, institutional investors, I \nhope, will be playing a more significant role in the future as we move \nto the courts of our land on these kinds of class action suits.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement I have \nprepared regarding millions of dollars for the lawyers and coupons for \nthe plaintiffs be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Millions for Lawyers, Coupons for Plaintiffs\n\n       Members of the plaintiff class each received a $400 \n     nontransferable coupon good for a year toward a new Ford in \n     litigation concerning leaky roofs in Ford Mustangs. The \n     lawyers received about $1 million in fees and expenses and \n     ``A Fistful of Coupons,'' New York Times, May 26, 1995.\n       Professors are known for their academic temperament. \n     Professors are thoughtful and scholarly in their writings.\n       Professor John Coffee of Columbia Law School wrote about \n     class action lawsuits where the plaintiffs get coupons and \n     the lawyer takes the cash:\n       ``These script settlements tend to be used by lawyers who \n     are not zealous on behalf of the class.''\n       Plaintiffs weren't so scholarly in their commentary:\n       ``The whole idea that the lawyer collects a million and the \n     person collects nothing is the most asinine thing that I have \n     ever heard.''\n       This plaintiff class would have benefited from S. 240: Most \n     adequate plaintiff; disclosure of settlement terms; and \n     attorney fee reform.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Proportionate liability. According to Arthur Levitt, \nthe current system is bad for all investors. So let me talk about that \nfor a minute. Creating a sound liability scheme is a balancing \nexercise, all investors versus the plaintiffs' class action lawyers and \ninvestors who happen to be plaintiffs in the case. Investors who are \nplaintiffs get 6 to 14 cents on the dollar. The current system \nobviously is not working very well and, clearly, litigation has an \nadverse impact on investors and on businesses.\n  The current system is working even worse than many think. Investors \nare harmed when their company is frivolously sued. Stock prices are \ndepressed. Dividends are less than they would have been, and management \nis sidetracked and loses much energy in figuring out what to do with a \nlawsuit instead of making the company work, grow, and prosper. Small \ncompanies cannot obtain outside directors and professional advisers; \ndirectors' and officers' insurance gets more and more expensive. That \nmeans they pay less for their company's activities. There would be \nsmaller raises, fewer new jobs, and fewer new products.\n  Arthur Levitt, in his April 6 written testimony, after discussing the \ninterest in compensating plaintiff/investors, said:\n\n       The Commission recognizes that there are competing policy \n     considerations that are also derived from concern with the \n     long-term interests of investors.\n\n  It is true that Chairman Levitt has made what I consider \n``sequentially evolving statements.'' His three most recent \npronouncements indicate that he disagrees with the premise of the \nSarbanes amendment that joint and several liability is always \nappropriate when a codefendant is insolvent.\n  Arthur Levitt supports modifying joint and several liability in \ncertain contexts. Support for a two-tier liability system is one \nmodification and S. 240 is a two-tier system.\n  In response to questions from Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes during \nthe April 6 hearing, Arthur Levitt said:\n\n       I think in those instances where conduct was willful fraud \n     or in those instances where we're talking about an issuer, \n     that joint and several liability should still apply.\n\n  The bill retains joint and several liability for knowing fraud.\n  Arthur Levitt said further:\n\n       I think when we're talking about other instances, a \n     proportionate liability scheme that was limited to fraud on \n     the market cases where the conduct may have been reckless, I \n     believe that would be a fair way of balancing it.\n\n  A May 25 letter to Chairman D'Amato identifying problems with the \ncommittee print did not mention joint and several liability.\n  In the SEC's submission to OMB, they did not oppose the joint and \nseveral provision of S. 240 and did not argue for change sought by this \namendment.\n  The SEC did not indicate any dissatisfaction with the way \nresponsibility is allocated in the event of an insolvent codefendant.\n  Jane Bryant Quinn's article in Newsweek endorses proportionate \nliability.\n  We have to be concerned about real world effect of these litigation \nrules.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boston Globe \neditorial called ``Stock Response,'' in which they end up saying the \nbill, as modified, before the Senate is a bill that should be adopted, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From the Boston Globe]\n\n                             Stock Response\n\n       Younger, high-tech Massachusetts corporations give the \n     state much of its economic vitality. But their volatility has \n     provided fodder for litigants who exploit weaknesses in tort \n     law to make extra bucks from the vulnerable. A bill now \n     moving through Congress would tighten terms under which suits \n     could be brought against corporations when performance fails \n     to match expectations. It would also reverse the trend toward \n     reducing information available to genuine investors.\n       So-called strike suits sometimes follow sharp drops in \n     stock prices associated with unexpected bad news, usually \n     failure to meet predicted performance in sales or profits. \n     Such disappointments are more frequent among newer \n     corporations that are often dependent on a single product or \n     a narrow range of products. Performances are apt to be \n     erratic, and the loss of a single customer can inflict \n     serious but temporary injury to sales figures.\n       Enterprising lawyers specializing in identifying such \n     situations sometimes team with stockholders--some with minor \n     stakes--to bring quick suits when company officers had \n     predicted better results. Too often it is the business \n     equivalent of suing your tout sheet, or maybe the horse, if \n     you lose money at the track. Managements frequently settle \n     rather than engage in costly litigation, even though they \n     might ultimately win at trial. Furthermore, they have become \n     increasingly wary of making any projections, to the detriment \n     of the full disclosure that underlies a free market.\n       A move to make such suits more difficult while protecting \n     shareholders from fraud by unscrupulous managements has been \n     evolving in Congress for three years. It permits managements, \n     with important exceptions, to make forward-looking \n     projections that identify risks involved.\n       Recent improvements in the bill have eliminated a loser-\n     pays provision that would have chilled legitimate challenges \n     to management practices, an important concession that \n     preserves shareholder rights. It is essential that this \n     protection be preserved in the conference committee as the \n     bill inches toward final passage.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, State and local officials support \nreform. There are about 14 quotes from State officials who support it.\n  Mr. President, supporters of the securities litigation--we have about \nfour sheets of them. And I just would like to call to the attention of \nthe Senate in submitting these that State pension fund administrators \nand regulators from the States of Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, and \nCalifornia are among those State supporters from the State regulatory \nside.\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of these be made a part of the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Overwhelming Consensus in Favor of Securities Litigation Reform\n\n\n                         investors want reform\n\n       There is no denying that there are real problems in the \n     current system--problems that need to be addressed not just \n     because of abstract rights and responsibilities, but because \n     investors and markets are being hurt by litigation \n     excesses.--SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt (``Between Caveat \n     Emptor and Caveat Vendor: The Middle Group of Litigation \n     Reform,'' Remarks at the 22nd Annual Securities Regulation \n     Institute, January 25, 1995).\n       Most shareholder suits are brought by people who care \n     little, if at all, for shareholders as a group. The \n     plaintiffs and their lawyers make grant statements about the \n     integrity of the markets, but the primary motivation--and the \n     primary outcome--is their own returns. Typically, plaintiffs \n     get a small award, and their lawyers get a large one.--Nell \n     Minow, LENS, Inc. (``Time to Wake the Sleeping Bear,'' Legal \n     Times, February 13, 1995).\n       Our nation's securities laws were enacted to protect \n     investors and to improve our capital markets. However, the \n     perverse incentive of attorneys to file meritless claims has \n     created the exact opposite of the intended effects of our \n     securities laws. Abusive lawsuits triggered by a small group \n     of lawyers, inflict tremendous harm on our nation's financial \n     system and on the individuals and organizations drawn into \n     them.--Richard A. Eckstom, State Treasurer, South Carolina \n     (Letter to Sen. Hollings, April 17, 1995).\n       . . . [T]he current system is not working and needs reform. \n     Under our current system, defrauded investors are receiving \n     too little compensation while plaintiffs' lawyers take the \n     lion's share of any settlement.--Managers of Ten Pension \n     Funds representing: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation \n     Authority; The Teachers Retirement System of Texas; New York \n     City Pension Funds; Champion International Pension Plan; The \n     Connecticut Retirement and Trust Funds; The Oregon Public \n     Employees Retirement System; The State of Wisconsin \n     Investment Board; State Universities Retirement System of \n     Illinois; Eastman Kodak Retirement Plan and The Washington \n     State Investment Board (Letter to Sen. Dodd and Sen. \n     Dominici, July, 1994).\n       [T]he amount of damages that plaintiffs have typically \n     recovered represents only a percentage of their initial \n     claim; but the lawyers who bring the claim extract \n     substantial fees from any lawsuit filed. A system that was \n     intended to protect investors now primarily benefits their \n     lawyers.--J. Kenneth Blackwell, Treasurer, State of Ohio \n     (Letter to Sen. D'Amato, March 10, 1995).\n       Because shareholders are on both sides of this litigation, \n     it merely transfers wealth from one group of shareholders to \n     another. However, it wastes millions of dollars in company \n     resources for legal expenses and other transaction costs that \n     otherwise could be invested to yield higher returns for \n     company investors.--Judy Baar Topinka, State Treasurer, State \n     of Illinois (Letter to Sen. Moseley-Braun, March 16, 1995).\n       Investors are also being harmed by the current system, as \n     it shortchanges people who are victimized by real fraud . . . \n     The plaintiffs' lawyers who specialize in these cases profit \n     from brining as many cases as possible and quickly settling \n     them, regardless of the merits. Valid claims are being \n     undercompensated in the current system because lawyers have \n     less incentive to vigorously pursue them.--Janet C. \n     Rzewnicki, Treasurer, State of Delaware (Letter to Sen. \n     D'Amato, March 21, 1995).\n       The current situation in the law permits and even \n     encourages the filing of lawsuits with very little merit \n     against corporations. The benefits derived from these suits \n     are going primarily to attorneys. However, the payments are \n     actually coming from the pockets of serious, lifetime owners \n     of the corporations like our members.--Thomas E. O'Hara, \n     Chairman, National Association of Investors Corporation \n     (Letter to Sen. Dodd, July 19, 1994).\n       Nearly seven out of ten investors surveyed say they favor \n     legal reforms to crack down on lawsuit abuse. According to a \n     new survey conducted by Public Opinion Strategies for the \n     National Investor Relations institute, . . . [s]ome (87 \n     percent) say they worry that lawsuits are diverting resources \n     that could be used on product research and business expansion \n     to create jobs. A similar number (88 percent) believe \n     lawyers, not shareholders, are the primary beneficiaries of \n     lawsuits.--National Investor Relations Institute (Press \n     Release, March 22, 1995).\n       The system of penalties and incentives contemplated by \n     Congress is turned upside down. The winners in these suits \n     are invariable lawyers who collect huge contingency fees, \n     professional ``plaintiffs'' who collect bonuses and, in cases \n     where fraud has been committee, executives and board members \n     who use corporate funds and corporate owned insurance \n     policies to escape personal liability. The one constant is \n     that the shareholders pay for it all.--Ralph V. Whitworth, \n     President, United Shareholders Association (Testimony before \n     the Securities Subcommittee, Senate Banking Committee, July \n     23, 1993).\n       We are ones who are hurt if a system allows someone to \n     force us to spend huge sums of money in legal costs by merely \n     paying ten dollars and filing a meritless cookie cutter \n     complaint against a company or its accountants when that \n     plaintiff is disappointed in his or her investment. Our \n     pensions and jobs depend on our employment by and investment \n     in our companies. If we saddle our companies with big and \n     unproductive costs that other countries do not pay, we cannot \n     be surprised if our jobs and raises begin to disappear and \n     our pensions come up short as the population ages.--Mayellen \n     Andersen, Investor and Corporate Relations Director, \n     Connecticut Retirement and Trusts Funds (Testimony before the \n     Senate Banking Securities Subcommittee, July 21, 1993).\n       Shareholders . . . are likely to realize only a small \n     percentage of their claims and have little active involvement \n     in the lawsuit. Plaintiff's attorneys are clearly in the \n     drivers seat.--Kurt N. Schacht, General Counsel, State of \n     Wisconsin Investment Board (Letter to Sen. Domenici, \n     September 27, 1993).\n       [T]he plaintiffs typically recover only a small percentage \n     of their claim, as the lawyers extract large fees for \n     bringing the suit. A system that was intended to protect \n     investors now seems to benefit the lawyers.--Bill Owens, \n     State Treasurer, State of Colorado (Letter to Sen. D'Amato, \n     April 19, 1995).\n       The concern about, and the reaction to, meritless lawsuits \n     has caused industry, as well as accounting, law and insurance \n     companies, to increase their costs with price tags ultimately \n     paid by the consumer and the investing public, including a \n     large percentage of our retirees and pension holders.--Joseph \n     D. Malone, Treasurer and Receiver General, Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts (Letter to Sen. D'Amato, March 22, 1995).\n       [M]eritless litigations cost companies millions of \n     dollars--money that could be generating greater profit for \n     the company and higher returns for investors.--Jim Hill, \n     Treasurer, State of Oregon (Letter to Sen. Dodd and Sen. \n     Domenici, June 21, 1994).\n       I believe there is a compelling need to reform the current \n     system of securities litigation. The problem with the current \n     system is two-fold. First, the current system too often \n     promotes the filing of meritless claims. Perhaps more \n     importantly, the current system does not adequately serve the \n     interest it is designed to protect--the interests of \n     defrauded investors.--Gary S. Mendoza, Commissioner of \n     Corporations, State of California (Letter to Representative \n     Fields, February 9, 1995).\n       Investors will be the beneficiaries of meaningful reform. \n     The current system fails to distinguish cases of actual fraud \n     from frivolous cases. Typical class members receive less than \n     $.14 for their losses. A system where private attorneys have \n     an incentive to seek out cases of genuine fraud and litigate \n     them to conclusion will compensate investors properly and \n     will not coerce settlements which are paid by the \n     shareholders of innocent companies.--Christopher J. Murphy, \n     Chairman, Association of Publicly Traded Companies (Testimony \n     before the Securities Subcommittee, Senate Banking Committee, \n     March 2, 1995, at 1).\n       [We] are all victims. The mere threat of a securities suit \n     makes us reluctant to provide the marketplace with voluntary \n     disclosures. This impedes the efficiency of the marketplace \n     by preventing investors from receiving full and complete \n     information. Investors are harmed because investment \n     decisions will not be made on a fully informed basis and \n     their stocks will be improperly valued. . . . Please help us \n     turn the securities litigation system right side up by \n     putting investors first and plaintiffs' attorneys last.--219 \n     California High Tech Executives (Letter to Dianne Feinstein, \n     July 21, 1994).\n       Much has been said about the fact that investors receive \n     little, ``pennies on the dollar'', in terms of the actual \n     settlement between the company and plaintiffs' attorneys. \n     However, just as important is the point that the vast number \n     of investors lost in these cases because during the period an \n     emerging growth company is being sued its stock becomes \n     moribund. Investors, large and small, are forced to wait the \n     process out, sell off at a price that does not accurately \n     reflect the company's true status and potential or exert \n     pressure on company officials to settle the suit regardless \n     of the fact that the suit is meritless.--James Morgan, \n     President, National Venture Capital Association (Testimony \n     before the Securities Subcommittee, Senate Banking, March 2, \n     1995, at 7).\n       Investors are ill-served by the present system. Because \n     issuers fear abusive litigation, they have sharply curtailed \n     the amount of information they are willing to disclose, \n     leaving investors without information essential for \n     intelligent decision making. To the detriment of \n     shareholders, abusive securities litigation distracts \n     companies from their principal tasks, discourages the \n     development of new businesses and inhibits sound risk taking. \n     Finally, the existing litigation system encourages suit \n     regardless of merit and cost forces defendants to settle \n     regardless of merit.--Lynn D. Dudley, Director of Retirement \n     Policy, Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans \n     (Letter to Sen. Domenici and Sen. Dodd, March 17, 1995).\n       [M]eritless law class actions have skyrocketed. The need to \n     defend unfounded litigation imposes a ``litigation tax'' on \n     capital formation that must ultimately be paid by the \n     investing public.--Marc E. Lackritz, President, Securities \n     Industry Association\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\n     (Testimony before the Securities Subcommittee, Senate Banking \n     Committee, March 2, 1995, at 3).\n       If a suit is filed, it should be to redress a legitimate \n     wrong. If a company pays a settlement, it should be because \n     the company did something wrong. If an injured investor sues, \n     that investor should get more than a few cents on the dollar. \n     I think it is fair to say that the views I express today are \n     held by a majority of institutional investors.--Joh Lukomnik, \n     Deputy Comptroller, City of New York (Testifying before the \n     Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, House Energy \n     and Commerce Committee, August 10, 1994).\n\n\n              managers of private or public pension funds\n\n       Champion International Pension Plan: Champion International \n     Pension Plan controls over $1.8 billion in total assets.\n       Connecticut Retirement and Trust Fund: The Connecticut \n     Retirement and Trust Fund invests over $11 billion on behalf \n     of over 140,000 employees and beneficiaries.\n       Eastman Kodak Retirement Plan: Eastman Kodak Retirement \n     Plan manages over $10.9 billion in total assets and is ranked \n     as one of the largest 60 pension plans in the U.S.\n       Massachusetts Bay Transportation Association: With over \n     12,000 participants, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation \n     Association controls over $772 million in total assets.\n       New York City Pension Funds: Over $49 billion have been \n     invested in the fund to insure the retirement security of \n     227,000 retirees and 130,000 vested employees.\n       Oregon Public Employees' Retirement System: Assets \n     controlled by the fund total over $17.2 billion.

What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes, 30 seconds, with 6 \nminutes 48 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 5 minutes. I say to my colleague that I \nlistened carefully to his statement and it really does not address this \namendment. The statement really addresses the overall bill and the \nprovisions of the overall bill.\n  There were some of the points he made with which I agree and some \nwith which I disagree, but it did not really get to the question of the \namendment before us. We had the debate on Friday on the joint and \nseveral issue, on Thursday night and Friday on the broad principle. We \nare now addressing the provision that is in the bill.\n  I want the Senator to explain to me the fairness or equity--\nobviously, the proponents of this legislation have recognized a \nnecessity to protect the small unsophisticated investor. What they have \nprovided is that if a plaintiff has a net worth of less than $200,000, \nhe will be regarded as such a person--$200,000. This, by their own \nstatement, includes all of the plaintiff's financial assets, including \nstocks, bonds, real estate, and jewelry. So if you own a home, that is \ngoing to get an awful lot of people close to the $200,000 right there. \nBut in addition, it would be bad enough if they said if your net worth \nis $200,000 or less--you have to have a net worth of $200,000 or less \nin order to be fully protected. If you are slightly above that figure, \nyou do not get full protection.\n  In addition, there is also a requirement that to be fully protected \non recoverable damages, you have to have lost more than 10 percent of \nyour net worth by this fraudulent scheme. So, in other words, if you \nare at the $200,000 figure, you have to have lost more than $20,000 in \norder to be fully protected. Why should someone who has a net worth of \nonly $200,000 not be fully protected if they get caught in a fraudulent \nscheme and they lose $12,000? Or $15,000? Or $18,000? Where is the \nequity or the fairness in that?\n  If you are going to limit the small people--I think the limit is too \ngreat at $200,000, but this amendment does not address that part of the \nprovision that is in the bill. This amendment addresses the provision \nthat in addition to being limited to a $200,000 net worth, you have to \nhave lost more than 10 percent of your net financial worth if you are \ngoing to be fully protected in recovering your damages.\n  The small people are really going to be hit hard. The small people \nare really going to be hit hard because someone who has a $200,000 net \nworth, but only $5,000 of risk, loses it all.\n  We say, ``Well, that is too bad. You will not get full protection.''\n  I cannot, for the moment, begin to understand the equity of that \nprovision, and therefore the amendment that I have sent to the desk \nseeks to change that in order to provide additional protection for the \nsmall, unsophisticated investors who have been recognized in this bill \nas requiring some form of special protection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the Senator for this amendment. I wonder \nif the Senator has seen the extraordinary list of national, State, \ncounty, and local public officials--it is really from A to W, from \nAlabama to Wyoming--that opposes this bill in its current form.\n  I say to my friend that if some of these amendments are passed, this \nis going to make a great difference to a lot of these people, and I \nthink to this administration, and certainly to this Senator.\n  We have the Government Finance Officers Association against it, the \nMunicipal Treasurers Association of the United States against it, the \nNational League of Cities, the National Association of County \nTreasurers and Finance Officers, the North American Security \nAdministrators Association, and attorneys general from all over the \ncountry, including, I notice, from New Mexico and others.\n  These are people that do not have an ax to grind. I wonder if my \nfriend has seen this incredible list. It is 10 pages, single spaced, of \nall the people who oppose this bill, and I have not even mentioned the \nconsumer groups on this issue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am not sure I have seen the list, but I hope the \nSenator will include it in the Record so your colleagues will have the \nbenefit of seeing the list.\n  We have a clash amongst interest groups, no question about it. We \nhave a group of lawyers who very much are involved in the securities \nlitigation which my colleagues on the other side say are abusing the \nexisting system. They are trying to address that. We also have a lot of \ncorporate people who want to shield themselves from liability on the \nother hand.\n  So we have vested economic interests coming from both directions, \nmost of the judgment coming from groups that have no vested interest in \nit, questioning the provisions of this bill as being excessive and as \ngoing too far.\n  As the article in the New York Times on Sunday by Mark Griffin, the \ndirector of the Utah Securities Division, states:\n\n       What's in the name? In the case of Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995, consumers will find a world-\n     class misnomer now before the Senate. The bill is more \n     accurately described as securities litigation repeal.\n\n  In effect, what we have is a situation in which this is excessive; it \ngoes too far. Even the proponents recognize that it went too far. They \nput this provision in that I am now trying to change, in a rather \nmodest way, in order to make it have some meaning, rather than being \nalmost meaningless.\n  It has a double requirement. You have to be below $200,000 net worth, \nand you have to lose 10 percent of your net worth. If you are some \nsmall, unsophisticated person with very limited means, below $200,000 \nnet worth--that is, your house, your jewelry, your real estate, any \nstocks or bonds that you own, all of that added up gets you below \n$200,000--you would think at least we will protect that person fully, \nfully protect them.\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\n  Oh, no, no. In addition to having to be below the $200,000 net worth, \nyou have to lose in this stock swindle more than 10 percent of your net \nworth. If your net worth is $195,000, all these things added up, you \nhave to lose more than $19,500.\n  Suppose you are a small investor with a net worth of $195,000, all of \nthese things I enumerated. Someone talks you into making an investment. \nA lot of elderly people get fast-talked on the telephone or in person \nand make an investment of $5,000. They lose it; they lose it. The stock \nswindler goes bust, flees. There is no recovery there. The people \nadvise the stock swindler, who were participants in the fraud on a \nreckless standard--on a reckless standard, the stock swindlers, \nlawyers, accountants, investment advisor, people drawn into this \nthing--they are protected ahead of this innocent investor who has lost \n$5,000. I cannot understand it.\n  I said before that this is a ``have-you-no-shame amendment,'' I say \nto my colleagues on the other side with respect to what you are doing \nto these small investors. Senators recognize the problem of the small \ninvestor, the unsophisticated person, and fail to adequately give them \nany protection, is what it amounts to.\n  That is a very important aspect. I would like to get the response \nfrom the other side focused on the provisions of the amendment. All we \ndo, we put the amendments forward, and then we hear a statement about \nthe bill as a whole.\n  We said earlier, at the very beginning of the debate, that we accept \ncertain aspects of this bill. The real question now is on the \namendments which go to particular provisions in the legislation.\n  I yield the floor. Perhaps we can get a focus on this particular \namendment and its provisions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator knows \nthat I was one of the Senators, along with Senator Dodd, that \nintroduced this legislation. I did not serve on the Banking Committee \nwhen this legislation was marked up.\n  Let me see if I can explain. I do not have any apologies for this. I \nthink the committee went, in one sense, too far. We are here to say, \n``Okay, that is fine.'' Here is the theory: The Senator now would like \nto say this bill has gone a long way to try to get rid of the problems \nthat joint and several liability brings to this kind of class action \nsuit.\n  Now, if one does not believe that joint and several has created any \nproblems for deep pockets who are almost in an infinitesimal amount \ninvolved in this case and makes them liable for the whole thing; if one \ndoes not believe that the accountants are not necessarily as liable \nunless knowingly participating in the fraud, that they should not be \nliable for the whole settlement or the whole verdict, if one does not \nbelieve that, obviously, those Senators ought to be for the Sarbanes \namendment.\n  If a Member is for changing that--and I spent a considerable amount \nof time, not necessarily as well as it can be done--explaining that the \nunfairness of the application that law to cases of this type by lawyers \nin America today, if a person does not believe it has been applied \nunfairly, or that it is causing litigation to be filed that is \nmeaningless, putting huge burdens on America's startup companies, if \nMembers do not believe that and they want to go forward, then go with \nSenator Sarbanes.\n  If you want to leave joint and several liability as it is, this \nessentially means no matter how much of the culpability is yours, you \npay the whole amount whatever that amount is. We know what that is \ndoing to the system. It is not helping clean up the system at all.\n  It is causing everybody in the chain of this kind of activity to buy \nhuge insurance policies. We have an example here of one that I put in \nthe Record. If you were in business in the United States, and exactly \nthe same kind of business with exactly the same kind of activity in \nCanada, in one country it would cost $40,000, and in America it would \ncost $450,000.\n  That would not matter to some who do not think it matters what \nbusiness has to pay. If that is a medium-sized business, $450,000 \nversus $40,000 for insurance coverage is a pretty big deal. It is like \nsix to eight full-time engineers that could work at one of these \ncompanies. But they pay it in insurance so you can have this liability \nof joint and several. So every board of directors, every official, \neverybody in the company, the CPA's and everyone else, can be liable \nfor the entire malfeasance of one.\n  If you do not agree with that statement, if you do not agree with \nthat position, which is basis of this new bill, S. 240, which \nreformulates class action suits on securities, then you start \nconsidering, who should we exclude? Who should we exclude from what is \nnow perceived to be a more fair system for everybody at large? I would \nassume that if you want to change that joint and several, that you no \nlonger consider each and every possible defendant as the insurer of \nstockholders--whether they are little stockholders or big \nstockholders--they are not the insurer, that they will not lose money \nbecause somebody in the chain of this company did something wrong.\n  So what did the committee do? I say to my fellow Senators, they said \nOK, there could be some situations when we want to provide more than \nthe proportionate liability, when we want to give a little bit of a \nbreak to some small investors who are poor. It did not mean that they \nwere throwing the new system out. In fact, they have gone to great \nlengths in this bill saying the new system of proportionate liability \nwill be better for everyone.\n  The answer to Senator Sarbanes is much the same as one would give if \nwe were on the floor discussing a Federal statute. When I was \npracticing law, if you stole $51 you committed a felony. If you stole \n$48 it was a misdemeanor. So you would come to the floor and say why \n$50? Or why did we not do $80? Or why did we not do $52? Why did we not \ncover the next little step? Just $51 should not be guilty of a felony. \nYou have to draw the line somewhere.\n  So the committee said, we want to take care of a small group of \ninvestors whom this change in the law might affect adversely. So they \ndrew some lines. That is all they did.\n  The Senator would like to draw the lines differently. Of course. The \nSenator from Maryland would like to draw a line very differently. He \nwould like to throw this whole bill out. That is the line he would \nlike. He would like to leave it like it is with maybe a few little soft \namendments. He clearly does not want this bill to pass.\n  From my standpoint, there is no answer to why you draw lines of this \ntype. If you want to have a debate in the Senate and say instead of \n$200,000 worth of net worth it should be $300,000, have the debate. If \nyou want to say it should be $250,000, have the debate. Sooner or later \nyou will draw the line somewhere or you will return to the old law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have not tried to draw the line on the net worth \nissue at all. The Senator says if you want to put it at $250,000 or \n$300,000--I have not tried to change that line. I have not drawn that \nline at all. I have left the line at $200,000.\n  That response does not go to the amendment in any respect.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. So, I answer the Senator's question before he \nfinishes it by saying you delete the requirement that small investors \nlose at least 10 percent of their net worth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You say it does not matter how much they lose of their \nnet worth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am saying if you have a small investor, $200,000 \nworth of net worth--I am not trying to change the Senator's net worth--\nit could be $300,000, could be $100,000--your net worth includes their \nhome, includes everything they have----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So the Senator does not want any?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am saying keep it at $200,000.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But do not require, before they are held harmless they \nlose 10 percent of their net worth. You have someone with a $200,000 \nnet worth, they loose $5,000 and you say, ``Tough.'' That is a small \ninvestor. It is an unsophisticated person who is taking a real \npounding. I am saying, why do you not let them at least collect what \nthey lost? You have limited it to a class of less than $200,000 net \nworth. At least whatever they lose, let them recover.\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say, from this Senator's standpoint, as I \nlook at this law, proportionate liability is fair. It is better for the \nentire system than the joint and several before. And there have been \nhours of statements on the floor on why the new system is better for \nthe country, more fair and all the other things that have been said \nabout it.\n  If you want to start talking about changing that small group of \ninvestors that, somehow or another, the committee in reporting out this \nbill wanted to protect in some way, then I am not going to say the \ncommittee was perfect in every one of its lines. But I do not believe \nwe ought to start with the premise that it is unfair when it could have \nbeen that there would not have been any exceptions, and that would have \nbeen a fair system. They decided to help small investors in some \nspecific way. What they have done is not unfair. It may be unfair to \nyou, Senator, and maybe to enough Senators to vote with you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just point out to the Senator that the notion that it \nwas unfair was encompassed by the Senator when he put his bill in. This \nwas in the bill, put in by the Senator. So the Senator himself departed \nfrom the absolutely rigorous application of moving to proportionate \nliability because he recognized it was not fair.\n  I am just making the point, the way it has been defined makes it so \nrestrictive that these small, unsophisticated investors--which my \ncolleague is asserting he is providing some protection for --are not \ngoing to get protection. I am urging my colleagues to change it in this \nrespect in order to provide protection for these small people.\n  The fact of the matter is, the shift the Senator is doing is he is \nshifting the burden of uncollected damages off of the codefendant, who \nhas abused the system, over to the insolvent defendant, the victim.\n  The Senator used an example between a misdemeanor and a felony, and \nhe says you have to have a line. The line you have is you are still \npunishing the wrongdoer. The shift from a misdemeanor to a felony does \nnot enable you to put the burden off on the victim of the crime. Here \nwe are throwing it off on the victims, and you are doing it in such a \nway that they have no adequate protection. I think these small \ninvestors ought to be protected. I think the proportionate liability \nought to be doubled. As the Senator from New York indicated the other \nday himself in making a statement, that is what this is directed to do. \nI say to my colleague, the way it is written now my colleague is going \nto have someone with a small net worth, they lose a small amount of \nmoney--he says, ``Too bad.''\n  They say, ``But this fellow was a participant in the fraud. They were \nin this scheme that cheated me.''\n  ``Tough. Very sorry.'' And Mr. and Mrs. Small investor, all across \nthe country, are going to feel the brunt. They are going to feel the \nbrunt of this.\n  I should have tried to amend the net worth as well. I think the \nfigure is much too low. But for the sake of drawing the distinctions we \nleft the net worth. We just said all right, you got $200,000 net worth, \nyou lose $15,000 in this fraudulent scheme. The person who directly \nperpetrated the scheme has fled. But his lawyer is around, his \naccountant is around, his investment counselor is around. And all of \nthem were so reckless that they became participants in the scheme. They \ndid not blow the whistle on this person and therefore you are entitled \nto collect from them. And I think you ought to be able to collect if \nyou are the small person.\n  If you have lost less than 10 percent, you have a smaller loss--why \nshould they not? That may be the only investment funds these people \nhave. We are not talking about wealthy people here. And you are putting \nthe burden--it is very important to understand, the law to date has \nbeen that all of the defendants can be held. If one of them goes \nbankrupt, then the others can be brought in and made to pay. And the \nvictim is held harmless.\n  Now we are making the perpetrators of the fraud harmless as opposed \nto the victims.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The hour of 2 \no'clock now having arrived, the Senator from California is recognized \nto offer an amendment on which there will be 90 minutes debate.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n(Purpose: To instruct the Securities and Exchange Commission to report \n to the Congress on whether senior citizens and retirement plans need \n               enhanced protection from securities fraud)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1473.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . STUDY AND REPORT ON PROTECTIONS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS \n                   AND QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) senior citizens and qualified retirement plans are too \n     often the target of securities fraud of the kind evidenced in \n     the Charles Keating, Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and \n     American Continental Corporation situations;\n       (2) this Act, in an effort to curb unfounded lawsuits, \n     changes the standards and procedures for securities fraud \n     actions; and\n       (3) the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated \n     concern with some provisions of this Act.\n       (b) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall--\n       (1) determine whether investors that are senior citizens or \n     qualified retirement plans require greater protection against \n     securities fraud than is provided in this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act; and\n       (2) if so, submit to the Congress a report containing \n     recommendations on protections that the Commission determines \n     to be appropriate to thoroughly protect such investors.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) The term `qualified retirement plan' has the same \n     meaning as in section 4974(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986; and\n       (2) the term `senior citizen' means an individual who is 62 \n     years of age or older as of the date of the securities \n     transaction at issue.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  The reason I had the wonderful employee of the Senate read the \namendment in its entirety is that it is pretty straightforward. As has \nbeen stated before, I am not an attorney. Because I tend to see these \nthings in a very straightforward way, I have a rule that I have to \nreally be able to show my amendment to the people I represent and make \nsure that they speak clearly to the point.\n  Is it not the case, Mr. President, that I have 45 minutes on my side, \nand Senator Domenici has 45 minutes on his side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume, but I ask if the President will let the Senator know when she \nhas used about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, my amendment takes a very conservative \napproach to what I think could be a terrible, unintended consequence of \nthis bill.\n  Many times when we pass legislation with the best of intentions, with \nthe best of minds, we come up short and we find out that in fact we \nhurt people instead of helping them. Since I know that every one of us \nis here to help people, every one of us is here to protect investors, \nevery one of us is here to show that we are fair, reasonable and that \nwe are just, I think the amendment I am offering ought to be accepted \nby the other side. I hope it will be.\n  It simply asks the SEC to report to us in 180 days as to whether \nsenior citizens and qualified retirement plans need more protection \nthan that which is called for under S. 240.\n  All I am doing in this amendment is ensuring that the most vulnerable \ntargets of securities fraud, the elderly, are not going to be even more \nvulnerable as a result of this bill, S. 240. Frankly, I am afraid that \nthey will be. This is not just my opinion; many senior groups oppose \nthis bill in its current form. They want us to amend it. They are very \nconcerned about the impact of this bill on their retirement plan, on \ntheir ability to not become a burden to their families.\n  This bill's entire focus is to make it more difficult to bring a \nclass action lawsuit involving fraud. That is its purpose. I understand \nit. We want to make sure there are no frivolous lawsuits filed. We do \nnot like these strike suits. We want to get rid of them. But I am \nconcerned that, if the proconsumer amendments continue to be beaten \nback in this Senate as they were in committee and the first one which \nwas here in the Senate, clearly the ones who will be hurt the most are \nthe ones who are the clearest targets for crooks.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a couple of articles that appeared \nin the recent press showing that senior citizens are, in fact, the \ntarget of crooks. I am going to show you a couple of articles. Here we \nhave an article from the AARP Bulletin, a publication of the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons.\n  ``Targeting the Vulnerable.''\n  ``Stock Schemes a New Peril.''\n  I am going to read it.\n\n       To Earl Bonsey of Dover, Maine, it sounded almost too good \n     to be true. As it turned out, it was. The 69-year-old retired \n     carpenter thought he was investing $15,000 in a safe, high-\n     yield mutual fund. Instead, he got a high-risk junk bond fund \n     and lost a third of his money.\n       Thousands of older Americans now find themselves in similar \n     situations, and the problem is worsening, experts say. \n     ``Although there are no firm statistics, we know that \n     countless numbers of older persons are being bilked out of \n     millions of dollars every year--dollars that often represent \n     the savings of a lifetime.''\n\n  Here is an article from the New York Times just last month.\n  ``If the Hair is Grey, Con Artists See Green.'' ``The Elderly Are \nPrime Targets.''\n  I am going to read just a portion of this.\n\n       Finding victims is simple. Older people are fairly easy to \n     contact, either through zip codes or mailing lists. Sometimes \n     they are taken for a ride by a parent or friend, whether it \n     is young people who turn up on their doorsteps offering to \n     carry groceries, or middle-aged people . . . in church \n     groups. Even trusted local business people can turn into \n     predators. The elderly ``just like the Marcus Welby view of \n     the world, believe that people in business are basically \n     honest,'' says Philip Feigin, Colorado's Communities \n     Commissioner and President of the North American Securities \n     Administrators Association which tracks investor fraud.\n  And I might add that that organization, the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, opposes S. 240. This is what he says:\n\n       So many times when we track a scam the investors who call \n     us are absolutely furious that we broke it up. Of course, any \n     investment made at any age can go sour, but if you blow it \n     when you are 30, you have 35 years to make it up before you \n     retire. If you blow it at 65, you may have to go back to work \n     for the rest of your life.\n\n  Now, my God, the last thing we want to do here is send people back to \nwork at age 65 and 70 when they have lost their life savings or part of \ntheir life savings. That is just what happened in the Keating case, so \nlet us be careful with what we do here.\n  Now, the next chart shows the Keating scam in all its beauty. It is a \ndraft; it is actually used here as a salesman's training course where \nthey showed their scam artists how to go after the elderly and it just \nshows how they look at the elderly: ``Edna Snidlip, 1 Geriatric Way, \nRetiredville, CA.''\n  That is the person they put up as the target here, and they are \ntrying to get her to write a $20,000 check, and that is how they refer \nto her. And I think more important than that is the next chart which \nshows what Keating said to his staff.\n\n       Capitalize On This.\n       And always remember the weak, meek and ignorant are always \n     good targets.\n\n  It is unbelievable what goes on with certain bad apples in this \ncountry, who would target the elderly and call them the ``weak, meek \nand ignorant.'' That is why senior citizens oppose this bill, and they \nare going to remember what we do with this bill. To me, that is the \nmost extraordinary thing. This is the way they talk about our grandmas \nand grandpas--``the weak, meek and ignorant.'' They are going to target \nthem, and they are going to get them into some scheme. And then, if we \ndo not strengthen this bill, they are not going to be able to recover. \nAnd so Senator Sarbanes is offering some amendments, I will be offering \nsome amendments, Senator Shelby, Senator Bryan, and others. I hope we \nwill get some support.\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n  Let me give you some of the stories of the senior citizens who were \nhoodwinked by Charles Keating, and let us be clear. The laws we are \namending in S. 240 are the very laws that were used by these seniors to \ngo after Keating and his cohorts.\n  Last week, Senator Bryan was questioned by the chairman of the \ncommittee, who said: How does this have anything to do with the Keating \npeople? It is very clear. We have the pleadings of the people who were \nhoodwinked by Keating, collected under these very laws. So when you \nchange it--and by the way, there were forward-looking statements put \nout by Charles Keating which I will show later in the debate.\n  When you change the laws, you make it harder for these people, \nwhether it is on the proportionate liability or the safe harbor or the \npleading requirements or any of the other things that we change by S. \n240. That is why. SEC has problems with this. The SEC has many problems \nwith many of the provisions--with the safe harbor provision, with the \nlead plaintiff provision--and we are trying to fix this bill so that it \nis, indeed, a good bill and what it winds up doing is making sure we \nprotect the good business people, not the bad ones. I wish to protect \nthe good business people of California, of which there are many, most. \nBut there are some who are not. And I used to be a stockbroker, and I \ncan tell you this from that experience. People are very nervous when \nthey give you their money to invest. It is a sacred trust. And to call \nthese people ``weak, meek and ignorant'' does not deserve to be \nrewarded by legislation that makes it easier for these crooks.\n  We should be careful. These seniors are warning us not to go too far. \nThe seniors who were bilked by Keating showed up here in Washington, \nDC, to stand with some of us. Here is one of their stories. Barbara \nMarks of Burbank, CA. Here is what she says.\n\n       I have my home. I have my car, but I have no savings. I \n     invested my savings but Charles Keating swindled it from me. \n     I lost $25,000 in American Continental Corporation bonds I \n     bought at Keating's Lincoln Savings. I've received about 50 \n     percent back from class action lawsuits. It's made things \n     much more difficult. I hate having no money,\n\nshe says.\n\n       I live check to check. If I didn't have any pension and \n     Social Security, I'd be on skid row. If a check doesn't show \n     up, I have nothing. Everything I do I have to pay on time. If \n     my battery goes, I have to pay. I cannot go to the bank and \n     draw out money if I don't have food or coffee. I have to wait \n     until the next check. Last week I had no money for 3 days.\n\n  This is a woman who was swindled out of her money. Why would we want \nto do anything to make it harder for her to recover, or others like \nher? I ask that question. Now, I know my friends on the other side and \nmy friends on this side who support S. 240 say I am wrong on this \npoint. I say do not listen to me. Listen to the hundreds and hundreds \nof people and organizations and consumer groups that absolutely oppose \nS. 240 in strong form. Join with me in this amendment so that we can \nhave a study done by the SEC to tell us if we have gone too far and we \nare hurting seniors. Let us see what else she says.\n\n       As an older person you want to think people are honest. I \n     thought everything was protected and everything was on the up \n     and up. I thought my investment was insured. People should be \n     able to collect the money taken from them from all who are \n     responsible,\n\nshe says.\n  This goes to Senator Sarbane's amendment.\n\n       We should benefit from those who benefit from taking from \n     us. The money belongs to us. The Senate shouldn't take away \n     our rights.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement \nof Ms. Jeri Mellen and Ms. Joy Delfosse, both of Nevada, Don and Judy \nMaxfield of Arizona, John and Ethel Rabkin, Granada Hills, CA, and \nEvangeline Ivy of Glendale, CA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe the Record, as follows:\n\n   People Who Were Swindled by Charles Keating and Who Oppose S. 240 \n               Washington, D.C. Visit, June 13, 14, 1995\n\n\n                                 nevada\n\n       1. Ms. Jeri Mellon, Henderson, NV.\n       Jeri Melon lost $40,000 in American Continental Corp. (ACC) \n     bonds, which she purchased at Lincoln Savings & Loan in \n     Sherman Oaks, California in the last 1980's.\n       She says, ``The bank had set aside a desk near the front of \n     the bank so that you were seen coming and going. The \n     individual selling the bonds was always a well-dressed, young \n     college graduate. He was charismatic, charming, good-looking, \n     attentive, and very well versed in his approach to clients.\n       ``The tellers advised you to put your money in the bonds \n     rather than a CD. Lincoln Savings was insured, so I felt that \n     if the bank was endorsing these bonds, they would have to be \n     insured.''\n       2. Ms. Joy Delfosse, Henderson, Nevada.\n       Joy Delfosse lost $21,000 in ACC bonds that she purchased \n     at Lincoln Savings & Loan in Sherman Oaks, Ca. She had been a \n     customer of Lincoln Savings since 1969; and when a CD of hers \n     came due, the Lincoln tellers she trusted convinced her to \n     put her money into ACC bonds.\n\n\n                                arizona\n\n       1. Don and Judy Maxfield,\n       Don and Judy Maxfield lost $21,000 in ACC bonds, when they \n     were living in Lakewood, CA. in the 1980's. They purchased \n     the bonds at their local Lincoln Savings bank in the Lakewood \n     Mall. when their CD's came due, Lincoln tellers persuaded \n     them to put their money into ACC bonds. At the time, the \n     Maxfields were looking forward to retirement and felt the \n     bonds were an attractive investment, since they were being \n     sold by Lincoln Savings.\n\n\n                               California\n\n       1. Sam and Ethel Rabkin, Granada Hills, CA.\n       Sam and Ethel Rabkin lost $100,000 in ACC bonds, which they \n     purchased at the Lincoln Savings & Loan where they banked at \n     Granada Hills, CA. They said, ``Lincoln was a family bank \n     with all the tellers knowing you by your first name and they \n     made you feel part of the family.''\n       2. Evangeline (Van) Ivy, Glendale, CA.\n       Evangeline (Van) Ivy and her husband lost $100,000 in ACC \n     bonds, which they brought at the Lincoln Savings & Loan in \n     their town of Glendale CA. They were regular customers of the \n     Lincoln Savings in Glendale; they purchased their bonds when \n     their CDs came due, based on information from Lincoln sales \n     people that the bonds were safe.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sam and Ethel Rafkin lost $100,000 in junk bonds. They \nsaid:\n\n       Lincoln was a family bank with all the tellers knowing you \n     by your first name and they made you feel part of the family.\n\n  Sure, they did. But in the back rooms they laughed at them and called \nthem the ``weak, meek and ignorant.''\n  We better be careful when we change our securities laws that we do \nnot as an unintended consequence--I do not think anyone, of course, \nintends to do that--reward that kind of crook. We know Charles Keating \ntargeted the elderly. We know many others target the elderly. I showed \nyou some of those articles. Charles Keating ran afoul of the securities \nlaws. The securities laws that this bill will change will be changed \ndeeply and adversely: 18,000 of the 23,000 people who bought Charles \nKeating's junk bonds were elderly--well, we know why; they targeted the \nelderly; junk bonds that did not drop 10, 20, or 30 percent in value \nbut junk bonds that became 100 percent worthless; 18,000 people \nswindled. That is a small city. Make no mistake, the elderly are the \ntarget, and that is why my amendment is such a good amendment, because \nit simply says to the SEC: Take a look at what the Senate has done and \nthe House has done with S. 240 and let us know in 180 days. Should we \ntake some actions to make sure that senior citizens are better \nprotected?\n  Mr. President, have I used up the 20 minutes at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 16 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say we better make sure we know what we are doing. We \nbetter make sure that at the end of the day, as the proponents of S. \n240 celebrate their victory, it is not a short lived victory, because I \nwill tell you, Mr. President, there is no wrath like the wrath of the \nelderly. There is no wrath like the wrath of people who took their \nhard-earned retirement money and invested it, only to turn around and \nfind out they were swindled. And that wrath will come down on those \npeople who changed the laws in such a way that good people like this \ncould not invest.\n\n  Let me give you another unintended consequence, and it is something \nthat my friend, Chris Dodd, has said over and over and over again, and \nhe is right on this particular point. We have to make sure that people \nare interested in making investments in this Nation. We want to make \nsure they feel good about it, they feel protected. Or what will happen? \nMoney will dry up. They will buy a Government bond. Why would they not? \nAt least they know it is protected by the FDIC and that the full\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nfaith and credit of the Treasury stands behind it.\n  But we want people to invest in the business world. We want the \ncapital to flow to innovation, to new technology so that jobs are \ncreated. So what I am saying is, as an unintended consequence of this \nbill, we better be careful that we do not go so much to one side \nbecause we do not want frivolous lawsuits that we, in fact, make people \nafraid that the protections are not there, that they will never collect \nif they are swindled and, therefore, they refuse to invest their money \nin the private sector. And they might very well.\n  I will tell you, I would have a lot of pause. I know a lot about this \nrewrite of securities laws, and I am very concerned.\n  Investment schemes that target the elderly are not the exception; \nthey are the rule. The Senate Committee on Aging held hearings 2 years \nago on elderly and retirement investor fraud. The assistant \ncommissioner from my State securities regulators testified. Let me \nquote from his testimony:\n\n       If I were conducting a seminar on investment fraud \n     techniques for aspiring con artists, lesson one would be: \n     Target the elderly and the retired.\n\n  So we have proof from people who are out there that the elderly, \nsenior citizens, and retirement plans are the focus of some of these \nbad appeals, these swindlers, these crooks, these corrupt people who \nhave no heart at all. I used to call them hard-hearted. I do not think \nthey have a heart. How do you have a heart when you take a grandma's \nmoney, a widow? She has $20,000. You imply that it is safe, as I read \nto you before the case of that elderly person. How do you take that \nmoney and lose it knowing all along that is what was going to happen \nand then even claim to have a heart?\n  No. 1, target the elderly and the retired.\n  The State securities regulators announced what they described as an \nalarming surge in investment schemes targeting IRA's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. They reported \nthat tens of thousands of unwary Americans already have invested \nhundreds of millions of dollars of their savings for old age through \nIRA's and other tax-deferred savings.\n  So we know who the targets are. And the Boxer amendment simply says \nto the SEC, ``Help us out a little. After S. 240 is the law of the \nland, take a special look, from the standpoint of our seniors and \nretirement plans, and let us know if there is something we should do to \nstrengthen the law.''\n  I would be surprised if people fight us on this amendment. If they \ndo, I will listen to their arguments, but it is hard for me to \nunderstand why we would not want to have this information.\n  Mr. President, today I took an early morning walk around the Capitol \non the west front, and I do not know if you have ever seen the statue \nof John Garfield. It was put up there by his Army buddies.\n  For the first time, I decided to take a look at it. It is surrounded \nby five classical sculptures, and one of them is a man who is holding a \ntablet, and the tablet has three words on it: Law, justice, prosperity. \nThose three words--law, justice, prosperity.\n  I thought to myself, how interesting that I happened to look at that \nthis morning. Law, justice, and prosperity. What we are trying to do \nhere is to make sure in S. 240 that our companies can be prosperous by \nprotecting them from frivolous lawsuits. Law, justice, prosperity. But, \non the other hand, there is a balance. Are we going to go too far and \ntake prosperity away from our seniors or, shall I say, survival away \nfrom our seniors? So, law, justice and prosperity. We are dealing with \nthose words today. We do not want to protect the bad guys; we want to \nhelp the good guys, and we certainly do not want to hurt the senior \ncitizens and those who are saving diligently for their retirement.\n  I know lawyer bashing is the latest thing of the nineties. We bash \neverything in the nineties, but particularly we bash lawyers, and I am \nagainst lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits. I will do whatever I can \nto stop that.\n  But let us be clear, we are doing a lot more here. We are going very \nfar, as this Congress has done on a number of issues, we are going too \nfar. We are going to hurt our grandmas and grandpas and average, decent \npeople who deserve to be protected and they do not deserve to have a \nlaw that protects them literally torn apart--torn apart--so that they \ncan be sitting targets: ``the weak, the meek and the ignorant with no \nlaws to help them.'' That is wrong.\n  We are changing many rules about securities laws in S. 240. The least \nwe can do--the least we can do--is require that the SEC come back to us \nin 180 days telling us what they believe the impact of these changes \nare on senior citizens and retirement plans. I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle can support the Boxer amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time, Mr. President. I yield the floor \nat this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I was listening to the concern my \ncolleague from California raised that senior citizens might be \nparticularly vulnerable to unscrupulous predators who prey on them \nbecause of their lack of sophistication and, in many cases, take \nadvantage of an established fiduciary relationship to defraud senior \ncitizens of their savings.\n  I agree with my colleague that, in the case of Charles Keating and \nhis bank, it is hard to imagine that a large and reputable institution, \ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, would engage in \nthe kind of reprehensible activities which defraud depositors and \ninvestors of hundreds of millions of dollars. People often think that \nbanks have the Federal Government's stamp of approval and that they are \ntherefore protected from these kinds of fraudulent practices, because \nof the various supervisory agencies--the Federal Reserve, the Office of \nthe Comptroller--which review these banks. However, I reject the \nSenator's contention that S. 240 would open the door to this kind of \nactivity. Fraud is not countenanced by this bill. Indeed, deliberate or \nintentional misstatements do not receive the safe harbor or any other \nprotections. In fact, those who make intentional misstatements can be \nheld liable, potentially, for all of the damages, even damages beyond \nthose which they are found to be directly responsible. Further, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission is empowered under this legislation \nto bring suits that before now they did not have the authority to \nbring.\n\n  This legislation's purpose is to control the race to the courthouse \nby greedy, avaricious lawyers, who look not to the benefit of innocent \ninvestors or the elderly who have been defrauded, but look only to \nenrich themselves. They have become legal holdup artists. Ninety-three \npercent of these cases are settled because it costs less for defendants \nto settle them than the millions of dollars they cost to try. The \nlawyers win their settlements by alleging fraud; they do not prove \nfraud.\n  It is about time that we say we are not going to allow the American \njudicial system to be used in this manner; to allow lawyers to pirate \nprofits from companies who have done nothing wrong, whose only mistake \nis that they are in business and that they are subject to the \nmarketplace fluctuations. It is about time that we stood up to the \nlawyers who have made filing these cases a business. These lawyers are \nnot concerned with the interests of the investors who have been abused.\n  I do not want to see people's rights to seek redress limited. \nHowever, this bill does not do that. Later, I intend to refer to a \nstatement by Mr. Levitt, in which he is highly complimentary of many of \nthe provisions of S. 240. Also I intend to point to a comparison \nbetween our bill and the bill that was passed in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I have not heard anybody point out that this bill does stop these \nattorneys from racing to the courthouse, and prohibits them from hiring \nplaintiffs so\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\nthat the people with real financial interests are represented. These \nattorneys would rather file suit on behalf of a person who owns 10 \nshares of stock and who the lawyer selects than have to consider the \ninterests of the defrauded investor. S. 240 stops this abusive behavior \nand it should be complimented for that. S. 240 would also legislate \nthat if you are an accountant, and you discover fraud, you have an \nobligation to bring that up to the board of directors. However, S. 240 \ngoes further than that; it requires that your obligation does not end \nwith the board of directors. If the board of directors does not act, \nyou have to go one step further, and report the fraud to the SEC. These \nprovisions protect the senior citizens.\n  I am tired of hearing this nonsense that this legislation will just \nopen up the doors to take advantage of people. People are being taken \nadvantage of, this legislation tries to put a stop to that. Where do \nyou think those senior citizens invest their money? They invest in \npension funds that account for 25 percent of all the moneys invested. \nHowever, I did not hear my colleagues say, you have done a good thing \nby giving to these pension funds the authority to pick their lawyers \nand control their litigation. While I share my colleagues' concern that \nsenior citizens not be hurt, I think it is unfair, that it is beyond \nthe pale, to say that this bill protects fraud. I have heard that \nstatement a half dozen times from my colleagues. But this bill does not \nprotect fraud. I ask my colleagues to show me where in this legislation \nwe protect fraud. Any intentional misstatement and you can be held \nliable. There is no safe harbor for fraud. It is neither right nor \naccurate to say that we protect fraud in this bill, and I resent the \nfact that my colleagues continue to make these statements.\n  For several weeks, my colleague has been talking about offering \namendments to help protect senior citizens. I have yet to see those \namendments. This is the first amendment that has been introduced. It \ncalls for a study. I believe that it is reasonable, and I am prepared, \nunder certain circumstances, to accept this amendment. But I do not \nthink it is unreasonable for me to ask what other amendments are going \nto be offered so that they are not just sprung on us. I hope that my \ncolleagues are willing to share their amendments so that we can see if \nwe might be able to accept them. I would like to be able to do that, \nbut I certainly cannot accept amendments blindly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before I yield to my good friend from Alabama, I want to \nrespond to my friend from New York. My friend from New York, the \nchairman of the committee, worked very hard on S. 240. He simply has a \ndifferent view of the consequences. You know, if it all was exactly the \nway my friend said it was, everyone would be supporting S. 240. But I \nhave already put into the Record the names of hundreds of people from \nAlabama to Wyoming, people who are there to look out for the people, \nwho have said S. 240 goes too far.\n  I already mentioned the Congress of California Seniors. Listen to \nwhat they said, and they are smart people:\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer: In behalf of the Congress of California \n     Seniors, I want to reiterate our strong opposition to S. 240 \n     as it emerged from the Senate on May 25. This bill threatens \n     the retirement savings of every Californian.\n\n  My friend can pound the podium all he wants. He is effective when he \ndoes that. But so can I.\n  Listen:\n\n       This bill threatens the retirement savings of every \n     Californian. It is one of the most anti-senior citizen pieces \n     of legislation to be considered by the Congress in recent \n     years.\n\n  That is such strong talk from the Congress of California Seniors.\n  So I just have to say there is a legitimate disagreement here. I am \nvery hopeful that my friend, the chairman, will accept my amendment, \nbecause I think that is the minimum we can do. I hope that he will. But \nwe can all pound the table and get upset because we see the bill \ndifferently, which is what the legislative process is about. I hope my \nfriend will not take it personally that I see it in a different way \nthan he does.\n  At this time, I yield 10 minutes to my friend from Alabama, Senator \nHeflin.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Boxer amendment \nwhich basically is to require a study as to the effect of securities \nlitigation on senior citizens and to then come forward with ideas on \nhow basically they might be protected in the event there are \ndisadvantages that arise relative to the matters that are involved in \nsecurities litigation.\n  I also rise in opposition to the bill. This bill has been called a \nreform bill. I think that is really a misnomer. It has been called by \nsome--and they go, I think, a little too far--the crooks and swindlers \nprotection act. However, the bill which proclaims to curb frivolous \nlawsuits would essentially put at a substantial disadvantage and \npenalize the victims of securities fraud and give protection to \ncorporate wrongdoers and their aiders and abettors.\n  This bill has many opponents, including the very people who are \nresponsible for investor protection and overseeing capital formation in \nthe States, the North American Securities Administrators Association. \nAlso the Association for Retired People, AARP; the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, and the Government Finance Officers Association number among \nthose that are opposed to S. 240.\n  All oppose the bill for good reason, as noted by the Raleigh News \nObserver, ``The bill is bad news for investors private and public and \nit would tie victims in legal knots while immunizing white-collar \ncrooks against having to pay for their misdeeds.''\n  The sponsors of this bill claim, with very little supporting \nevidence, that there is a litigation explosion in the securities class \naction arena. The studies regarding the number of these types of cases \ndo not reflect anything close to an explosion. In fact, they prove that \nthe level of actual cases has remained constant for the past 20 years. \nIn 1993 alone there were only 140 companies sued; there are over 20,000 \ncompanies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This \nsmall number of companies sued, only 140, hardly amounts to a \nlitigation explosion.\n  The proponents of the bill also claim that most of the cases which \nwere filed are frivolous and that companies feel that they must settle \nthe cases to avoid protracted litigation expenses. Well, if we were to \nbase this reform bill only on what companies believe are frivolous \nsuits, we would believe that the charges filed against the accountants, \nlawyers, and brokers involved in the Charles Keating, Lincoln Savings \nfraud case were frivolous. Although they claimed the charges were \nfrivolous, they settled for ten's of millions of dollars with investors \nwho had lost considerably.\n  There probably are cases in which companies have been wrongly sued \nfor stock price decreases not due to fraud or based on actions for \nwhich they should not be held accountable. Predominately this is not \nthe case. In fact, according to a study performed by the University of \nCalifornia for 3 years ending in 1990, only 20 companies were hauled \ninto court of the 589 companies whose stocks dropped more than 20 \npercent in 5 days around the time of a disappointing earnings report. \nIn many of those 20 cases, executives were telling the public that \neverything looks great, while bailing out of the company and selling \ntheir own stock.\n  The amendments offered by Senators Bryan and Sarbanes will go far to \nachieve a balance between protecting the rights of defrauded investors \nand providing protection from frivolous lawsuits to honest companies. \nThese amendments include language which was part of the original \nversion of S. 240. I believe that the cosponsors of the original \nversion of S. 240 will agree that the bill as reported out of the \nBanking Committee steeply tilts the playing fields against investors. \nWithout these amendments, I cannot support this legislation which will \nstrip the rights of defrauded investors.\n  The amendments are supported by the Securities Regulators \nAssociation, Government Finance Officers Association, and many others. \nAcceptance of them could resolve many concerns of these organizations. \nOne amendment would allow the SEC to fashion through its rulemaking an \neffective\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nsafe harbor for forward-looking statements. The SEC and others are \nconcerned that the safe harbor in the bill makes it possible for \ndefendants to avoid liability for false statements. Another amendment \nwould extend the statute of limitations to allow investors enough time \nto file a securities fraud suit. Currently the bill provides for a time \nperiod which is widely regarded as too short.\n  Other amendments which greatly improve this bill involve the ability \nto pursue accountants, brokers, and other professionals who may have \naided in a securities fraud and the apportionment of damages to those \nsecondary violators. One amendment would return to prviate parties the \nability to pursue aiders and abetters in securities fraud suits. This \namendment is supported by State securities regulators as well as by the \nSEC. Both of these enforcement agencies have limited resources \navailable and realize the need for private actions to pursue aiders and \nabetters. The other amendment would allow the innocent victim to be \ncompensated rather than penalized due to the bankruptcy of the primary \nviolator. This amendment would simply restore joint and several \nliability so that the equities are in favor of the innocent investor.\n  It seems odd that now we are moving to reform securities litigation \nwith a result that would protect those who may create investor scams. \nIf any reform needs to be addressed, based on the current actions on \nWall Street, it should come in the form of greater investor protection, \nnot making it easier for corporations and stockbrokers to mislead \ninvestors. There is currently a recent frenzy of mergers and takeovers. \nAccording to the New York Times securities regulators are opening \ninvestigations into insider trading at a rate not seen since the \n1980's. Unfortunately, I believe that if this bill were to become law, \nmany of its provisions would soon be tested to the detriment of \ninvestors.\n  Our financial markets do not run on money, they run on public \nconfidence. The stock market is trading at all-time highs and companies \nare earning record profits. This is greatly due to the confidence that \ninvestors have in the marketplace. This confidence will be drastically \naltered if investors come to believe that not only are they at risk of \nbeing defrauded, but that they have no recourse to fight back against \nthose who defraud them.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support all the amendments offered to \nput investor protection back into this bill. If these amendments are \nnot adopted I will find it difficult to vote for a bill which supports \nthose involved in fraud while tearing down long-standing protection in \nour securities law.\n\n  In closing I would like to quote from a letter I received from Mr. \nJoe Borg, the director of the Alabama Securities Commission. In his \nletter, Mr. Borg considers the question of whether this bill would \nachieve a balance between protecting investors and granting relief to \nhonest companies and professionals. He concludes that ``the bill would \ntilt the balance too far in favor of corporate interest and would have \nthe effect of depriving many defrauded investors of the ability to \nrecover their losses.'' He further states that ``I agree there is room \nfor constructive improvement of the Federal securities process. \nHowever, S. 240 as reported by the Banking Committee goes beyond the \nstated goal of curbing frivolous lawsuits and instead would in \npractical effect, eradicate most private actions under the Federal \nsecurities laws.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Alabama Securities Commission,\n\n                                    Montgomery, AL, June 19, 1995.\n     Via facsimile: 202-224-3149.\n     Attn: Winston Lett.\n     Hon. Howell Heflin, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S. 240, the ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act''.\n       Dear Senator Heflin: I understand that the Senate may \n     consider as early as this week S. 240, the ``Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act.'' In my capacity as the \n     Director of the Alabama Securities Commission, I am writing \n     today to express my serious concerns with S. 240 as it was \n     reported out of the Senate Banking Committee. As you know, \n     the Alabama Securities Commission is responsible for investor \n     protection and for overseeing the capital formation process \n     in Alabama.\n       In evaluating the variety of securities litigation reform \n     measures that have been introduced in the 104th Congress, I \n     applied one test: Does the bill achieve a balance between \n     protecting the rights of defrauded investors and provide \n     relief to honest companies and professionals who may find \n     themselves the target of a frivolous lawsuit?\n       Regrettably, S. 240, as it was reported by the Senate \n     Banking Committee, does not achieve this balance. Instead, \n     the bill would tilt the balance too far in favor of corporate \n     interests and would have the effect of depriving many \n     defrauded investors of the ability to recover their losses.\n       It is my understanding that pro-investor amendments will be \n     offered at the time S. 240 is considered on the Senate floor. \n     Among the amendments expected to be offered are the \n     following: Extending the statute of limitations for civil \n     securities fraud actions; fully restoring liability for \n     aiding and abetting securities fraud; narrowing the scope of \n     a safe harbor for forward looking statements so that the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has the \n     necessary expertise, is directed to engage in rulemaking to \n     develop a reasonable and effective safe harbor without giving \n     corporate executives free rein to make misleading statements; \n     and modifying the severe limitations on joint and several \n     liability so that innocent defrauded investors have a chance \n     to fully recover their losses.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission, the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association (the organization \n     representing the 50 state securities regulators of which I am \n     a member), and others generally have expressed concerns over \n     the bill's treatment of these issues. The amendments expected \n     to be offered on the floor (as discussed above) respond to \n     those concerns and are deserving of your support. Please vote \n     in favor of these amendments when they are offered on the \n     floor.\n       If these amendments are offered and rejected, I \n     respectfully encourage you to vote against S. 240 on final \n     passage.\n       I want to emphasize that I agree there is room for \n     constructive improvement of the federal securities litigation \n     process. However, S. 240 as reported by the Banking Committee \n     goes beyond the stated goal of curbing frivolous lawsuits and \n     instead would, in practical effect, eradicate most all \n     private actions under the federal securities laws.\n       In closing, I want to stress that our financial markets do \n     not run on money; they run on public confidence. It is my \n     view that the confidence that investors have in the \n     marketplace will be dramatically altered if they come to \n     believe that not only are they at risk of being defrauded, \n     but that they have no recourse to fight back against those \n     who have defrauded them. I urge you to support balanced and \n     targeted reform measures and to reject S. 240 if it does not \n     incorporate the amendments discussed above.\n       You may reach me at 334-242-2984 should you have any \n     questions or need additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joseph P. Borg,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California will have 8 \nminutes, with 36 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would like to take a moment to state, as I indicated \nto the Senator from California, that we certainly would like to review \nher amendment. While I might have difficulty with the language used in \nthe amendment, I do not have a problem asking the Securities and \nExchange Commission to look at the impact this legislation would have, \nparticularly as it relates to senior citizens.\n  Certainly, I think that is reasonable. I say that in the spirit of \ncooperation I hope that we can iron out our differences. I would also \nlike to point out, Mr. President, that I have a statement from the \nchairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who indicates that \nhe, as a businessman, finds there is a need for a stronger safe harbor.\n  I quote from Chairman Levitt:\n\n       The current rules have largely been a failure and I share \n     the disappointment of issuers that the rules have been \n     ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       . . . I know all too well the punishing costs of meritless \n     lawsuits--costs that are ultimately paid by investors. \n     Particularly galling are the frivolous lawsuits that ignore \n     the fact that a projection is inherently uncertain even when \n     made reasonably and in good faith.\n\n  That is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who my \ncolleagues like to quote so often.\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\n  My colleagues would have us believe that all is well with the \nsecurities industry. All is not well. All is not well when you have a \nband of lawyers who literally hire the people they represent, race to \nthe courthouse to file the suit and allege fraud, and are then selected \nas lead counsel.\n  The statement that we are protecting fraud, gets the hackles up on \nthis Senator. Not only are we not protecting fraudulent conduct, but we \nare making sure that people are held liable for intentionally making a \nmisstatement. Again, I say there is no safe harbor anyplace for fraud. \nThere were other legislative proposals that would have brought such a \nsafe harbor, but not this bill. It is a disservice to this legislation \nto say it protects fraud. There is neither intent nor language in this \nbill nor is there any way to interpret this bill to say that fraudulent \nconduct is protected under S. 240.\n  The cost of these abusive cases is incalculable. It has cost business \nthe ability to communicate and to give the information to people to \nwhich they are entitled. This inability is particularly troublesome to \nthe small startup business in the high-technology area. It has a \nchilling impact on these firms and it is wrong.\n  The fact is that there were $1.3 billion worth of settlements, \nsettlements in 1993-94, that is 93 percent of the cases filed. No one \ncan afford to stand up defend themselves in these cases. Do we really \nbelieve out of all 300 cases that were brought, every one of them \nengaged in fraudulent conduct? That is absurd. Those cases were not \ntried they were settled. What we are attempting to do in S. 240 is to \nseek balance; to demonstrate that those who truly commit fraud will not \nbe let off the hook, but by the same token, we will not expose an \nentire class of people who are associated with the securities business \nto meritless suits. That is what this legislation does, and it does \nstrike a balance.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in support of S. 240, \nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and against the \nproposed amendment.\n  S. 240 is a moderate and carefully balanced compromise bill that \npermits investors in securities to continue to file and win legitimate \nlawsuits. However, the bill does something that is much needed at this \ntime: It gives issuers of securities the ability to quickly dismiss \nmeritless and abusive lawsuits.\n  The current system of securities litigation is clearly broken. Why? \nBecause it makes millionaires out of attorneys who repeatedly file \nfrivolous lawsuits. As a matter of fact, securities litigation costs \nAmerican industry $2.4 billion a year, one-third of this amount being \npaid to plaintiffs' attorneys. This results in companies being forced \nto lay off workers and consumers paying higher prices for goods and \nservices.\n  The bottom line is that the current system of securities litigation \ndoes not benefit investors or consumers: It benefits a handful of \nattorneys.\n  Here is how this perverse system of securities litigation currently \nworks: There are a handful of plaintiff law firms in this country today \nthat specialize in filing securities class action lawsuits. This is \nshown by the fact that seven plaintiff law firms in this country \nreceive 63 percent of the legal fees generated by securities class \naction cases. That is seven law firms receiving 63 percent of all of \nthese legal fees.\n  These law firms monitor the stock prices of businesses with computers \nevery day. When a corporation stock price suffers a major drop, the \nplaintiff's law firm immediately files a lawsuit. Indeed, some 20 \npercent--or one out of five--of these securities lawsuits are filed \nwithin 48 hours of a major drop in the stock price.\n  The reason these law firms are able to file their lawsuits so quickly \nis that they sue on behalf of professional plaintiffs. These \nprofessional plaintiffs actually receive a fee, in many cases, for \npermitting themselves to be named in the lawsuit. The Securities \nSubcommittee found that there were some plaintiffs who had as many as \n14 securities action lawsuits filed on their behalf.\n  These law firms justify the filing of these lawsuits by generally \nalleging that the drop in the stock price was caused by the corporation \nor its management acting fraudulently or recklessly. The lawsuits seek \nthe corporation to pay to its shareholders damages in the amount of the \ndifference between the stock price before and after the stock's drop in \nvalue.\n  Even if the lawsuit is meritless, the corporation is forced to \nsettle, even if it is meritless, even if it does not make sense? Why? \nFirst, litigating a lawsuit is costly--even if your only goal is to get \nthe lawsuit dismissed for failing to state a cause of action. This is \nbecause it is very difficult to dismiss such lawsuits, and defense \nexpenses for complex securities class action lawsuits can total between \n$20,000 and $100,000 a month.\n  Second, the depositions and extensive document review associated with \nthese lawsuits are so time consuming that they disrupt the management \nof the business. On average, companies that are sued devote as much as \n1,000 management and employee hours per case per suit.\n  The end result is that it is worthwhile for a business to settle even \na frivolous securities litigation lawsuit because there is rarely, if \never, any cheap way of dismissing it.\n  Opponents to securities litigation reform are going to tell you that \nnotwithstanding all of the foregoing, investors still benefit from the \ncurrent system of securities litigation. But I submit that the current \nsystem actually harms investors.\n  The first problem, as was stated by former SEC Commissioner Carter \nBeese, is that the current system encourages, and I quote Mr. Beese, \n``. . . counsel to settle for amounts that are too low for fees that \nare too high.'' The plaintiffs in a securities class action have a \nconflict of interest with their lawyers. The lawyers' incentive is for \nan uncomplicated settlement and avoidance of a trial. This is because \nthe difficulty and time-consuming work for the plaintiffs' attorneys \ncomes at the trial phase. If it can be avoided by a settlement, the \nlawyers still get their percentage for relatively little effort. Thus, \nthe lawyer-driven nature of these lawsuits tends to shortchange \ninvestors who have truly been defrauded and would benefit from \nlitigating the lawsuit to conclusion.\n  The second problem is that in securities class action lawsuits, when \na corporation makes a settlement payment to a class of shareholders, \nthe shareholders who still own the corporation's stock are not really \ngetting any tangible benefit in return. If the settlement amount is \ncoming from the corporation's money, then it is no more than a type of \nquasi-dividend, with a law firm taking on average a 33-percent cut for \ngiving the shareholder the privilege of having the quasi-dividend \noccur.\n  This will generally cause the corporation's stock price to drop, \nwhich indeed nullifies the benefit of the settlement. If the settlement \namount comes from the corporation's directors and officers liabilities \ninsurance, the corporation will be faced with partly paying it back \nthrough a staggeringly high premium the very next year. Either way, an \ninvestor who continues to own a share of stock in a sued corporation \ndoes not gain much from settlement of the lawsuit.\n  The third and final problem is that investors can no longer get \nuseful forward-looking information about corporations. As former SEC \nCommissioner Carter Beese testified before the Securities Subcommittee:\n\n       Companies go out of their way to disclose every conceivable \n     bit of innocuous information, but very little useful forward-\n     looking information. At the same time, legions of lawyers \n     scrub required filings to ensure that disclosures are as \n     milquetoast as possible, so as to provide no grist for the \n     litigation mill.\n\n  With all of these problems we have with our current system of \nsecurities litigation, the moderate relief offered by S. 240 is \nnecessary to protect investors, to protect consumers, and to protect \njobs.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against amendments which weaken \nthe\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\nvery carefully balanced aspect of S. 240 and to vote for S. 240's final \npassage.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do I have 8 minutes remaining? Is that \naccurate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not take but 2 minutes of my time.\n  My friend from New York is going to yield back his time so we can get \nto a very important amendment by the Senator from Nevada.\n  I am very pleased that the chairman has indicated to me, although he \nhas not said it definitively, that he may well be supporting my \namendment.\n  I think that we have pointed out by virtue of charts and some very \nserious examples that I do not think I need to repeat because they are \nvery, very difficult here in this Chamber where senior citizens have \nbeen the target of fraud.\n  I believe, because we are changing so many aspects of the law in this \nbill, that the SEC ought to take a look at what we have done and all \nthe amendments that we have incorporated or turned down should this \nbill become the law of the land, and then tell us whether or not senior \ncitizens are as well protected as they should be.\n  So I think that this amendment should have broad support. It will \ngive me some comfort to know that in 180 days, we will have a report \nfrom the SEC which has expressed reservations about this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time \nsome of the comments they have made regarding many aspects of this \nbill. They have questions about a lot of areas, including the safe \nharbor, which is the basic provision of the bill, proportionate \nliability, appointment of lead plaintiff, aiding and abetting, and \ndamages.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Response to OMB Request for Views of the Securities and Exchange \n                      Commission Regarding S. 240\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission submitted testimony \n     on S. 240, as introduced by Senators Domenici and Dodd, on \n     April 6, 1995.\\1\\ As noted in the testimony, the Commission \n     supported many of the provisions of S. 240 as introduced. The \n     Commission views S. 240 as ordered reported on May 25, 1995 \n     by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs as a \n     significant improvement over its counterpart in the House, \n     H.R. 1058. However, the Commission has significant concerns \n     regarding certain provisions of S. 240 as reported, and also \n     believes that the legislation should address certain \n     additional issues not included in S. 240.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Provisions of S. 240 endorsed by the Commission--The \n     Commission supports, or does not oppose, the following \n     measures:\n       Class Action Reform Provisions: Except as discussed below, \n     the Commission supports, or does not oppose, the measures set \n     forth in Section 101, ``Elimination of Certain Abusive \n     Practices,'' and Section 102, ``Securities Class Action \n     Reform.''\n       Requirements for Securities Fraud Actions: The Commission \n     supports, or does not oppose, the measures set forth in \n     Section 104, ``Requirements for Securities Fraud Actions,'' \n     and Section 106, ``Written Interrogatories.''\n       RICO: The Commission supports the provision of Section 107, \n     eliminating the overlap between private remedies under RICO \n     and the Federal securities laws.\n       Contribution and Settlement Discharge: The Commission \n     supports those provisions of Section 202 that provide for a \n     right or proportionate contribution among defendants, and for \n     the reduction of a judgment upon a settlement by an amount \n     equal to the greater of the settling defendant's percentage \n     of responsibility or the amount of the settlement.\n       Fraud Detection and Disclosure: The Commission supports \n     Section 301,``Fraud Detection and Disclosure.''\n       Limitation on Rescission under Section 12(2): The \n     Commission does not oppose the amendment offered by Senator \n     Bennett that would allow a defendant to avoid rescission \n     under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act and reduce the \n     damages upon proof that part of the plaintiff's loss was the \n     result of factors unrelated to the fraud.\n       Provisions that should be included in S. 240--The \n     Commission has recommended that Congress adopt the following \n     measures, which are not included in S. 240:\n       Statute of Limitations: The Commission recommends extending \n     the statute of limitations for private securities fraud \n     actions to five years after a violation occurs. Although S. \n     240 as originally introduced addressed this issue, the \n     provision was deleted from the reported bill.\n       Aiding and Abetting in Private Actions: The Commission has \n     recommended restoring liability for aiding and abetting in \n     private actions. As discussed below, Section 108 of S. 240 \n     only provides authority for the Commission to bring actions \n     based on aiding and abetting under the Exchange Act, and \n     limits such actions to persons who act knowingly.\n       Recklessness: The Commission has recommended that Congress \n     expressly provide that recklessness is sufficient for \n     liability under Section 10(b), and codify the definition of \n     recklessness which was enunciated by the Seventh Circuit in \n     the Sundstrand case.\\2\\ S. 240 provides that defendants are \n     proportionately liable unless they commit ``knowing \n     securities fraud,'' which necessarily implies that there is \n     liability for reckless conduct, but does not expressly \n     provide that recklessness is sufficient.\n       Provisions of S. 240 that the Commission does not support--\n     The Commission opposes the following measures as currently \n     set forth in S. 240:\n       Safe Harbor Scienter Standard: Section 105 creates a safe \n     harbor for forward-looking statements. The Commission \n     believes that the complex task of fashioning an effective \n     safe harbor for forward-looking statements would be better \n     addressed through Commission rulemaking pursuant to express \n     statutory authority. The safe harbor in S. 240 contains \n     important exclusions, not present in H.R. 1058, that address \n     some areas of particular concern. However, the measure might \n     make it possible for some defendants to avoid liability for \n     certain false statements.\n       We believe that the safe harbor scienter standard would be \n     better if modified to include the following exclusions.\n       (c) Exclusions--The exclusion from liability under \n     subsection (a) with respect to a ``forward--looking \n     statement'' that is materially false or misleading is not \n     available: (i) for a natural person, if such person made such \n     statement knowing that such statement was materially false or \n     misleading when made; or (ii) for an issuer, if such \n     statement was made by or with the approval of an executive \n     officer (as defined by the Commission) of that issuer, if \n     such executive officer made, or approved the making of, such \n     statement knowing that such statement was materially false or \n     misleading when made.\\3\\\n       Provisions of S. 240 that cause concern or that need \n     clarification--The following provisions raise concerns or \n     need clarification and may require some adjustment in order \n     to achieve the desired effect:\n       Proportionate Liability: Section 202 generally limits the \n     application of joint and several liability to defendants \n     determined to have committed knowing securities fraud. Other \n     defendants would be proportionately liable; except that, if a \n     defendant's share of the damages were uncollectible, each \n     proportionately liable defendant would be liable for a \n     proportionate share of the uncollectible amount, up to an \n     additional amount equal to 50% of his own share.\n       The Commission has recommended that Congress first enact \n     other reform measures before adopting any form of \n     proportionate liability under which the burden of \n     uncollectible damages owned by an insolvent defendant must be \n     borne by the defrauded investor, rather than by solvent co-\n     defendants who violated the federal securities laws. If \n     Congress determines to adopt a system of proportionate \n     liability, such as that provided in S. 240, the Commission \n     has recommended that it not include issuers (who should \n     remain liable for all damages suffered) and that it be \n     limited to fraud-on-the-market cases, rather than applying \n     also to cases of direct, considered reliance.\n       Damages: Section 201 limits a plaintiff's damages to the \n     difference between the price paid by the plaintiff and the \n     value of the security during the 90-day period following \n     correction of the misstatement or omission. This provision \n     should be limited to fraud-on-the-market cases. In other \n     cases, this measure of damages may be wholly inappropriate. \n     In addition, the 90 day period should be shortened since \n     losses attributable to fraudulent statements may be offset by \n     price rises that are unrelated to the fraudulent activity.\n       Aiding and Abetting in Commission Actions: Section 108 \n     clarifies the availability in Commission actions under the \n     Exchange Act of liability for ``knowingly'' aiding and \n     abetting. This provision should also cover reckless aiding \n     and abetting and should be extended to the Securities Act, \n     and the Investment Company Act.\n       Appointment of Lead Plaintiff in Class Action: One \n     provision of Section 102 requires the court generally to \n     appoint as lead plaintiff the class member that has the \n     largest financial interest in case. While this approach has \n     merit, it may create additional litigation concerning the \n     qualifications of the lead plaintiff, particularly when the \n     class member with the greatest financial interest in the \n     litigation has ties to management or interests that may be \n     different from other class members. The Commission believes \n     that there should be greater clarification as to how this \n     concept will work in practice.\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\n\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Testimony of Arthur Levitt, Chairman, U.S. Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, Concerning Litigation Reform Proposals, \n     Before the Subcommittee on Securities, Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate (April 6, \n     1995).\n     \\2\\ In Sundstrand Corporation v. Sun Chemical Corporation, \n     553 F.2d 1033, 1045 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 434 U.S. 875 \n     (1977), the court used the following definition of \n     recklessness: ``a highly unreasonable omission, involving not \n     merely simple, or even inexcusable negligence, but an extreme \n     departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which \n     presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is \n     either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor \n     must have been aware of it.''\n     \\3\\ If the scienter standard is modified as suggested, the \n     Commission would support the safe harbor in S. 240. If, \n     however, the scienter standard is not so modified, the \n     Commission believes that the definition of forward-looking \n     statement in the safe harbor should be further narrowed, \n     although Commissioner Wallman believes that certain forward-\n     looking elements of the financial statements should receive \n     safe harbor protection, such as stock option valuation \n     disclosures.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the SEC has questions about this bill.\n  I look at the Boxer amendment as a way to say OK, in 180 days, let us \nhave a written report from the SEC to tell us if in fact this bill puts \na greater burden on our seniors, takes away some of their privileges \nand their rights.\n  Mr. President, I am going to retain the remainder of my time, \nalthough I will not use it unless some of my colleagues make some \ncomments that I feel I must respond to. So I will reserve the remainder \nof my time only to be used in case that does occur.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I intended to yield back our time because \nI believe that we will accept the Senator's amendment as it relates to \nthe study of the SEC. That will be my recommendation. Having said that, \nI know Senator Dodd, who is a cosponsor of this amendment, would like \nto speak to it so I yield such time as he will need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. Let me thank my colleague from New York. \nLet me just say to my very good friend--and those words are used \nlightly around here; when I speak of my colleague from California, they \nare meant as more than just a collegial gratuity--my very good friend \nfrom California has offered a good amendment. My intention is to \nsupport it because none of us, as I said the other day, Mr. President, \ncan say with absolute certainty every time we change the law what the \nimplications will be. We think over 4 years and more than 4,000 pages \nof congressional hearings and testimony, having put together what we \nthink is a balanced bill here, we know what the implications will be.\n  We made strong efforts in this legislation to try and protect those \nwho are truly defrauded, and hence proportionate liability does not \napply in those cases. We try and take care of smaller investors with a \nnet worth of $200,000 or less, so that they are protected as well.\n  I would like to say to my colleagues I am absolutely 100 percent \ncertain that there will not be some implications here for smaller \ninvestors and seniors. I think the amendment covers seniors and smaller \ninvestors.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Seniors and retirees.\n  Mr. DODD. Looking at this makes some sense. I think they would have \ndone it anyway but requiring it here in the law is not a bad provision \nto have. If I may point out to my colleague--and I do not know whether \nshe is interested in doing it--I do not know what the timeframe on the \nstudy is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is 180 days.\n  Mr. DODD. It is 180 days from passage. I might suggest that not only \nyou do it then, but it may be done every 6 months for a space of 2 or 3 \nyears because I would suggest that in just 6 months you may not get a \npicture. It may not be an adequate picture. You may need a bit longer \ntime to get at various increments along the way as to what the \nimplications are. Sometimes in 180 days you may not see any indication \nand you may get a false reading as to whether or not we have done \nsomething here that has a negative implication.\n  So the Senator may want to modify the amendment to require it at \nvarious stages along the way here so we do get snap shots taken at \nvarious milestones over the next several years. So I appreciate the \ncomments of my colleague from New York that this is an amendment we \nought to accept, and I would concur in that conclusion and thank my \ncolleague from California for offering the amendment.\n  Let me if I can just briefly, Mr. President, also address, while I \nhave the floor, the amendment raised by our colleague from Maryland. \nLet me first of all point out here when we set a net worth figure of \n$200,000 or less, we did it with the understanding that the average \nmedian net worth of people in this country is quite a bit less. We had \ntwo different studies, I would say to my colleagues. One study done by \nthe Census Bureau in 1993 has the median net worth of all people in \nthis country at $37,587. Another study done by the Federal Reserve has \nthe median net worth--this is a 1992 study--at $52,200 a year. So when \nSenator D'Amato, myself, and Senator Domenici set a net worth of \n$200,000 or less a year, we are going extensively beyond the median net \nworth of families in this country. Depending on which study, either the \nCensus Bureau or the Federal Reserve at $37,000 or $52,000, our figure \nat 200,000 goes well beyond the median income of people in this \ncountry, to try and protect the smaller investor. In fact, it goes four \ntimes beyond the median net worth.\n  I do not know the percentage of families, but I suspect it is in the \ntop 5 percent or so, maybe less, who would have net worth in excess of \n$200,000 a year.\n  So we made a significant effort here to not only just protect smaller \ninvestors. Now, maybe the people who live in Washington and those of us \nwho serve in Government with our incomes being what they are fail to \nrecognize that most people in this country have net worth substantially \nless than what people in Washington, DC, might accept as a reasonable \nnet worth.\n  At any rate, we set it at that level, and anyone who has a net worth \nless than that and has a loss of 10 percent of their net worth, \nobviously, is protected by the joint and several and not proportionate \nliability.\n  Now, with regard to the 10-percent figure, let me suggest that if we \nwere to eliminate that, you are in effect eliminating proportionate \nliability because, as I said, it is such a high level that you \nbasically exempt almost everybody in the country except for maybe 5 \npercent of the population. So you really have not done anything in \nterms of trying to inject proportionate liability into the process, \nwhich is what the goal of S. 240 is, to apply proportionate liability \nwhere you do not have the kind of intentional fraud and you have people \nwho are not that wealthy.\n  Now, why did we do that? Why proportionate liability? Is this some \ngratuitous favor to try and bail out some people here who would \notherwise be held fully accountable?\n  It is not that at all, Mr. President. I would say the core, central \nissue here, aside from one of simple fairness, where someone who is \nmarginally, marginally involved gets saddled with the full load of \npaying up all of these costs--and as we have pointed out over and over \nagain over the last several days of debate--it is not that we are \ngetting litigated results. It is not litigated results; 93 to 98 \npercent of these cases are settled. Why are they settled? They are \nsettled because your company lawyer says, ``Let me tell you something, \nMr. CEO, or Ms. Chief Executive Officer, or Mr. Chief Financial \nOfficer, or Ms. Chief Financial Officer. You run the risk here of \nlosing everything. If you go to trial on this, you lose everything.'' \nYou have a choice of settling or losing everything. And they opt to \nsay, ``Look, we will settle.'' That is what they do in 93 to 98 percent \nof the cases. They settle.\n  Now, you say, well what is so terrible about all of that? I would \ndraw my colleagues' attention to an article in today's Wall Street \nJournal, which is entitled ``Big Accounting Firms Weed Out Risky \nClients.'' The article points out the problem, and my colleagues ought \nto come to appreciate why there is a sense of urgency about trying to \ndeal with this problem. Lee Berton, the author of the article, points \nout that the large accounting firms--and the large accounting firms, \nparticularly in this country, are like the Good Housekeeping seal of \napproval for a firm-- are abandoning these clients.\n  They are not picking them up, and there is a real economic danger, I \nthink, in this country to have that trend line continue.\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\n  I quote from the article:\n\n       Big accounting firms say they have begun dropping risky \n     audit clients to lower their risk of lawsuits for allegedly \n     faulty audits. New companies, which have a particularly high \n     chance of failure, are affected most, because almost nothing \n     triggers lawsuits against accountants faster than company \n     failures.\n       . . . Peat Marwick, the fourth-biggest U.S. accounting \n     firm, is currently dropping 50 to 100 audit clients annually, \n     up from only zero only 20 years ago. . .. ``When a client we \n     audit goes bust . . . it costs a bundle in court if we're \n     sued by investors, whether we win or lose the case.''\n       . . . Mr. Lambert says that legal costs were ``staggering'' \n     for a lawsuit filed in a Federal court in Texas, alleging a \n     faulty review of a bank's books by Peat [Marwick]. The bank \n     was taken over by the Federal Government in 1992 after big \n     losses. The jury ruled in Peat's favor in 1993.\n\n  So you had a lawsuit that did not end up going anywhere--actually, it \nwent to trial in this particular case, and the decision was for Peat \nMarwick. Then listen to what happens.\n\n       The jury ruled in Peat's favor in 1993, but the firm had to \n     spend $7 million to defend itself.\n\n  The contract to handle the account that got them involved in the \nlawsuit was $15,000. That was the contract, but the lawsuit cost them \n$7 million, even though they won in the end. The intelligent business \ndecision here is to say, ``Look, stay away from these firms, these new \ntechnologies that are emerging where there is a lot of volatility in \nthem, don't go near them.''\n  The net effect of all this is we are losing the benefit of having the \ntop accounting firms in this country get in where they can make a huge \ndifference in these firms, but because of the fear of expending amounts \nvastly in excess of what the contracts are worth to them, they stay \naway.\n  Arthur Andersen ``has either dropped or declined to audit over 100 \ncompanies'' in the past 2 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 26, 1995]\n\n              Big Accounting Firms Weed Out Risky Clients\n\n                            (By Lee Berton)\n\n       If you have a big-name auditor, hold on tight. It's getting \n     tougher to find--and keep--prestigious outside auditors to \n     certify annual financial statements.\n       Big accounting firms say they have begun dropping risky \n     audit clients to lower their risk of lawsuits for allegedly \n     faulty audits. New companies, which have a particularly high \n     chance of failure, are affected most, because almost nothing \n     triggers lawsuits against accountants faster than company \n     failures.\n       But established companies are getting the ax too. KPMG Peat \n     Marwick, the fourth-biggest U.S. accounting firm, is \n     currently dropping 50 to 100 audit clients annually, up from \n     only zero to 20 five years ago, says Robert W. Lambert, the \n     firm's new director of risk management. ``When a client we \n     audit goes bust,'' he says, ``it costs us a bundle in court \n     if we're sued by investors, whether we win or lose the \n     case.''\n       Mr. Lambert says that legal costs were ``staggering'' for a \n     lawsuit filed in a federal court in Texas alleging a faulty \n     review of a bank's books by Peat. The bank was taken over by \n     the federal government in 1992 after big losses. The jury \n     ruled in Peat's favor in 1993, but the firm had to spend $7 \n     million to defend itself ``even though the fee for the job \n     was only $15,000,'' Mr. Lambert says. ``We just can't afford \n     to take on risky audit clients anymore.''\n       Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner of Arthur Andersen & \n     Co., another leading accounting firm, says his organization \n     has either dropped or declined to audit more than 100 \n     companies over the past two years. ``When a company has a \n     risky profile and its stock price is volatile, we're just not \n     going to jump in and do the audit and invite a lawsuit,'' \n     says Mr. Weinbach.\n       Audit clients dropped by the Big Six are often furious \n     because investors tend to feel safest with companies audited \n     by the biggest accounting firms. A Big Six opinion is ``like \n     the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on Wall Street,'' \n     maintains Chriss Street, chairman and chief executive of \n     Comprehensive Care Corp., a Newport Beach Calif., medical-\n     rehabilitation center operator that Andersen recently \n     dropped.\n       But the accounting firms say they have no choice. \n     Litigation settlement costs of the Big Six accounting firms \n     now exceed $1 billion a year. The firms say that even after \n     insurance reimbursement, these costs equal 12% of their \n     annual audit and accounting revenue.\n       No risky client can pay us enough money to defend ourselves \n     after the client develops problems,'' asserts J. Michael \n     Cook, chairman of Deloitte & Touche, the third biggest U.S. \n     accounting firm. ``We must reduce our legal risks to remain \n     viable.''\n       And he and other heads of Big Six firms say that if \n     Congress doesn't pass pending legislation reducing \n     accountants' litigation exposure, the firms will turn down \n     even more audit clients.\n       The biggest legal drain on accounting firms involves \n     settling lawsuits brought by disgruntled investors against \n     the auditors of collapsed companies. These suits usually \n     accuse the auditors of professional negligence in failing to \n     warn the public of the problems of a troubled client company.\n       To protect his firm against these costs, Mr. Cook says, \n     Deloitte has begun weeding out audit clients with potential \n     problems and refusing to handle the audits of companies \n     making initial public offerings, or IPOs, because so many of \n     them fail. And all of his competitors among the Big Six are \n     doing likewise. The portion of all IPOs audited by these \n     prestigious firms declined to 75% last year from 84% in 1992, \n     according to Emerson's Audit Change Report, a trade \n     publication.\n       Andersen's Mr. Weinbach says his firm uses new computer \n     software to measure the litigation risk of an audit client. \n     The software looks at the company's financial health, \n     industry performance, stock fluctuations and financial \n     controls among other information. Other firms have begun \n     asking clients to agree to arbitration or mediation rather \n     than filing lawsuits in case of disputes over fees or \n     performance.\n       Andersen now asks tax and consulting clients to sign \n     indemnification clauses that require the client to pay \n     Andersen's court costs if the accounting firm is sued by a \n     third party. For instance, litigation might arise if a real-\n     estate buyer got into a dispute over a project's performance \n     or price with the seller and Andersen had provided a \n     financial projection for the project. ``If the client doesn't \n     agree to indemnify us, we generally won't do the work,'' says \n     Mr. Weinbach.\n       BDO Seidman, the ninth-biggest U.S. accounting firm, two \n     years ago began asking clients of five U.S. offices to agree \n     to arbitrate disputes over fees and service quality rather \n     than go to court. And Ernst & Young, the second biggest U.S. \n     accounting firm, says that later this year it will begin \n     asking clients to agree to resolve disputes with it through \n     arbitration or mediation rather than by court suits. Philip \n     Laskawy, Ernst's chairman, says this shift will save Ernst \n     and its clients ``millions of dollars in legal fees.''\n       The accounting firms are swinging hardest at companies that \n     have actually experienced financial trouble. For instance, \n     Mr. Street of Comprehensive Care is irate that his company \n     recently got a terse letter from Andersen saying the company \n     no longer meets Andersen's audit profile and should seek \n     another auditor.\n       Andersen had been Comprehensive's auditor for three years \n     for an annual fee of $125,000. But in the past two years, \n     Andersen has ``qualified'' the company's annual report, \n     questing whether Comprehensive could continue as a ``going \n     concern.'' The company has reported losses in each of its \n     past five years, totaling close to $100 million.\n       Mr. Street, who was brought into Comprehensive about a year \n     ago, says that Andersen gave no warning that it planned to \n     drop the company. ``We were caught completely off guard and \n     were in the midst of restructuring and recapitalizing the \n     company with Andersen's help,'' he says. ``We feel that \n     Andersen abandoned us when we most needed them.''\n       Andersen won't comment specifically on why it dropped \n     Comprehensive as an audit client. But it says that ``in the \n     current litigious business environment, accounting firms are \n     forced to assess risks associated with current and future \n     clients.'' It adds: ``Comprehensive's historic performance \n     speaks for itself.''\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it goes to the very heart of why we put this \nbill together. We saw the trend lines where we are losing the expertise \nand ability. One of the provisions, by the way, we put in this bill is \nto require these accounting firms, if everything else is adopted, to \nseek out a report when they discover problems of fraud. That has not \nbeen a requirement in the law in the past, to actually serve as a \nquasi-governmental agency, if you will.\n  Obviously, the Federal Government cannot go around and audit every \nfirm in the country to determine whether it is doing its job or not. \nBut having these accounting firms do it, requiring them to report when \nthey discover any kind of wrongdoing, I think, is going to enhance \ntremendously our ability to pursue those firms where you have the \nintentional fraud, but also cause these firms to be far more careful \nabout how they do their business.\n  So if we adopt the Sarbanes amendment by eliminating the 10 percent, \nin effect, it is just the median income of $200,000, you have just \ndestroyed the whole purpose of proportionate liability. It goes right \nto the heart of what this Wall Street article points out today--the \nfact you are seeing these firms leave these audits, audits that serve \nall of us and also serve the investor.\n  That investor making the decision about where to put those hard-\nearned dollars is going to be less inclined to\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\ninvest in these firms that may be, in the overwhelming number of cases, \nhighly deserving of that investment, because they do not have that \n``Good Housekeeping seal of approval.'' The investor would probably shy \naway from it. Everybody loses in that kind of situation.\n  We are trying to help solve that problem by the provisions we have \nincluded in S. 240. Is it perfect? Is it guaranteed success? Absolutely \nnot. I would be the first one to tell you, no guarantees here. We think \nit will go to the heart of the problem, maybe help us solve it. But as \nthe Senator from California has offered with her amendment to take a \ngood look and see what the implications of this are, I think, makes \ngood sense, is sound judgment.\n  For those reasons, I support her amendment. But I oppose the \namendment offered by our colleague from Maryland. I would rather there \nbe an amendment offered eliminating proportionate liability, just \nstriking all proportionate liability because that is the net effect of \nthe amendment.\n  If you just have a net worth of $200,000, you have only 5 percent of \nyour investors at that, so it is really gone, in effect. It seems to me \nwhen median net worth is either $37,000 or $52,000--we have set it at \n$200,000--it is really going, to a large extent, beyond what many have \nsuggested we ought to do here. But I thought, and the Senator from New \nYork did, that by setting that higher bar, as well as including the 10-\npercent loss, that what we were trying to protect against with this \nprovision is the total economic devastation of someone. Again, \nobviously, if you eliminate that 10 percent, you lose that altogether.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I urge, with all due respect to my \nfriend and colleague from Maryland, rejection of his amendment, that we \naccept the amendment by the Senator from California, and I gather next \nwe will be talking about an amendment which I support, which is the \namendment being offered by the Senator from Nevada dealing with the \nstatute of limitations.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, at a later time, I will ask the Senator \nfrom California to consider whether she really wants to vote on this \namendment, because we are willing to accept it. Having said that, I \nwant to commend my colleague, the prime sponsor of this legislation, \nSenator Dodd, for very eloquently and very cogently stating the \nincredible burden that has been placed on the fine accounting firms of \nAmerica.\n  I might refer those who are interested to the report of the \ncommittee. I quote:\n\n       Accounting firms particularly have been hard hit by \n     securities litigation. The six largest firms face $10 billion \n     worth of 10b-5 claims. Their gross audit-related litigation \n     costs amounted to $783 million in 1992--more than 14 percent \n     of their audit revenues for that year. Former SEC \n     Commissioner Sommer, who heads the Public Oversight Board, \n     the independent body that oversees the accounting \n     profession's self-regulatory efforts, testified that, in view \n     of ``some recent judgments and the amounts being sought in \n     pending cases, it is not beyond the pale to believe, and some \n     responsible people do believe--that one or more major \n     [accounting] firms may ultimately be bankrupted.''\n\n  But the problem goes beyond just bankruptcy. The accounting firms are \nbeing priced out of the marketplace. They cannot afford, as Senator \nDodd indicated, to give their services to clients due to the great \nexposure they face, through no fault of their own, to being brought in \nto suits because they are the deep pockets, particularly where there is \na small firm or small company as the primary defendant.\n  That small firm then, or many small firms, are being deprived of \nhaving the best accounting firms; the American public are being \ndeprived of having the audit capacity and functions of our best; and, \nthird, the accounting profession is placed unnecessarily under a great, \ngreat strain.\n  It is just simply intolerable and unfair. Part of this bill is \ncrafted to eliminate that unfairness. It will eliminate the situation \nwhere people have no choice but to surrender to these lawsuits--\nsomething that happens in 93 percent of these suits. They cannot afford \nto go to trial and I do not think that is what the capital system \nshould be about.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1472\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the doctrine of joint liability permits \nan injured plaintiff to collect the full judgment from any defendant \nfound liable for any part of the injury. It means that no matter how \nremotely connected a defendant is to the events leading to plaintiff's \ninjury, a defendant could be required to satisfy the entire judgment.\n  The result is that lawyers for the plaintiffs add a whole host of \ndefendants to a lawsuit in an effort to ensure the plaintiff can get \nthe full judgment paid. With joint liability, it doesn't matter if you \nhad anything to do with the events leading up to the plaintiff's \ninjury. Instead, the chances of your getting sued depend upon how deep \nyour pockets are. The deeper the pocket, the more likely to be sued.\n  I'll illustrate with a negligence case: if a drunk driver injures an \nindividual on someone else's property, the property owner will be \njoined in the lawsuit. It happened to the Cincinnati Symphony \nOrchestra, only it wasn't even the property owner. The accident \nhappened near one of the orchestra's performance facilities. And the \norchestra, a nonprofit entity, was needlessly dragged into a $13 \nmillion lawsuit and put at risk for the judgment.\n  Nonprofit organizations, municipalities and small businesses can be \nhardest hit by joint liability. Although we don't think of these \ndefendants as wealthy or rich, they are usually adequately insured, \nwhich also makes them good candidates to be deep pockets. New York City \nspends more on personal injury awards and settlements--$270 million--\nthan it spends on funding public libraries.\n  In securities litigation, accountants, bankers, and insurers are \ntargets of abusive suits because of their deep pockets. One Big Eight \naccounting firm, Laventhol & Horwath, went bankrupt because the cost of \nfighting these suits became too prohibitive. The consequence of \ndragging these professional firms into these kinds of lawsuits is \nobvious: it becomes increasingly difficult for new businesses to get \nadvice from business professionals. And, it gets harder to find people \nto serve on corporate boards due to the fear of lawsuits.\n  This litigation explosion burdens the economy, retarding economic \ngrowth. It is essentially a tax imposed on every American. And every \npotential defendant has to take account, in the prices they set, for \nthe possibility of being dragged into a lawsuit.\n  During the product liability debate, I received a letter from the \nInstitute for the National Black Business Council, an association of \nminority business owners. Mr. Lou Collier, the president of the \ncouncil, wrote in support of expanding the product liability bill. \nWithout an expansion of the joint and several liability reform, Mr. \nCollier states, ``Millions of small businesses--restaurants, gas \nstation owners, hair stylists, nearly every small business you can \nthink of, would still face the threat of bankruptcy. That includes most \nAfrican-American firms.'' The latest census data shows that 49 percent \nof all black-owned firms are service firms, and Mr. Collier, on behalf \nof minority small business owners, asked us to improve the climate for \nsmall business, ``Small business owners and entrepreneurs have to \novercome staggering odds to build a successful company. They shouldn't \nhave to face a legal system where one frivolous lawsuit can force them \nto close their doors.''\n  The same arguments ring true in the context of securities litigation. \nThis amendment must be defeated because restoring joint liability means \nlittle improvement in the litigation climate.\n  Injured plaintiffs will still recover their full economic loss. But \nfor the subjective noneconomic loss, each defendant would be \nresponsible only for his or her proportionate share of harm caused.\n  This bill is fair and consistent with principles of individual \nresponsibility. It will put an end to the gamble taken\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\nby the trial bar when they join everyone in sight of an alleged harm. I \nurge that the amendment be rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1469\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Bryan amendment \nNo. 1469.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, am I correctly informed? I believe we have \na time agreement of 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided. Am I correct, I \ninquire of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Since I am the advocate of the amendment, may the Senator \nfrom Nevada presume that he controls 45 minutes of the time that is \nallotted to those who are in support of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 15 minutes at this point, Mr. President.\n  My colleagues will recall that we began the debate on this amendment \nlast Friday shortly before we recessed for the weekend. I want to make \njust a couple of points in general about this. There are a number of \nthings that have divided us as we have debated S. 240, but there are \nsome things in which the prime sponsor of this legislation, Senator \nDodd, and I are in agreement, and I acknowledge, as he has previously \nindicated on the floor, Senator Dodd, as the prime sponsor of S. 240, \nis in support of the amendment, which I will describe in a moment.\n  But first let me give a little bit of background. My colleagues will \nrecall in 1991 the Supreme Court of the United States decided the Lampf \ncase, as it was called--and the Lampf case, in effect, imposed a \nstatute of limitations which is a bar to securities litigation 1 year \nfrom the point that the plaintiff discovers the fraud and in no event \nmore than 3 years in the actual occurrence of the fraud.\n\n  Now, that came as quite a shock and surprise to those that are in the \nsecurities business, because the accepted interpretation prior to that \nhad been that you looked to the statute of limitations in the State in \nwhich the action originated. Immediately, as a result of that, because \nthe Court's decision was retroactive; that is, there were a number of \ncases pending, as well as prospective; that is, to place a bar on any \nactions to be filed in the future, a number of us came to the floor, \nand the Senate Banking Committee at that time unanimously reported out \nthe 2-to-5-year statute of limitations proposal--2 years from the date \nof discovery of the fraud, in no event beyond 5 years. That is what \nthis amendment does. Under the current print, 1-to-3 is the statute of \nlimitations timing. Under the Bryan amendment, it could be 2 to 5 \nyears. This is what the Banking Committee, in 1991, had unanimously \nagreed should go forward.\n  Moreover, I think it is important for my colleagues--and there are \napproximately 50 of them who have signed onto this legislation--S. 240, \nas introduced, contains the 2-year/5-year statute of limitations. So \nthis amendment, somewhat of an anomaly, does not change the original \nlanguage of S. 240 but seeks to restore to the bill the language which \nwas originally in the bill at the time it was introduced and language, \nat least by implication, that 50 of our colleagues, as cosponsors of \nthe legislation, have supported.\n  So this is not something that comes as after the fact--2-to-5 years.\n  Why is the 2-to-5 years important? I realize that people are not \nliterally hanging over the edges of their seats in the galleries as we \ndiscuss what appears to be a very abstract legal issue. First, let me \nsay that it has absolutely nothing about frivolous lawsuits--not one \nthing. We are talking about a lawsuit which, by definition, is \nmeritorious but cannot be filed under the current law if indeed it is \nafter the 1-year point in which the plaintiff discovers the fraud, or \nin no event beyond 3 years.\n  So this does not have a thing to do with frivolous litigation. I \nunderstand the concern of my colleagues and I share it. We ought to act \nagainst frivolous lawsuits, and there are provisions in S. 240 that \ndeal with rule 11 and some other provisions that I think are \nmeritorious. So no one who is approaching this amendment ought to be \nmisled that somehow a vote against this amendment protects the innocent \nfrom frivolous litigation. This simply gives you the right to get into \nthe courthouse door. Without this amendment, you are saying 1 year, 3 \nyears, and you are barred.\n  Now, who supports the amendment? Well, first, let me indicate to my \ncolleagues that the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nhas repeatedly testified in favor of extending the statute of \nlimitations. Most recently, on April 6, 1995, Chairman Levitt testified \nbefore the subcommittee that:\n\n       Extending the statute of limitations is warranted because \n     many securities frauds are inherently complex, and the law \n     should not reward a perpetrator of a fraud who successfully \n     conceals its existence for more than three years.\n\n  So the present Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nsays that it is important to protect innocent investors who have been \ndefrauded from those who are inherently clever enough to conceal it to \nprovide for a longer statute of limitations. Then he went on by way of \nexplanation to say that even with all of the resources that are \navailable to the SEC, the staff that is available with the expertise \nthat they have, with all of the kind of background information they \nhave as to what is happening in the marketplace generally, that it \ntakes approximately 2.25 years to complete an investigation. Now, that \nis beyond the period of time that the 1-to-3 year statute would \nprovide. This is not partisan, this is not a Democratic chairman and \nthe Republican SEC under President Bush who felt differently. The \nformer chairman, the last Republican chairman was Richard Breeden. He \nhad this to say about the proposed 2-to-5 year statute, and \nspecifically about the unfairness and the limiting ability of a 2-year \nstatute:\n\n       Had a 3-year statute of limitations been in effect and had \n     it been applied to the SEC, approximately one-half of the \n     cases against Drexel Burnham, a large part of the case of \n     Equity Funding, one of the largest frauds in the history of \n     the United States, and the entire case against E.F. Hutton \n     for check kiting would have been barred from the courthouse.\n\n  Again, these were meritorious cases. The recovery would have been \nprevented because the statute of limitations would have constituted a \nbar. In that period of the 1980's where we have talked about Charles \nKeating and we talked about Ivan Boesky, another name has had \nprominence and that is Michael Milken. Here is what the sentencing \njudge had to say to him with respect to the complexity of securities \nmatters and their difficulty:\n\n       You may have committed only subtle crimes--\n\n  This was being addressed to Mr. Milken at the time of sentencing.\n\n       . . . not because you were not disposed to any criminal \n     behavior but because you were willing to commit only crimes \n     that were unlikely to be detected. We see often in this court \n     individuals who would be unwilling to rob a bank, but who \n     readily cash Social Security checks that are not theirs when \n     checks come to them in the mail because they are not likely \n     to be caught in doing so . . . You also committed crimes that \n     are hard to detect, and crimes that are hard to detect \n     warrant greater punishment in order to be effective in \n     deterring others from committing them.\n\n  These are crimes that are very hard to detect and are particularly \nvery difficult to detect when we are talking about small plaintiffs who \ndo not have the resources available to them that the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the North American Association of Securities \nDealers and others might have.\n  In the Lampf case itself, which was a very narrowly divided case, 5-\n4, one of the dissenting Justices, Justice Kennedy, had this to say:\n\n       Concealment is inherent in most securities fraud cases. The \n     most extensive and corrupt schemes may not be discovered \n     within the time allowed for bringing an express cause of \n     action under the 1934 act. Ponzi schemes, for example, can \n     maintain the illusion of a profit-making enterprise for \n     years, and sophisticated investors may not be able to \n     discover the fraud until long after its perpetration. The \n     practicalities of litigation, indeed the simple facts of \n     business life, are such that the rule adopted today--\n\n  Referring to the majority of the court that adopted the more limiting \n1 and 3 year statute of limitations.\n\n     will ``thwart the legislative purpose of creating an \n     effective remedy'' for victims of securities fraud. By \n     adopting a 3-year period of repose, the Court makes a section \n     10(b) action all but a dead letter for injured investors who \n     by no conceivable standard of fairness or practicality can be \n     expected to file a\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\n     suit within 3 years after the violation occurred.\n\n  In its brief before the Supreme Court, the SEC pointed out the \ndifficulty that the shorter limitation period ``would deprive many \ndefrauded investors of a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate their \nrights.'' Here is what the SEC, in the brief, went on to say:\n\n       Especially in complex cases, plaintiffs often ``do not \n     discover the fraud until long after its perpetration.'' \n     Violations involving financial fraud, for instance, often go \n     undetected until the enterprise fails, an event that may \n     occur years after the violation. Moreover, as the \n     securities markets have grown in size and complexity, \n     frauds have become increasingly difficult to discover.\n\n  An example of that, Mr. President, is the municipal bond. They are \nparticularly susceptible to concealment. In a typical municipal bond \noffering, 2 to 3 years of interest payable to the bondholder is placed \nin an escrow account, so the bondholders can have no inkling anything \nhas gone awry until they do not receive an interest payment--oftentimes \nmany years after the closing of the offering. The average timespan \nbetween issue date in municipal bonds and the date of default in \nrepayment is approximately 4.5 years.\n  Limited partnerships have the same susceptibility. Again, as the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association--and some of my \ncolleagues may not have had the opportunity to interface with them; \nthese are the securities administrators of the 50 States, who are \ncharged with enforcement of securities law at the State level--as they \nhave testified, limited partnerships in which investors have poured \nmore than $150 billion since 1980--\n\n       . . . often run for as many as 7 to 10 years. Customer \n     account statements--a primary means of detecting fraud or \n     misconduct--reflect only the original purchase price of the \n     partnership, not the current market value. Therefore, it may \n     only be at the expiration of the partnership that an investor \n     uncovers misconduct or wrongdoing. Under Lampf, [the 1- to 3-\n     year statute decided in that case] that investor would be \n     precluded from seeking redress in the courts, for no reason \n     other than the decision to purchase a long-term investment. \n     Holders of zero coupon bonds will face similar difficulties \n     in uncovering fraud in the short period of time allowed under \n     Lampf.\n\n  The point, I think, that is to be made here is that we have talked a \ngreat deal about balance. Every provision that I can see that is \ncontained in S. 240 is designed to provide additional protection for \nsecurities underwriters. Aiders and abetters are not included. Safe \nharbor statements are made more generous.\n  The wealthiest investor, in effect, becomes the chief of the last, \nand one can go on and on. Of all of the provisions contained in this \nlegislation, in its original form, only the extension of the statute of \nlimitations could be fairly said to benefit the innocent investor.\n  For those of my colleagues who are truly seeking balance as they \napproach this legislation, and who support and will vote for the final \nversion of S. 240, this is really your only opportunity at this stage \nto provide that kind of balance by extending the statute of \nlimitations.\n  Here is what Mark Griffin, who is the head of the Utah Securities \nDivision, had to say in testimony before the Banking Committee. He said \nthe current period for filing fraud actions is ``unduly short.'' Going \non, he said:\n\n       . . . [it] is the experience of State securities regulators \n     that victims of investment fraud often have no way of \n     knowing, nor reason to suspect for what may be many years, \n     the truth about the mishandling or abuse of their \n     investments.\n\n  That comes from the security administrator in the State of Utah.\n  Mr. President, in looking at what States have done, the testimony is \nthat 60 percent of the jurisdictions have longer statutes, and ``13 \nStates recognize the concept of equitable tolling, in which the \nlimitations period starts running only after the fraud is discovered.''\n  Among those States are Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Massachusetts, New \nJersey, Washington, and Wisconsin. Many other States have longer \nstatutes, as well, including California, Pennsylvania, my own state of \nNevada, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and New York.\n  It seems to me that in an era in which we believe that not all wisdom \nresides in the banks of the Potomac, looking at the experiences at the \nState level could be particularly instructive as we process this \nstatute of limitations amendment.\n  The effect of the shortened statute of limitations is simply \ndevastating, and has absolutely nothing, Mr. President, to do with \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  For example, had the Lampf rule been in effect, investor cases with \nrespect to such notorious fraud as Lincoln Savings and Loan, Washington \nPublic Power Supply System, Executive Life Insurance, Home-Stake \nProduction Co., and Crazy Eddie would have been barred.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for keeping me cognizant \nof the time.\n  In fact, Charles Keating attempted to have his case dismissed on \nLampf grounds, and that was the genesis of our effort to keep those \ncases alive. The Congress responded by making sure that the Court's \ndecision did not have a retroactive effect on those cases that were \npending. According to a study released by the House Subcommittee on \nTelecommunications and Finance in 1991 after the Lampf decision, over \n$5 billion in pending fraud claims were dismissed or threatened with \ndismissal based on the shortened statute of limitations.\n  This amendment tracks the exact formula that is urged upon us by the \nSEC, an extension that would allow cases to be filed up to 5 years \nafter violation has occurred, provided they are brought within 2 years \nafter discovery of the violation.\n  As I pointed out at the outset, S. 240 in its original form contained \nan extension of the statute of limitations. I commend my colleague and \ngood friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut, who has \ntaken a lead on this case. He has long supported the longer statute of \nlimitations. I commend his effort.\n  I might say that in previous Congresses, subsequent to the Lampf \ndecision, efforts to make changes in the securities litigation system \nhave all recognized the wisdom of the longer statute of limitations of \n2 to 5 years.\n  I note it is somewhat anomalous--we have the situation in which the \namendment on the floor is designed to restore what the introducer of \nthe bill must surely have intended, because they cast it in the \nidentical language that we are seeking to place back into the bill.\n  In addition to the securities regulators at the national level and \nthe State level, this amendment enjoys the support of the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Public Citizen, the Council of Institutional \nInvestors, the United Shareholders Association, the Bond Investors \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Government Finance \nOfficers Association, and the National Association of County Treasurers \nand Finance Officers, to list but a few.\n  So for my colleagues who may have some motivation in saying ``Look, \nthe lawyers are responsible for all of the ills in America and have \ndone terrible things with respect to the securities litigation,'' they \nhave an opportunity to support other provisions in the law.\n  Please, in the interest of striking back at these securities lawyers, \ndo not deprive, do not undermine the right of innocent investors to \nsimply present their case, to simply present their case; simply give \nthem the key to get into the courthouse door. And all these other \nprovisions that are included with respect to lawyer sanctions, which I \nhappen to agree with if it is a frivolous case, then they can come into \nplace and operate to serve as a bar to the frivolous case.\n  This is a case that deprives the innocent investor with a meritorious \ncause of action from ever having his or her case presented because of \nthe cleverness of the wrongdoer, the defrauder. We ought not, it seems \nto me, as a matter of public policy, say, ``Look, we ought to provide \nthe benefits in our society to those who are clever enough to conceal \ntheir wrongdoing and perpetrate frauds before the victims find out.''\n  I do not think any Member of the Senate can defend that kind of a \npublic policy.\n  I note the distinguished majority leader is on the floor and may seek \nrecognition. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the pending amendment?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me point out that one of the finest, \nmost skilled, and eloquent lawyers, when it comes to interpretation of \nthe law, is my friend, the Senator from Nevada. I find myself at a \ndistinct disadvantage when having to take any position that is contrary \nto one that he is expounding on. Such is the case here. I do not \npretend to be his equal.\n  However, I will attempt to explain a concern to my colleagues \nregarding the extension of the statute of limitations. That concern is \nthat if we extend the statute of limitations we will open the door to \nmore mischief.\n  At first, I was ambivalent on this particular question, as to whether \nthe statute of limitations should be 1 and 3 years or 2 and 5; I \nconsidered extending the time as is done in some of the State statutes. \nMy friend and colleague explained how this came about, how we had, \nactually, no statutory law until the Supreme Court in its Lampf \ndecision in 1991 said: the 1-year and 3-year statute of limitations is \nrooted in common law and should be the uniform limit.\n  Some said that this statute would preclude meritorious suits. Indeed, \nthere may be some curtailment of individual investor suits, However, \nhaving said that, this statute of limitations will not preclude suits \nbeing brought under longer State statutes, nor will it preclude the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission from bringing suits in cases of \nfraud, where the SEC has no statute of limitations.\n  There are examples of the SEC bringing suits, after the statute of \nlimitations has expired; suits in which large settlements have been \nrecovered. In one rather recent case, the Prudential case, there the \nsettlement was $660 million. The SEC has recovered notable settlements \nin some other large cases--the Drexel-Burnham-Lambert case brought $400 \nmillion in disgorgement. Again, the statute of limitations is not a bar \nfor the SEC.\n  So, while the statute of limitations may be a bar to some individuals \nare aggrieved, if there is a serious case there is no doubt in my mind, \nnor, I think, in anybody's mind, that the Securities and Exchange \nCommission will bring a suit. My staff has reviewed some of the \nhistorical debate on the general question of how long the statute of \nlimitations should be.\n  Back in 1934, when this issue was first debated in the context of the \nneed for a fraud statute, Senator Kean made a statement on what he felt \nwas the reason we should limit the filing of suits to within 1 year \nfrom the actual time of discovery. I quote from Senator Kean:\n\n       If a man buys something today and discovers tomorrow that \n     some mistake has been made and perhaps he has grounds to sue \n     because of fraud, under the terms of the bill he must bring \n     the suit within 1 year. But suppose he thinks perhaps the \n     bonds I have bought will go up. I will not bring suit \n     until I find out about that. If the bonds go down, then I \n     will have the option of suing these people and trying to \n     recover. If the bonds go up, then I will not sue because I \n     can get a profit on them.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest to you that by extending the statute of \nlimitations, what we do is open the door for those people who wait and \nsee if anything comes out over time. It becomes much easier to create a \nlawsuit and to force a settlement if we allow a longer period of time \nfor something, anything, to be discovered. This extended statute of \nlimitations opens the door to the kinds of litigation we see now, but \nthese enterprising entrepreneurial lawyers will have a longer period of \ntime in which to bring their claim. Certainly this Senator does not \nwant to protect anyone who has been involved in fraud. Again, if there \nhas been an egregious fraud, there is no doubt in this Senator's mind \nthat the Securities and Exchange Commission will do the business of the \npeople, which they have done in the past.\n  But businesses are entitled to some certainty that they will not be \nsued. I think my friend, Senator Dodd, quite aptly stated his argument \nas it relates to the inventive, creative entrepreneurial petitioner of \nthe law. I believe my friend called them buccaneering barristers. I \nthink extending the statute of limitations just gives them a longer \nperiod of time to practice their craft of filing suits without merit.\n  If there is a legitimate fraud, even if it is discovered and 10 years \ndown the road and it has brought harm, then as far as I am concerned I \nwant the situation to be rectified. I know that there is a body who can \ndo that; that is, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Let me say again this is an area where I think reasonable people can \nhave some differences. I, myself, have gone back and forth on this \nissue. It was only when I was convinced that there was the opportunity \nto close down some of the people who are not practicing law as they \nshould, who are more interested in creating situations where they force \nsettlement, and at the same time we would not leave that door open for \ndefrauded people to be further victimized, that I decided on the \nstatute of limitations in this legislation.\n  That is why I will be forced to oppose my colleague's amendment, as \nthoughtfully and as articulately as he has presented it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Connecticut, after which I hope to be able to respond to \nthe debate of my good friend, the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield to me 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment by my \ncolleague from Nevada.\n  Like my good friend from New York, I understand the arguments on the \nother side. I suppose one might say in this debate what is magical \nabout 1 and 3 or 2 and 5? I presume that if we made it 2 and 5, there \nwould be those who would say it ought to be 3 and 7, or 4 and 8. You \ncould run the string out. Then there are some who think you should not \nhave any statute of limitations, I say to the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. So you are never going to satisfy everybody with some of these \nprovisions.\n  Senator Domenici and I originally offered this bill back several \nyears ago, and we included an extension of the statute of limitations \nhere to 2 and 5 years on the theory that it contributed to the balance \nof the legislation. It is a crucial part of the balance between \ninvestor's and defendant's rights, plaintiff's and defendant's rights. \nOur colleague from Nevada has promptly pointed out the legislative or \nlegal history of this.\n  The Supreme Court decision in Lampf versus Gilbertson established the \nlimits of 3 years after fraud occurred, or 1 year after it was \ndiscovered. It is simply too little time, in my view, to ensure that \ninvestors have the necessary time to bring an action. Justice Anthony \nKennedy, in his dissent in the Lampf decision said, and I think it is \nworth noting: ``Concealment is inherent in most of the securities fraud \ncases.'' And it is tough fraud to find, I point out to the Chair.\n\n       The most extensive and corrupt schemes may not be \n     discovered within the time allowed. Ponzi schemes, for \n     example, can maintain the illusion of a profit-making \n     enterprise for years, and sophisticated investors may not be \n     able to discover the fraud until long after its perpetration.\n\n  The SEC and the Council of Institutional Investors support extending \nthe statute of limitations, and, frankly, I am concerned that unlike S. \n240, this amendment does not contain language that requires an investor \nto use reasonable diligence.\n  This is the one point on which I have some disagreement with on the \namendment offered by my colleague from Nevada. Even though we disagree \non this point, I still intend to support the amendment. I think \nrequiring reasonable diligence on the part of investors is not asking \ntoo much. There has to be some burdens and responsibilities people \nassume when they engage in this activity. In our original bill that \nincluded an extension of the statute of limitations, we required \nreasonable diligence on the part of the investor. That reasonable \ndiligence is no longer included in the amendment being offered by the \ndistinguished Senator\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\nfrom Nevada. The reason I say that is because I think it ought to be a \ndistinction made between the lazy investor and the diligent investor. \nWe make no distinction with this amendment; that is, the current \nstandard in most private actions under our securities laws.\n  Frankly, I am concerned that the unintended impact of this amendment, \nshould it be adopted, will be to grant more time in effect to investors \nwho know nothing about their investments or care nothing about them and \nthose who exercise reasonable care.\n  I think we ought to be trying to inject responsibility on the part of \neverybody involved in these activities. While this is a significant \ndeparture from the original Domenici-Dodd language on the statute of \nlimitations, as I mentioned a moment ago, I will not oppose the \namendment on that basis alone.\n  So when this amendment is considered and voted on, I will cast a vote \nfor it for the reasons I have identified. I think in this day and age \nof technology, being what it is with the sophistication that is out \nthere, it is an awful lot to expect even a knowledgeable investor to be \nable to pick up on some of these activities, as they might have even a \nfew short years ago, in the absence of high technology.\n  So trying to keep pace with that high technology, providing a bit \nmore time here, is not an unreasonable request in my view.\n  For that reason, I commend the Senator from Nevada for his comment. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time do I have under \nmy control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 20 minutes and 4 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The able distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, who is my \nfriend, raised two objections as I understand the thrust of his \nargument. I must just say as an aside, it makes me very, very nervous \nwhen the able chairman lavishes great praise upon a more junior member \nof the committee because no one is more sophisticated than the \ndistinguished chairman in making his point. He speaks in the idiomatic \nlanguage of the street and people understand where he is coming from, \nand he speaks with clarity that every lawyer in America can only hope \nto equal. So I am quite concerned when I receive this praise.\n  He made two points. One, he said that by extending the statute of \nlimitations as we propose to do in this amendment we would thereby \nincrease the amount of litigation.\n  Let me just suggest that the experience shows quite to the contrary. \nMy colleagues will note that I have had a chart prepared tracing the \nexperience of the past 20 years, from 1974 to 1993. As my colleagues \nwill note, that represents a fairly level activity. In fact, the most \nnumber of cases filed in any one year was 315. Last year was 290. And \nas you will note, the statute of limitations case was not cited until \n1991. Prior to that, the longer statute of limitations existed. There \nwere actually in many years fewer cases than had been filed since the \nstatute of limitations result.\n  So may I say, with all due respect, I think the experience is \ncontrary to his assertion that more cases would be filed. In point of \nfact, I think an argument can be made that the shorter statute of \nlimitations may encourage haste in filing such actions which is clearly \ncontrary to the purpose that he and I and I think all of our colleagues \nhave in terms of trying to discourage such litigation.\n  Second, he makes the point that the SEC is available, and he is quite \ncorrect, but I think it is important to point out that when the SEC \nbrings an action, it brings an action to impose a fine, penalty or \nsanction, but it does not--I think this is a very important \ndistinction--seek to recover money that investors have lost. So it is a \nphilosophically different role. One is akin to a prosecutorial agency \nin which sanctions, fine and imprisonment may result. The purpose of \nthe individual filing is to recover his or her loss.\n  Even if one thought the SEC might do an adequate job, the testimony \nby Mr. Breeden, the former chairman, was that it would require another \n800 to 900 people serving in that office to offset the inability of \nprivate causes of action to be brought under S. 240 as constituted, and \nin the committee report on this particular bill it indicates that the \ncost of providing those additional resources to the SEC would be \nanother $250 million over the previous 5 years.\n  Let me say that I think, like most of us, we gain considerable \ninsight over the years as we have served, and I was pleased to have my \nfriend's support and his leadership in 1991 when we sought to do the \nvery thing we are seeking to do in the Chamber this afternoon, and that \nis to extend the statute of limitations from 1 to 3 to 2 to 5. And I \nwish to give my friend an opportunity to engage me in a colloquy if he \nchooses to do so. But may I respectfully say I think the Senator from \nNew York was absolutely right in 1991, as we sought to process the \ncorrective legislation in the aftermath of the Lampf case by supporting \nthen a 2- to 5-year statute of limitations, and I hesitate to say he \nhas not grown in wisdom over the intervening years but I think that he \nclearly was more correct then than he is now.\n  I would be happy to engage my colleague in any conversation he might \ncare to in terms of this debate. I just do not see that there is any \nreason today, of course, not to go for the 2- to 5-year statute of \nlimitations. The same circumstances exist, it seems to me, and I want \nto give my good friend a chance to share with me the benefit of his \nadditional wisdom.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I appreciate the opportunity to engage my friend in \ndialog in the spirit of the Senate. As I said, I was ambivalent on this \nissue. I have had numerous constituents and groups who have come to me \nand said: Senator, we are very much concerned that leaving the door \nopen, particularly extending the statute of limitations to 5 years, \nwill just create added exposure to these suits. We cannot extend the \nstatute of limitations, unfortunately, because of those individuals who \ndo not and have not practiced law with the same spirit and \nenlightenment of my colleague from Nevada.\n  I understand he has joined with us and voted with us on a number of \nmatters, which some might consider procedural but are awfully \nimportant, aimed at reducing the abuses in this system; the race to the \ncourthouse, the buying of people to put oneself in a position to bring \nthese suits, and the plaintiffs for hire who let their names be used \nfor bonuses.\n  When my colleague says to me he wants to stop this abuse, I know that \nto be the case. But those in the industries, in the emerging companies \nsay, ``You know, if you keep that door open, there is just a stronger \nlikelihood that there will be that inventive lawsuit later on that \nholds them harmless.''\n  I feel I must be supportive of those companies and that theory. We \nmust not abandon these firms. Let me say once again, even if there has \nbeen fraud and it is discovered only 5 years or 6 years after the \nstatute of limitations has expired the Securities and Exchange \nCommission can bring suit.\n  Nor have we placed a disproportionate burden on the SEC. They have \nrepeatedly said that they do not want to be in the position where they \nhave to be the eyes and ears for all, that, there is a proper place for \nindividuals and their lawyers to bring these class action cases.\n  I think that by limiting private rights of action to 1 and 3 years \nand yet having no limit, no statute of limitations for the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, that we strike a proper balance. It was in \nthat spirit that I came to this decision.\n  Second, it was also in that spirit that I could put together a \nmajority----\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I interrupt my friend?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. To pass out this bill. I want to be candid.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And I appreciate that. The concern that I have is that we \nare engaging in this discussion and the time may run out.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield to my friend any time that he may need.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator be willing to take part of his time to \nengage in the colloquy?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Oh, yes. I ask unanimous consent that the last 5 minutes \nbe charged to myself.\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I finished my statement, and I will be glad to yield to \nmy friend any additional time. How much time remains, might I inquire \nof the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 31 minutes 40 \nseconds remaining and the Senator from Nevada has 17\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining with the exchange of time conceding 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think we are going to be fine. Let me say, I appreciate \nhis fairness. He did not have to do that, and I think that speaks well \nfor him. I did not want to cut him off. I did not want to be precluded \nfrom making final comments. If the Senator has concluded, I would like \nto make a response and yield the floor back to him.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I had completed my observations how we find ourselves in \nthis position. And there is that necessity, in any attempt to craft \nlegislation--I have to say that my colleague is offering amendments \nbecause he is not happy with all the provisions of this bill and wants \nto make it better, to enhance the bill--to put together a package that \ncan build a coalition, and this was a major concern to quite a few \nSenators on my side, a very, very big concern.\n  I can see their point. If I had my druthers, I might say what is \nwrong with 2 and 5, but I heard from many groups, and numerous \nassociations, who were quite persuasive as to why this would be a \nretreat.\n  One last observation. In this legislation we are attempting to reduce \nthe exposure to unfair suits; it sends a very different message if we \nextend the statute of limitations. How can we say this cuts down on \nfrivolous suits when people think ``My gosh, you are broadening the \ntime to bring them.''\n  The Supreme Court has said 1 year and 3 years is sufficient, and now \nwe have amendments to extend it to 2 and 5. We cannot support that. I \nmust tell you there are a number of my colleagues who felt very, very \nstrongly, that 1 year and 3 years was the right statute of limitations \nand that is why, given the fact I knew we had the support of the SEC, I \nsupported this position. I share that with my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished chairman. I ask unanimous \nconsent to yield 2 additional minutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me say, I appreciate the explanation the chairman has \ngiven. It is a matter of balance. Again, I respond with great respect \nthat the role of the SEC is not to recover those losses, and that is \nsomething that greatly troubles me, that individuals who have lost \nmoney, who are totally innocent, although the SEC would not be \nprecluded from bringing an action, that action is not to recover money \nfor them but simply to impose the appropriate fine, penalty, sanction, \nthat may exist for the violation.\n  Second, I, too, was exposed to the arguments made by those who reach \na different conclusion than I do that the shorter statute of \nlimitations protects them from some lawsuits.\n  On the other hand, I must say that in balancing, I found the \narguments of the securities regulators--the SEC, the States securities, \nthe State and local government finance officials--who all argued that \nthe 2 to 5 was necessary. We all put into the scales of justice our \nindividual component parts, and I would just respectfully say, engaging \nmy good friend in colloquy, that ultimately that is what persuaded me \non the longer statute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to ask the Senator, as I understand it, \nnot only the SEC but the FDIC and State securities regulators all \njoined the SEC in seeking to, in effect, overturn the Lampf decision \nand go to the 2-and-5-year standard for the statute of limitations; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is correct. The distinguished ranking member from \nMaryland is correct. They all uniformly support that position.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And, in fact, I have a quote from SEC Chairman Breeden. \nThis was in 1991. This is the Republican Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, in which he said:\n\n       The timeframe set forth in the Supreme Court's decision is \n     unrealistically short and will do undue damage to the ability \n     of private litigants to sue.\n\n  He then went on to point out that in many cases:\n\n       Events only come to light years after the original \n     distribution of securities and the cases could well mean that \n     by the time investors discover they have a case, they are \n     already barred from the courthouse.\n\n  Will the Senator yield me just 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to yield to the distinguished ranking \nmember such time as he needs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. D'Amato). The Senator from Nevada has \n14\\1/2\\ minutes; the Senator from Minnesota has 30 minutes 27 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will defer and let the Senator from Minnesota proceed \nbefore we use the time on this side.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada. In Lampf versus Gilbertson, the \nU.S. Supreme Court established the period of time in which attorneys \nmay file claims under the implied right of action found in 10b-5, and \nthat was 1 year after the plaintiff knew of the alleged violation and 3 \nyears after the alleged violation occurred.\n  While critics of this legislation have seized upon the statute of \nlimitations as a wedge to defeat this important reform measure, they \nhave failed to present a convincing case of why this period should be \nextended. In the years since the Lampf decision, we have not seen a \nsurge in the number of actions dismissed because of the limitation \nperiod. Instead, the evidence points to just the opposite conclusion. \nSince the Lampf decision, we have witnessed an increase in the number \nof complex claims filed within days, even hours, after a movement in \nthe market.\n  Plaintiffs with meritorious claims have more than enough time to file \ntheir claims, but, unfortunately, so do strike suit attorneys. There \nare a number of reasons, however, why the current statute of \nlimitations should be preserved. For example, a longer period of \nlimitations makes it more difficult for innocent defendants to defend \nthemselves in court. As a result, strike suit attorneys will have an \neasier time forcing these defendants into exorbitant settlements.\n  These settlements, by the way, rarely benefit any real injured class \nof investors. They simply go to enrich an attorney and, worse, the \nresult of these settlements are higher prices for consumers, lost jobs \nfor workers, and a weaker economy. In other words, consumers lose, it \nis the workers who lose, victims of real valid securities fraud actions \nlose--everyone loses, again, except for the attorneys.\n  S. 240 is designed to reverse this trend, to weed out the frivolous \nlitigation that robs consumers of their hard-earned dollars, to make it \neasier for innocent parties to defend themselves against meritless \ncharges, to free our economy from the litigation bonanza that has made \nus less competitive in the global marketplace.\n  If the Senate adopts this amendment, it will do the opposite, and we \nwill do a major disservice to the people we represent.\n  Again, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The chart that the Senator from Nevada put up back \nthere indicates that there was no major number of lawsuits filed \nsubsequent to the Lampf decision. I do not know where, in fact, the \nhighest figure preceded the Lampf decision. As I understand it, that \nwas 315, and since then, it is now 290. On what basis does the Senator \nmake the assertion that following the Lampf decision there was an \nupsurge in the number of cases filed?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Well, I hate to differ, but the statistics, according to \nsome of the research that we have done, do not correspond with the \nstatistics that the\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nSenator from Nevada has produced. So we still maintain that the 1 and \n3----\n  Mr. SARBANES. These figures, as I understand it, are from the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. What figures is the Senator \nusing? What are they, and where do they come from?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I was talking with my staff, and that is according to the \nSEC and, I guess, also the Judicial Conference begs to differ with the \nnumbers that the Senator from Nevada presented. I also wanted to \ncomment on what the Senator from Connecticut had mentioned in talking \nabout the new technologies and the speed with which things are done and \nthe complexity of the programs.\n  That also gives an advantage to those who are able to find fault, or \nto find fraud, or to find these problems and have a real advantage then \nin trying to file these claims within a year or within the 3 years. So \nthe technology has probably worked in favor of those, as well as \nagainst them. And this timetable, if I am not mistaken, was adopted in \n1934, and has served those years since. That would also provide \nadequate time. The main thing is that it would weed out the frivolous \nlawsuits and, as the Senator from New York pointed out, even if these \ntime periods elapse and real fraud is found, they can still be \nrectified in the courts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How would they be rectified in the courts if the \nstatute of limitations had run? That is the whole problem. See, the \npeople who file a----\n  Mr. GRAMS. The SEC would be able to bring the suits.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The people who file the frivolous suits, by the \nSenator's own statement, would file them within the 1-year period. He \nwas just complaining about that, and he said subsequent to Lampf, the \nnumbers jumped because they were doing exactly that. Our numbers do not \nshow that.\n  In fact, the SEC used these numbers when they testified before the \ncommittee in 1993. But the frivolous suits, the persons that are doing \nthese things with a cookie-cutter, they can file them within the 1-year \nperiod. The people that are going to be blocked out by the 1 and 3 \nrequirement are people who really have reasonable claims and do not \nfind out about them. By definition, there is a lot of deception that \ngoes on here, and a lot of people with meritorious claims are going to \nbe blocked out by the failure to adopt this 2 and 5-year amendment, \nwhich I think is a very constructive proposal.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I wanted to make one note, that all these what we would \nconsider frivolous lawsuits are not filed within hours, but some wait 3 \nto 5 years, requiring businesses to produce even more records, which \nwould make it even more expensive to debate or fight this in court.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 14 minutes 15 \nseconds, and the Senator from Minnesota 23 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is this colloquy on the time of the Senator from \nMinnesota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will yield to the Senator from Nevada for a question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might inquire of my good friend. The Senator from \nMinnesota made the point that a 2-year statute of limitations will help \ninvestors and disadvantage lawyers. If that were the case, I would \nargue on behalf of his position. But if in his State of Minnesota, or \nin my State of Nevada, an innocent victim of fraud, because of the \ncleverness of the perpetrator of the fraud, does not discover that \nfraud until after 3 years from the date of its occurrence, would not \nthe Senator agree that, in that situation, the investor recovers not at \nall? The SEC can bring an action, but it is not brought to recover on \nbehalf of the investor. The investor may be penalized civilly or \ncriminally, but the recovery is not on behalf of the investor. I would \nbe interested in the Senator's response.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Sometimes all the cleverness is not on behalf of the \ndefendant but on behalf of the plaintiff who is bringing the suit. This \nis basically the attorney. So I believe that with the speed and \ntechnology, this always can be a debate or an argument of who benefits \nmost from that. But I do believe that in the far majority of the cases, \nthe plaintiff has adequate time, and in the serious cases where real \nfraud has been perpetrated by such a company, would always have an \nopportunity, if I am not mistaken, for the SEC to bring legal action.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that point, the SEC can \nbring action against the bad actor to punish the bad actor, but that \naction would not recover the damages for the innocent investor. I ask \nthe Senator from Nevada, is that not correct?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is the point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. For the private party to recover the damages, the \nprivate party must bring this suit. So your private party would be \nleft, in effect, holding the bag.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I was just advised that the plaintiff can recover from the \ndisgorgement fund if this were the case.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator might answer one other question about \nfrivolous litigation----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield on his time?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might engage in a continuing dialog, we all agree--\nand there is no disagreement--with respect to taking the appropriate \naction against the frivolous lawsuits, as I have commended the chairman \nof the Banking Committee. There are provisions in there that I agree \nwith, as do the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Maryland, \nwith respect to the sanction provisions under rule 11. But I must say--\nand I ask the Senator this--when you have the SEC, the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the State Securities Administrators, the North \nAmerican Association of Securities Administrators, you have the State \nGovernment Finance Officers, the local government finance officers, all \nof whom advocate the 2- and 5-year statute, is it the Senator's view \nthat they are advocating that on behalf of the Nation's trial lawyers \nas opposed to the public? Unless there is a conspiracy I am not aware \nof, I would be interested in the Senator's response.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I think as you noted in your colloquy, there have been \narguments on both sides. And in weighing the differences in those two \narguments, you might agree with the group that you have just mentioned. \nBut I also agreed with some of the others and agree that the 1 and 3 \nstill provides adequate protection.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I respect the response of the Senator. I yield the floor, \nreserving the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 14 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield 4 minutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada will be happy to yield 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the American Bar Association expressing its opposition to \nS. 240, and stating:\n\n       In its present form the ABA opposes S. 240 since many of \n     the provisions of the legislation would dramatically reduce \n     the protection now afforded shareholders who are defrauded. \n     The ABA agrees that some adjustments to existing procedures \n     and securities class actions are warranted.\n\n  They are making a very important point. I say to my distinguished \ncolleagues, I hear the assertions, the people proposing the amendments \nwant no changes made. That is not the case.\n  From the very first in this debate, we agreed to the proposition that \nsome changes needed to be made. The question now is, what changes, how \nfar? We are trying to cut back on the excesses.\n  Here is a letter--and many others I have quoted take exactly the same \nposition--which concludes by saying, urging us:\n\n       . . . to amend many of the proposals in S. 240. Instead of \n     accomplishing the laudable purposes that the proponents \n     assert, the legislation in its present form will have a \n     fundamental negative effect upon private enforcement of the \n     securities law which is an essential and effective ingredient \n     to maintaining the integrity of our markets.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I very strongly support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada. I think it is important to restore \nsome balance to this bill.\n  The statute of limitations governs a period of time that an investor \nhas to bring a securities fraud lawsuit. If it is not brought within \nthat period of time, it cannot be brought at all, no matter how valid \nthe claim is.\n  So, it is very important to understand the impact the statute of \nlimitations will have upon all suits. It is being portrayed here as \nimpacting only frivolous suits. It will, in fact, impact all suits, \nincluding meritorious suits.\n  For over 40 years, the courts held that the statute of limitations \nfor security fraud actions is the State statute of limitations \ndetermined by analogous State law. While these statutes varied, they \nafforded securities fraud victims sufficient time, generally speaking, \nto discover fraud and to file suits. More than 60 percent of the States \nhad statutes of limitations longer than what has now been provided in \nthe Lampf case and that is in this bill.\n  That was a 5-to-4 decision, that the lawsuit must be brought within a \nyear after learning of the fraud, and in no event, more than 3 years \nafter it takes place, even if you do not know about it --even if you do \nnot know about it.\n  There are two standards. One, you know; how soon must you bring your \nsuit? The other is, you do not know about it; how many years must \ntranspire before you are closed out? If you find out about it 7 years \nlater, even under the old statute of limitations, well, it is too long. \nNow that is being cut from 5 to 3 years.\n  The time period in this bill is shorter than the statute of \nlimitations for private security actions under the law of 31 of the 50 \nStates. Security law experts say the statute of limitations imposed by \nthe Supreme Court is too short. It does not provide investors with \nenough time to discover a fraud and then to file a lawsuit.\n  I quoted earlier a quote from Chairman Breeden, in which he said that \nit could ``well mean that by the time investors discover they have a \ncase, they are already barred from the courthouse.''\n  As my distinguished colleague from Nevada has pointed out, not only \nthe SEC but State securities administrators and the FDIC have all \nagreed that the shorter period as reflected in this legislation does \nnot allow individual investors adequate time to discover and pursue \nviolations of securities law. In fact, the State securities regulators \nsaid about the shorter statute of limitations, that it:\n\n       . . . effectively forecloses any means of recovery for \n     defrauded investors whose only mistake may be to not discover \n     a concealed fraud.\n\n  We are talking about people who are the victims of fraud. Their only \nmistake is they have not discovered this concealed fraud.\n  I want to commend Senator Bryan for offering this amendment. It is a \nmatter he has pursued before. In fact, it was without opposition, \nadopted as an amendment to a banking bill in 1991. Many here thought it \nwas important. In fact, this bill, as initially introduced by Senator \nDomenici and Senator Dodd, contained this provision. In fact, it was \nput right in the title:\n\n       To amend the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to \n     establish a filing deadline.\n\n  Obviously, it was regarded as an important matter, since it was put \nfront and center.\n  As I indicated, the objective, independent parties have all testified \nthat the 2 and 5 years is the standard that we ought to have. The \nGovernment Finance Officers Association wrote:\n\n       Wrongdoers would be let off the hook by a shorter statute \n     of limitations.\n\n  Mr. President, I very strongly support this.\n  Let me close with this observation: Extending the statute of \nlimitations has nothing to do with frivolous cases. It will allow \nindividual investors more time to bring legitimate cases, time they \nneed, because fraud artists often conceal their fraud. The experts in \nthis area, the securities regulators, know more than anyone about \nbringing securities fraud cases. They have been supportive of the \nproposition being offered by my distinguished colleague from Nevada.\n  I very much hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, June 26, 1995.  \n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I write on behalf of the American Bar \n     Association concerning legislation entitled Reform of Private \n     Securities Litigation--S. 240--presently before the United \n     States Senate. In its present form the ABA opposes S. 240 \n     since many of the provisions of the legislation would \n     dramatically reduce the protection now afforded shareholders \n     who are defrauded.\n       The ABA agrees that some adjustments to existing procedure \n     in securities class actions are warranted. Legislative \n     amendments which require full disclosure of settlement terms, \n     promote finality in settlements and encourage voluntary and \n     non-binding ADR foster those goals without sacrificing the \n     integrity of our markets and the interests of public \n     investors. Accordingly, we support provisions of S. 240 which \n     contain such reforms.\n       The ABA's concerns are directed to those provisions in \n     proposed legislation which would, in effect, eviscerate the \n     remedy which makes the capital market in the United States \n     the envy of the world. In particular, we oppose the ``Loser \n     Pays'' provisions, the change in the long-standing principle \n     of joint and several liability, and the expanded ``safe-\n     harbor'' which will not protect even fraudulent forward \n     looking statements. In addition, we oppose the mandating of \n     heightened requirements for pleading scienter, and mandatory \n     stay of discovery when a motion to dismiss is filed, the \n     limitations on discovery even after a complaint has been \n     sustained, and the limitation to a single amendment to a \n     complaint in a securities class action.\n       The legislation detailed above, if enacted, would not \n     simply, as proponents assert, prevent frivolous litigation. \n     It would dramatically undermine the ability of public \n     shareholders who have been injured through violations of the \n     federal securities laws to achieve redress. In our view, the \n     federal class action for securities fraud remains a vital and \n     necessary component of the federal regulatory scheme. \n     Moreover, the present trend in the case law to eliminate \n     frivolous claims and to ensure adherence to relatively \n     stringent pleading and proof requirements, calls into \n     question the need for many of the provisions of S. 240.\n       At a minimum, any proposed changes to Federal rules of \n     Civil Procedure should follow the Rules Enabling Act in which \n     Congress specified such changes will go to the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States which receives input from the \n     public, the bench and the bar. The need for this review by \n     the Judicial Conference is particularly compelling given the \n     provisions of the legislation which seek to have different \n     pleading, proof and discovery rules for federal securities \n     fraud cases, a dramatic departure from the uniform approach \n     to all claims taken by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n     ever since their enactment in 1937.\n       The reasons for our objections to particular provisions of \n     S. 240 are detailed below:\n\n\n                 modified ``loser pays'' under rule 11\n\n       The requirements of Section 103 (a) and (b) requires the \n     court (i) to make specific findings on compliance by all \n     parties and all attorneys with regard to each requirement of \n     Rule 11(b) and (ii) mandating sanctions for any violations. \n     The court is also directed to presume that the appropriate \n     sanction is reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the \n     opposing party. Although this presumption may be rebutted by \n     evidence that such sanctions would impose an undue burden on \n     the violator, we agree with Chairman Levitt of the SEC that \n     this section ``may have the unintended effect of imposing a \n     `Loser Pays' scheme''.\n       The in terrorem effect of such a change in the law will \n     largely close the Federal courts to securities class actions \n     including the most meritorious of cases because the vast \n     majority of litigants are unable to run the risk of being \n     forced to pay for the other side's fees. The merits of \n     litigation are rarely, if ever, clear at the outset and what \n     is one side's clearly meritorious case is often the other \n     side's frivolous litigation. Thus, in the absence of \n     assurances from counsel, which counsel will be unable to \n     provide, all but the very wealthy likely will be prevented \n     from bringing a securities action in Federal court and no one \n     likely will ever bring a class action.\n       If any ``Loser Pays'' provision is enacted, securities \n     class actions in the federal courts will largely become a \n     thing of the past, and private securities litigation in \n     general may all but disappear, except for disputes between \n     wealthy adversaries. The resulting loss in accountability, \n     investor confidence, and the proper functioning of our \n     capital markets would be wholly against the public interest. \n     A major deterrent to corporate wrongdoing would be lost. This \n     cannot be the desire of Congress and we urge you to reject \n     these proposals.\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\n\n\n\n          excessive safe harbor for forward looking statements\n\n       S. 240, in Section 105, adopts a sweeping exemption from \n     fraud liability for forward looking statements by including a \n     scienter standard which, in the words of Chairman Levitt of \n     the SEC, ``may be so high as to preclude all but the most \n     obvious frauds.'' S. 240 should be amended to assure that \n     there is no safe harbor for a forward looking statement that \n     is materially false or misleading.\n\n\n                 ending of joint and several liability\n\n       The ABA strongly supports the existing joint and several \n     liability principles of today's laws. As SEC Chairman Levitt \n     stated, ``[t]he Commission has consistently opposed \n     proportionate liability, because [u]nder the existing system \n     of joint and several liability, the solvent defendants [in \n     cases where one of the wrongdoers in insolvent] must bear the \n     share of the bankrupt defendants. Under a system of strict \n     proportionate liability, the defrauded investors would be \n     required to absorb the loss.'' As he elaborated: ``although \n     the traditional doctrine of joint and several liability may \n     cause defendants to bear more than their proportional share \n     of liability in particular cases, this is because the current \n     system is based on equitable principles that operate to \n     protect innocent investors. Joint and several liability is \n     based on the equitable principle that, as between defrauded \n     investors and defendants who are found to have knowingly or \n     recklessly participated in a fraud, the risk of loss should \n     fall on the latter. The goal of ensuring that defrauded \n     investors are fully compensated for their losses, in other \n     words, overrides any distinction based on the relative \n     culpability of the defendants. . . .\n       S. 240 should therefore be amended to restore the joint and \n     several liability princples.\n\n\n   pleading and discovery, and limitations on amended pleadings and \n                               discovery\n\n       S. 240 mandates a number of procedural requirements none of \n     which have serious merit and all of which represent a \n     violation of the procedures established by the Rules Enabling \n     Act. Simply put, the cumbersome nature of these proposals and \n     their unintended consequences demonstrate anew why the far \n     more thoughtful process established by Congress in the Rules \n     Enabling Act ought to be followed here.\n       Rule 23 contains ample safeguards today to assure that \n     named plaintiffs adequately represent the class and their \n     lawyers pursue the cases vigorously. The new pleading and \n     discovery proposals of S. 240 are troublesome in that for the \n     first time under the Federal Rules special requirements are \n     established for a particular class of cases. Moreover, the \n     proposals contradict the present Rule 9(b) of the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure. Given the evidence that courts are \n     already enforcing heightened pleading requirements today, the \n     proposal is not only mischievous but unnecessary. The last \n     thing Congress should be endorsing is the dismissal of \n     meritorious cases at the pleading state. The pleading \n     standards in S. 240 require a plaintiff to plead the ``state \n     of mind'' of each defendant, which is impossible to do prior \n     to any discovery.\n       Finally, the limitations on the ability of plaintiffs to \n     amend their pleadings and to pursue discovery while \n     undoubtedly having the effect of preventing frivolous claims \n     from going forward, also has the pernicious effect of barring \n     claims with substantial merit. It is only through significant \n     discovery and repleading that these important claims get \n     adjudicated, an unlikely result if these proposals are \n     adopted.\n       In sum, the American Bar Association urges you to amend \n     many of the proposals in S. 240. Instead of accomplishing the \n     laudable purposes that their proponents assert, the \n     legislation in its present form will have a fundamental \n     negative effect upon private enforcement of the securities \n     law, which is an essential and effective ingredient to \n     maintaining the integrity of our markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the question before us, on the statute of \nlimitations, is an interesting one.\n  I think we really have to ask whether or not you really cannot \ndiscover a fraud in the 3 years?\n  Now, there have been some Ponzi schemes and other schemes that have \ngone on and worked for a long time. There have been some fraudulent \ninvestment practices at large, very well respected, institutions, where \nit has taken a period of time for people to bring them to the bar. In \nthose cases, I suggest that it has been the SEC who has brought these \ncases. They have done it because people have broken the law, people \nhave committed fraud. They have not filed specious, frivolous suits.\n  That does not mean every time they bring a suit, the are right; but \nmore often than not, they are. Indeed, where people have defrauded \ninvestors and have made profits unfairly, the SEC has been quite \nsuccessful in gaining penalties and fines, and in some cases \ndisgorgement of those ill-gotten gains. Again I state that the SEC is \nnot precluded by the statute of limitations. In the Prudential case the \nSEC got $660 million in disgorgement. The wonderful thing is that when \nthe SEC recovers in a case those moneys go to the people who have been \nvictimized. It is not a case where they recover pennies on the dollar.\n  If we look at most of the successful cases that have not been brought \nby the SEC, the cases brought by the private sector bar, they literally \nrecover pennies, pennies on the dollar of lost investment. As a matter \nof fact, there have been a series of articles that after these cases \nhave been settled--most of these cases end in settlements being made--\nthe people who the lawyers settle on behalf of get literally nothing, \nin some cases box tops, or the ability to receive even more products \nthat they do not want. They say, ``What was this? What did I gain from \nthis suit?'' But, the lawyers got millions and millions of dollars.\n  We are really here making a statement, saying, we will put into law \nwhat the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, feels is right. Of course we \nhave a right to disagree, but they said 3 years is plenty of time in \nwhich to discover that fraud; 1 year after the time of discovery and I \nagree.\n  Let me raise a question. Why should it take 2 years to bring a \nlawsuit after the time of discovery?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Why, after 1 year upon discovery, can you not bring a \nsuit?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am happy to yield. But on my colleague's time, because \nwe are pretty much even now. I have done that deliberately, evened it \nup.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield such time as the Senator needs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, the Senator from Nevada said it \ntakes the SEC 2.2 years from the time they start working on it to bring \nthe case. So if it takes the SEC 2.2 years, I do not think it is \nunreasonable that a private party ought to have 2 years.\n  The SEC cannot recover. The disgorgement which the Senator made \nreference to is only for illegal gains that a party realizes. Then you \ncan force them to disgorge it. They may not have illegal gains, or the \ndisgorgement may not be enough to pay the private parties. The private \nparty suit goes against the wrongdoer with respect to all of their \nassets. The disgorgement only gets at some bonanza which they have hit \nupon which you force them to give back and then you can allocate that \nout. That does not begin to cover the problem of the plaintiff \nrecovering.\n  But, in any event, on the particular point, the SEC takes 2.2 years. \nI do not think it is unreasonable to give private parties 2 years to \nbring their suit.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If I might, the point is, if after the discovery of a \nfraud it takes more than a year to bring that case I think we are just \nreally holding captive and in bondage, so to speak, a small business \nentrepreneur who is the possible plaintiff of a suit. Also, I think \nthat the SEC does not take 2.2 years to bring that case; but I believe \nto finish that case; not to just investigate that case.\n  Let me suggest that, extending the statute of limitations makes it \npossible to hold this sword of alleged fraud over someone; I have found \nit or someone will find it. Instead of bringing a case within a year \nthey dangle it over the company for 18 months, 2 years, attempting to \nget a settlement, then maybe file the papers just before that 2 years \nis up--I do not think we want to do that. How is that advancing the \ncause of justice?\n  If there is wrongdoing this Senator wants to see the people who have \nundertaken that wrongdoing punished. I want to see their illegal \nprofits given back. And again, there is a procedure whereby those who \nhave gotten ill-gotten gains who have profited by defrauding others can \nbe brought to justice by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And \nthe SEC has used that authority. They have done it in the case of \nPrudential, and, I daresay, that in other cases where outrageous \npractices have taken place they will continue to bring suit.\n  Mr. President, what we are seeking here is a balance. I think to \nbasically double the statute of limitations will not bring about the \nkind of balance we are looking for. I think it would be a mistake.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n  Again, this Senator has been willing to look at this question \ncarefully but I think the overwhelming body of opinion in the business \ncommunity, in the legal community, and in the Congress, is that 3 years \nis a sufficient period of time given the fact that the SEC has \nauthority to bring suit.\n  By the way, there may be cases that the SEC should not undertake, \nwhich it does, but there is the difference. I have some trust in them. \nI do not have any trust in the entrepreneurial spirit of a handful of \nlawyers who have managed to hold captive, to a certain extent, \nlegitimate business activities in this country. When the accountants of \nthis country are placed in the position that some of them may go out of \nbusiness because of the incredible liability that they face in \npracticing their profession as a result of these type lawsuits, then it \nis time to say, ``Enough is enough. We have to change this.''\n  That is what we are attempting to do with this legislation, and that \nis why the 1 and 3 years statute of limitations is the provision we \nused. I recognize reasonable people may disagree, but I hope I have \nbeen able to lay out the methodology and the motive, for why we have \nchosen what we think is a fair balance. One year from the time the \nfraud is discovered, 3 years from the time the fraud has been \ncommitted; I think that is very, very reasonable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire of the Chair, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 4 minutes and 45 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from New York has 12 minutes and 7 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that a motion will \nbe made shortly to seek unanimous consent, to which I have no \nobjection, to have the rollcall begin at 5:30. If in fact the Senator \nfrom Nevada is correctly informed of that, I inquire of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee whether he would be \nagreeable to providing a little additional time for us to engage in \ndiscussion?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I ask if my colleague might like an additional 15 \nminutes or half-hour equally divided?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That I would think would be fair. If we do not need it \nall, we can yield it back.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we be given an \nadditional 30 minutes to debate, 15 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is about 15 minutes remaining in the \ndebate.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am asking an additional 15 minutes and extend the time \nfor voting an additional half-hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just a \nmoment?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Chair indicate the parliamentary situation for \nus now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator repeat the question, please?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Chair repeat the parliamentary situation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was just consent given for an additional \n30 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided, 15 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That would bring us to 5:45.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then when would the vote occur?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. At 5:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right, under the time that was just consented \nto, it would be at 5:45.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understood the request, it was to move the vote to \n5:30 and have half an hour equally divided. The vote is now scheduled \nfor 5:15, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was for an additional 30 minutes \nof debate time and there was 15 minutes remaining on the clock between \nthe two sides, so that would now give 45 minutes debate remaining, \nequally divided between both sides.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That was not my understanding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I misspoke myself I apologize.\n  What I was seeking to do was to get a combined 30, which was the time \nthat, as I understood it, the vote was to occur, and the use of \nadditional time. I am not trying to preclude my friend from New York \nfrom exercising the full amount of his time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, might I ask that the two votes that are \nscheduled after the Bryan vote be limited to 10 minutes each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When will the first vote occur under this request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the unanimous-consent agreement, \nit would be at 5:45.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The subsequent two votes would be 10 minutes each; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The time between now and 5:45 will be divided equally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional time is divided equally. The \nSenator from Nevada would now have 16 minutes and 57 seconds; the \nSenator from New York would have 28 minutes and 1 second. But the \nadditional 30 minutes was equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, again, I think I created some confusion. I \napologize. It was my intent to get additional time but to begin our \nvoting at 5:30. The reason I say that to my friend from New York is to \ntry to accommodate him. I intend to offer several amendments this \nevening. I think the sooner that we get to those probably the better \noff we are.\n  So somehow the state of the Record might reflect that whatever time \nthe Senator needs, I would like a little bit more time, and start \nvoting at 5:30. It is not my intent by some parliamentary artifice to \nreduce or limit his time. But I need a little bit more time. That is \nwhy I was requesting that be done in that fashion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think maybe we can work this out if we \nbegin the vote at 5:45, and divide the time between now and then \nequally and make the two votes after the first vote 10-minute votes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there objection? But the time \nis still not divided equally with the 45 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me ask that the time from this time on be divided \nequally; that both sides start off with the same time, and we commence \nour first vote at 5:45.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And then the subsequent two votes will be 10-minute \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think this has been an interesting and a \nconstructive debate.\n  Let me just say that this is an issue that I know is dry as dust, but \nI think it is important to point out that across the country there is \nsome understanding that we are not just talking about legalisms, and \nwhat we are about to do will have a serious impact on millions and \nmillions of Americans.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to a number of editorial responses \nfrom across the United States, from a broad number of newspapers, not \nregionally focused, not philosophically on one side, but I think a \nbroad spectrum. They raise very, very legitimate concerns about S. 240 \nin its present print.\n  The Miami Herald, ``License to Steal''; the Bergen County Record, \n``Protection for Con Artists''; the News & Observer, ``Safe Harbor for \nFraud''; the New York Times, ``Protection for Corporate Fraud''; \nJonesboro Sun, ``Bad Measure''; the Denver Post, ``Senate Bill Would \nGive Free Ride to Securities Fraud''; the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, \n``Securities Bill Hurts Investors''; the Napa Valley Register, \n``Securities Fraud Bill is a Fraud''; the Palm Beach Post, ``One Big \nStock Swindle''; North Sioux City Times, ``Your Money At Risk''; the \nSeattle Times, ``Congress is Wrong to Limit Investor Suits''; Dayton \nDaily News, ``Securities `Reform' Bill Backwards''; St.\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nLouis Post-Dispatch, ``Don't Protect Securities Fraud''; Contra Costa \nTimes, ``Shielding Securities Fraud''; Los Angeles Times, ``This Isn't \nReform--It's a Steamroller''; and, again, the Palm Beach Post, ``Making \nthe Nation Safe for Fraud.''\n  So the notion that somehow this is an argument that only involves \nthose who are involved as securities lawyers I think can misstate the \nscope and the concern of this provision.\n  Let me say that if you look at the history of what has occurred since \nthe last case in 1991, that issue was brought before the Congress. At \nthat time, my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, was a cosponsor with me in trying to extend the statute of \nlimitations from 1 to 3 years, as that court decided the case, to 2 to \n5. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut was a supporter of that \nchange, as well. He continues to support the 2-to-5-year statute of \nlimitations.\n  His very able cosponsor, the distinguished senior Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, also expressed his support in 1991. The only \nconcern the Senator had was that he felt that the statute of \nlimitations issue ought not to be considered in an isolated sense. This \nis what he had to say on the floor of the U.S. Senate on November 19, \n1991.\n  First, I am not opposed to the extension or retroactivity if we are \nable to attach some amendments that address the issues of attorney \nfees, who pays the cost for these various lawsuits which are going to \nbe extended, all of which is done in S. 240.\n  So we have those people who have been over the years most actively \ninvolved at one time or another, all of whom supported S. 240 with a 2-\nto-5-year statute of limitations.\n  Those who know the circumstances best, those who investigate fraud at \nthe State level and at the Federal level, the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association and the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nall say that one fact that is central to securities fraud is the \ncleverness of the defrauders in concealing their fraud. They have from \ntime to time pointed out the Ponzi scheme, in which you do not know \nuntil at the very end that you have been a victim of a fraud; or \nmunicipal bond fraud, which has front loaded an escrow account in which \npayments are made for several years so the unwary investor is totally \nunaware that he or she has been defrauded. You have limited \npartnerships, in which those frauds are not detected for years, and the \nSEC itself saying that to conduct an investigation takes an average of \n2.25 years.\n  That strikes me as a very persuasive argument for a 2-to-5-year \nstatute of limitations.\n  In addition, you have the State financial officers and local \ngovernment financial officers. Now, I am not unmindful of the fact that \naccountants and securities underwriters and others do not like the \nlonger statute of limitations, and they are obviously entitled to make \ntheir point. But I do not think it would shock anybody on the floor to \nsuggest that their positions are tinged with self-interest.\n  Who speaks for the public? The Congress of the United States ought to \nspeak for the public. And those who represent the public interest in \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations, the Chairmen of the \nSEC, each have expressed their support for a 2- to 5-year statute of \nlimitations. State securities administrators, many of whom, I suspect, \nprobably most, are appointed by Governors directly representing the \npeople of their respective States, have also spoken in behalf of the 2- \nto 5-year statute of limitations. State financial officers, many of \nwhom are directly elected by the people, others of whom may be \nappointed by the Chief Executive of the respective States, again \nrepresenting the public interest, have expressed their support. And the \nsame thing is true with local government financial officers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that very point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In just yesterday's New York Times an article appeared \nwritten by Mark Griffin, the director of the Utah Securities Division. \nHe is a board member of the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation, which comprises the 50 States' securities regulators. In \nfact, he is the chairman of the Securities Litigation Reform Task Force \nand testified in front of our committee, and I think, in fairness, all \nmembers of the committee would agree that he was a very rational, \nthoughtful witness. Now, he in this article, in which he takes a very \nstrong position, says, ``The securities litigation bill is reform in \nname only.'' But on this very point that the Senator is now arguing, \nhaving addressed other provisions of the bill that he thought were \ndeficient, he said, and I quote him:\n\n       Perhaps the clearest sign, however, that the bill's \n     proponents have sold middle class investors down the river is \n     their refusal to lengthen the time in which consumers can \n     bring cases to court. The current rule derives from a 1991 \n     Supreme Court decision that created a statute of limitations \n     for Federal securities law cases of 1 year from discovery of \n     a misdeed or 3 years from the commission of the act in \n     question. This represented a serious reduction in the time \n     available for such lawsuits since Federal courts previously \n     had relied on State standards for statute of limitations. \n     Currently 31 States permit longer than the 1 and 3 standard \n     for the filing of State securities cases.\n\n  And then he closes this discussion on this very point with this \nquestion:\n\n       What possible case can the backers of this bill make for \n     keeping the time limit as short as possible so that future \n     swindlers who cover their tracks carefully will get off the \n     hook for good?\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a party to the issue. This is not someone \nwho has a vested economic interest on one side or another of this. This \nis a State director of the State securities division.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think the Senator makes a very compelling point, and I \nthink he speaks on behalf of the Nation's security regulators at the \nState level. And that view is shared by his counterpart at the Federal \nlevel.\n  I would yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think we just have a fundamental \ndifference of opinion. There are those people who advocate extending \nthe period of time to 5 years to detect fraud. To them I say, look at \nthe sophistication to study markets and to review documents that we \nhave today. Given the ability to learn more about a company, more about \nits activities, given all of the information that is available, I think \nthat extending the statute of limitations gives this group of hawks--\nthat is a kind word; more descriptive would be ``vultures''--who look \nat every turn to seize an opportunity to bring suit, not on behalf of \nthe poor or the downtrodden but on behalf of themselves, too much time \nand opportunity to find something with which to bring a frivolous suit. \nThere is a page in the Committee report on S. 240 which quotes a lawyer \nwho talks about his clientele. He is one of those lawyers who brings \nthese meritless suits, and he describes it.\n  I do not pretend, nor do I suggest at all, all lawyers operate in \nthis manner, because they do not. That would be wrong. That would be a \ndisservice. But a sufficient number operate in this way in this \nparticular area. I have asked if we could get some figures on this. It \nwould be very interesting to ascertain, for example, in the second \ncircuit, where one law firm in particular brings all these suits, how \nmany of the plaintiffs are the same. I mean, they are the same people \nand they own almost no stock whatsoever--sometimes as little as 10 \nshares each. They just get shares in every company. And if stock in \nthat company goes up or down--even if it goes up--then they sue. They \nsay: You did not tell us; you withheld information from us; and we \nshould have known; and I am injured. They sue, and they get paid. They \nget paid for loaning their names. These lawyers, these same lawyers pay \nthese individuals. This one lawyer said--I do not want to give the \nwrong name:\n  ``I have the greatest practice of law in the world,'' this one lawyer \nsaid. He acknowledges once telling a meeting of corporate directors--\nimagine telling this to a group of corporate directors--``I have the \ngreatest law practice in the world.'' And why? Why? Senator Boxer talks \nabout the aged, the sick, the infirm, the poor investors, here is what\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\nhe thinks about them. Here is what he thinks about them; he said, ``I \nhave no clients.''\n  He is operating for himself. He is just looking to make money, pile \nit up. Here it is on page 6 of the committee report, which has been \nsubmitted, ``Report of the Committee of Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs,'' I knew it was here because I did read it. The comment by one \nplaintiff's lawyer:\n\n       I have the greatest practice in the world. I have no \n     clients.\n\n  ``William T. Barrett, `I have no clients,' Forbes, October 11, \n1993.'' The fellow's name was Bill Barrett. Mr. Barrett was a partner \nin the law firm that brings most of these suits perhaps even more than \nanybody else. And he is proud of that. He is proud of that.\n  I do not think that is something to be proud about. If you want to \nsay I recover on behalf of the little guy, and I take on those who have \ninveigled them and swindled them, I understand that. But when you brag: \nI have the greatest practice of law in the world--``I have no \nclients''--that is a heck of an admission.\n  I do not want to give Mr. Barrett and those who practice with that \nkind of attitude an additional period of time to chum up the waters, to \ntry to create situations, to try to look for that which does not exist. \nI will support them if they are bring cases that involve fraud \nabsolutely, that involve deliberately giving misinformation, \nabsolutely, but I will not support the creation of specious lawsuits, \nlawsuits that are not well grounded and only designed to shake down--\nshake down--businesses, shake down insurers, shake down people, to make \nthem pay.\n  That is wrong, and we have got to stop it. The fact is we are paying \nbillions of dollars out and consumers are paying because we have \nallowed this practice to continue, and it has become a very \nsophisticated art form. Look at the record. Just look at the record. \nNinety-three percent of those cases are settled, and they are not \nsettled because anybody was going to prove fraud. They are settled \nbecause a small company or even a large successful company cannot \nafford to carry that litigation on for many years; litigation that \ncosts them millions of dollars. Even if they win, they lose.\n  You heard my friend, Senator Dodd, bring up the case where the \naccounting firm was sued and won, they won the lawsuit. It cost them $6 \nmillion to win. They were only paid on the initial contract $15,000. \nThat probably epitomizes the worst of what takes place, but it takes \nplace too often.\n  Open the door longer? No, I do not see what benefit that would hold. \nAnd I really have a difficult time understanding, and I do not refer to \nmy colleagues, those in the media who say we are trying to give a \nlicense to people to commit fraud. Why do they not wake up? They could \nnot operate under the same standards that business does. They are given \na shield. We are simply saying, in this legislation, that you ought to \nbe able, if you discover the fraud within a year, to bring the suit. \nWhy would you need 2 years?\n  Now, it is true that at the Securities and Exchange Commission, once \nthey have completed all their depositions; they go through very \nthoroughly; takes 2-plus years to bring suit.\n  But in 2.2 years their suit is absolutely totally ready, they have \nlaid the cupboard bare and have made all their discoveries, they use \nthe power of their office to bring suit where there is fraud and they \ncan recover for the investors. So, indeed, it may take them 2 years to \ncompletion. We are not saying somebody has to complete their lawsuit in \n2 years, but certainly, they should be able to start it within 1 year \nif they believe a fraud has really taken place. Extending it to 2 years \njust goes beyond the realm of reason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On your side, 11 minutes 30 seconds, and \nSenator D'Amato has 12 minutes 56 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield as much time as the Senator from Maryland desires.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will just yield me 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to again commend the Senator from \nNevada for offering this amendment. It is a very important amendment. \nThis is an issue he has dealt with over the years with a great deal of \nattention and understanding and thought.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada is, of course, a former \nGovernor of that State, and prior to that the attorney general of the \nState of Nevada, and before that a member of the Nevada Legislature on \nthe judiciary committee. So he has had experience in dealing with these \nissues, and I am sure out of his tenure as attorney general can \nappreciate what small investors come up against when they are \nconfronted with these fraud situations.\n  This provision to extend the statute of limitations does not reach \nthe kind of horror examples that people on the proponents of this \nlegislation are asserting.\n  This statute of limitations issue affects meritorious suits as well \nas frivolous suits. There are other ways in the bill that we are trying \nto do away with the frivolous suits, to which the Senator from New York \nwas just making reference. And, in fact, many of us trying to amend \nthis bill have indicated that we support many of the provisions aimed \nat dealing with the frivolous suits. But we have to draw the line when \nthe provisions are carried to excess, when you have overreaching and, \nin effect, you are negatively going to impact upon the small investor \nwho has been bilked, who has been taken gross advantage of.\n  This statute of limitations we previously dealt with here with \nrelatively little controversy. As a matter of fact, most people, when \nwe previously considered it, were supportive of the 2- to 5-year \nperiod, which is what the standard has been for 40 years under the \nsecurities laws, for 40 years.\n  The 1- to 3-year standard that is now in this bill is shorter than \nwhat applies in over 60 percent of the States. If you know about the \nfraud, you ought to be able to bring a suit within a year. The SEC \ntakes over 2 years to bring a suit once it knows about it. So I think \nit is unfair to expect the private party to meet a higher standard than \nyou expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to meet with all the \nexpertise and with all the resources that it has.\n  The 3 years, in effect, says if you perpetrate a fraud and no one \nfinds out about it and 3 years go by, you are scot-free.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What that says is if you do a fraud, you are a fast \noperator, you perpetrate a fraud, and you manage to conceal it for 3 \nyears, that under this statute, you are then scot-free. What the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada is saying is that period at least \nought to be 5 years.\n  Some say why should it not even be longer and some States, in fact, \nhave a longer period. The argument for having a statute of limitations \ngenerally speaking in the law is that at some point you want to have \nfinality, you want to bring things to an end, you do not want to have \nalways open the prospects of a lawsuit. So you try to have a reasonable \nstatute of limitations. The one we have always used in this area now \nfor more than four decades has been 5 years in terms of the period that \ncould run in which you could then find out about the fraud.\n  Now it is proposed to cut that back to 3 years. So if the fast \noperator can conceal and deceive his fraud for a 3-year period, then he \nescapes, he comes out scot-free.\n  I say to my colleagues, I suggest to you this is a very meritorious \namendment, and I very much hope the Members will support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes fifty-six seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come--and \nI understand there will be stacked\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\nvotes--and talk on several amendments, one that was the subject of \ndebate earlier. I asked my distinguished chairman if I could make a \nquick comment on it, and he agreed that might be appropriate.\n  There is an article in today's Wall Street Journal that I think has \nbearing on the debate, today's news today, if you will, which says: \n``Big Accounting Firms Weed Out Risky Clients.''\n\n       If you have a big-name auditor, hold on tight. It's getting \n     a lot tougher to find--and keep--prestigious outside auditors \n     to certify annual financial statements.\n\n  The statement that I think is appropriate in this article, to this \ndebate, referring to a partner at Peat Marwick, is where he talks \nabout:\n\n       When a client we audit goes bust . . . it costs us a bundle \n     in court if we're sued by investors, whether we win or lose \n     the case.\n       Mr. Lambert says that legal costs are ``staggering'' for a \n     lawsuit filed in a Federal court in Texas alleging a faulty \n     review of a bank's books by Peat. The bank was taken over by \n     the Federal Government in 1992 after big losses. The jury \n     ruled in Peat's favor in 1993, but the firm had to spend $7 \n     million to defend itself even though the fee for the job was \n     $15,000. Mr. Lambert says, ``We just can't afford to take on \n     risky audit clients anymore.''\n\n  That is what will happen if we do not pass this legislation, Mr. \nPresident. People are going to be denied access to accountants, who \nwill not run the risk of a $7 million legal fee, even when they are \nexonerated, for a $15,000 auditing fee. They will simply not be \navailable, and the end that we are all seeking in this legislation, \nwhich is to protect investors, will be frustrated if the amendment \ndealing with the joint and several liability is adopted.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The other day, we rejected the amendment that would \nhave restored joint and several. So the bill now has proportionate \nliability in it. The only thing the amendment offered earlier addresses \nis a provision in the bill that would still keep joint and several for \nsmall investors.\n  So if you had a small investor with a net worth of under $200,000--\nand that figure is retained--we would drop out of it the requirement \nthat that small investor had to lose at least 10 percent of his net \nworth, namely $20,000. So if he lost $15,000 or $5,000, he could be \nheld whole instead of the participant in the fraud escaping the burden.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are talking about strike suits on \nbehalf of professional plaintiffs, and a professional plaintiff could \neasily fit within the category of the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Maryland was not here when I expressed my \nremarks. I will say to the Senator from Utah, I submitted that article \nfor the Record.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I apologize.\n  Mr. DODD. If you go to the Census Bureau and Federal Reserve study on \nwhat the median net worth is in this country, you get two different \nnumbers. The Census Bureau says the median net worth is $37,000. The \nFederal Reserve said in 1992 it is $52,000.\n  When you set the standard at $200,000 of net worth, which we do, \nbasically, you are including about 95 percent of the people in this \ncountry. Only a small percentage is left that have a net worth in \nexcess of $200,000. So if you then do not have some of the standard \nhere, then de facto--not de jure, but de facto--you have eliminated \nproportionate liability.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, what is the net \nworth of the median investor?\n  Mr. DODD. I do not have that statistic.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I know, but you are----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think my time has probably expired. I thank my \ncolleague from Connecticut. I apologize that I was not listening to him \nwhen that was put into the Record. I will not ask that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield another 2 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1469\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. The amendment before us is on the statute of \nlimitations. We have heard all of these arguments. I do not want to \nrepeat them over and over again. Simply, from my business experience, I \ntell you the impact of the statute of limitations which is hanging over \nbusiness. If you have a statute of limitations that is 5 years, you \nhave to keep all your records for 5 years; you have to be concerned \nabout what is going to happen to you in 5 years, even though you know \nnothing has gone wrong, and you get yourself into that circumstance.\n  If there were time, I could describe circumstances where the lawyers \nwait until the last moment before the expiration of the statute, no \nmatter when it is, in order to panic the situation. It becomes a \ndevice, if you will, that plays into the hands of the people that are \nseeking to do the kinds of things we are talking about here.\n  I believe 3 years is long enough. I believe that it is a salutary \nthing to say to the lawyers, if you suspect there is fraud, get on with \nit quickly and do not play the game of playing it out those extra 2 \nyears and hoping in that extra 2-year period that people will be a \nlittle sloppy in recordkeeping and you will be able to create greater \nuncertainty than you would if you acted in a timely fashion. Memories \nfade after 3 years, legal suits become much more difficult to pursue \nafter 3 years. I think the 3 years that are in the bill are \nappropriate. For that reason, I am opposing the amendment. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator from North Carolina would like 3 minutes.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to address some of the \namendments that have been discussed on the Senate floor today. First, I \noppose extending the statute of limitations for securities private \nrights of action. I think the current 3-year statute is quite adequate. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission Act of 1934 put this into law. \nThat was 60 years ago. It has been unchanged ever since.\n  Certainly, in this age of computers, fax machines, and the rapid \ncommunications that we have, particularly in the financial community, I \ndo not see the need to extend the statute that has been more than \nadequate for 60-plus years.\n  Mr. President, there is little evidence that a longer period is \nneeded. Three years from the discovery of a securities fraud violation \nis adequate.\n  The problem has not been a longer period--the problem has been that \nclass action suits are now filed literally within hours of a stock \nprice dropping. I cannot understand why anyone would think that a \nlonger period is justified with the current practices that we are \ndealing with.\n  I am also concerned that by extending the statute to 5 years, we make \nit harder for firms to defend themselves against lawsuits that are \ntotally baseless to begin with.\n  Companies will have to search business records that have not been \nused for years. They will have to interview employees whose \nrecollections are hazy. Moreover, they will have to track down \nemployees that probably no longer work for the firm and probably are on \nthe other side of the country. All of this is to defend themselves \nagainst a possible claim for 5 years. Business records and \nrecollections get hazy, and 5 years gets to be a long time.\n  In my home State of North Carolina, we have a 2-year statute of \nlimitations, and to my recollection, no one has ever suggested that it \nneeded to be changed.\n  With respect to Mr. Sarbanes' amendment, I think the Senate has \ncovered this ground already. On Friday, the Senate defeated Mr. \nShelby's amendment by a large margin.\n  Mr. President, S. 240 already has an extremely balanced and \nreasonable proportionate liability section. First, it requires that in \nthe case where other defendants are insolvent, every other defendant \nmust pay an additional 50 percent of the losses he caused to help pay \nthe plaintiffs.\n  Also, the bill takes care of small investors. It covers those with a \nfinancial net worth of under $200,000.\n  Mr. President, this covers 90 percent of the families in the United \nStates. There is no need to go further, as Senator Sarbanes is \nsuggesting. Yes, there are many victims and some victims who are not \nmade whole. But there are\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\nvery few. If, however, we do not leave this provision alone, there will \nbe many victims on the other side of the equation, those companies that \nare sued simply because they have deep pockets.\n  These companies are often forced into settling because large lawsuits \nloom and it is cheaper to settle. They, too, are victims of a flawed \nlegal system and untrustworthy lawyers. This needs to be changed. S. \n240 changes this, and that is why I am opposed to the Sarbanes \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 1 minute. Again, for the purpose of debate and \ndiscussion here, my colleagues will not be surprised. The original bill \nwe put in, of course, did include a statute of limitations very much \nalong the lines being offered by the Senator from Nevada. I support \nthis amendment. There is one major difference here between this \namendment and what was originally proposed, and that is the requirement \nof reasonable diligence on the part of the investor to determine \nwhether or not there has been any fraud. Reasonable diligence is not \nincluded in this amendment. I regret that because I think there is a \ndifference between the investor who must bear a responsibility to keep \nan eye out for what is going on and the one that does not pay any \nattention whatsoever. The absence of that language is not so fatal that \nI oppose the amendment. There is a difference between the original \nlanguage and the language here. So you treat both investors alike and \npeople who engage in this activity bear a responsibility to watch out \nfor themselves in many ways, which is not included in the amendment.\n  I think that technology being what it is, the world having changed to \nthe point where you can actually have pretty sophisticated operations \ntoday, makes it difficult for the average investor to be aware of what \nis going on. I support the language Senator Domenici and I originally \nhad in the bill and, for that reason, I support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes two seconds, and Senator Bryan has \n4 minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. This has been an \ninteresting discussion. Because the time is running out, let me be \nbrief on several points. For my colleagues who are concerned about the \nabuses that lawyers visit upon the system, let me suggest that this \namendment is not at issue. The able chairman and the sponsor of the \nbill have crafted a number of provisions--prohibition of referral fees \nto brokers, prohibition on attorney's fees paid from SEC disgorgement \nfunds, and several others.\n  Let nobody be misled that this bill or debate is about whether you \nfavor reforms in the litigation system as it deals with attorney abuse. \nWe have dealt with that issue. I find myself a bit confused. The \ndistinguished Senator from Utah is arguing against my amendment and he \nsays if the statute of limitations is extended, those lawyers who file \nsuits will wait until the last minute. He has extensive experience in \nbusiness, and I greatly respect him. The distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, also experienced in business, tells us that the problem \nis that lawyers file instantaneously when the stock prices go down. I \nmust say, I do not think it can be both ways.\n  The basic problem here is one of concealment. The very nature of \nthese frauds that are perpetrated upon the investment public involve \nthe concealment of fraud through any artifice or device possible, and \nalthough there is much new technology out in the market, the technology \nchanges are not a response to the basic cleverness of those who \nperpetrate these frauds in keeping their frauds from the victim.\n  The North American Association of Securities Administrators and the \nSEC point out to a number of those cases--municipal bond frauds, \nlimited partnership, to cite just two.\n  Mr. President, I think it also needs to be made note of those who \nhave looked at this over the years, as Senator D'Amato, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Dodd have all at one point taken the position the \nstatute of limitations ought to be extended from 2 to 5 years.\n  I recognize there are those that have a vested financial interest who \nwant to preclude suits from being filed. I understood that. That ought \nnot to dictate policy response.\n  Those who have the public interest and the public trust at issue as \nto their only responsibility, the SEC, State Securities Association, \nthe State Financial Officers, Local Government Financial Officers, all \nare together. All of the regulators agreed that in the interest of \nfairness, the statute of limitations ought to be extended from 2 to 5 \nyears. That represents both a national perspective, a State \nperspective, and a local government perspective.\n  Unless we subscribe to a conspiracy in history, all cannot be in \nleague with trial lawyers. They have reached the conclusion, as I have, \nbased upon the compelling evidence before us, concealment is the \nproblem, and 2 to 5 years is a reasonable time to provide an \nopportunity for plaintiffs to file.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this is admittedly incomplete, but let me \njust share some statistics from one law firm in New York between 1990 \nand 1992. One plaintiff was a plaintiff in 14 cases--14. The second \nplaintiff was in 10; the third fellow, 7; another fellow, 7; another \nfellow, 7. I will not mention the names of these plaintiffs, because I \nwant to be respectful and not embarrass them. But, I should mention \ntheir names, because I am sure these plaintiffs are not legitimately \naggrieved. It is incredible. I would like to find out how many shares \nthey owned in each of these firms--I bet not more than one owns more \nthan 10 shares. These plaintiffs buy shares in multiple companies so \nthe firm can be designated lead counsel, and then the plaintiffs get \npaid a bonus.\n  That is the kind of practice we have had taking place. I do not think \nwe should keep this door open for 5 years for these lawyers to find \nsupposed frauds so they can bring these kinds of cases. That is why I \nhave to oppose this amendment.\n  Do I want to hurt those who truly have been hurt? Absolutely not. \nWhen I see one plaintiff in 14 cases in 3 years, and another plaintiff \nin 10, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 others who have been involved in a \nmultiplicity of cases during this same period, I say it is time to \nchange things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 1 minute and 18 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think this perhaps has been discussed fully. I want to \nacknowledge the leadership the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, \nprovided in viewing this legislation. I thank him very much for his \nleadership; and the courtesy of the chairman of the committee. Although \nwe find ourselves in disagreement, his courtesy is much appreciated.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion to table the amendment numbered 1469, offered by the Senator \nfrom Nevada [Mr. Bryan].\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-\nBraun], the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], and the Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Simon] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell] is \nabsent on official business.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nIllinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] would vote ``aye.''\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nRhode Island [Mr. Pell] would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 41, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 283 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nunn\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Bond\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Gramm\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Pell\n     Santorum\n     Simon\n  So the motion to table the amendment (No. 1469) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1472\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Amendment 1472 \noffered by the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. Is there a request \nfor the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? It was my \nunderstanding that the author of the amendment had the option to take a \nminute of time before the vote was taken. I understand that it was part \nof the unanimous consent agreement. I want to make sure that I am \ncorrect on that, because I would like that opportunity with my \namendment. I was not certain whether the Senator from Maryland waived \nthat right or what the parliamentary situation was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. That time is available \nif Senators wish to take it. It certainly would be available to the \nSenator from California when her amendment is considered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMaryland. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the explanation of the amendment was \nincluded in the order. I ask that the explanation be given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement called for an explanation, and \nthe explanation is requested. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very quick.\n  This amendment takes a provision that is in the bill that departs \nfrom proportionate liability. The bill says that in a situation in \nwhich you have a small investor, with a net worth of less than \n$200,000, and if that small investor loses over 10 percent of his net \nworth--in other words, $20,000--then you will in effect hold them \nharmless, all the defendants will continue to be jointly and severally \nliable. I leave the $200,000 net worth provision but eliminate the 10 \npercent requirement as to the amount of loss, so if someone has a net \nworth of $200,000 and loses $5,000, they still would be protected. The \nnotion of this is to try to protect small investors, and I am very \nfrank to tell you I think they ought to be protected.\n  Under the other provision in the bill, they provide--\n  Mr. CONRAD. May we have order, Mr. President, so we can hear.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That in an instance of proportionate liability----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment is really another attempt \nto knock out one of the most meaningful provisions of S. 240 and double \nthe amount that defendants would have to pay if there was an insolvent \ncodefendant. The basis upon which we attempt to give some relief is to \nsay, yes, for some small investors, if they have under $200,000 and a \n10 percent cap. What we are doing here is just knocking it aside. We \nhave to stop people going after people just because they have deep \npockets, just because they have lots of money. And so I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 1472 offered by the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BOND (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, under the unanimous \nconsent request, the Senator from California now has the opportunity to \naddress the substance of her amendment for 1 minute and the Senator \nfrom New York has 1 minute to reply; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I make the point of order that the \nSenate is not in order, and I request the Chair to obtain order in the \nSenate before we go to the explanation of the amendment and the \nresponse thereto, out of courtesy to our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point is well taken. The Senate \nwill be in order. Members will cease conversation.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be less than 1 minute. Mr. President, I say to my \nfriends, S. 240 changes many aspects of our securities laws, and many \nsenior citizen groups have voiced concern.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  My amendment simply says if S. 240 becomes law, the Securities and \nExchange Commission shall report to the Congress in 180 days as to its \nimpact on senior citizens who are the main targets of securities fraud.\n  So we are calling on the SEC to come and report to us as to the \nimpact of this legislation on senior citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have agreed to ask the Securities and \nExchange Commission to make this statement. We understand the \nvulnerability of seniors. We are prepared to accept the amendment \nwithout a rollcall vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

This is in reference to the remainder of the evening, so it \nwill be important to every Member. I understand we are not able to \nconvince anybody to continue on this evening, except there will be \namendments offered and there will be debate this evening, but there \nwill be no more votes after this rollcall vote.\n  There will be votes starting at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow: Two votes, under \nthe same provision. There will be 2 minutes to explain before each \nvote, and then following those two votes, I understand there will be \nanother amendment laid down. Senator Sarbanes will be recognized to lay \ndown his amendment at about 11:15, I assume. We still very much would \nlike to finish this bill in the early afternoon. There are five \namendments, I understand, outstanding.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It appears there are five amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, there has not been any delay on either side. There \nhas been a lot of good debate all day today. But we would like to \ncomplete action on this bill to move to something else, hopefully \nregulatory reform. There will be no more rollcall votes tonight, but \ntwo votes starting at 10:30 a.m.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the majority leader yield? The Senator was just \ninterested in when the Medicare Select conference report will take \nplace?\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope that will happen this evening. As I understand, the \nSenator from West Virginia wanted 20 minutes for debate. We will \ndispose of that this evening.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer my enthusiastic \nsupport to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  I was an original cosponsor of S. 240, and have been deeply \ninterested in remedying the current abuses in the securities litigation \nsystem--particularly those abuses that have arisen from the misuse of \nclass action lawsuits to prosecute securities fraud. Companies in Utah \nas well as across the country are being adversely affected by unfair \nlawsuits brought under the current system.\n  This is only one area of the law in which litigation abuse has become \nrampant, and I commend the many cosponsors of this bill--who number \nover 50--for their recognition that it is time to address some of the \nsignificant litigation abuses in this country.\n  In particular, I would like to commend and thank Senators Dodd and \nDomenici for their longstanding leadership on this issue. They have \nonce again worked long and hard to come up with an excellent bill, \nwhich so many of us have been able to support wholeheartedly. I also \nwant to thank Senator D'Amato for his support of securities litigation \nreform and for his key role in developing the fine version of the bill \nreported out of the Banking Committee that we are considering here on \nthe floor today.\n  This bill seeks to make securities litigation more fair by curbing \nthe abusive litigation practices that have been employed by a small \nnumber of plaintiffs' lawyers in securities litigation class action \nlawsuits. The hallmark of this small group has been the so-called \nstrike suit. In such suits, attorneys typically file a securities fraud \nlawsuit against a company as soon as possible after the company's stock \ndrops in price--often regardless of whether there has been any fraud on \nthe part of the company.\n  In the complaint, those attorneys accuse the company of securities \nfraud, either in issuing the stock or in other company statements, and \nseek to obtain damages to make up for the stock price drop--a drop that \nis in fact typically caused by nothing more than natural market forces.\n  Here is one example. In a case--or I should say cases--filed in New \nYork this past year, Philip Morris had announced that it was reducing \nthe price of Marlboro cigarettes by 40 cents per pack. [In re Philip \nMorris Securities Litigation, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. \n6, 1995).] Shortly thereafter, the company's price per share lost \nnearly 24 percent of its value. That is not so surprising in a reactive \nmarket that could easily have interpreted such action as leading to a \nloss in profits, at least in the short term.\n  What was surprising was the reaction of lawyers. Within just 2 \nbusiness days, 10 securities litigation lawsuits involve 34 law firms \nwere filed against Philip Morris. That kind of litigiousness on such \nshort notice is absolutely astounding. Unfortunately, that kind of \naction has become commonplace and is plaguing our finest companies, be \nthey large corporations or smaller businesses.\n  It is so widespread that a 1992 National Law Journal article reported \nthat of 46 stock fraud cases studied, 12 were filed within 1 day and \nanother 30\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nwithin 1 week of the publication of unfavorable news about the \ndefendant company. [Source: Milt Policzer, ``They've Cornered the \nMarket,'' National Law Journal, April 27, 1992.]\n  In 1990, when L.A. Gear, the sportswear and sneaker manufacturer, \nannounced lower than expected earnings, one law firm filed 15 lawsuits \njust three days after the announcement. [Source: William Lash, \n``Securities Law Reform: Too Little, Too Late'' (Center for the Study \nof American Business, Washington University, May 1995).]\n  Particularly hard hit by strike suits have been high technology \ncomputer companies. A Stanford University law professor who conducted a \nstudy of shareholder class actions filed in the early 1980's, most \ninvolving high tech firms, found that every single company that \nexperienced a market loss in stock price of at least $20 million was \nsued. Every single company. [See Janet Cooper Alexander, ``Do the \nMerits Matter? A Study of Settlements in Securities Class Actions,'' 43 \nStan. L. Rev. 497 (1991).] That is mindboggling. These are some of the \nmost successful American companies in recent decades, and they are \nbeing besieged with lawsuits. Why could this be?\n\n  The answer is found in the securities litigation system. In her \nstudy, the Stanford professor--Professor Janet Cooper Alexander--\nconcluded that, due to the pressures of the litigation system, \ncompanies were being sued for reasons that had little or nothing to do \nwith the presence of any real underlying securities fraud and that \ncompanies were being forced into settlements that had nothing to do \nwith the merits of the case. That is not how the legal system is \nsupposed to work, and that is now how the securities laws were meant to \nbe used.\n  Although the securities laws were designed to punish and prevent \nfraud and abuse in the securities market, they are currently being \nabused by certain attorneys who seek to make a profit from simple stock \nlosses. But the securities laws were not designed to insure against \nstock loss. Far from it. The securities laws were designed to protect \nAmerican investors from fraud.\n  When most of our major high-technology firms have been the target of \na securities fraud class action lawsuit, and when hundreds of millions \nof dollars are spent each year on the litigation costs relating to such \nsuits, a number of which show no evidence of wrongdoing whatsoever on \nthe part of the defendant, I think we have to take a long hard look at \nthis and ask ourselves--is corporate fraud really so widespread that it \nexists in every single firm in America? Or is this system encouraging \nlitigation when there is no evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever on \nthe part of the defendant?\n  I think the answer is clear. I think the reason these suits yield so \nmany costly settlements has to do with the high costs to companies of \ndefending against these suits. Due to the threat of exorbitant legal \nfees that would be required to defend against such strike suits, \ncompanies will settle securities lawsuits even when those suits are \nentirely meritless. The plaintiffs' attorneys then collect a hefty \nportion of that settlement through their contingent fees.\n  While accurate statistics are not available on the breakdown of \nattorneys fees, because this information is often not public, the \nBanking Committee has heard testimony that plaintiffs in these types of \nlawsuits typically receive only 14 cents for every dollar of damages \nwhile the attorneys collect 39 percent of the settlement. Other studies \nhave suggested even lower recoveries by the shareholders.\n  This area of legal abuse is truly the work of a few attorneys. It has \nbeen widely reported--both in congressional testimony and in cases and \narticles--that only a small number of law firms are involved in these \nabusive strike suits. Often, the firms use the same professional \nplaintiffs in multiple suits. Some will pay referral fees to get \nplaintiffs. Typically, these firms will rush to the courthouse to try \nto be the firm that files suit first.\n  One problem is that, under current law, that firm will often be \ndesignated the lead class counsel and will be able to receive a larger \nshare of the settlement. Clearly, with so many suits being filed on \nsuch short notice, the law firms involved cannot possible have \nthoroughly considered the possible existence of fraud. Instead, these \nfirms are simply reacting to the skewed incentives in the current \nsystem that reward them for filing a lawsuit first.\n  These few, rapacious law firms have made this kind of abusive \nlitigation their specialty. They are the ones who have taken advantage \nof the system and harmed our businesses and our economy. Let us all be \nperfectly clear in our understanding that the only group this bill \nharms is that small group of specialized lawyers.\n\n  Their actions come at a very high cost. Companies pay needless \nlitigation, settlement, and insurance costs with money that could be \ngoing to create jobs or to further research and development. Testimony \nbefore the Banking Committee demonstrated again and again how much \nexcessive securities litigation costs companies, who must then pass \nthose costs on.\n  Let me just mention one example. Testimony was received about a \nSilicon Valley corporation named Adept Technology. Adept Technology is \nthe only U.S. robotics corporation and it employs over 275 people. They \nwere contemplating an initial public offering of shares, or what is \ncommonly referred to as going public. They were advised, however, that \ndue to the threat of litigation if they went public, they would have to \ncarry a liability insurance policy of $5 million in coverage which \nwould cost upwards of $450,000 per year. They were advised that they \nhad to bear that cost, because, as a high-technology company going \npublic, they would undoubtedly be sued for securities fraud within a \nyear or two of going public. The upshot of securities litigation \nlawsuit abuse is that Adept must pay a litigation tax in order to be a \npublicly traded company. The money spent this way could easily pay for \nfive or six engineers who might be creating new products and helping \nkeep American business competitive.\n  By limiting the access of some firms to the capital market--for \nexample, those that decide they cannot afford to go public--the current \nsystem damages our economy and stunts its ability to grow. The irony is \nthat, while securities litigation laws were designed to safeguard \ninvestors, in reality the current system ends up hurting investors. It \nharms those investors who could have invested successfully in those \ncompanies, had they gone public, and it hurts those investors who could \nhave earned more profits on their shares, had those companies been more \nprofitable. In this system, whose intent was to protect investors, the \nsad fact is that investors end up getting hurt while certain lawyers \nrake in exorbitant fees.\n  Another cost this abusive system imposes is in the perverse \nincentives created when companies decide to disclose less information \nabout their companies simply for fear that they will inevitably be sued \non the basis of the information. That goes completely against the grain \nof the securities laws--all of which were designed to encourage \nopenness and full information in our securities markets.\n  These costs must be addressed. We need to eliminate abuses in the \nsystem, so that we can efficiently preserve the core values of the \nAmerican stock market--honesty, integrity, openness, and the free \nexchange of information. Those values are what gives the American stock \nmarket its respect, both here and abroad.\n  This act is an attempt to do just that. It represents the culmination \nof a bipartisan effort that has evolved over several Congresses. I \nbelieve this bill balances several competing interests. There can be no \nquestion that it ensures that the class action device will remain \navailable for those shareholders who have been the victims of \nsecurities fraud. It also improves on that class action device so that \ninjured investors--not a small group of greedy lawyers--can control the \nlitigation and have a greater share of any settlement.\n  The bill does this in a number of ways.\n  First, the bill contains a number of reforms of securities litigation \nclass actions that are designed to increase participation of the real \nshareholder plaintiffs and decrease the control of attorneys. For \nexample, the court will select the most adequate plaintiff who will \nthen direct litigation decisions. Securities lawsuits have often been \nbrought and controlled by a relatively\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nsmall group of lawyers whose incentives are frequently at odds with \nthose of the plaintiffs and with the goals of the securities laws. This \nprovision would ensure that litigation decisions are truly in the best \ninterests of the shareholders and are not merely in the best interest \nof the law firm that won the race to the counthouse door.\n\n  Where the parties enter into a class action settlement agreement, the \nbill requires the disclosure of settlement terms to class members so \nthat plaintiffs know what they are getting and the attorneys fees \ninvolved.\n  The bill increases pleading requirements so that a potential \nviolation must be clearly laid out in a complaint. In securities \nactions involving misleading statements or omissions, plaintiffs will \nhave to specify each allegedly misleading statement or omission and why \nit is misleading. Where a defendant's state of mind must be proven, \nplaintiffs must plead specific facts supporting that state of mind.\n  Those provisions make sense. They do not require a plaintiff to prove \nthe entire case at the pleading stage. Instead, they merely require \nthat that case be set out and that all the allegations be supported by \nsufficient allegations of fact.\n  The bill also provides for a stay of discovery during the pendency of \nany motion to dismiss, unless the court finds that particularized \ndiscovery is necessary to preserve evidence or prevent undue prejudice. \nThis reduces one of the highest litigation costs that have been used to \nbadger defendants into settling. This way, some of the merits of the \ncase can be considered by the court before the defendant can be forced \nto settle through the threat of mounting unpayable legal bills.\n  Another problem the bill addresses is the problem of predictive of \nso-called forward-looking statements. Some companies have faced \ndamaging lawsuits merely on the basis of vague but optimistic \nprojections that they would do well even though it was clear that the \npreduction was somewhat speculative and future-orented. The bill does \nso by establishing what has been referred to as a safe harbor to \nprotect issuers and others from liability under the securities laws for \nforward-looking statements.\n  This provision has been mischaracterized by opponents of this \nlegislation. It should be clearly understood, however, that \nintentionally misleading statements would never be covered by the safe \nharbor provision. In addition, a number of other exceptions apply to \ninsure that investors can be protected adequately from fraud. In this \nway, the bill does not permit companies to misrepresent their future \nperformance or intentions knowingly. It simply permits them to suggest \nwhat they predict their future will entail without being subject to \nharassing lawsuits when, for one reason or another, reality differs \nfrom their suggestions.\n  The bill also reforms joints and several liability in private \nsecurities lawsuits. Often, accounting firms and others involved in \nissuing securities have been held liable and ultimately responsible for \nfraud that was at best the primary responsibility of the issuing \ncompany. This provision is carefully structured to be fair, and to \nensure that injured investors are protected to the greatest extent \npossible. As a general rule, liability would be several only, in \nproportion to a defendant's responsibility for wrongdoing.\n  Significantly, in cases involving knowing fraud, defendants would \nremain jointly and severally liable. That is something that opponents \nof this bill seem to have missed entirely. Where any defendant engages \nin knowing fraud, that defendant can be liable for the investors' \nentire loss. This bill does not give any leeway to knowing wrongdoers.\n  In addition, the bill also employs certain modifications to the joint \nand several rule where one defendant's share may be uncollectible. \nThose are designed to fairly balance the responsibilities and needs of \nplaintiffs and defendants. Thus, it helps improve a shareholder's \nability to gain full recovery, for instance, where the defendant \ncompany has gone bankrupt. In those cases, the other defendants' \ncontributions will be stepped up.\n\n  While this bill will grant some relief to accountants and others who \nhave been unfairly held jointly and severally liable, at the same time \nthe bill seeks to ensure that accountants take responsibility for \ndetecting fraud. The bill requires accountants to put in place \nprocedures to detect securities fraud. Then, if the accountant \ndiscovers or suspects fraud, the accountant must inform management. If \nmanagement fails to act accordingly, the accountant must then notify \nthe SEC concerning the suspected fraud.\n  In another provision designed to balance the need to ensure that true \nfraud does not go unpunished, the SEC is given authority to prosecute \nthose who aid and abet securities fraud. By giving this authority to \nthe SEC, it will not be misused by some of the securities lawyers who \nhave misused so many other provisions of the securities laws.\n  As one final point, I emphasize that the pervasive litigation abuses \nin securities class action lawsuits are not the only litigation misuses \nplaguing our civil justice system. In other areas of the law, reform is \nneeded just as desperately.\n  I was very proud to see the Senate pass product liability reform in \nMay, and I look forward to the passage of securities litigation reform. \nI only note that these two areas of legal reform are only the tip of \nthe iceberg. Americans have been subject to all sorts of litigation \nabuses that are imposing unjustifiable costs on our economy, our \nbusinesses, and our workers.\n  Those costs are passed on throughout the Nation and they cause harm \nwhenever a company, a school, or a volunteer organization must defend \nagainst outrageous legal claims. That occurs whether the lawsuits are \nsecurities litigation lawsuits, product liability actions, or garden \nvariety fraud, breach of contract, or other types of civil lawsuits.\n  I hope to have the Senate consider the problem of the multiple \nimposition of punitive damages for the same act or course of conduct. \nWhile it is not my intent to offer to this legislation amendments that \npertain to other, broader civil justice reforms, I see this bill as one \nstep in a progression of more extensive reforms to improve our \nlitigation system. I am pleased to see the support for this bill, and I \nlook to my colleagues for continuing efforts against litigation abuse.\n  Again, I thank Senators Domenici, Dodd, and D'Amato for their \nleadership and commend them for their efforts.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 240--the \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n  Mr. President, Americans need to be assured that their investment are \nsecure--that our money has been invested in good faith.\n  And, if an American investor has been the victim of fraud--no matter \nhow big or little--how rich or poor--they should get equal treatment \nunder the law.\n  Guilty parties must be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, I am not rich. I know that investments are risky. \nThere is no guarantee that you will make money in the stock market, or \nthe bond market, or on any investment.\n  I learned a long time ago--from my parents--that you should not \ninvest money you cannot afford to lose. So, now as a parent myself, I \nam very conservative in my investments.\n  I believe in personal responsibility.\n  But, Mr. President, there is an appropriate Federal role in this \nprocess, as well. We cannot abdicate our responsibility to protect the \nAmerican people.\n  And, Mr. president, we in Congress have a unique role in promoting \ninvestor confidence.\n  We have a duty to encourage critical investments--it is needed for \ncapital formation--it is needed for economic growth and job creation.\n  This is especially true in my home State of Washington--where many \nconsumers invest in small high-technology companies.\n  For Washington State and for the entire country--we must be vigilant \nto ensure proper protection for investors.\n  That is why I am a big supporter of the work of the Securities and \nExchange Commission: Chairman Arthur Levitt and his staff do a great \njob in exposing fraud and protecting even the smallest of investors.\n  Section 105 of this bill gives the SEC new authority to sue for \ndamages from securities fraud--so that victims of fraud will recover \nmore of their losses.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  Right now, Americans--who have been defrauded--have been getting only \npennies on the dollar for their losses. Victims of fraud deserve \nbetter; they deserve more. This bill will help change that.\n  Mr. President, that is why this bill is so critical. It returns some \ncommon sense to our legal system.\n  I have been pleased to work with my good friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, on this legislation. He has provided real leadership on \nthis issue together with the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici.\n  This bill is the best of bipartisan cooperation--it passed the \nBanking Committee by a vote of 11 to 4, with the majority of Democrats, \nvoting in favor of this much needed reform.\n  I have heard from so many people in my home State of Washington on \nthis issue. Many have told me the present system operates at the \nexpense of the investors it was intended to protect--everyday, \nhardworking Americans.\n  We have all heard the stores of court cases which diminish \ninvestments. They inhibit job creation. They slow economic growth.\n  How many times do small business people settle suits out of court \njust to make them go away?\n  And, as I said, how many times do small investors--who have actually \nbeen the victims of fraud--only receive pennies on the dollar of their \ninvestment?\n  This bill returns power and benefits to the little guy. Sections 101 \nand 102 of the D'Amato substitute are critical in this regard.\n  This reform will provide a mechanism for real plaintiffs--instead of \na few lawyers--to take charge of the cases.\n  That way, the interest of plaintiffs are taken into account.\n  And, investors are the ones who lose money when fraud occurs--they \nhave a right to have more of a say in steering the course of \nlitigation.\n  Right now, small investors lose out--we all lose out--because company \nresources are wasted on settling suits, instead of inventing new \nproducts.\n  Biotech companies waste their resources on settling nuisance lawsuits \ninstead of finding the cure for AIDS and breast cancer.\n  High-technology companies waste their time and resources on legal \nfees--instead of giving us a cutting technological edge that will bring \nus into the 21st century.\n  I have heard from many of these companies in my home State. Companies \nsuch as these--new, growing, forward-looking--are a point of civic \npride in the Pacific Northwest. They reflect the high-technology, high-\nwage economy of the future.\n  I have real letters from real people expressing the importance of \nthis bill. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Northern Group,\n\n                                        Seattle, WA, June 1, 1995.\n     Senator Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I would like to voice my strong \n     support for Senate Bill 240. This long overdue legislation is \n     critical to the continued success of our nation's \n     entrepreneurial underpinnings.\n       It is unfortunate that our judicial system has allowed a \n     small group of unscrupulous attorneys to create such havoc \n     among the community of public companies, particularly given \n     the evidence that shows the lawyers as primary beneficiaries.\n       Enough! S. 240 deserves your full support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn Kalnasy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   IMRE Corp.,\n\n                                        Seattle, WA, June 7, 1995.\n     Re Senate Bill 240.\n\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: We urge you to continue to support SB \n     240, a bill which would reduce the ability of parties to \n     bring groundless stockholder suits. IMRE Corporation is a \n     small, publicly held, biomedical company which is seeking to \n     develop therapeutic products to treat patients with certain \n     immunologically mediated conditions such as rheumatoid \n     arthritis and difficulties with kidney transplants. Given the \n     investor environment for biotechnology companies, wide \n     fluctuations in a company's stock price can occur because of \n     rumors, perceptions, and other factors outside the control of \n     the company.\n       While there are circumstances in which shareholder suits \n     should be brought to protect investors, many stockholder \n     suits which are filed are based solely on a sudden drop in \n     stock price which may have nothing to do with information \n     that was or was not disseminated to the public by the \n     company. Groundless shareholder suits consume vital corporate \n     resources that should be used for more productive purposes \n     such as research and development.\n       If we can be of any assistance in answering questions that \n     you or your staff may have about this subject matter, please \n     call me at (206) 298-9400.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Edward M.

Patty Murray,\n     Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing to urge your support of \n     S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n     This legislation, designed to curb abusive securities suits, \n     is very important to Washington Energy Company (WECO). We \n     believe that it is time to restore balance and fairness to \n     the securities litigation system.\n       The number of shareholder suits have escalated dramatically \n     in recent years. Many are unsubstantiated, however, companies \n     are forced to address them in protracted and extremely costly \n     processes. In addition, these suits may produce indirect \n     expenses, such as insurance costs and stock price \n     fluctuations. As you may know, Washington Energy Company \n     currently is involved with a shareholder suit. While the \n     court dismissed the claim as one without merit, we've been \n     forced to commit considerable resources. These costs will \n     continue to climb as the decision has been appealed.\n       S. 240 seeks to establish disincentives against filing \n     frivolous suits. It encourages voluntary disclosures, \n     transfers control of suits from lawyers to investors, and \n     enhances ways to address bona fide shareholder claims.\n       The Senate Budget Committee soon will be considering the \n     ``Chairman's Mark'' which reflects a good compromise. Your \n     support would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Wortley,\n     Vice President Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Key Technology, Inc.,\n\n                                    Walla Walla, WA, June 5, 1995.\n     Re S. 240, The Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing to express my support for \n     the provisions in the Private Securities Litigation Reform \n     Act (S. 240). This reform will benefit the growth of \n     companies, like Key Technology, that provide jobs and \n     economic expansion in our local communities. In addition, the \n     proposed reform will provide protection for those who have \n     invested these companies.\n       It is important that we work to provide a more fair basis \n     on which to establish the degree of liability for defendants, \n     to provide a safe harbor for statements by a company \n     regarding future economic performance, and to put an end to \n     litigation suits filed without any substantial evidence.\n       I am pleased to see that you are a co-sponsor of S. 240 and \n     encourage your continued support of this needed reform. Thank \n     you for taking a leadership position on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Madsen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Whirlpool Corp.,\n\n                                  Benton Harbor, MI, May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: As a company with a constituent \n     facility in Redmond, I am writing to request your support of \n     the Securities Litigation Reform Act. Senate Banking \n     Committee Chairman D'Amato's substitute for S. 240 is \n     scheduled to be marked up in the Senate Banking Committee on \n     Thursday, May 25, 1995.\n       We especially request your support for a ``safe harbor'' \n     which would correct the ``chilling effect'' on voluntary \n     disclosure of information to investors by providing companies \n     with protection from investor lawsuits based upon forward-\n     looking information. Disclosures that would be protected by a \n     safe harbor provision are predictive statements on business \n     trends, possible price movements and other market factors \n     which investors want and expect companies, such as Whirlpool, \n     to provide.\n       Unfortunately, the threat of private securities litigation, \n     should these predictions not be realized, is causing many \n     companies to hesitate before sharing such information. A \n     strong safe harbor provision will help correct the chilling \n     effect on disclosure and will force American businesses to \n     redirect their focus away from baseless lawsuits.

Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing on behalf of Darwin \n     Molecular, a start-up biotechnology company based in Bothell. \n     It has come to our attention that the U.S. Senate is \n     contemplating SB 240, a bill that would dramatically reduce \n     the ability of lawyers to file meritless stockholder \n     lawsuits. I am writing to encourage your continued support \n     for this bill.\n       As you well know, high technology business and especially \n     biotechnology companies face many uncertainties on the road \n     to produce development. This is an industry whose potential \n     may continue to be in jeopardy because of the inherent \n     difficulty of balancing out the financial opportunities and \n     obligations against truly innovative scientific and medical \n     productivity. It is difficult enough to raise sufficient \n     funding to do useful and beneficial research without the \n     additional burdens imposed by other types of ``risks'' often \n     from individuals who may be looking to enhance their own \n     situations. New companies in particular are vulnerable to \n     these risks.\n       Reform legislation in this area would be extremely \n     beneficial not only to assist companies but most importantly \n     to provide a more productive marketplace for the ultimate \n     beneficiary, the consumer.\n       We thank you for your support of this bill.\n\n                                                Diane Isonaka,\n\n                                          Director, Scientific and\n     Business Development.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Conductive Rubber\n\n\n                                             Technology, Inc.,\n\n                                        Bothell, WA, June 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: As the President of a small, high-tech \n     company in Bothell, Washington, I am concerned about the S. \n     240 legislation drafted to curb the extravagant number of \n     meritless lawsuits filed against high tech companies. As it \n     now stands, the bill has been altered from its original \n     intent and purpose and no longer provides the ``safe harbor'' \n     provision for forward-looking and predictive statements by \n     companies.\n       S. 240 is a modest, reasonable and balanced piece of \n     legislation which assured the right of private action as a \n     deterrent to fraud. The high-tech community has acted very \n     responsibly in their desire to provide access for truly \n     defrauded investors to sue for recovery. The U.S. House of \n     Representatives has already passed Securities Litigation \n     Reform Legislation by a veto-proof majority of 325 to 99.\n       I am asking you to support the original intent and purpose \n     of S. 240 by cosponsoring the bill and further to add your \n     vote to strengthening amendments for safe harbor, without \n     which reform will be meaningless for the high-tech community.\n       Please give your unqualified support to this important \n     bill. I look forward to the successful passage of S. 240 as \n     soon as possible.\n           Best regards,\n                                                    R.B.

Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I understand that the U.S. Senate is \n     considering a bill (SB 240) which would reduce frivolous \n     stockholder lawsuits. As both a small investor and an \n     employee of a company that provides services to high \n     technology companies, I strongly encourage your support of \n     such legislation.\n       High-tech companies, particularly high risk biomedical \n     companies, are susceptible to what amounts to extortion by \n     attorneys bringing meritless lawsuits. By nature, their stock \n     values fluctuate widely, and almost any sharp drop can \n     trigger a stockholder suit.\n       Officers of high-tech companies have become so fearful of \n     stockholder suits that disclosure of information of any type \n     can be a risky proposition. Such an intimidating business \n     atmosphere stifles the entrepreneurial spirit found in most \n     young high-tech enterprises.\n       Unscrupulous attorneys have stunted the growth of high-tech \n     companies, have cost the small investor money, and have made \n     themselves rich in the process. Again, I strongly encourage \n     your support of SB 240, as such legislation is a positive \n     step in limiting stockholder suits to only those cases which \n     have merit.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Mark Johnson,\n     Division Manager, Biomedical Projects.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Eagle Hardware & Garden,\n\n                                                     June 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I want to express our thanks and \n     appreciation for your vote for Senate Bill 240. It is very \n     important for businesses and employees in the state of \n     Washington.\n       Eagle Hardware & Garden, Inc. had a basically unfounded \n     class action suit filed against the company by Steve Berman. \n     It was a frivolous suit and the insurance company will settle \n     the case, but we know these suits can damage a fledging \n     company and affect the price of the stock for all \n     shareholders.\n       Again, your vote for Senate Bill 240 is greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Very truly yours,\n     David J.

Manager.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to read just a portion of another letter I \nreceived. It is from Michael Darling, who wrote:\n\n       Digital Systems International settled two securities cases \n     in 1993 for payments of cash and stock valued at $7.5 \n     million, not including litigation expenses. The costs of the \n     litigation forced the company to lay off 30 workers--and to \n     ask those remaining to accept pay cuts.\n\n  Mr. President, I have also heard from the opponents of the \nlegislation. I have listened carefully to every argument against the \nbill. I have worked to make this legislation good for all the parties \ninvolved.\n  In fact, I have studied this issue for more than 2 years with members \nof both sides of the aisle--in a strong bipartisan fashion--to make \nthis bill work for the American people.\n  As we debate this bill, there are ads running in the papers and \ninflammatory attack ads being broadcast by both sides in this debate. \nGiven the lengthy debate we have had on this bill, I find these \ncampaigns very disturbing.\n  Let me say to these groups, Mr. President, they are not serving \nanyone's purpose but their own.\n  They are not helping craft legislation that works for America--they \nare slugging it out trying to seek advantage.\n  I stand here on the floor today and say clearly to both sides of this \nissue--\n  Keep things in perspective. Use some common sense. Stop attacking and \nstart cooperating.\n  Mr. President, I have seen some unfortunate--and inaccurate--\nstatements made about this bill. Many have referred to an editorial \nfrom a Seattle newspaper which overlooked some of the bill's most \nimportant provisions.\n  First, their editorial states that high-profile, meritorious cases of \nsecurities fraud could not be brought once S. 240 becomes law.\n  That is simply not true. The SEC can always fight fraud, and they do \nso with vigor and clear purpose.\n  This point is made quite clearly in the committee report:\n\n       None of the provisions in S. 240 affects the SEC's ability \n     to bring enforcement actions.\n\n  Second, the editorial stated the bill contains a loser-pays \nprovision.\n  Again, this is untrue. S. 240 does not contain any fee-shifting \nprovisions.\n  It merely modifies rule 11 of the Federal Rule of Civilian Procedure. \nAnd, rule 11 does not sanction anyone just for losing their case.\n  This provision actually favors the small investor. S. 240 states that \nthe sanction does not apply if it will cause undue financial hardship \non the sanctioned party.\n  Mr. President, this editorial has been challenged aggressively by \npublic officials, business people, and many constituents in my State. I \nnow ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \nletters-to-the-editor to Washington newspapers on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n            [From Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 19, 1995]\n\n           Editorial on Fraud Law Shows Homework Wasn't Done\n\n                            (By John Level)\n\n       Your June 2 editorial regarding Sens. Patty Murray and \n     Slade Gorton was certainly not good reporting. Both senators \n     became co-sponsors of S. 240 because the bill is long \n     overdue. If you had done your homework, you would have found \n     the following information.\n       High-growth companies have become targets of abusive \n     securities litigation. There are about 300 lawsuits filed in \n     each of the past few years. Ninety-three percent are settled \n     before they go to court with settlements that amount to $8.6 \n     million or a $2.4 billion a year industry.\n       The only reason that these cases are settled out of court \n     is that it is cheaper in the long run. The trail lawyers are \n     the only big winners in these suits. In many cases, over 60 \n     percent of the settlement goes to the legal system.\n       Nearly seven out of 10 investors surveyed by Public Opinion \n     Strategies for the National Investor Relations Institute say \n     they want the bill passed. The only people who do not want \n     the bill passed are the lawyers, people who make a living \n     from lawsuits and some people who have not read the bill or \n     even seen it. I suspect that is the case with you.\n       Your editorial was written without a full understanding of \n     the bill, and your remarks about Murray are fully uncalled \n     for. A retraction should be made to her. While I don't agree \n     with Murray all of the time, she certainly made a good \n     decision in supporting this bill and it appears that she \n     ``read'' it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Seattle Times, June 7, 1995]\n\n                     Investors Retain Right To Sue\n\n                        (By Scott G. Hallquist)\n\n       The misleading information printed by The Times concerning \n     securities litigation reform has been a disservice to Times \n     readers. In both an editorial published May 29 and a news \n     article published May 31, Times writers incorrectly suggested \n     that the proposed legislation will strip investors of their \n     right to sue companies for fraud. This is simply not true.\n       The legislation to be considered by the Senate represents a \n     negotiated compromise that preserves an investor's right to \n     sue, while implementing reforms intended to curb lawsuits \n     that are filed without reasonable basis.\n       By providing a safe harbor for forward-looking company \n     forecasts made in good faith, the legislation is expected to \n     improve the quality of information companies can make \n     available to investors.\n       Most troubling to me was a personal attack upon the \n     integrity of Sen. Patty Murray by a local attorney who \n     specializes in securities litigation. Unlike her accuser, I \n     do not believe that Sen. Murray can be ``bought off'' and \n     applaud her courage for voting in favor of this legislation.\n       In our securities markets, the ability of individual \n     investors to sue for damages for fraud by securities issuers \n     does provide an important incentive for companies to provide \n     accurate and timely information to investors. In approving \n     the legislation now being considered by Congress, Sen. Murray \n     and other members of Congress balanced the need to preserve \n     redress for investors in fraud cases, against the need for \n     public companies to be able to discuss future performance \n     without the fear that unanticipated developments will \n     invariably result in costly and protracted litigation.\n       Growing public companies are primary engines of job \n     creation and economic growth in our state. Appropriately \n     balanced legislation such as the securities litigation reform \n     bill supported by Sen. Murray is a reasonable step that need \n     not be feared by individual or public investors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Seattle Times, June 19, 1995]\n\n       Reform Measure Doesn't Limit Liability of Accounting Firms\n\n                           (By John A. Moga)\n\n       Your May 29 editorial and your May 31 news report on \n     congressional efforts to repair a securities litigation \n     system that is drowning investors and businesses in a sea of \n     unmerited lawsuits included a number of disturbing factual \n     errors.\n       Your report that legislation (S. 240) introduced in the \n     Senate by Republican Sen. Pete Domenici would relieve \n     accounting firms of liability is simply not true. Rather, the \n     bill establishes a system of proportionate liability that \n     would base liability on a defendant's degree of \n     responsibility for any plaintiff damages. In cases of \n     ``knowing fraud'' where the defendant was guilty of \n     deliberate misconduct, the defendant would remain liable for \n     the total amount of damages assessed by the court. By the \n     way, this provision applies to all defendants--not just \n     accounting firms as you suggest.\n       The report also erroneously says that the bill eliminates \n     the ``fraud on the market'' provision of current law. This, \n     too, is untrue. S. 240 retains fraud on the market--which \n     enables shareholders to recover even when they are unaware of \n     the erroneous statement--an important provision for \n     investors.\n       Finally, I was distressed by the flat assertion in your \n     editorial that the proposed reform measures strip investors \n     and government of their right to sue. Neither the Senate bill \n     nor a measure passed by the House earlier this year does any \n     such thing.

Wolff)\n\n       Your editorial in defense of the current class-action \n     securities law is very wrong. You have not looked at the real \n     issue. Stockholder class-action suits enrich the lawyers at \n     the expense of the stockholders and the consumer.\n       Most suits against small public companies are never proved \n     but instead settle out of court because, regardless of right \n     or wrong, it is cheaper to pay than to defend. A word that \n     would describe this type of settlement is ``blackmail.'' \n     Carol Bartz, president of Autodesk, a CADD software company, \n     explained it this way at President Clinton's business \n     conference. A lawyer, using the name of a couple of \n     shareholders, instigated a class-action suit. Autodesk's \n     lawyers reviewed the claim and concluded that the company was \n     not in the wrong but advised the company to pay $10 million \n     because it would cost $100 million to defend. That is called \n     a ``negotiated'' settlement.\n       In a recent stockholder case against Egghead, the Issaquah-\n     based software retailer, I personally heard the judge approve \n     a similarly arrived-at settlement that paid the suing lawyer \n     about $700,000, which computes out at the rate of $700 per \n     ``billable'' hour. That is almost 200 times minimum wage.\n       The two stockholders in whose name the suit was brought had \n     lost a total of less than $1,200. The managers who were \n     running the company at that time paid nothing because they \n     were covered by a company guaranty. The total cost to the \n     company, and thus to the rest of the stockholders, was in the \n     order of $3 million, plus the loss of much management and \n     employee time. Among those stockholders, and thus among those \n     who in essence paid, was my nephew, a minor, whose savings \n     account for college was invested in the company. . . .\n       The judge implied that settlements like this would \n     encourage more such suits. Woe to small businesses, woe to \n     the investing public.\n       There are adequate criminal laws regarding fraud that are \n     handled by state and federal agencies; let those agencies \n     prosecute. . . .\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 16, 1995]\n\n     Editorial Fails To Acknowledge the Need to Reform Existing Law\n\n                             (By Dan Grimm)\n\n       As state treasurer and a member of the State Investment \n     Board, I read with interest your June 2 editorial on \n     securities litigation reform. The SIB has been involved in \n     costly and protracted litigation involving allegations of \n     securities fraud. (Your editorial noted the SIB's recent \n     recovery of $1 million in the settlement of a securities \n     fraud case. And like some corporations, the SIB has had to \n     deal with hastily drafted lawsuits filed by attorneys who \n     were out to make a quick buck.\n       I was disappointed that you failed to acknowledge the need \n     to reform the securities litigation law. The fact is, many \n     organizations representing investors and government entities \n     support legislation designed to deter costly and frivolous \n     litigation while preserving vital investor rights and \n     remedies.\n       Your editorial correctly pointed our that legislation under \n     consideration by Congress could unduly burden investors and \n     limit their access to the courts. That's why I sent a letter \n     to our Senate delegation urging them to oppose legislation \n     that does not strike an appropriate balance between the \n     concerns of investors and corporations.\n       I have been in contact with Sen. Patty Murray to share \n     those concerns, and contrary to the assertions of your \n     editorial, she shares the view that securities-reform \n     legislation must protect the rights of investors as well as \n     address the problems of frivolous lawsuits. In fact, Murray \n     was instrumental in making sure that legislation under \n     consideration by Congress will reasonably protect the rights \n     of small and large investors. With her assistance, the \n     draconian ``loser pays'' provision was tempered in the \n     Banking Committee. I am optimistic that Murray will be \n     successful in her efforts to see that other anti-investor \n     language is moderated or even removed from the bill as it \n     moves through the Senate.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this system needs reform. S. 240 will \nretain the rights of investors to bring suit if they have been the \nvictims of securities fraud.\n  At the same time, it will clamp down on the abusive suits that prey \non investors and small business owners.\n  It is an honest effort to reduce the excessive costs to investors and \nour economy. It enjoys bipartisan support.\n  It is a good compromise.\n  For those of us concerned about the rights of investors--let me be \nvery clear.\n  It is absolutely critical to me that businesses and entrepreneurs \nremain bound to their obligations to maximize the return-on-\ninvestment--to seniors\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\nand average American families who invest in stocks and bonds.\n  I will not support a bill which goes further than this in changing \nthe current system.\n  I will not support a loser pays provision.\n  I will fight efforts to remove the protections for small investors in \nthe bill.\n  I will reject any legislation that takes away the SEC's powers to \nfight fraud.\n  These are lines I will not cross, and in fact, no Senator should \ncross.\n  They set my standards publicly for Senators offering amendments \ntoday--and Senators who go into conference with the House.\n  As it stands now, S. 240 brings rationality and perspective and \ncommon sense to the system.\n  And, I urge its swift adoption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have many questions about S. 240, the so-\ncalled Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. This bill is intended \nto curb frivolous lawsuits by private investors claiming securities \nfraud. But I fear that this bill would also stifle honest lawsuits. I \ncannot support a bill that will infringe on the rights of innocent \nsecurities fraud victims.\n  Our Federal securities laws provide enforceable legal rights to the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and private investors. The \nability of private investors to enforce their rights is indispensable \nto enforcing our Federal securities laws. As one former Commissioner of \nthe SEC said:\n\n       Because the Commission does not have adequate resources to \n     detect and prosecute all violations of the federal securities \n     laws, private actions preform a critical role in preserving \n     the integrity of our securities market.\n  A perfect example of this critical role is the securities fraud case \ninvolving Charles Keating, known for his role in the largest savings \nand loan debacle in U.S. history. After Keating, as president of the \nLincoln Savings & Loan of California, sold uninsured bonds in the \nlobbies of Lincoln branches by making misrepresentations, private \ninvestors sued under our Federal securities laws. A class of 23,000 \ninvestors recovered $240 million of their $288 million in losses \nthrough private securities fraud actions.\n  I am sure that the vast majority of professionals working in the \nsecurities industry strive to provide accurate information and there \nare some abuses of the private securities litigation system. This \nlegislation would, undoubtedly, curb many of these abuses. For \ninstance, I support the bill's provisions to prohibit lawyers from \npaying bounties to professional plaintiffs, those who buy a few shares \nof different stocks so they may bring shareholder suits for a living.\n  But this bill also overreaches beyond these abuses and penalizes \ninnocent investors. Under S. 240, for example, aiders and abettors \ncannot be sued in private securities actions, even if they knowingly \nassist securities fraud. The defendants in the Charles Keating case \nwhose liability depending on aiding and abetting, which included \nKeating's lawyers, accountants and consultants, paid over $100 million \nto fraud victims.\n  In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthat enactment of S. 240 would increase costs to the SEC for \nenforcement actions by $125 million to $250 million over the next 5 \nyears. In these tight budget times, I am very doubtful that Congress \nwill increase the SEC's budget by such a large amount. As a result, \nenforcement of our securities laws will suffer.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters, including the commissioner of the \nVermont Department of Banking, Insurance and Securities--the State's \nchief securities regulator--who feel S. 240, as reported by the Senate \nBanking Committee, would severely limit private actions under \nsecurities laws. Vermont institutional investors, such as the Towns of \nColchester, Brandon and Stowe, Teamster Union Local 597, the Vermont \nNEA, AFSCME Council 93, the Vermont State Labor Council and others have \nalso alerted me to their opposition to this bill. Vermont consumer and \nsenior groups including Vermont Public Interest Research Group, Council \nof Vermont Elders, Older Women's League, Southwestern Vermont Council \non Aging and the Central Vermont Council on Aging opposed S. 240. \nMoreover, the Commissioner of the SEC--the national's chief securities \nregulator--also has significant concerns about S. 240 as reported.\n  I believe we are moving too fast on this bill, ignoring the SEC and \nothers concerns. That is why I supported a motion on the Senate floor \nto refer this bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am a \nmember. This legislation would make significant changes to Federal \nlitigation rules and should be carefully reviewed by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee before the full Senate votes on it. Unfortunately, \nthat motion was defeated.\n  Thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans depend on our \nFederal securities laws to protect their investments, savings and \nretirements. These laws are just too important to add questionable \ncurbs that may protect companies and individuals who commit fraud at \nthe expense of innocent investors. Unless this bill is significantly \namended, I will vote against it.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to propound a number of \nunanimous consent agreements which we have worked out in order to \naccommodate Members and in order to move the legislative flow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bryan be recognized to offer an \namendment relative to aiding and abetting on which there will be 1 hour \nfor debate to be equally divided in the usual form, and any second-\ndegree amendments may be limited to half that debate time, and must be \nrelevant in the first degree they propose to amend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I further ask that following the debate \non the Bryan amendment, the amendment be laid aside, and Senator Boxer \nbe recognized to offer an amendment relative to lead plaintiffs, on \nwhich there will be 90 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual \nform, and any second-degree amendment be limited to half the debate \ntime and must be relevant to the first-degree amendment they propose to \namend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I further ask that at 9:15 on Tuesday, \nthe Senate resume consideration of S. 240, and that there be time for \n30 minutes of debate on the Bryan amendment to be equally divided in \nthe usual form, and following that debate there will be 30 minutes for \ndebate on the Boxer amendment, to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour \nof 10:15 on Tuesday, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to \nthe Bryan amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on or in \nrelation to the Boxer amendment, with 2 minutes prior to the second \nvote for Senator Boxer in the usual form, to set forth an explanation, \n1 minute on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I further ask, following the two stacked \nvotes at 10:15, Senator Sarbanes be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelative to safe harbor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAbraham be recognized, and that the time he utilizes be charged against \nthe time that we would be allocated in considering the Bryan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n240. This legislation makes a number of important reforms that are \ndesigned to prevent abuse in litigation connected with the issuance of \nsecurities.\n  This in turn will improve the investment climate in this country, \nwhich will make it easier to start businesses and create jobs.\n  These changes will be made without, in my judgment, in any way \nundermining protection for investors against genuine fraud or other \nmisconduct by issuers.\n  There is one particular set of reforms the bill would make on which I \nwould like to focus. The bill will require courts to sanction attorneys \nwho file\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nfrivolous pleadings. This reform will apply when the lawyers file \nfrivolous proceedings on behalf of plaintiffs and on lawyers filing on \nbehalf of defendants. I think it is an extremely sound proposal which \nshould command strong support from Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Indeed, as the Presiding Officer will recall, he himself offered a \nsimilar provision with regard to the product liability issue some weeks \nago, a provision which I supported and which a majority of Senators \nsupported at that time.\n  Mr. President, under present law, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nNo. 11 requires all attorneys to have some factual and legal basis for \nfiling any claim or defense. If attorneys violate this requirement, \ncourts may award sanctions against the violator. Right now, however, \nthe courts are not required to take any action against the violator.\n  The changes proposed by S. 240 would do three things. First, they \nwould require courts to find, at the end of all securities cases, \nwhether any attorney violated rule 11. Second, the court would then \nhave to impose a sanction if they found a violation. Third, that \nsanction would presumptively require the attorney in violation to pay \nthe other side's attorney fees, although the court could select another \nsanction if the attorney shows that the presumptive sanction would \nimpose an undue burden on the sanctioned party.\n  Two important features of this reform should particularly be known. \nFirst, the court would only be obligated to impose a sanction on an \nattorney who filed a frivolous pleading; that is, a pleading wholly \nlacking in a legal or factual basis. This reform will in no way kill \nlegitimate litigation.\n  Second, the sanction is paid by the person signing the frivolous \npleading; that is to say the attorney responsible, not by the party the \nattorney is representing.\n  The Supreme Court itself has noted the securities litigation has been \nespecially prone to be misused as a tool to extort settlements. It is \nCongress' responsibility to do something to put an end to this abuse. \nThe rule 11 provisions are one mechanism this legislation puts in place \nto do just that.\n  This leaves me, however, with one problem about what we are doing \nhere this week. It is certainly good we are taking serious steps to \nenact litigation reforms that will address abusive practices in the \nsecurities area. Similarly, it was good we took similar steps to enact \nreforms that address abusive practices in the field of product \nliability, which we did just a few weeks ago.\n  I ask, Mr. President, why are we stopping here? Brokerage firms, \naccountants, and manufacturers, and the people who buy their products \nor use their services, are far from the only victims of our out-of-\ncontrol civil justice system.\n  Our homeowners, farmers, volunteer groups, charitable organizations, \nsmall businesses, State and local governments, architects, engineers, \ndoctors and patients, employers and employees, are likewise injured by \nour civil justice system on a daily basis.\n  Every day, lawsuits suffering from the same defects as those the \nsponsors of this litigation have brought up are filed against all of \nthese people.\n  Indeed, when their plight was brought to the attention of the Senate \nduring the product liability debate, along with several other \ncolleagues, I led an effort to broaden the reforms that bill would have \nmade.\n  We wanted reforms that would benefit all Americans. A majority of \nSenators supported many of our broadening proposals, yet the will of \nthat majority was frustrated by opponents of broader reform, who made \nclear they would filibuster a bill that made civil justice reforms that \nwould benefit all Americans. I considered mounting a similar effort in \nconjunction with this bill, but sponsors of this legislation were \nassured that it would suffer a similar fate. Therefore, and with some \nregret, I yielded to their request not to offer broadening amendments \nat this time. However, I do not believe the Senate can forever avoid \nconfronting the fact that, while it is making important reforms in \nspecific areas of civil justice, it is refusing to make broad-based \nreforms that will help small businesses, charities, and other \ninstitutions that form the backbone of this country. I, for one, will \ncontinue to bring these reforms up, again and again. I will not rest \nuntil broad-based reforms to our civil justice system are adopted.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we take the actions we \ntake today to protect the people in the securities industry and people \nwho are shareholders in corporations that are affected by these \nfrivolous lawsuits, just as I think it was appropriate that we take \nthose actions in conjunction with product liability actions. But across \nAmerica, every day the small business people, the farmers, and the \ncharitable organizations in our communities suffer from frivolous \nlawsuits brought against them. They suffer when the joint and several \nliability provisions cause deep pockets to end up paying for damages \nthey had virtually no connection with creating. I think it is time for \nacross-the-board reforms that protect, not just certain areas of civil \njustice, but all areas.\n  For those reasons, I intend to come back to this Chamber at a future \ntime to offer some of those types of reforms, and I look forward to \nworking with other Members of the Senate who agree we need them and we \nneed them soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Michigan \nbecause he does have, and has had, a number of proposals that I believe \nwould have strengthened the bill. He has agreed, in order to get \nlegislation that would pass and begin to address some of the \nshortcomings in the present system, to withhold them--I deeply \nappreciate that--so we can make some progress. I fully anticipate in \nthe future he will go forward with those legislative initiatives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1474\n\n   (Purpose: To amend provisions relating to liability for aiding or \n                          abetting violations)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1474.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 127, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 128, line 15, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 108.

No person \n     shall be liable under this subsection based on an omission or \n     failure to act unless such omission or failure constituted a \n     breach of a duty owed by such person.''.\n       (b) Securities Exchange Act of 1934.--Section 20 of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78t) is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Prosecution of Persons Who Aid or Abet Violations.--\n     For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 21(d), or \n     an action by a self-regulatory organization, or an express or \n     implied private right of action arising under this title, any \n     person who knowingly or recklessly provides substantial \n     assistance to another person in the violation of a provision \n     of this title, or of any rule or regulation promulgated under \n     this title, shall be deemed to violate such provision and \n     shall be liable to the same extent as the person to whom such \n     assistance is provided.

No \n     person shall be liable under this subsection based on an \n     omission or failure to act unless such omission or failure \n     constituted a breach of duty owed by such person.''.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, our colleagues will recall, under the unanimous \nconsent agreement propounded by our distinguished chairman, that this \nis an amendment that deals with restoring aiding and abetting \nliability. The amendment which I offer is to restore the state of the \nlaw as everyone in America believed it to be prior to last year's \nSupreme Court decision in a case involving Central Bank of Denver \nversus First Interstate Bank of Denver.\n  With one stroke of the judicial pen, so to speak, this 5-to-4 \ndecision wiped out private liability for crooked professionals who aid \nand abet, but who are not defined as primary participants in securities \nfraud under the provision of the law. What we are talking about are \nthose people who counsel and assist in furtherance of the perpetration \nof fraud. Some of them are disreputable lawyers--who ought to be \ndisbarred. Others are accountants. Others are professionals who, by \nvirtue of their own affirmative action, have aided and contributed to \nthe securities fraud involved.\n  Aiding and abetting liability was the primary method through which \nprofessional assistors of fraud--these lawyers, accountants and \ninvestment banks--have historically been held liable to defrauded \ninvestors. In my view, if this decision is allowed to stand without \naction having been taken by the Congress, it will seriously weaken and \nerode the effectiveness of our Federal securities laws because it \noverturns three decades of established precedent in which Federal \ncourts have permitted private investors to sue aiders and abettors of \nsecurities fraud.\n  Every circuit court of appeals to address the issue--11 circuits--has \nupheld aiding and abetting liability. Investors have long had the right \nto sue accountants, brokers, bankers and lawyers who, by their actions, \nhave assisted the primary perpetrators of such securities schemes. This \nright of action has played a critical role in compensating those \ninvestors who have been swindled in major financial frauds of recent \ntimes. I will comment a bit more on that in just a moment.\n  The damage caused by the Central Bank decision is immeasurable. \nDozens, if not hundreds, of participants in securities frauds have had \ncases against them dismissed on the basis of the Central Bank decision. \nAn unknown number of other cases against clear wrongdoers have been \nprecluded, based on the Central Bank decision. And the deterrence of \nsecurities fraud, which ought to be one of the prime reasons for the \nlaw in the first place, has suffered a major blow. The problem is that \nin immunizing wrongdoers who substantially assist fraud, we clearly \ngive fraudulent behavior a green light.\n  I cannot think of any argument that could be advanced, as a matter of \nsocial or economic justice, in which we ought to reward fraudulent \nbehavior on the part of those who aid and abet a primary perpetrator in \na securities fraud to the detriment and loss of literally tens of \nthousands of innocent investors. Under the Central Bank case, it is \nsimply OK to help others commit securities fraud so long as you are \ncareful not to make any direct statements or direct the wrongdoing.\n  I know a good bit of animosity is directed to America's lawyers, and \nI must say that I am not happier than anybody else who has seen in \nAmerica, speaking generically, a proliferation of a lot of litigation \nthat ought not to be filed. If I might cite an outrageous case in my \nown State that has nothing to do with the issue currently, but it is \nthe kind of case that just engenders real hostility on the part of the \npublic--and count me on the part of those being hostile. It is a person \nwho, under the workers compensation law in our State, had been denied \nrecovery. Subsequent to that, he drove his automobile into the worker \ncompensation office in the Las Vegas area, nearly killed several people \nwho were working, and then a year or two later had the temerity to file \na lawsuit against the SIS, which is the worker compensation system in \nNevada, blaming the system for causing his action in doing extensive \ndamage to the building and literally terrifying those employees.\n  So I am not unmindful of the hostility that has been generated. But \nthis is a case that rewards lawyers. If you are clever enough not to \nmake a direct statement or participate directly in the wrongdoing, then \nyou are home free. You do not go to jail, you go home free. I cannot \nimagine that is the sort of thing that we want to encourage.\n  To put this into some historical context, if this decision had been \non the books earlier, the substantial recoveries by the victims in the \nKeating case--which is the Lincoln Savings and Loan case--would have \nbeen impossible. As you will recall, in the Lincoln Savings and Loan \ncase, the primary wrongdoer was the nefarious Charles Keating. By the \ntime the class action is filed, Mr. Keating is bankrupt.\n  There was a judgment entered of about $240 to $262 million in the \nclass action. But about half, a little more than $100 million of \nrecovery for the 23,000 bondholders, would have been denied to these \n23,000 bondholders. These are people who are totally innocent, have no \nculpability at all other than the fact that they relied upon some \nrepresentations made at the savings and loan which they kind of thought \nwas a local, home-based outfit. Everybody knew each other. Mr. and Mrs. \nSmith would be greeted every morning. ``Have you walked your dog? Your \ncat?'' ``How are the grandkids doing?'' That sort of thing. But the \naiders and abettors responded with more than $100 million of recovery \nthat otherwise would have been denied to these 23,000 bondholders. Had \nthis case, Central Bank, been the law, that $100 million recovery would \nnot have been possible.\n  These are aiders and abettors, people who have assisted in the fraud. \nAgain, if the scales of justice mean anything, should those who have \naided and abetted, in terms of their own conduct, not be held \nresponsible, to respond to damages incurred by their conduct to those \nwho are totally innocent?\n  That is what this whole issue is all about. Federal District Judge \nStanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief, in his opinion in the \nKeating case asked critical questions that sum up the theory behind \naiding and abetting:\n\n       Where were the professionals when these clearly improper \n     transactions were being consummated? Why didn't any of them \n     speak up or disassociate themselves from the transactions? \n     Where also were the outside accountants and attorneys when \n     these transactions were effectuated?\n\n  In a subsequent speech, Judge Sporkin elaborated,\n\n       For this kind of massive, very sophisticated fraud to have \n     occurred, it required the complicity of certain professionals \n     that we all know of--CPAs, lawyers and appraisers. I am \n     suggesting that perhaps these professionals did not discharge \n     their responsibilities to the broader public interest.\n\n  The responsibility of corrupt accountants and lawyers for the savings \nand loan debacle of the 1980's can hardly be overstated. On August 12, \n1992, then SEC Chairman Richard Breeden wrote Senator Domenici:\n\n       Securities fraud actions against accounting firms that \n     participate in or assist in fraudulent activity by not \n     properly\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\n     preforming their auditing functions are important to the \n     maintenance of high standards of quality and integrity among \n     public accounting firms.\n\n  Parenthetically, I should say I think the public has a right to \nexpect that level of integrity.\n  Then Chairman Breeden went on to say:\n\n       Investors rely heavily on the accuracy of all of audited \n     financial statements of public companies as do creditors, \n     investment analysts and others. When others fail to adhere to \n     generally accepted accounting principles or generally \n     accepted auditing standards, many innocent parties may \n     suffer. Indeed, inaccuracies in audited financial statements \n     of banks and savings and loans have contributed billions of \n     dollars in investor losses during the past 10 years. Public \n     policy should seek to maintain high expectations of integrity \n     and accuracy in the performance by others and accountants of \n     their tasks.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what the Republican Chairman of the SEC had to \nsay about the importance of holding aiders and abettors responsible for \ntheir actions.\n  A number of notable statistics from cases brought by the Federal \nGovernment highlight the importance of holding professional assistors \nliable: In 1990, the RTC banned six of the largest accounting firms--\nErnst & Young, Deloitte & Touche, Coopers & Lybrand, Peat Marwick, \nArthur Andersen, and Grant Thornton--from receiving thrift \nreorganization work because they were being sued by the Government for \nfailure to perform their audits of S's in a professional manner.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, when all categories of \nprofessionals are considered, Resolution Trust Corp. attorneys \nsuspected wrongdoing on the part of one or more professionals \naffiliated with over 80 percent of failed thrift institutions. More \nthan 80 percent. There is some indication that professionals were \nresponsible, and attorneys in particular were suspected of wrongdoing.\n  In one astounding example of the pervasive role of accountants in S \nwrongdoing, a Federal judge stated in 1992 that:\n\n       [The Office of Thrift Supervision] advised the court that \n     approximately one-third of the 690 financial institutions \n     that have failed were audited by Ernst & Young or its \n     predecessor.--Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision v. \n     Ernst & Young, 786 F. Supp. 46, 52 (D.D.C. 1992).\n\n  In a speech before the American Bar Association, Timothy Ryan, former \nDirector of the Office Thrift Supervision, stated:\n\n       The federal agencies have uncovered actionable abuse in a \n     third of the failed thrifts investigated to date. It is clear \n     that many of the unlawful scheme hatched at those failed \n     institutions could not have proceeded without the active \n     assistance of professional service providers, especially \n     lawyers. They have abandoned their ethics for expediency, and \n     sold their good name to satisfy their greed.\n\n  Mr. President, the point I seek to make is that unless the law is \nchanged, that kind of conduct, so articulately denounced, will remain \nunpunished and innocent investors will be unable to recover from \nlawyers, accountants, and other professionals.\n  So, Mr. President, the loss of aiding and abetting liability \nundermines fundamental protections for investors and the securities \nmarkets. Many defrauded investors will not recover their losses \nbecause, typically, the perpetrator of the fraud is insolvent, in jail, \nor has fled by the time the case is completed. In addition to wiping \nout private actions against aiders and abettors, the Central Bank case \ncalls into question the SEC's own enforcement actions against aiders \nand abettors.\n  S. 240 fails to restore aiding and abetting liability for private \nactions. Although it authorizes the SEC to take action against aiders \nand abettors who knowingly violate the securities laws, it effectively \neliminates the ability of the Commission to proceed against reckless \nprofessional assistors, which is now permitted by most courts.\n  This amendment, which was drafted with the technical assistance of \nthe SEC, reverses the Central Bank decision, and restores the status \nquo ante. It restores the law to the way it was prior to the Central \nBank case last year by restoring aiding and abetting authority in \nindividual securities fraud actions and clarifying the SEC's authority \nto pursue aiders and abettors for reckless and knowing fraud.\n  The original sponsor of securities litigation reform, Senator Dodd, \nhas recognized the importance of aiding and abetting liability and has \nurged a response to Central Bank. At a May 12, 1994, hearing before \nthis committee, he said:\n\n       In my view, aiding and abetting liability has been \n     critically important in deterring individuals from assisting \n     possible fraudulent acts by others. Until the Supreme Court \n     changed the landscape a few weeks ago, aiding and abetting \n     liability was an important tool in ensuring honesty and high \n     professional standards by individual professionals who \n     facilitate access to the securities markets. In my view, we \n     need to respond to the Supreme Court's decision promptly and \n     I emphasize promptly.\n\n  In a February 27, 1995, ``Dear Colleague,'' Senator Dodd and Senator \nDomenici reiterated that a reversal of Central Bank should occur ``as a \npart of a comprehensive package to fix our broken securities class \naction system.'' In his additional views to the committee report on S. \n240, Senator Dodd again expressed his concern about the restoration of \naiding and abetting liability for private actions.\n  Even the Supreme Court majority opinion in Central Bank which was \nbased solely on the lack of the actual words ``aiding and abetting'' in \nthe statute, recognized the need for restoring aiding and abetting \nliability. In the words of Justice Kennedy:\n\n       To be sure, aiding and abetting a wrongdoer ought to be \n     actionable in certain instances. The issue, however, is not \n     whether imposing private liability on aiders and abettors is \n     good policy, but whether aiding and abetting liability is \n     covered by the statute.\n\n  The SEC argued strongly in the Supreme Court that ``aiding and \nabetting'' liability was critical to enforcement of the Federal \nsecurities laws. Since the Court decision, the SEC has repeatedly urged \nCongress to restore aiding and abetting liability. Most recently, on \nApril 6, 1995, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt testified before the \nSubcommittee on Securities that:\n\n       Unless another theory of liability can be applied in a \n     particular case, persons who knowingly or recklessly assist \n     the perpetration of a fraud may be insulated from liability \n     to private parties if they act behind the scenes and do not \n     themselves make statements, directly or indirectly, that are \n     relied upon by investors. Because this is conduct that should \n     be deterred, Congress should enact legislation to restore \n     aiding and abetting liability in private actions. Such \n     legislation should also clarify the Commission's ability to \n     use the aiding and abetting theory of liability where it is \n     not expressly provided by statute.\n\n  Levitt previously testified that, of 400 pending SEC cases, 80 to 85 \nrely on aiding and abetting theories of liability.\n  I must say, Mr. President, as I read the current version of S. 240, \neven the ability of the SEC to recover for aiding-and-abetting \nliability seems to be more narrowly confined than those circumstances \nwhere there is knowledge or scienter involved.\n  On May 25, 1995, the day S. 240 was voted out of the Banking \nCommittee, Chairman Levitt again raised the aiding-and-abetting issue, \nnoting that, while some of the SEC's authority had been restored, ``a \nmore complete solution is preferable.''\n  The bar association of the city of New York--undoubtedly the leading \norganization of plaintiff and defense attorney's in the securities \nfield--has taken an extremely strong position on this issue. As Mr. \nSheldon Elsen testified in the House,\n\n       Let me turn, finally, to lawsuits against lawyers, \n     accountants, underwriters and other professionals. Experience \n     in these cases has shown that securities frauds do not \n     succeed very often without the aid of such professionals, but \n     that it is almost impossible to prove the professionals' \n     involvement . . . The Association feels particularly strongly \n     about this matter, which involves lawyer misconduct. In our \n     view, the primary problem of abuse by lawyers lies in the \n     conduct of securities lawyers involved in fraudulent \n     transactions.\n\n  That is a scorching indictment by the most distinguished and \nknowledgeable and the most sophisticated bar in America dealing with \nthis subject. And it deals with lawyer misconduct. Thus our purpose \nhere simply is to deter lawyer misconduct on the part of the plaintiffs \nbar, and that we certainly ought to do. If the changes which our able \nchairman has crafted to rule 11 do, indeed, deal with misconduct in the \nform of frivolous actions by the plaintiffs bar, why would we not also \nwant to impose liability on lawyers, accountants and others who are \nhelping\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\nto assist in the perpetration of this fraud? The policy disconnect, Mr. \nPresident, I find difficult to comprehend.\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated previously, the securities \nregulators in their respective States also support this proposition. \nAnd it seems to me that in light of the indications that we have seen \nthat the amount of securities fraud is estimated to be about $40 \nbillion annually--the SEC has commented recently in an article which I \nshared with our colleagues on Friday that securities fraud is not \nsomething out of the 19th century; it is very much alive, very \nsophisticated--the sophisticated aiders and abettors, the clever \nlawyers, the smooth accountants who assist in this fraud behind the \nscenes, they ought to be brought to the bar of justice, and economic \nrecovery for innocent victims is the way of achieving that economic \njustice.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will try not to take a \ngreat deal of time on this. I have said privately, Mr. President, I am \ngoing to hire the Senator from Nevada as my lawyer if I am ever in need \nof a lawyer, after the Senator from New York apparently.\n  I have known the Senator from Nevada for a long time. No one is \nbetter in crystallizing an argument and making a thoughtful \npresentation on a point. Certainly we have seen his incredible ability \nhere over the last several days on a number of amendments that he has \noffered to this bill.\n  On this particular issue of aiding and abetting, he has once again \ndisplayed those skills which should probably earn him a distinguished \nreputation as great debater of causes. But we disagree on this \namendment. I say that because we agree on aspects of this. The tendency \nof these debates on amendments is to lose sight of where you agree.\n  One of the things this bill does do is, of course, extend to the SEC \nthe authority to bring aiding and abetting cases, which was not the \ncase prior to this legislation as a result of Supreme Court decisions \nso we have strengthened it.\n  Second, when it comes to the issue of fraud, knowing intentional \nfraud, we do not change anything in effect. The joint and several \nprovisions apply. People who are knowingly involved in those \nactivities, all can be subject to the maximum financial penalties.\n  What we are talking about here is a much lower standard and one that \nwould apply, as the amendment indicates, to knowing or reckless \nbehavior. It is a result of that standard and the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada that I would take exception, particularly the \nrecklessness standard. The knowing standard, if you could really \ntighten that up to some degree and actual knowledge, and so forth, I \nthink you might have something that we would like to talk about. But \nthe recklessness standard here is a standard that is so difficult to \napply that it in effect would destroy the attempts of this legislation \nto mitigate against this explosion of unwarranted litigation in the \narea of securities.\n  Let me just, if I can, Mr. President, as a matter of background point \nout that until the Central Bank of Denver case was decided last year, \nmany circuit courts recognized aiding-and-abetting liability.\n  I want to come back to that point in a minute because one of the \npoints I wish to make here is that it is being implied or suggested if \nwe adopt this amendment, all we are doing is going back and just \napplying the law as it was prior to the Central Bank of Denver case. I \nwould argue very strenuously here in a moment that, in fact, we are \ngoing by and applying a different standard than existed prior to the \ndecision on Central Bank of Denver and, in fact, going further back \nthan I think the courts at least in many cases would like to see us go.\n  At any rate, that was the situation. Prior to Central Bank of Denver \nthere was a controversy about aiding-and-abetting. In that case, the \nSupreme Court decided that there was no aiding and abetting liability \nfor private lawsuits involving fraud and that in fact that idea evolved \nas a result of section 10(b), rule 10b-5. And many can argue, in fact, \nthat probably was the case; that we had not legislatively determined \nthat, this has been more of an evolution of an idea over the years, and \nso the issue comes back to us if we want to expand it.\n  The Supreme Court did not believe that section 10(b) intended to \ncover aiding-and-abetting liability. You can argue about that, but that \nis how the Court ruled. Providing for aiding and abetting liability \nunder section 10(b) would be contrary to the goal of this legislation.\n  I remind my colleagues to come back to the central goal of this \nlegislation, and that is to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits \nthat are being brought under 10(b) and to try and avoid what my \ncolleague from New York, I think, has appropriately described as sort \nof a hijacking scheme that goes on where you end up with these \nsettlements because if you do not settle, the small percentage of risk \nthat you may end being held accountable causes people to settle for \namounts vastly in excess of their involvement.\n  The case we talked about earlier today where Peat Marwick in a \n$15,000 contract to go in and do an audit of some banks books were \nbrought to trial, and it went on for some time. The courts ultimately \ndecided that in that case Peat Marwick was not responsible, did not \nmeet the aiding-and-abetting standard, but the legal fees for Peat \nMarwick for a $15,000 contract, which is a nothing contract, were in \nexcess of $7 million. That is what it cost that company over a $15,000 \ncontract.\n  We want to stop that kind of stuff. That should not have to go on, \nfrankly. And that is where the crux of this whole legislation is \ndesigned to try and minimize those sorts of problems.\n  At any rate, the Supreme Court said in the Central Bank of Denver \ncase--and it is highly appropriate that we have as the Presiding \nOfficer this evening the distinguished Senator from Denver--from \nColorado. I apologize--in that case litigation under rule 10b-5 \npresents a danger of vexatiousness--it is a mouthful, that word, \n``vexatiousness''--different in degree and kind and would require \nsecondary actors to expend large sums even for pretrial defense and the \nnegotiation of settlement.\n  That is exactly what happened to Peat Marwick--a $15,000 contract, a \n$7 million legal fee. Peat Marwick, it was painful to them. They \nprobably passed that cost on to a lot of other clients out there, so it \nis not as if somehow the company just absorbed it, as bad it was for \nthem, but there is where you get the economic ripple effect as a result \nof a lawsuit where again the allegation is that they were marginally \ninvolved, aiding and abetting on a $15,000 contract. The Court said no, \nthey were not ultimately but not before that company spent $7 million \nto defend against a $15,000 contract.\n  The Supreme Court did not consider whether the SEC was able to bring \ncases for aiding and abetting, and the committee print, as I mentioned \na moment ago, restores aiding and abetting liability for the Securities \nand Exchange Commission. Allowing the SEC to bring cases against aiders \nand abetters strikes, we think, a balance. It allows the SEC to punish \nbad actors without opening the door to a flood of unnecessary \nlitigation.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the reason that we reluctantly oppose the \namendment of our colleague, because it does change the standard.\n  Now, let me come back to the point I made earlier, because the \nsuggestion that all we are doing is making whole the situation prior to \nthe Supreme Court's decision on the Central Bank of Denver case is just \nnot borne out.\n  Let me point out that prior to the Central Bank of Denver the courts \nacross the country adopted different types of scienter, standards, for \nthe aiding-and-abetting context. Some courts concluded that, as with \nthe primary violators, recklessness was sufficient.\n  I would say to my colleague from Nevada he is correct in that. There \nwere courts that did hold the recklessness standard adds enough to net \nsomeone under the aiding-and-abetting provisions. Other courts, I would \npoint out just as quickly, Mr. President, held that where the alleged \nprimary violators did not have an independent duty\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nto disclose information to the plaintiff, proof of actual knowledge of \nthe fraud was required. Still other courts adopted what the SEC \ndescribed to the Supreme Court as the sliding scale approach to aiding \nand abetting under which the degree of scienter required for aiding-\nand-abetting liability varied depending upon the nature of the \ndefendant's conduct and the presence or absence of a duty to disclose.\n  So here we had a lot of different standards being used. Recklessness \nwas one, in some courts. But in many others, it was actual knowledge or \nsliding scales.\n  The Seventh Circuit had essentially eliminated aiding-and-abetting \nclaims by requiring proof of all elements of a primary violation of \n10b-5 in order to impose liability.\n  Accordingly, expanding to private suits the provision included in the \ncommittee print would not provide any real protection against abusive \nclaims. And that approach, if we adopted this amendment, would actually \nrepresent, as I said a moment ago, an expansion of liability, not a \nreturn to pre-Central Bank of Denver status quo, because it would \noverrule those decisions that had set the higher standard. That is, \nactual knowledge before you can get a minor player in terms of the \naiding-and-abetting clause.\n  Again, my point is--and again I say this with all due respect to the \nauthor of the amendment--throughout the amendment it is knowing or \nreckless, and on the reckless standard, let me, just for the purpose of \nmy colleagues, point out how difficult that standard is to apply. \nAgain, this is citing some work that has been done on the issue. I will \nfootnote them accordingly.\n  Let me begin with this. The prevailing reckless standard does not \nlimit, as I am sure the case can be made, liability to highly culpable \nwrongdoers, and that is the suggestion here. Again, the highly culpable \nwrongdoers are not covered. We get them under this bill, in fact. And \nthis is where the problem comes with recklessness. The vagueness of the \nrecklessness standard is one of the principal reasons that joint and \nseveral liability should be modified, and that is what we do in this \nbill.\n  In practice, the legal standard does not provide protection against \nunjustified or abusive claims because juries can and do misapply the \nstandard. Juries today have considerable difficulty in distinguishing \ninnocent mistakes, negligence, and even gross negligence--none of \nwhich, by the way, Mr. President, is actionable under rule 10b-5--from \nrecklessness.\n  So, while to the layman recklessness sounds like something else, \nrecklessness can actually be a minor mistake, a mathematical mistake. \nIn effect, you could get netted under the recklessness standard.\n  One commentator observed:\n\n       The courts have been less than precise in defining what \n     exactly constitutes a reckless misrepresentation. This \n     imprecision has resulted in ad hoc, if not arbitrary, \n     recklessness, if I may use the word, determinations. The \n     result is that the actual and potential parties to section \n     10(b) and rule 10b-5 actions cannot predict with any degree \n     of certainty how a trier of fact will characterize alleged \n     conduct and, thus, whether it may serve as the basis of \n     liability.\n\n  I am quoting from Johnson, ``Liability for Recklessness \nRepresentations and Omissions'' under section 10(b) of the Securities \nand Exchange Act of 1934 in the Cincinnati Law Review, 1991.\n  Let me quote further from Commissioners of the SEC. Commissioner \nBeese argues:\n\n       Because the standard of recklessness is a vague one and its \n     interpretation by both the court and the jury is difficult to \n     predict accurately, defendants that may not have acted in a \n     reckless fashion cannot be assured of being vindicated at \n     trial.\n\n  Former SEC Chairman Breeden observed:\n\n       The problem is that almost anything can be said to be \n     reckless.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is all too easy to apply 20/20 hindsight to a complex \n     problem and conclude that someone behaved less than \n     perfectly.\n\n  The standard of reckless behavior has tended to expand in recent \nyears as courts and even at times the SEC tried to reach out to \ncompensate investor losses. Even the SEC, with all its expertise, has \nmisjudged the standard. In a case arising out of a 1982 bankruptcy of \none of an accounting firm's clients, the SEC alleged a violation of \nrule 10b-5 asserting that the firm had acted recklessly in failing to \ncomply with the professional standards in an audit. A Federal court \nrejected every claim, including the claim that the firm had acted \nrecklessly. The court found that the SEC's claim ``involved complex \nissues of accounting as to which reasonable accountants could reach \ndifferent conclusions. It follows that no finding of fraud or \nrecklessness can rationally be made in that case.''\n  That was SEC versus Price Waterhouse, decided in 1992.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does your bill allow for any private right of action \nagainst an aider and abettor?\n  Mr. DODD. No, it does not.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not even knowingly. I have been listening to the \nSenator very carefully, and he is talking about recklessness.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My own view is, if you are reckless, you ought to be \nable to be reached as an aider or abettor. I understand the Senator is \nopposed to that. The Senator's bill, as I understand it, would not \nallow a knowing aider and abettor to be reached by a private securities \nsuit; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague, the problem with just the word \n``knowing'' is that it is far too vague a word. I said at the outset of \nmy remarks that if you could apply where you had actual knowing, \nknowledge of the fraud itself, then you might raise a different \nstandard. I said that at the outset of my remarks.\n  My problem is your amendment says ``knowing or recklessness.'' I \nfocused my remarks on the recklessness side of this because under the \namendment, you could be nabbed under the recklessness standard. Again, \nas I pointed out, with a series of court decisions----\n  Mr. SARBANES. The bill does not have a knowing standard in it; is \nthat correct? The bill leaves out aider and abettor altogether in a \nprivate action.\n  Mr. DODD. No. What we have said here is where you have the knowledge, \nknowing fraud involved here, then obviously the whole question of \njoint-and-several liability applies. In almost every case an aider and \nabettor, where you have that kind of knowledge situation, would be \nsnagged. Yes, we do cover that in that situation.\n  What they are attempting to do with this amendment is to reach a \ndifferent level. So when you have that fact situation, clearly as we \nmade that case all the way through this debate dealing with \nproportionate liability, we do not allow proportionate liability to \napply. Where you meet that standard of the actual knowledge and intent \nto defraud, then you get everybody involved.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The aiding-and-abetting issue is separate from the \njoint-and-several issue, is it not?\n  Mr. DODD. De facto they end up not being separate. If this amendment \nwere adopted, that is not the case, because you have a reckless \nstandard here which is a much, much lower threshold than the other ones \nwe require you to meet.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If one is tangentially involved, let us say an \naccountant, and knowingly and intentionally participates in a fraud, is \nthat person, regardless of their portion of liability, held jointly-\nand-severally liable?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. So that a person, would be considered as a minor \nparticipant, an aider and abettor, as a result of this amendment. We \nhave made very clear, that if they knowingly and intentionally \nparticipate in fraud, that defendant can really be held as a primary \nculprit, so to speak; he or she would be libel for all the damages \nunder the present situation; is that not true?\n  Mr. DODD. My understanding is that is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Of course, as it is clearly stated in the S. 240 the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, still has the ability to go after \nthose for their intentional wrongdoing.\n  Mr. DODD. That is there, also. We include that in the bill \nspecifically. As I pointed out a minute ago, everybody said let us go \nback to Central Bank of Denver. Prior to that case, different standards \nwere being used on the aiding and abetting provisions. Some\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\ncourts did recklessness. Obviously, if you are an attorney for the \nplaintiff in that case, of course you are going to allege that. In \neffect, you have wiped out our efforts in the bill to try and minimize \nthat. So you are back in the negotiation phase again. But up to the 93 \nor 98 percent of these cases people are settling out of court. That is \nwhat every good attorney would advise his clients. They would say, \n``You are exposed to the whole cost on this. With the reckless \nstandards being so low, my advice is you better settle, because if do \nyou not, that is a pretty low standard.'' In a sense, you get snagged \nfor the whole amount. We are trying to avoid that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You let the knowing aider and abettor go free. How can \nyou justify that? I will argue the recklessness with you, and I \nunderstand that is a more complicated issue. But how can you let the \nknowing aider and abettor go free?\n  Mr. DODD. It is not a question of letting him go free. I think in the \nmost recent colloquy the Senator from New York and I had, we made it \nclear that where you have that standard, I think we establish very \nclearly what the intent of the legislation is.\n  I say to my colleague, having to face the law firm of Sarbanes and \nBryan or Bryan and Sarbanes is difficult under any set of \ncircumstances. But the word ``knowing'' alone is a rather loose term in \nterms of what constitutes knowledge. So I say to my colleague from \nMaryland that if, in fact, it is the desire of the Senator from Nevada \nand the Senator from Maryland to offer an amendment that truly raises \nthe level of knowledge to a point where legal definitions would apply, \nI, for one--not speaking for my colleague from New York or others--\nwould entertain such an amendment. That is what you have done. The word \n``knowing''--you have to be much more definitive.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I am trying to point \nout what you have done with the bill. In other words, what you have \ndone with the bill is let a knowing aider and abettor go free. Now, I \ncannot, for the life of me, understand how you can possibly justify \nthat. A knowing aider and abettor cannot be reached and held liable \nwhen a securities fraud is perpetrated. How can you justify that?\n  Mr. DODD. That is not what the case is here. You are applying two \ndifferent standards here. When you have actual knowledge and intent to \ndefraud, again, we do not allow an aider and abettor, in that case, to \nget off the hook at all. It is a different standard you are applying \nhere.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would refer the Senator to pages 131 and 132 of his \nbill, where they define a knowing securities fraud. ``Defendant engages \nin knowing securities fraud if that defendant, (1), makes a material \nmisrepresentation with actual knowledge that the representation is \nfalse * * *. And it also requires other things.\n  The central--\n  Mr. DODD. To reclaim my time, that is under the section dealing with \nproportionate liability. Again, my colleague is fully aware that, \nobviously, it would only apply it to proportionate liability. When you \nhave the knowledge and intent to defraud, then the joint and several \napplies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator repeat that again?\n  Mr. DODD. We do not apply proportionate liability when you have the \nknowledge and intent to defraud. You cannot escape and get \nproportionate liability. Joint and several applies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. By your own admission, under this bill, an aider and \nabettor cannot be reached in a private action suit, is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. An aider and abettor can be reached through Government \naction, but not private action, correct. Under the standards you have \nset here--\n  Mr. SARBANES. How can you justify that?\n  Mr. DODD. To go back to the point I am trying to make to my colleague \nover and over again, under the proportionate liability standard--which \nis the section we are talking about here--recklessness is such a low \nstandard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You are not even reaching the aider and abettor; you \nonly go to recklessness.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Maryland has a fundamental and inherent \nobjection to proportionate liability.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am trying to get over that. I am trying to point out \nthat there are a lot of other problems with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time the Senator has been allocated has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield more time. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 27 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield five more minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What I am trying to point out to my colleague is that \nthere is a joint and several liability problem in this bill. We have \ntried to deal with that--unsuccessfully. There was a statute of \nlimitations problem in this bill. I think these are large problems. \nThese are what the independent objective groups have been writing to us \nabout.\n  Now we are addressing the aider and abettor problem. The way you have \nwritten the bill, aiders and abettors in a private action go scot-\nfree--whatever the test is. They go scot-free on recklessness and on \nknowingly. The way you have written the bill --\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, if he will yield, the way you have \nwritten your amendment, what you are asking us to support is that you \nwould apply that standard of reckless behavior, which is an unfair \nstandard to apply.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do not think it is unfair. But I do want to make this \npoint. The question is, who is going to go scot-free? For years, we \ncaught aiders and abettors on recklessness and knowingly, on both of \nthose standards. That was the law.\n  Mr. DODD. Not in every court, no, no. There were courts that set a \nmuch higher standard in this country than that. Actual knowledge was \nrequired by many courts in the country prior to the decision by Central \nBank of Denver. You are going back and weakening a standard applied in \nmany courts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, the general prevailing \nstandard on reaching aiders and abettors was, in effect, thrown out in \nthe Denver case.\n  Mr. DODD. I point out to my colleague--and you may not have been here \nwhen I pointed out the cases where the SEC used sliding scales in \ncases. Other courts used actual damages.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Fine. I am prepared to concede to the Senator that, in \ncertain jurisdictions, there were sliding scales and all the rest. But \nyou have eliminated all of that.\n  Mr. DODD. I did not, the Supreme Court eliminated that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You do not have a sliding scale encompassing knowing \nstandard. You have knocked it out, and all the aiders and abettors are \ndancing their way down the street.\n  Mr. DODD. I did not do it, the Supreme Court did it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am enjoying this colloquy. If the Senator requires more \ntime, I yield three more minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The final point is that, obviously, tomorrow we are \ngoing to do the so-called safe harbor. I call it pirate's cove because \nit is being carved out here for all the sharks and barracudas to find \nsort of a comfort and solace----\n  Mr. DODD. Including the buccaneer barristers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Nevada and I have conceded that we \nwant to do some things about frivolous suits. We are trying to get at \nthe extraordinary lengths to which you have gone to immunize from \nliability and, therefore, throw the burden upon innocent investors. I \nthink the Senator from Nevada put it very well the other day. He said \nthis is a ``Trojan horse.'' It is waving the pennant of frivolous \nsuits, but hidden within the Trojan horse are lots of other things as \nwell. That is exactly the case. That is what we have been trying to, in \neffect, lay out in the course of this debate.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield on that point, would you not \nadmit that the present situation, in the absence of passing this \nlegislation, is certainly as big a Trojan horse as anything he might \ndescribe with this legislation being adopted?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What I want to do is pass a good piece of legislation. \nI want to avoid the comment that was at the end of the article that I \nput in the Record the other day about the pendulum swing. And that in \nthe course of\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nswinging the pendulum too far, what you are going to require are some \ninvestors to actually be defrauded and not gain any recovery before you \nwill straighten out the law. We ought to straighten it out now and not \nallow that situation to happen. We tried to address the issue of joint \nand several liability versus proportionate liability. We had this \nextension of the statute of limitations, and we are doing aiders an \nabettors today, and tomorrow we are going to do the ``pirate's cove.''\n  The Senator from California has, I think, some very worthwhile \namendments to offer as well. This is not a balanced bill. That point \nneeds to be made and needs to be made very clear. This is not a \nbalanced bill. There are certain problems we want to get at, and we \nought to do that. This bill overreaches. It is unbalanced. I think we \nwill pay a high price for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has used all of his \ntime.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will yield back the remainder of my time. \nI want to thank my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, for making the point \nthat I think needs to be made here, that if the recovery is premised \nand predicated upon aider and abettor recovery; whether the conduct is \nintentional, whether it is knowing, or reckless, no recovery. The only \nway in which you can attach liability is under an aiding and abetting \ntheory. That is the point he has made.\n  The Senator from Connecticut quite correctly points out that with \nrespect to others that are primary, then the level of misconduct, \nwhether intentional or knowing, creates the joint and several liability \nsituation, and the reckless conduct which the Senator from Maryland and \nI agree ought to be included as well.\n  That is when you get the proportionate liability. There is no \nquestion about proportion or joint and several. There is no recovery if \nthe cause of action is based upon aiding and abetting. That is the \npoint he has made so clear.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator put it very clearly. The point we were \ntrying to make, the aiders and abettors walk scot-free as far as \nprivate lawsuits are concerned under this legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. This is my understanding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We try to attach liability that way.\n  Under the different theories of liability, there is an argument over \nrecklessness and knowingly and so forth.\n  The bill never attaches liability to the aider and abettor; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand in many suits that an important part of \nthe recovery, on the part of the innocent investor, is from the aiders \nand the abettors.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is my understanding.\n  Tomorrow, as we complete the debate, I will have additional data to \nshare with my colleagues. I have never been involved in this area as an \nattorney representing a class action or defending this, but the issue \nis quite substantial, and the impact, I think, will astonish some of \nour colleagues. It is not just an academic discussion among Senators in \ngood faith trying to craft a piece of legislation.\n  The impact is profound. There must be reasons, when these actions are \nbrought, they are brought under a theory of aiding and abetting. It \nmust be the only way to get into court against some of this misconduct \nwith lawyers, accountants, bankers, and others. We simply wipe them \nout. ``You folks can do whatever you want. You are home free.'' That is \na public policy that, in my view, is indefensible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield for a second, I would like to \nbring this discussion towards close by saying there is a point where I \nagree very strongly with the Senator from Connecticut.\n  At the outset of his statement he gave praise to the very strong \nstatement which the Senator from Nevada had made on this issue. I want \nto fully associate myself with that judgment. I think he is absolutely \nright. I urge all my colleagues, and their staffs that are following \nthis issue, to go very carefully through the opening statement which \nthe Senator from Nevada made when he presented his amendment. It was a \nvery powerful statement as to why aiders and abettors ought not to be \ncompletely free from liability.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I notice a number of colleagues are about ready to join \nthe floor with other amendments.\n  I will simply share one additional statistic in closing and yielding \nthe remainder of my time. Chairman Levitt has stated, of 400 pending \nSEC cases, 80 to 85 rely on aiding and abetting theories of liability. \nWe are talking about a substantial number.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be allowed to speak for 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9032-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9087-S9088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE SELECT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, because I know a lost cause when I \nsee one, I concede that the majority leader is succeeding in passing \nwhat is known as the Medicare select legislation tonight. The \nconference report will pass tonight. Nobody else will comment on it, \nbut I will. I just hope I will not be tempted into saying, ``I told you \nso'' a year from now if some troubling signs turn out to be an omen of \nserious problems.\n  For some reason, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare adamant about rushing to expand a pilot project limited to 15 \nstates into one for all 50 States. The conference report is an \nagreement to make this extension, but only for 3 years instead of the 5 \nyears that had been passed by the House. I still think 3 years is too \nlong, but I have assurances from the chairman of the Finance Committee \nthat we will have a hearing or hearings, and a good faith process, to \nconsider whether any changes are warranted.\n  What is Medicare select? Medicare select is a managed care insurance \npolicy that is sold to senior citizens to fill in the gaps of Medicare \ncoverage, of which there are many. It differs from other MediGap \npolicies because it only pays Medicare's cost sharing amounts if the \nsenior citizen receives his or her medical care from an insurer's \nselected network of health care providers.\n  What bothers me is the rush to expand this limited program before an \nevaluation of this demonstration project, done at the direction of \nCongress is completed and reviewed in oversight hearings. As the \nproponents of this push to expand the program know, the independent \nresearchers evaluating the pilots will have their analyses completed by \nmid-August and a draft final report submitted by October.\n  Leapfrogging over a careful effort to review a demonstration project, \nin order to decide if and how to expand the approach, is not the way to \ndo business with Medicare and its beneficiaries. I think it is a \nmistake. I think it is bad precedent. I have to wonder whether it has \nto do with special interests eager to see this program quickly \nexpanded. I think it is a mistake to ignore emerging signs that this \napproach to the marketing of medigap policies may be costing Medicare \nrather than achieving savings. When the majority of this body has just \ntold senior citizens of America they want to cut Medicare by $270 \nbillion, where is the sense in also extending a program for 3 years \nthat might drain Medicare even more.\n  Just in recent days, another yellow line started flashing. Based on \nreports routinely submitted to the Government from the top notch \nresearch firms conducting the Medicare select study for HCFA, some \nstartling findings have been reported on how the Medicare select \nprogram is operating. They are finding that Medicare select enrollees \nhad significantly higher Medicare costs in comparison to seniors with \nregular medigap insurance. The Congressional Budget Office agrees that \nthe new study raises serious questions about the operation of the \nMedicare select program.\n  On average, Medicare's costs have increased 17\\1/2\\ percent--higher--\nunder Medicare select, which we are expanding to all 50 States. Only \none State, Missouri, experienced lower Medicare costs for its Medicare \nselect enrollees. Mr. President, 8 States had higher Medicare costs for \nits Medicare select. Alabama, 12 percent higher; Arizona, 23 percent; \nFlorida, 8 percent; Indiana, 57 percent higher; almost 6 percent in\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nKentucky; 7.5 percent in Minnesota; 12 percent higher in Texas; and 14 \npercent higher in Wisconsin. And so it goes. Researchers believe the \nbulk of these cost increases were a result of greater hospital costs.\n  This information was not available to the Congressional Budget Office \nwhen it did its cost estimate of the original Medicare select \nlegislation. At that time, CBO was forced to rely on very preliminary \nresearch that was done by these same researchers. The information then \nwas limited to case-study information and did not include actual \nanalyses or a comparison of utilization data.\n  Mr. President, this is why I remain troubled about this legislation, \nthis conference report, which will be passed tonight and then become \nthe law of the land. Serious questions have been raised about the \noperation of the Medicare select program, yet a conference report is \nabout to be passed that gives the green light to 3 years of taking this \nprogram to every single State.\n  It is maddening that just when there is all the railing about the \nMedicare trust fund and its solvency, some of my colleagues are so \nanxious to expand this program with a disregard for its potential drain \non the part A trust fund.\n  There are all kinds of questions to answer before I would be \ncomfortable expanding or extending this program. That is why Congress \nfor this evaluation. That is why I believe we wait for the final report \nand take 3 hours out of our day in the Finance Committee to hold a \nhearing on what was learned. Instead, we are seeing this rush to pass a \nbill.\n  The independent researchers have a full year of data from 1994 and \nare currently in the process of analyzing this data. It will take them \nabout a month to complete their analysis of this insurance data. The \ndata cited previously mostly reflects Medicare's cost experience in \n1993. While the researchers have already controlled form many \nvariables, they plan to try to better pinpoint the reason for these \nvery significant Medicare cost increases. This additional information--\nwhich will be available in only 1 month--would provide Congress with \nmuch better information and will tell us if the Medicare cost increases \nof Select enrollees are a one-time phenomena or a continuing trend. It \nwould also help us figure out the reasons for the higher Medicare costs \nof beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare select plans. It would provide us \nwith information which would make sure we didn't enact a major new \nexpansion that primarily benefits insurance companies without making \nsure the Part A trust fund was not going to be drained of funds.\n  Are sick seniors merely signing up for Medicare select managed care \nproducts in record numbers? This would be an unexpected finding since \npeople with serious health care problems normally avoid managed care \nplans, if they can. Or, are sick seniors somehow being steered into \nMedicare-select plans by insurance companies and away from risk-based \nHMO's? In addition to analyzing 1994 utilization data, the research \nteam is also completing work on beneficiary survey which will include \nbeneficiaries' own stated reasons for signing up with the Medicare \nselect plan.\n  Mr. President, it is not often that legislators are able to have \nresearch of this caliber available on a Medicare legislative \ninitiative. Yet, we are choosing to ignore the red flag that these \nresearch findings have raised.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicare Program is \ncurrently overpaying HMO's by about 5.7 percent per person because of \nMedicare's payment methodology which does not take into account the \ntendency of healthier seniors to sign up with HMO plans. This \nlegislation before us today could--because of the special advantages \nMedicare select insurers have been granted in obtaining discounts from \nhospitals--have a similar effect. Insurance companies make money while \nthe Medicare Program loses money.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today is preferable to the \nHouse bill that was originally brought to the Senate floor. Instead of \nextending the Medicare select program to 50 States for 5 years, this \nlegislation expands it to 50 States for 3 years. This is still longer \nthan I would have liked. It is longer than the original Senate bill \nwhich was the result of a compromise reached between myself and the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, and Senators Packwood and Chafee. The \nlegislation will also allow the HHS Secretary to discontinue the \nprogram if the Secretary determines that the Medicare select programs \nis resulting in higher premium costs to beneficiaries or in higher \nprogram costs to the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to an oversight hearing in the Finance \nCommittee on the Medicare select program which--under a prior agreement \nwith Senators Dole and Pakcwood--will be held once the final evaluation \nstudy has been completed. And I am committed to working with the \nchairman of the Medicare Subcommittee, Senator Dole, on any legislative \nmodifications that may be necessary based on the committee's oversight \nhearing, the RTI study, or from the results of a GAO study--that was \nadded to the Senate bill and retained in the conference agreement--that \nrequires a study of the medical underwriting practices of Medigap \ninsurance policies. Again, I hope I will never have to say ``I told you \nso'' on behalf of the Medicare Program and the senior citizens who \ncount on us to look before we act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9087-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9088-S9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MEDICARE SELECT POLICIES ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 22, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the conference \nreport be considered and adopted, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and a statement by Senator Packwood be included in the \nRecord at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I am very pleased with the conference \nagreement on Medicare select. The agreement is very close to the bill \npassed by the Senate. The only major change is extending the program 3 \nyears instead of 18 months. This is reasonable extension. It gives \nStates sufficient time to take the necessary legislative or \nadministrative actions to allow Medicare select policies to be sold in \ntheir states. It also allows insurers sufficient time to develop \nproducts, bring them to market, and accumulate enough experience for a \nmeaningful evaluation of Medicare select policies.\n  This legislation will allow people in all the States to have access \nto very popular, lower cost type of Medicare supplemental insurance. \nRemember, Medicare supplemental insurance is private insurance that \npeople buy with their own money to cover medical expenses not paid for \nby Medicare. There is no Federal money involved.\n  Some concerns have been raised about Medicare select. Since Medicare \nselect is a new type of supplemental insurance and the full \nimplications of Medicare select for the Medicare Program are not known, \nthis legislation contains a safety valve. The Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services is to study Medicare select. If the Secretary finds that \nMedicare select is saving seniors money on supplemental insurance, is \nnot adding additional costs to the Medicare Program, and has not \nnegatively affected quality or access to\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nhealth care, Medicare select automatically becomes a permanent option \nafter 3 years. If, on the other hand, the Secretary finds serious \nproblems with Medicare select, the program expires June 30, 1998.\n  This is a very sensible compromise. It protects the Government \nagainst unintended consequences while also allowing the program, if \nsuccessful, to become permanent without having Congress take additional \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9088-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 483\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, let me explain my amendment. My amendment \ndeletes language in the bill which instructs the judge to make the \nlargest investor in a securities class action suit the lead plaintiff \nin that suit. To me, on its face, as a nonlawyer, this is an amazing \nproposition. The richest investor gets to be the lead plaintiff.\n  My amendment is designed to give the little investor, people with \nIRA's, Keoghs, a 401-K plan, the chance to be the lead plaintiff.\n  My amendment is simple, reasonable, fair and, I believe, democratic. \nThis bill assumes the wealthiest investor is somehow better suited to \nrepresent smaller investors in the suit.\n  Mr. President, class action securities lawsuits are supposed to \nprotect the average and the small investor--not only the largest \ninvestor. Of course we want to protect them as well. But clearly we are \nconcerned about the small investor. In fact, class action lawsuits are \nthe only practical chance that the small investor has to recover if he \nor she has been defrauded.\n  Why do I say that? The small investor, let us say, has been defrauded \nout of $500 or $1,000 or $5,000. That small investor simply cannot \nafford to bring an individual action against a fraudulent party. It \nwould cost way more than even the $5,000 to do so, maybe even more than \nthe investor's total net worth, just to recover the small investment.\n  So in practical terms, class actions are the small and average \ninvestor's only chance to recover. This bill, S. 240, without my \namendment, would\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\ndeny them control over their own lawsuits. It would put the largest \ninvestor in control.\n  I said my amendment is democratic. I say that because it allows the \nmembers of the class to decide who will pick their representative \ncalled a ``lead plaintiff.'' The lead plaintiff will then represent the \nclass, control the litigation, and hire lawyers to serve as class legal \ncounsel.\n  The candidates for lead plaintiff are all named plaintiffs who file \nmotions with the judge saying they want to serve as the lead plaintiff.\n  My amendment, and the bill, require that notices be placed in a \nwidely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire \nservice, which then gives notice to all the class members that there is \na class action. That way, every member of the class has an opportunity \nto be named the lead plaintiff.\n  Under my amendment, the court will appoint as lead plaintiff anyone \nunanimously selected by the named plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits. \nAnd that seems to me the way it ought to be. Everybody has an \nopportunity to decide who will be the lead plaintiff. I think it is \nfundamentally undemocratic to do it otherwise--to do what this bill \ndoes, to prevent the members of the class from picking their lead \nplaintiff; to require that the largest investor be appointed.\n  Under my amendment, only if the plaintiffs cannot agree unanimously \namong themselves on the lead plaintiff would the court decide who the \nlead plaintiff should be. So, first we have all the plaintiffs decide \nwho they want. If they reach unanimous agreement, it is so done. If \nthey do not, then the judge or the court would decide who the lead \nplaintiff would be.\n  Again, the bill without the Boxer amendment requires that the judge \nappoint the largest investor. Again, my amendment merely says if the \nplaintiffs at first do not agree, the judge, after considering all \nrelevant factors, shall select the lead plaintiff.\n  The court, under the Boxer amendment, could very well pick the \nlargest investor. But the court does not have to at that point. So, if \neverybody agrees on the lead plaintiff, it is done. If they cannot \nunanimously agree, then the court will select, and they can certainly \nlook at who the largest investor is, but that should not be the only \ncriterion.\n  My bill requires the court to consider all relevant factors in \nselecting a lead plaintiff or plaintiffs. These factors include--and \nthey are in my amendment--but are not limited to the following:\n  First, the financial stake that the lead plaintiff would have in the \nlawsuit. So we agree with the chairman. Let us take a look at that.\n  Second, how much work and money he or she has expended on the suit \nthus far. We think it is important for the judge to see who has made \nthe biggest investment so far.\n  Third, the quality of that work.\n  Fourth, the quality of their individual claim.\n  Fifth, whether they have any potential conflicts.\n  Sixth, whether the defendants would have any unique defenses to this \nlead plaintiff--which I will describe later.\n  So, again I say to my friends, as Senator Bryan has said, this is not \nan exciting issue. No one is glued to their TV sets saying, ``Gee, we \nhave been looking forward to this all day, Senator Boxer.'' But clearly \na lot is at stake. If you are a small investor and automatically the \nlargest investor is picked, even if that large investor has a conflict \nof interest--and I will go into that--you are going to really take it \nin the neck. You are going to be out of luck, and I am going to explain \nthis.\n  It could be that the defendants are accused of having targeted the \nelderly. This is not uncommon. I made that point today. I am glad my \ncolleagues agree that senior citizens are the targets here. Would the \nlargest investor be the best plaintiff in a fraud against targeted \nsenior citizens, small investors? Not necessarily. And this is where \nmaybe some people will wake up and will take notice.\n  Let us look at the Keating case, a case my colleagues on the other \nside of this issue keep telling us not to bring up. I have news for \nthem, we are going to bring it up because it is on point and it is on \ntarget.\n  Listen to this. Keating was sued by small investors who bought his \nsecurities. One of the largest investors eventually became a defendant \nin the small investor lawsuit. If this bill had become law it would \nhave been clear that the judge should appoint that large investor as \nthe lead plaintiff. Talk about foxes in charge of the chicken coop. \nMany of the biggest investors in Keating's junk bonds were friends of \nKeating and associates of Michael Milken, including Executive Life \nInsurance Co. of California, and a Minneapolis brokerage company called \nOfferman & Co. These relationships were not public when the lawsuit was \nfiled. Under this bill Offerman & Co. would have been put in charge of \nthe Keating class action. That would have meant that Keating's friends \nand junk bond cronies would have been in the position to stifle the \nlawsuit.\n  I say thank God this bill was not law and the small investors were in \ncharge. They eventually uncovered the hidden relationship. But they \nnever could have uncovered those relationships at the point at which \nthe judge was deciding who the lead plaintiff should be, and he would \nhave had to pick the largest investor.\n  Here is the thing. The largest investor became a codefendant and \neventually paid $55 million to the small investor. If this bill had \nbeen the law of the land, the largest investors would have been in \ncontrol of the suit. They would have been the lead plaintiff in the \nsuit. And I say the Keating case is just an isolated example.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is an extraordinarily important \npoint which the Senator from California is making. In fact, the SEC in \ncommenting on this provision of the bill that is before us said, and I \nquote them:\n\n       One provision of section 102 requires the court generally \n     to appoint as lead plaintiff the class member that has the \n     largest financial interest in the case.\n\n  Exactly the provision the Senator is addressing.\n  The SEC then says:\n\n       While this approach has merit, it may create additional \n     litigation concerning the qualification of the lead \n     plaintiff, particularly when the class member with the \n     greatest financial interest in the litigation has ties to \n     management, or interest that may be different from other \n     class members.\n\n  As I understand it, you permit having the largest financial interest \nto be a factor to be considered by the judge if all the plaintiffs \ncannot get together on who the lead plaintiff should be. Then the judge \nhas to pick a lead plaintiff, and the Senator concedes the one factor \nto be looked at would be financial interest. But the bill as written \nprovides the presumption to the large financial interest plaintiff \nwhich carries with it the risk, as the SEC points out, where the lead \nplaintiff may have ties to management or interest that may be different \nfrom other class members.\n  As the Senator points out, they later found that out in the Keating \ncase. Well, you say they will find it out in the beginning. They cannot \nfind it out in the beginning. In fact, the bill as written denies the \ndiscovery in the early stages unless you already have a reasonable \nbasis for doubting the lead plaintiff. This whole thing is structured \nin such a way that a lead plaintiff who has ties to the defendant, a \nparty that has ties to the defendant, can end up being the lead \nplaintiff.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right on target, and as usual presents the \npoint magnificently. This is a total outrage. It is a total outrage \nbecause at the time when the judge will decide who the lead plaintiff \ncould be, they say there is a rebuttable presumption, but it is really \nirrebuttable because of the high standard that has to be met. It will \nbe the largest investor. And after I yield to my friend from Nevada, I \nam going to show you another case on point so that we show the Keating \ncase and how it would have worked to have the people who eventually \nwound up paying the small investors under this bill be the lead \nplaintiff. There would not even have been a case, if that had been the \nlaw. I shudder to think about the miscarriage of justice.\n  Here we are today. You know one of the reasons I think so. We are \nmaking our points here. Obviously, we can tell by the votes that so far \nwe were not carrying the day except my one amendment that requires a \nreport. We are not\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\ncarrying the day. But, by God, let us make the record and let us be \nclear on it so that if there is an explosion, and investors get \ndefrauded, and we have another S scandal on our hands, and \npeople are scared to death to invest and all they do is buy Government \nbonds, I think some of us can point to this debate and say we tried; we \nmade the record.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I want to compliment the Senator. We have heard many times \nduring the course of this debate the word ``balance.'' I think what the \nSenator has done in revisiting this particular section of the bill \nrepresents the essence of balance. As the Senator has pointed out, the \nSenator's amendment does not preclude the consideration of wealth, if I \nam reading the Senator's amendment correctly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. But it simply indicates that where there is not a \nunanimous agreement it is simply a factor. Am I correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me say it is my understanding--the Senator can correct \nme if she has a different view--that the very essence of a class action \nis to allow individuals who are very small with relatively modest \ninvestments to band together, that there is a unity of interest, a \ncommonalty of purpose; can band together, and that same commonalty of \ninterest may or may not exist with respect to a large security \nunderwriting house which may have other dealings with the defendants \nwho may indeed have a little self-dealing. ``We will wash your back on \nthis one if you will wash our back on the next one.''\n  Is that the essence of the Senator's concern?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Nevada, the former attorney general of \nthat State, is so right on point here.\n  If a relatively small investor who, let us say, owns a home and a \ncar, and is retired and has a $50,000 investment, I say to my friend \nthat means so much to that individual. The large investor could be a \nbig brokerage house. We have a brokerage house that is worth $50 \nbillion. They may be the largest investor in this particular company. \nThey may have $1 million. That $1 million is a lot more than $50,000, \nbut to that large company it is nothing. Whereas, the $50,000 to a \nsmall investor is virtually everything.\n  Today I put in the Record a story of one of my constituents who was \none of the victims of Keating. She lost $20,000. It was the difference \nbetween her being dependent or independent. She talked about the pain \nof knowing she just waited for that Social Security check because they \nbilked her out of her money; the savings she needed.\n  So the Senator is so right. This bill, I do not know how to put it, \nit is so elitist. I do not like that word, but I cannot think of \nanother word. It is not fair, it is elitist. It is looking at a small \ninvestor as if they were worth nothing.\n  I want to give my friends another example. This is a recent example. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported only last month that a large Wall \nStreet investment bank--and I am going to name the bank because it is \nin the paper; they have a great reputation--Wertheim Schroeder--filed a \nclass action against Avon Products for securities fraud. Wertheim \nSchroeder filed a class action against Avon for securities fraud. \nWertheim was supposed to represent the interests of the small investor. \nBut the Journal reported that Wertheim tried to get Avon to settle the \ncase by giving Wertheim $50 million to invest. That is no way to \nbenefit the small investor, to settle a lawsuit.\n  It does not even think about the small investors. This bill would \nprevent those small investors from discovering the secret deal, because \nthey would have to know about it before they could use subpoenas to \nfind out about it.\n  So here is the largest investor who has its own agenda, clearly, and \nthat agenda did not benefit the small investors. But under this bill, \nthe small investors could not have found that out and automatically, \ntherefore, the largest investor would have been the lead plaintiff.\n  We talked about the rebuttable presumption so I will not go into \nthat. It really is simply not there, because my friend, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, explained the bill precludes the small investor from \nbeing able to subpoena or discover a large investor's hidden conflict.\n  In other words, if you cannot read about it in the newspapers, forget \nit. Only if the conflict is obvious would the small investor be able to \nprove it, and it is just very unfair. In other words, the rules are \nstacked against the small guy and the rules are in favor of the large \nguy. Now I have shown you two examples, the Keating case and this other \nAvon case, and I am sure there are many more.\n  In other words, if the large investor can hide its conflict of \ninterest, it is home free, it is going to be the lead plaintiff. Small \ninvestors will not be able to uncover the conflict. My God, I know we \nwant to stop frivolous lawsuits, we all do, but I do not know anyone \nwho would say that the suit against Charles Keating was frivolous, but \nwe are standing on the floor of the Senate, a few of us, trying to show \nyou that it would have totally changed the outcome of that case, and we \nhave to be very, very careful.\n  Mr. President, I see nothing in the record which supports the thesis \nthat the largest investor is more honest or more trustworthy. In fact, \nhistory suggests there are reasons to believe that the opposite is \ntrue, and I showed you a few of those.\n  In response to my friend from Nevada, I pointed out that a $50,000 \ninvestment from an individual's IRA sometimes is worth much more than a \nhuge investment by a huge company.\n  I want to make another point----\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for one more question? I know the \nhour is late.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I compliment the Senator for her fine work. As I am \nreading the print before us, I am almost offended with the language \n``the most adequate plaintiff.'' Somehow if you have $10,000 in this \ninvestment and that is all you have, somehow you are less adequate to \nbe the lead plaintiff in the action.\n  My question really deals with the origin of this. I sat in on as many \nof the hearings as I could. The chairman was extremely fair in posting \nnotice and giving us opportunity to present our arguments and to make \nthe point, but I do not recall this being in the original bill. I do \nnot recall any testimony offered in behalf of this measure. I do not \nrecall any discussion or debate about this at all. Perhaps the \ndistinguished Senator from California can enlighten me further on that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right on target again. The language about \nlead plaintiff was added only 4 days before the committee markup, weeks \nafter the last hearing. I see nothing in the committee records that \nsupports giving the large investor virtual control over class actions. \nThis was added 4 days before markup, and it is very meaningful. I have \none more point and then I am going to yield to my friend from Maryland, \nbut I want him to listen carefully to this as well. We believe on our \nreading, and we have put a lot of legal minds to work on this, that the \nbill makes it possible for the largest plaintiff to sneak into a class \naction and become the lead plaintiff without going through any of the \nrequirements that all the other investors have to go through.\n  A large investor can hijack a small investor's case. Listen to this. \nIt is our understanding that large investors do not even have to file a \nlawsuit in order to take control of the suit. A large investor only has \nto sit back and wait to see if a small investor files a suit, see if \nthe suit has merit and then pounce on it. The small investor will have \ninvested his or her scarce time and money investigating the case and \nfiling it.\n  At that point, this bill permits the largest investor to take over \nwithout even having to file the lawsuit. He does not even have to be a \nparty to the lawsuit. It means the largest investor does not have to \nrun the risk of rule 11 sanctions of filing a frivolous complaint, \nsanctions that small investors who bring the original complaint are \nsubject to by this bill, which a lot of us support.\n  But the largest investor is scot-free. This forces the small investor \nto take the risk but rewards the big investor.\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\nIt is to me extraordinary. The bill permits a large investor to control \nthe class action and the rights of small investors without having to \ndescribe in a sworn certification filed with the court how the largest \ninvestor came to buy the securities that made it the largest investor. \nSmall investors who file a lawsuit have to include a sworn \ncertification describing how they purchased the security. That is good. \nBut why should the largest investor not have to do that?\n  Let me bring that home. This means that the largest investor would \nnot have to disclose even a sweetheart deal with the defendant that \nmight have resulted in his buying the securities, a sweetheart deal \nthat should disqualify the largest investor from being the lead \nplaintiff.\n  This type of sweetheart deal was very common in the eighties when \nMichael Milken gave preferential shares of junk bonds to his insider \nfriends. Like Ivan Boesky--I am bringing up names from the past, not \nbecause I want to try people again. They went through a lot of pain. I \nam trying to make a point, if we do not learn from the eighties, what \nare we doing here? So this bill would put Ivan Boesky in charge of a \nclass-action lawsuit. How well do you think Ivan Boesky would have \nrepresented small investors? It would have put Boesky in a position to \ntake over lawsuits against Michael Milken.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do not think the Senator from California ought to \nexpress reluctance or apologize for bringing these names out of the \npast in order to remind people what has occurred in this area and the \ntremendous damage and harm that was done to thousands of innocent \ninvestors. And we are running the risk here--I thought the Senator was \nabsolutely right earlier when she said, we are, in effect, writing some \nhistory here, making a record so that down the road we can look back \nand say, it was at that point that a decision was made that led to \nthese terrible consequences.\n  One of the articles in U.S. News & World Report was headed ``Will \nCongress Condone Fraud?'' and then the article ends by saying:\n\n       The pendulum had swung too far toward the lawyers, and now \n     it is swinging too far the other way. Unfortunately, some \n     major investor frauds may have to take place before it again \n     moves back toward the center.\n\n  And we are trying to prevent that here and now. We do not want those \nmajor investor frauds to take place, and it is our contention that many \nof the provisions that we are trying to change will make it possible \nfor that to happen. That is why I think that the points the Senator \nfrom California is making are so extremely important. Things of these \nmeasures have consequences, and the consequences may be very harmful \nand detrimental. Her reference back to earlier abusers is very much on \npoint in underscoring that fact.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank my friend, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, and my friend from Nevada. But it is painful to bring back \nthese issues. To me, it is extraordinary that we are giving insiders, \nreal insiders who may have had a sweetheart deal with a company, the \nchance to be the lead plaintiff.\n  That is really hard to swallow. And I think the Boxer amendment is \nvery fair. It basically says let us have fairness and justice to this \nsection of the bill. We do not discriminate against the largest \ninvestor or the smallest investor. We say let all the plaintiffs get \ntogether and unanimously pick their lead plaintiff. If they cannot \nagree, let us have the judge take a look at it. Let us have him or her \ntake into account who the largest investor is. Let us have him or her \ntake into account the legal work that has been done and then we will \nhave him or her choose who the lead plaintiff will be.\n  So, Mr. President, I truly hope that this debate has been \nenlightening to any of those who have listened to it. Let us not turn \nthe clock back to the 1980's. Let us not get into a situation where \nsmall investors are so scared that they start putting their dollar \nbills under the mattress. We want the moneys out there. We want them to \ninvest their moneys for economic growth. But let us not skew the system \nso much against them they feel they do not have enough protection.\n  I reserve whatever time I have remaining. I will yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of her \ntime. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I find it interesting that we talk about \npreserving the system to help the little people. Let me tell you \nsomething. What is actually taking place is the small investors are \nbeing used, and they are not representatives of any class. The only \nclass they are representatives of is the greed and avarice of the \nattorneys who are milking the system and are spending the millions of \ndollars they make from the settlements right now. The lawyers are \nfinancing the public interest groups, which are lobbying to keep this \nsystem. It is the lawyers protection act to enrich themselves. That is \nwhat this amendment is.\n  Let us look at the lead plaintiffs, the big law firms in New York and \nCalifornia that are manufacturing most of these cases. Who do they \nhave? Steven Cooperman was named in 14 cases between 1990 and 1993. Is \nhe the little guy who got bilked out of $10,000? How many shares does \nhe own in how many companies? He is a hired gun. And who is he going to \nselect to be his lawyer? I will tell you what he has done 14 times; 14 \ntimes he has decided between 1990 and 1993 to take the same firm. \nSheldon Shore, 10 times, same firm. Mr. Shore, do you think he really \nrepresents the working people? I bet he did not even know there was a \nsuit until he got a call because his name is in a computer and that \nstock dropped 6 points, and then he gets right on in there and he \nbrings a suit.\n  Now, that is not what the legal system is supposed to be about. Do \nyou want to go through them again? Rodney Shields, seven; David \nSteinberg, seven; William Steiner, six; Ronald Kassover, five. We are \ntalking about just a small handful of people who have been involved in \nsuits multiple times in 3 years. It is a racket. It is not the little \nhomeowner. It is not the pensioner investing for his retirement.\n  So what do we try to do? We try to say let us stop the race to the \ncourthouse by a bunch of quick scam artists. Let us see to it that the \npeople who have a real stake, if there are some shenanigans going on, \nlet us see to it that the small investor with a real stake is given \ncontrol over the suit. This legislation protects the small investor by \ncreating a rebuttable presumption that the person who has the largest \nfinancial stake should lead the case.\n  And who do you think we are talking about? You think we are talking \nabout an investment banking firm? A securities firm? No.\n  My colleagues say they have knowledge of securities areas, in fact \nsome of them have worked in securities. If you worked in the securities \narea, do you know that 51 percent of all of the funds that are invested \nare by institutional investors? And guess what? Half of that, $5.5 \nbillion is in pension funds--pension funds. Those are the little guys. \nThey have every nickel and dime they have earned for their retirement \nin there, and I think those pension fund managers, the institutional \ninvestors should be consulted when lawsuits are brought. And if they \nhave a position in a company and they have invested hundreds of \nmillions and they represent tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of \nsmall investors, I want them to lead the case and I do not want Mr. \nCooperman and the other guys over there picking the class.\n  You better believe I wish to change it. I am sick and tired of having \na system that rips off the American people so a handful of lawyers can \nget rich. They do not give two hoots and a holler about the small \ninvestor. Let us stop them from taking over the lawsuits. Do not come \nin here telling us that with this legislation we are trying to protect \nthe fat cats. I want a system where if there is an institutional \ninvestor, and they have got some losses, that they have an opportunity \nto come to the Court, and by a rebuttable presumption they have an \nopportunity to be picked as lead counsel.\n  Now, let me ask you, the only time that you have all the plaintiffs \nline up and agree on the lawyer is when these seven or eight plaintiffs \nrace in to the\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\ncourtroom at the same time--and they all say to the judge: Guess what, \nwe all want the same law firm. Is that fairness? S. 240 creates a \nrebuttable presumption that the Court should look at the size of the \nfinancial interest, by the way, all the other standards under the \nFederal code of procedures. They still have to meet any challenges, but \nthe lawyer who represents the pension fund should at least be given \nthat presumption that they are the best counsel to keep the interests \nof the small investor.\n  And by the way, if everyone agrees--and it would seem to me that all \nthe small investors would want to be represented by somebody who would \nhave a stake in the case. I want true plaintiffs, and if it is that \nperson who has lost their life savings of $25,000, they are certainly \ngoing to want that pension manager who has a real stake on behalf of \ntens of thousands of similar people to be there to be supervising, to \nbe watching.\n  I look at this legislation, and I see that the amendment that is \ncrafted talks more about the lawyers--the plaintiffs counsel. It says \nthe judge should consider the work done to develop and prosecute the \ncase. We are talking about 90 days in which this has been filed when \nthe judge is going to have to make a decision. I would like to know \nwhat work is done by a plaintiff within 90 days.\n  The judge should also consider the quality of the claim, prior \nexperience representing the classes and possible conflicting interest. \nThis is the lawyers protection amendment. This is not a class action \namendment. This is not an amendment designed to see to it that the \nlittle guy is really represented. This is to continue the same kind of \ncharade as exists now. And as well-intentioned as my colleague might \nbe--and I believe she is very well intentioned--I believe that what \nthis amendment will do is just allow another way for the entrepenurial \nlawyer to get around the door and race to the courthouse to stake his \nclaim and keep control of the case--not on behalf of the truly \naggrieved but on behalf of the fat law firms who want to get fatter. \nThere are only a handful of these firms, but that handful has been a \nplague, that handful has kept the securities industry from doing what \nit does best, which is to provide capital for jobs, provide creativity, \nlet firms experiment, let them go forward, let them do what they can do \nbest without being unduly harassed.\n  For those who break the law, for those who commit fraud, we have kept \na strong SEC presence at every turn. We have provided that those who \ntruly commit fraud will have no way out, whether it be through the so-\ncalled aiding and abetting, although, if you knowingly commit, you are \nnot an aider and abettor, you are a perpetrator under this act and will \nbe held liable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to my chairman, \nand I have to tell you I did not hear him give me any reasons to be \nagainst this amendment. He said this amendment protects lawyers. Well, \nI have news. If I wanted to do that, I would have just struck this \nwhole section which other colleagues had wanted to do, but I did not do \nthat. I said yes, I think my chairman has a point. We ought to look at \nthe largest investor, and we have put it in here very clearly so the \njudge can consider the larger investor.\n  So I really take exception to the fact that this is keeping business \nas usual. We are not keeping business as usual. And my friend does not \naddress the point of the examples that we gave on the Keating case, the \nexamples we gave on the Avon case, where the largest investor happens \nto be involved in a sweetheart deal which never could have been \ndiscovered by the time the attorney was appointed.\n  Now, I agree with my friend, if you are talking about a pension plan, \nthat is fine; that pension plan would probably be appointed under the \nBoxer amendment, because if the pension plan comes on board and is one \nof the plaintiffs and files a suit and holds out and does not agree \nwith the appointment of the lead plaintiff, then the pension plan would \ngo before the judge and, under the Boxer language, no doubt would be \nselected.\n  So I have not heard my friend argue against the basic premise of the \nBoxer amendment, which is this: Just because you are the richest does \nnot make you the best. Just because you are the richest does not mean \nthat it is fair to appoint you as the lead plaintiff. I do not think \nanything my friend said really attacks the basic premise of the Boxer \nlegislation.\n  Now, I have to say that my friend talks about this bill as if it is \nsupported by the SEC. I have the latest comments of the SEC. Yes, they \nsupport certain parts of the bill, as do I, and as does my ranking \nmember and the Senator from Nevada. But it has a number of problems. \nAnd they raise the issue of lead plaintiff, and they say this could \nhave merit but there are some unintended consequences here. And I would \nsay that the Senator from California, the Senator from Maryland, and \nthe Senator from Nevada are raising these unintended consequences. We \nwill continue to do that tomorrow when we have our time, when Senator \nBingaman has asked me for some time.\n  Mr. President, again, there are lawyers on both sides of all of these \nissues. There are lawyers on both sides. So to me, what is important \nis, who is against this bill? Virtually every consumer organization in \nAmerica: community colleges, the Association of Retired Persons, the \nAmerican Bar Association, the American Council on Education, the \nAssociation of the Bar of the City of New York, the Association of \nJesuit Colleges and Universities, Citizen Action. And I mentioned the \nconsumer's groups: the Consumer Union, Consumers for Civil Justice, \nConsumer Federation of America, Council of Independent Colleges, the \nFraternal Order of Police, International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers, Investor's Rights Association of America, Municipal \nTreasurer's Association of the United States--and Canada, I might add--\nthe National Association of County Treasurers and Officers, the \nNational Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and \nNational Council of Senior Citizens. I read the letter from the \nCalifornia branch of that group today. They said it is the most \nantisenior citizen piece of legislation to come before the Congress in \nyears. There is the North American Securities Administrators. And it \ngoes on and on.\n  So I hope that some of these amendments will be voted up.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to agree with the Senator from California when \nshe said that nothing the Senator from New York said really negates her \namendment. I think she is absolutely right. What we just saw was \nanother example of what is taking place in the course of considering \nthis legislation. An amendment was offered, which is focused fairly \nnarrowly in its scope, directed at correcting a flaw in the legislation \nthat is before us. The counter argument that then is made to the \namendment is the whole universe. We go right back to the basic argument \nthat, well, something is amiss here and we need to correct it. We have \nconceded we want to correct some things. But how far should the \ncorrection go? If you overcorrect, you are creating another problem.\n  Now, the problems the Senator from New York referred to when he cited \nthe so-called professional plaintiffs--there are provisions in the bill \nto get at those. This amendment does not touch those provisions. There \nis a provision called no bonus to the named plaintiff, which has been \ngoing on, which we do not think ought to be happening. The lawyer \ncannot pay brokers for referring clients. That is in this bill. That is \ngoing to be prohibited. No one is seeking to take that provision out. \nRequiring the plaintiff to file a sworn certificate that he did not buy \nthe stock in order to file the lawsuit, and requiring notice to class \nmembers that the lawsuit has been filed, they can ask the judge to take \nover the suit.\n  Those are all provisions designed to get at the kind of problem which \nthe Senator from New York cited.\n  Now, the amendment of the Senator from California addresses a \ndifferent issue. Those professional plaintiffs can be knocked out by \nall of those provisions that I am talking about. The\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nquestion now comes down to whether, when you pick the lead plaintiff, \nyou ought to establish this presumption. And as the Senator says, it is \nsupposedly a rebuttable presumption; but if you read carefully, it \namounts to an irrebuttable presumption that it ought to be the \nwealthiest plaintiff.\n  I want to commend the Senator for offering this amendment. She does \nnot preclude giving it to the party with the largest financial \ninterest. In fact, it is permitted for the judge to consider that as \none of the factors to be weighed. But it is not made the sort of \ndominant factor. I think it would bring a much greater balance and \nequity to the problem of selecting the lead plaintiff.\n  All of the horror stories that were outlined by the Senator from New \nYork are addressed by other provisions that are in the legislation. \nThose are provisions that we are not seeking to amend in the \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the ranking member again for his support on this. \nAs a matter of fact, I say to my friend and my chairman that we say, \nfirst and foremost, the judge should look at the financial interests of \nthe parties. So we, by virtue of listening, at first say absolutely it \nought to be looked at. I agree, if it is a pension plan and there are \nno conflicts and all the rest, that would be fine. We are trying to \nprotect small investors from a situation that actually would have \ndeveloped in the Keating case and developed in the Avon case, where the \nlargest investor had a clear conflict of interest, and you know that \ncan only lead to injustice. I am putting it mildly.\n  Again, I make a plea to my colleagues to look at these amendments as \nthey come before us, because I am just concerned that if this moves \nforward in the condition it is in, we are going to be revisiting it.\n  I urge my colleagues to be on the side that I think is the \nappropriate side, which is fairness, justice for individual investors, \nwho may have their whole life, in a way, tied up in these investments.\n  My friend from New York, in his way--and he is very strong in his \nbeliefs, and I respect that--said it is the fat cats that are being \nprotected in the Boxer amendment. Well, that is laughable. The bill \nsays the richest investor shall be the lead plaintiff. What the Boxer \namendment says is, well, maybe sometimes. But there is nothing \ninherently god-like about the richest person. I think we should respect \nthose who may not be rich but who are hanging on everything we do--\nmaybe not tonight because maybe they cannot follow the argument--but \nbelieve me, if they are unfortunate and they have an experience like \nthe Keating people did, they will be hanging on everything we did.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to say to the Senator that the assertion of \nmaking the argument is that the pension funds are going to come forward \nin order to be the lead plaintiff. The fact of it is that, as the bill \nis written, there is nothing that assures that the pension funds will \ncome forward. In fact, pension funds have been notorious for hanging \nback in terms of being the lead plaintiff.\n  So when this proposition is put forward in the legislation and it is \nthen asserted or interpreted that this means the pension funds will \ncome forward to be the lead plaintiff, there is no reason to suppose \nthat will be the case. In fact, the lead plaintiff may well be an \ninvestor with a great financial interest in the litigation who has ties \nto management.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As exactly happened in the Keating case, as I \nunderstand the Senator from New York, or as other interests that may be \ndifferent from the broad range of the class members.\n  So it is very important to understand that. I think the Senator from \nCalifornia, as I understand it, in effect, has said, let all the \nplaintiffs decide amongst themselves, or, alternatively, let the judge \ndecide; and the judge, in deciding, should consider this list of \nfactors. But it is up to the judge to make the decision. So you do not \ntry to predetermine the outcome, as I think has been done in the \nlegislation before us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 5 minutes 46 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I retain that time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the hour is growing late and I do not \nintend to use all of my time.\n  Let me first make an observation that the person or entity who has \nthe greatest financial interest, does not necessarily mean rich people. \nIt does not mean that we want a fat cat.\n  Indeed, if we are talking about someone who is acting as a manager, \nwe are talking about a class of people who, for the most part, are \nexactly the people who I would presume my colleague from California is \ninterested in protecting, those people who have lost their entire \ninvestment portfolio, their 401 K., or their IRA. They are the people \nwho I am concerned about.\n  Now, this amendment, if passed would knock out one of the most \ncritical provisions of S. 240. We call it the most adequate plaintiff. \nWho is the most adequate plaintiff for the class? One of the areas of \nabuse which was pointed out time and time again was the strike suit \nlawyers who file these class actions by racing to the courthouse to \nfile a complaint and using a whole host of professional plaintiffs to \nfile the lawsuit.\n  I have to believe that the lawyer will continue to encourage that. \nRight now, an entrepreneur lawyer can draft a complaint, select one of \nhis many ready prepared plaintiffs, and I have read the list, and race \noff to the courthouse to file the complaint. Nine out of ten times the \nfirst lawyer who arrives at the courthouse with the complaints in hand \nwill be chosen to represent the rest of the class. This is the \nlucrative race that lawyers stand to make between 30 to 35 percent of \nmultimillion dollar coerced settlements. Do we want to continue that or \ndo we want to stop that practice? Nine out of ten times the so-called \nnamed plaintiff has no idea that the suit has been filed. My colleague \nhas not put any provisions in her amendment that will stop that race. \nWe have. We have.\n  The professional plaintiff has no idea what is in that complaint, \nnever mind pretending that this is the type of lead plaintiff who \nactually is aggrieved. They are not aggrieved. They have been working \nin cahoots with a cast of characters who are defrauding the public.\n  This is not the way our legal system should work. Plaintiffs who have \nbeen harmed, or have been defrauded should be able to file lawsuits to \nrecover damages. Professional plaintiffs should not be allowed to clog \nup this system. S. 240 contains a provision to take care of these \npernicious problems. It attempts to allow institutional investors who \naccount for 51 percent of the market and who manage $4.5 trillion of \npension funds to serve as lead plaintiffs. Maybe they have not served \nin this capacity before because they have not had a chance, because \nthey have not been fast enough to race into the courthouse and they \nonly read about the lawsuits after they are filed and lead counsel has \nbeen appointed. Make no mistake about it, and it is not the intention \nof my colleague to bring this about, but this amendment will help \nperpetuate this system--the race to the courthouse.\n  By giving institutional investors an opportunity to more fully \ncontrol and be involved in litigation, the class will have meaningful \nrepresentation. We will have an institutional representative who \nrepresents hundreds of thousands of aggrieved parties control the case \ninstead of someone who is looking for a quick buck and who is not \nhelping the class but is helping himself. The members of the class can \nonly wonder what happened when they get a check for 22 cents in the \nmail. I will tell you what happened, the lawyer made $8 million and the \nclass got 22 cents. Now, that is not right, but that is what is going \non.\n  Now, what about the selection of a person who has a great financial \ninterest or who represents the class that has the largest financial \ninterest through a pension fund, an institutional investor.\n  We say there will be a presumption, a rebuttable resumption, and if \nthere is no deficiency, the court will choose the counsel who \nrepresents the largest financial interest to lead the class. If\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nthey do not meet the standards pursuant to the Federal rules of civil \nprocedure, they will not be able to serve as lead plaintiffs.\n  There are a number of those provisions. Although the hour is late I \nwill read a few of those Federal procedures.\n\n       Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a \n     class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf \n     of all only if, first, the class is so numerous that joinder \n     of all members is impractical; second, there are questions of \n     law or fact common to the class; third, the claims of \n     defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \n     claims of defense of the class, and fourth, the \n     representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \n     interest of the class.\n\n  That is called for in law.\n  The amendment offered today seeks to change the standard for \nselecting lead plaintiff. This amendment provides for those seeking to \nserve as lead plaintiff to decide unanimously who should serve as lead \nplaintiff. If there is no unanimous agreement, the court will pick the \nlead plaintiff based on certain factors. Those factors have nothing to \ndo with the class. They are incredible.\n  They talk about how many times you brought class action suits, what \nthe legal work to date has been. It says ``financial interest in the \nrelief sought,'' and after that, it is just a critique of lawyers who \nhave brought these actions.\n  I cannot understand why we would put these considerations in--for the \npeople to be chosen as the plaintiffs. I say this, because this was \nprobably drafted by LeFrac and Company.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No, I will not. I have listened patiently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator ought to yield to the author of the \namendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Section (B) is more interested in developing the \nqualities that one would look for as a lawyer, than the qualities of a \ngood lead plaintiff.\n  Now, let me say why I say that, and I mentioned it before: (B) after \nconsidering all relevant factors including but not limited to financial \ninterest in the relief sought, the section I am concerned with starts \nwith work done to develop and prosecute the case.\n  Well, that the plaintiff is not doing. That plaintiff is not \ndeveloping and prosecuting the case. ``The quality of the claim.'' The \nplaintiff has not brought this claim; a lawyer brings the claim on \nbehalf of these plaintiffs, it is up to the lawyer to assess the \nquality of the claim.\n  ``Prior experience''--listen to this--that is why I say I believe \nthis is the lawyer's protection amendment. ``Prior experience \nrepresenting classes.'' That does not seem to me to be looking out for \nthe small investor. That seems to me to be selecting a lawyer. Why \nshould a small investor interested in representing the defrauded class \nhave prior experience representing classes, unless he is a professional \nplaintiff. That is why I ask, how did this amendment come about?\n  I do see some good criteria in this amendment, possible conflicting \ninterest. That is excellent. And, exposure to unique defenses. That is \nin the legislation. The same thing we have. Also for lead plaintiffs to \nserve as lead plaintiff of the appointed plaintiff class. I might more \nadequately suggest it should say pick the lawyer, because in the final \nanalysis, it is the lead plaintiff, it is the plaintiff who is \nassigned, who picks the lawyer.\n  That is what I am concerned about. I am concerned about this \namendment perpetuating the same scheme. Do I want to protect the little \nguy? Absolutely. I have told my colleague that if there are ways--and \nwe have cooperated in the past to do this--to give greater protection \nto those who are aggrieved, I want to do it.\n  That is one of the reasons we have entered, at my colleagues' behest, \nthe provisions giving the ability to those people who have $200,000 or \nless and who sustain up to 10 percent, the ability to recover their \nlosses. We do not just shut the door on the little guy.\n  My colleague mentioned a woman who lost $25,000 and had no recourse, \nthis bill would provide to that person an opportunity to recover those \nfunds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I find it really incredible that my friend \nwould say that this language is the lawyer protection act when, in \nfact, three of the six requirements that the judge has to look at are \nrequirements that came from your side of the argument; namely they \nshould look at the financial interests. In other words, whom is the \nbiggest investor? That is my friend's point. We put it in here first. \nHe is telling me that the lawyers whom he names want that in this bill? \nI tell you ``no.''\n  So I cannot understand how my friend could tell me that this section \nis the lawyers protection act when I put in as the first requirement a \nvery important concept that comes from the opposing side. Maybe my \nfriend wants to sit and talk to me about what he would accept that the \njudge could look at. If my friend from New York is willing, I would \ntake out some of these, if he finds them objectionable, if he will \nsupport me on this. No one wrote this but me. Did I ask for help from \nmy staff? You bet. I am not a lawyer. I have to make sure.\n  To me it sounds reasonable to think that the quality of the claim is \nimportant; that the arguments are laid out well. But if my friend \nthinks that is not a good thing and he will support me, I will take out \nthose things he finds objectionable in a New York minute. I would do \nit.\n  So, tomorrow we finish this argument up. It is getting awfully late. \nEven I am losing my will to argue at 9 at night. So I would, at this \ntime, be very happy to yield back my time, except if my ranking member \nwanted to make a few closing remarks, and I look forward to picking \nthis debate up in the morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, might I inquire of time remaining to both \nparties?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York retains 27 minutes \nand 45 seconds. The Senator from California has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining of her time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not intend to use much of my time. I \nthink I have made my point. I think we both made our points.\n  I believe as an unintended consequence--because I do believe my \nfriend, the Senator from California, is interested in trying to protect \nsmall investors, particularly senior citizens --this amendment would \nnot be a service to them. It would continue the race to the courthouse.\n  I find particularly difficult to accept that part of the amendment on \npage 3 starting at line 13, ``work done to develop and prosecute the \ncase, the quality of the claim, prior experience representing \nclasses.'' That is absolutely the kind of language that suggests to me \nthis amendment will continue the race to the courthouse.\n  If my friends and colleagues find ways to deal with an admitted \nconcern of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who, for the most \npart is strongly supportive of what we are attempting to do in this \nbill, but recognizes that there are problems in the system, I will be \nhappy to work with them. I might call to the attention of my colleagues \na letter from the SEC, and I believe my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, has already called this letter to our attention:\n\n       One provision of Section 102 requires the court generally \n     to appoint as lead plaintiff the class member that has the \n     largest financial interest in the case. While this approach \n     has merit, it may create additional litigation concerning the \n     qualifications of the lead plaintiff, particularly when the \n     class member with the greatest financial interest in the \n     litigation has ties to management or interests that may be \n     different from other class members.\n\n  I hope in the managers' amendment we might be able to address that \nconcern with some language. That is a concern I think many of us have. \nIt would be good to clarify that all possible conflicts under all cases \nmust be avoided.\n  We have to be careful because you do not want to unintentionally open \nthe door to a different unintended consequence. Certainly I would have \nto strongly oppose my friend's legislation as it presently stands, \nbecause it would\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\ncontinue, as I see it, the race to the courthouse.\n  Let me say this, if my colleague from California is prepared to yield \nher time, I will yield all of my time.\n  I yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I only have 3 minutes left. I want to make \na point. This section deals with the plaintiffs. It does not deal with \nthe lawyers. And the way I read it, if there has been a repeat of a \nplaintiff, the judge can throw out that plaintiff. So, my friend cites \na section that deals with plaintiffs, not with lawyers.\n  His other point about a rush to the courthouse. If he thinks this \nSenator has a bill that is a rush to the courthouse, we took the \nlanguage out of his bill. Mr. President, 90 days they have to file in a \nnewspaper of general circulation. It is boilerplate language. It is the \nsame exact timeframe as my friend from New York has. He says I am \nrushing to the courthouse, then he is rushing to the courthouse.\n  Again I have to say I know my friend vociferously opposes this. But I \nhave not heard anything that makes me feel he has undermined my basic \nargument. If he wants to work on language I am happy to work on \nlanguage.\n  I yield to my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, one of the provisions that \nthe Senator from New York pointed to, that the Senator has listed, \nprior experience representing classes, could be used by the judge to \ndisqualify plaintiff, not to qualify the plaintiff. The very plaintiffs \nyou have cited who you said have represented--I do not know, seven \ntimes or whatever the number was--who were just buying professional \nplaintiffs.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Fourteen.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All right, fourteen. He could be ruled out by the judge \nby considering that factor. It says, ``after considering all relevant \nfactors including prior experience representing classes.'' That could \nbe a negative factor as well as a positive factor. It is up to the \njudge. That is the very thing you would argue to the judge.\n  You would say to the judge, ``This person should not be the lead \nplaintiff. He has fourteen instances of doing this. He is just playing \na game with you.''\n  And the judge would say, ``Oh, yes, you are right. And under the \nBoxer amendment I am entitled to consider that factor, prior experience \nrepresenting classes, and considering that factor I am not going to \nmake this person the lead plaintiff.''\n  The Senator from California has in effect taken one of your \ncontentions and put it in her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Yes. The Senator from Maryland is correct. Because \nthis section does not talk about lawyers, it talks about the \nplaintiffs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It does not say positively or negatively. That is for \nthe judge to weigh.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if I might?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  The Senator from California retains 38 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I have to tell you that is one of the most novel, \ninteresting, intriguing arguments I have ever heard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is right there in black and white.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I want to salute and take my hat off to my friend from \nMaryland for putting that twist on. Certainly, it is a stretch to read \nthis as a disqualification. All relevant factors including but not \nlimited to financial interest, work done, prosecution of case, quality \nof the case, prior experience. I suggest no one could really interpret \nthis literally and say to the judge, ``You should disqualify someone, \nif they have been in on two or three or four of these cases, from being \nconsidered as lead plaintiffs, or taking their vote or their \ndetermination, because they are professionals and have been doing it \nfor years.''\n  I have to agree with my colleague, could the judge do it? Sure. But I \nhave not seen a judge exercise that kind of right to interpretation. Of \ncourse we have not passed this bill. But that certainly is unique and \nnovel as an interpretation. I have to tell my colleague, ``I could have \nsome support for this amendment--and maybe we should put this provision \nin a managers' amendment--if it said we are going to look expressly at \nthe qualifications to see that there are not professionals leading the \nclass.''\n  Of course, how do you really tell? You get into how do you define who \n``professional plaintiffs'' are? There may be some people we classify \nas gadflies who bring these suits, not because they have been prompted \nby somebody but because they want to do what is right, to bring the \ncase, maybe they have been aggrieved, maybe they do not have a great \nfinancial stake, but they think others have been aggrieved.\n  It is, I think, stretching--even beyond that limit to which most of \nus stretch, including this Senator at times--the credibility of this \nargument, to suggest you are really telling the court to look and see \nwhether or not this person has been involved in multiple suits and \ntherefore should be dropped.\n  I find that difficult to interpret in that manner. But I do say ``It \nis novel. It shows great dexterity.'' And it shows, I believe, why we \nshould not even get involved in this.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In my 38 seconds, Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. Boxer. In this section the Boxer amendment lists 6 things. They \nare neither positive nor negative. My friend seems to think financial \ninterest is a relief sought as a positive. I would think it is a \nnegative. I could change it to the number of times the plaintiff has \nrepresented a class. I am well meaning here. This section does not \nrelate to lawyers. Even though my friend said it did does not make it \nso. Just read it. It has to do with who the lead plaintiff is.\n  If my friend is serious, we could work this out. We could have a good \namendment. We could agree to it. We could pass it, and we could I think \nprevent a real problem from developing out there when we find ourselves \nin a situation where a co-defendant winds up as a lead plaintiff. I \nthink that would be dangerous.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am very serious. If we cannot read this \namendment to say financial interest and relief sought should be \nconsidered, what are we talking about? If work done to be developed and \nprosecute the case is considered--I mean you can obviously say, ``Well, \nwas there a lot of work done, or was not their work done?'' But is that \nsomething obviously that should be taken into consideration? The \nquality of the claim--are we to say it is good quality? These are \ndeterminative factors that we will make. Are we using the English \nlanguage or turning it upside down? Are we back to Alice in Wonderland \nnow? I mean really, maybe the hour is late. But to suggest that by \nwriting ``prior experience representing a class'', one would really say \nwe are calling upon the judge to limit those people who serve often, if \nthere have been those who have been representing a class over and over \nand in other suits, that would disqualify them. I think that is rather \npreposterous. If that is what the intent is, then we will need to spell \nit out. Maybe we should have spelled this out when we forth this \nlegislation. But certainly, as I see it, it is difficult to believe \nthat is the intent of this particular amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I mean the way the amendment \nis written it is absolutely neutral in terms of whether the judge shall \nconsider the factor positively or negatively. It only says these are \nfactors to be looked at, and the judge upon looking at the factor could \nweigh in a positive way or weigh it in a negative way. I mean I think \nthe Senator has tried very hard to just lay out some items the judge \nshould look at. The Senator tried in arguing against it to read it a \ncertain way. But the amendment does not read a certain way. It is very \nclear on the face of the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. My friend and colleague, as I read it, these are \nconditions that the court will look at in making a determination. They \nare going to consider these factors. It says it quite clearly. We could \nargue about whether or not they should take them into consideration. \nReasonable people can disagree.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator say this amendment with respect to\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nconsidering financial interest in the relief sought--is that a plus or \na minus?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It is something that has to be considered. Obviously, it \nwould seem to me that we should select someone who had a financial \nstake. That would be a factor, a positive factor. If something had been \ndone in developing work, that would be a positive factor, and prior \nexperience and exposure to unique defenses would be a positive factor. \nWhy would you otherwise put these in the amendment? Then possible \nconflicts of interest, we read that as a negative factor, obviously. I \nthink though that we go beyond.\n  We have had a good debate on this. I am prepared to yield back the \nbalance of my time, and we can take this up tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9089-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

A bill to designate the United States Courthouse for the \nEastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, VA, as the Albert V. Bryan \nUnited States Courthouse; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n              ALBERT V. BRYAN UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to transfer the \nname of the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse to the New Federal \ncourthouse in Alexandria, VA.\n  The current Federal courthouse at 200 South Washington Street in \nAlexandria, Virginia bears the name of one of Virginia's most \ndistinguished jurists, Albert V. Bryan.\n  My legislation simply ensures that when the new courthouse is opened \nit shall be known as the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse.\n  Mr. President, the recognition of the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of Judge Bryan to his chosen profession--the law--and to \nhis community is not a new matter for this body.\n  On October 9, 1986, the Senate passed by unanimous consent S. 2890 to \ndesignate the Federal courthouse in Alexandria in honor of Judge \nBryan's lifetime of public service. Since 1987, the Alexandria \ncourthouse has carried his name.\n  Appointed to the U.S. district court in 1947 by President Truman and \npromoted to the appeals court by President Kennedy in 1961, Judge Bryan \ndeveloped a record as a legal conservative and a strict \nconstructionist. He was known for his tolerance on the bench, \ndemonstrating reluctance to cut off lawyers in mid argument, and \nreacting sternly to those who flouted his judicial orders.\n  Throughout his 37 years on the Federal bench, Judge Bryan was known \nto be fair, firm, and thorough. His was a low-key personality, his \ndemeanor\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\nmarked by modesty, politeness and courtliness spiked with a good dose \nof dry wit. Chief Judge Harrison L. Winter of the Fourth Circuit Court \nof Appeals once remarked that Judge Bryan represented ``old Virginia at \nits very best.''\n  Judge Bryan's renowned wit was further evidenced in his dislike of \npomposity. He worked diligently to ensure that his writings were clean \nand precise, often laboring lengthily to identify the exact wording he \nsought. Once, seeking a simple synonym for ``gravamen,'' the essential \npart of a legal complaint, he rejected such complexities as \n``quintessence,'' settling instead on the word ``nub.''\n  Born in 1899, Judge Bryan grew up in Alexandria just one block from \nthe courthouse where he would later preside. He attended Alexandria \npublic schools, then distinguished himself at the University of \nVirginia and, ultimately, its law school. He is said to have taken \ngreat pride in having been named rector of the university in later \nlife.\n  Returning to Alexandria in 1921, he became something of a fixture in \nthe city. He was comfortable riding the bus to his west end home, and \nhe was frequently seen taking lunch in modest, small restaurants near \nthe courthouse.\n  A conservative on racial issues, Judge Bryan, while a district court \njudge, ordered that four black students be enrolled in Arlington's all-\nwhite Stratford Junior High School in 1958. The students' admission the \nfollowing February marked the first day of desegregation in Virginia. \nHe also served on the Federal judicial panel that ordered racial \nintegration for Prince Edward County's public schools. The Prince \nEdward case later became part of the Supreme Court's historic Brown \nversus Board of Education decision.\n  In 1969, Judge Bryan and two additional appeals judges struck down \nVirginia's tuition grant program--the last vestige of massive \nresistance to integration. One year later, he gained considerable \nnotice when he rejected an appeal by Yippie leader Jerry Rubin, sending \nthe Vietnam protestor to jail for 30 days for disorderly conduct during \na 1967 demonstration at the Pentagon.\n  Judge Bryan is credited with writing 322 opinions as a circuit judge \nand an additional 18 opinions while he was a district judge. He was \nreversed in only four cases--a dramatic record which few could equal.\n  Judge Bryan's accomplishments are perhaps best summarized by the \ncomments made at the original courthouse dedication in 1987, by Supreme \nCourt Justice Lewis Powell, Jr.\n  He was indeed an exceptionally able and scholarly judge. Every lawyer \nwho ever argued a case before the fourth circuit court was happy to \nfind Judge Bryan had been assigned to the panel.\n  Judge Powell also quoted a beautiful tribute to Judge Bryan made by \nChief Judge Harrison Winter at the Fourth Circuit Judicial Conference: \n``Albert Bryan was a man to love, a man to respect, and a man to \nemulate.''\n  The new Federal courthouse in Alexandria will be located at \nCourthouse Square South and Jamieson Avenue. My legislation provides \nthat when this facility is completed it shall be known as the Albert F. \nBryan Courthouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SIMPSON:\n  S. 966. A bill for the relief of Nathan C. Vance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     NATE VANCE PRIVATE RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill for private \nrelief of a citizen who has fallen victim both to the 1988 Yellowstone \nfires and to an insensitive Government bureaucracy.\n  The tragic Yellowstone ``Mink'' Forest Fire of 1988 devastated Nathan \nVance's outfitting business when it burned through his Teton wilderness \ncamp. The fire destroyed essential outfitting equipment, forcing Nathan \nVance to cancel 12 prepaid trips and to forfeit valuable revenue from \nthose trips. Mr. Vance incurred both equipment replacement costs and \nlost revenue, a deadly combination to a small, seasonal business with a \nsmall profit margin even in the best of times. This legislation would \ncompensate him for the equipment losses he suffered--as the Congress \nhad intended when it passed the original legislation following those \ntragic fires.\n  That law, Public Law 101-302, authorized the Forest Service to settle \ncertain personal damage claims from the 1988 Yellowstone fires. Mr. \nVance mailed his claim on August 19, 1990 to meet the August 23 \ndeadline. Through no fault of his own, it took 5 business days for Nate \nVance's letter to travel from Wyoming to Utah--longer than it takes a \nletter to reach Washington, DC from San Francisco, CA.\n  The Forest Service officially received the Vance claim less than 24 \nhours after the deadline. The Forest Service initially seemed \nunconcerned by the deadline and continued the claim process by asking \nMr. Vance to provide a detailed accounting of his lost equipment and \nrevenue.\n  More than 3 months after the Forest Service received his accounting \nand appeared ready to pay the claim, Mr. Vance was informed by a Forest \nService employee that his claim was invalid because of the missed \ndeadline. Mr. Vance has since attempted to appeal to the Forest \nService, but has been met with repeated refusals.\n  Public Law 101-302 states the ``Forest Service is directed to \nnegotiate, compromise, and reach a determination on the original \nclaims.'' It is clear that the Forest Service failed to negotiate, to \ncompromise, or reach a determination even when directly ordered by law \nto do so--all based on unusually slow mail service. The tragic \ncombination of a devastating forest fire and Government insensitivity \nhas turned Mr. Vance's life upside down. He is still struggling to pay \nthe additional mortgages on his home and on the business assets he was \nforced to assume in order to continue his business.\n  Nate Vance's story is an unnecessary and an unintended inequity. \nInsensitive Government actions contributed to his hardship through an \nunreasonable and unresponsive process. We should not allow Government \nto forget that we are here to ``serve'' the people, not to impose \nunfair burdens upon them.\n  This legislation will allow us to ease part of the unfair burden \nimposed on Nate Vance by requiring the Secretary to pay Mr. Vance \n$4,850 which is authorized under section 1304--the judgments, awards, \nand compromised settlements section--of title 31 of the United States \nCode. This amount represents his equipment loss and is the amount that \nwould have been approved if the postal service had taken 4 rather than \n5 days to deliver his claim from Wyoming to its adjacent neighbor, \nUtah.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Dole, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Warner, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 967. A bill to provide a fair and full opportunity for recognizing \nwith awards of military decorations the meritorious and valorous acts, \nachievements, and service performed by members of the Army in the Ia \nDrang Valley (Pleiku) campaign in Vietnam in 1965; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                  ia drang valley military awards act\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at 10:48 in the morning on November 14, \n1965, 450 men from the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry hit the ground \nat Landing Zone X-Ray, Ia Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam. Over the \nnext 96 hours, the fighting men of the 1st Battalion joined by men from \nthe 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry, would engage the enemy--over \n2,000 strong. At the conclusion of these 4 days of battle more than 230 \nAmericans were dead and 240 more were wounded.\n  This engagement marked the first battalion-sized engagement of United \nStates Army personnel with North Vietnamese regulars. It was a hellish \nbattle. Ground was seized. Ground was lost. Positions were overtaken, \nand counterattacks repulsed. The men who fought on that morning were \nstronger than the ground on which they fought. Theirs is a story of \ngallantry, victory, sacrifice--an example of human strength in the face \nof overwhelming odds and a numerically superior enemy.\n  But unlike most significant military engagements, this time the \nmilitary recognition for the numerous acts of bravery, sacrifice and \ndignified service to the flag of the United States has largely gone \nunrecognized. It is a\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nwrongful shame which should--and must--be undone, corrected and made \nright.\n  Only 25 months before Lt. Col. Harold Moore led his troops into the \nteeth of battle at Landing Zone X-Ray, then-President Kennedy addressed \nthe students of Amherst College with these words:\n\n       A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces, \n     but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.\n\n  Just 2 years after the President spoke these words, the fallen \nAmericans of the Ia Drang Valley, Pleiku campaign, and the men who \nserved there in November 1965, discovered a void of silence and \ninaction from their government. It was a government which failed to \nheed the words of their President. The Nation's leadership had failed \nto reveal itself--by remembering the men who served--by honoring the \nmen who sacrificed.\n  But nations also learn from history, and in learning are reminded. \nNow is such a time. From the pages of a book documenting the service of \nthose who sacrificed in the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965--a book \nentitled ``We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young''--our Nation is \nreminded. Through this account we are now able to remember those who \nfought, who died, who gave and served. Once again, history reminds us \nof our obligation and responsibility. And as we recognize this \nresponsibility, the nation can go back and correct the failures of the \npast by honoring those very men who served.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation directly aimed to honor the men \nwho served, sacrificed, and in many cases died, in the Ia Drang Valley \nin the Republic of Vietnam in November 1965. Joining me as cosponsors \nin this effort are Senators Smith, Shelby, Bingaman, Helms, Hollings, \nKempthorne, Lieberman, Faircloth, Inhofe, Dole, Warner, and McCain.\n  The bill we collectively introduce today has one singular goal: to \nensure that the men who served in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965 \nare not forgotten. Over the past 5 years, it has become clear that many \nwho fought, sacrificed and died in the Pleiku campaign in the Ia Drang \nwere not recognized for their deeds. In some instances individuals \nkilled even failed to receive recognition for their sacrifice through \nthe award of Purple Hearts. Our Nation can and should do better.\n  Under existing law and regulation, the Department of Army refuses all \naward recommendations submitted after 2 calendar years. It is a \nrestriction callously enforced without regard to the very confluence of \ncircumstances which precluded the assembly of facts in the case of the \nmen who led the first of the 7th into battle in the Ia Drang almost 30 \nyears ago.\n  After almost continuous fighting for the better part of 4 days, unit \ncommanders lost hundreds of men. Exhausted, they huddled under lanterns \neach night writing letters to parents and wives explaining the loss of \ntheir sons and husbands who died in battle. In many cases the only \nwitnesses to the valor and sacrifice of Americans felled by combat were \neither dead or severely wounded--neither of which were available to \ndocument the acts which justify recognition.\n  Over the intervening years, former commander in the Ia Drang and now \nretired Gen. Harold Moore, USA and Joseph Galloway, a UPI war \ncorrespondent who was in the Ia Drang in November 1965, conspired to \nwrite the history of the men served in the Pleiku campaign. After \nconducting hundreds of interviews to research their book, they \ndiscovered that numerous acts of heroism, sacrifice, and valor went \nunrecognized. Over the years efforts were made to convince the \nDepartment of Army to reconsider these men for military awards. In each \ninstance, these efforts failed.\n  On July 6, 1994, the Adjutant General of the U.S. Army wrote Brig. \nGen. Henry Thorpe, USA, (retired)--himself commander of Delta Company, \n2d Battalion, 7th Cavalry in the Ia Drang in November 1965--to say:\n\n       The Department of the Army has rigidly adhered to the rules \n     pertaining to the two-year time limit and the only recourse \n     available to recognize these soldiers is special legislation \n     by Congress.'' [emphasis added.]\n\n  This bill seeks to fulfill the casual advice of the Adjutant General \nof the Army. While it is unfortunate that legislative action is \nrequired to correct an oversight of the past 30 years, it should not be \nan insurmountable obstacle. The bill we introduce today removes the \nbarricade erected by the Army, not by dictating the award of specific \nmedals to individuals, but by directing the Army to waive the 2-year \nrestriction and consider awards recommendations under existing Army \ncriteria.\n  Should my colleagues question the wisdom of this legislation, I \nrecommend you read two letters I have received from veterans of Ia \nDrang Valley, Pleiku campaign. At this point, I request unanimous \nconsent that two letters supporting this bill be inserted in the \nRecord. The first letter is from Joseph Galloway and the other is from \nJack Smith.\n  Joseph Galloway was a 23-year-old war correspondent for United Press \nInternational when he accompanied elements of the 7th Cavalry into the \nIa Drang Valley in November 1965. Thirty years later, his words ring in \nreverent tones as he describes the sacrifice of men lost, fallen \ncomrades who served yet received no recognition.\n  Jack Smith was an enlisted specialist in Charlie Company, 2d \nBattalion, 7th Cavalry. Today, Jack Smith is an accomplished journalist \nwith ABC News. His account is perhaps more personal as the book \ndescribes his experiences on the afternoon of November 17, 1965, on a \ntrail to Landing Zone Albany--the extraction point for a tired group of \nsoldiers who had already faced the dangers of battle and were weary \nfrom it.\n  As you read these letters, I urge you to envision the faces of the \nhundreds of young men who fought, not so much out of fear, but out of \nduty, honor, and commitment to the men with whom they served. This is a \nhistory which deserves recognition. And this legislation deserves \npassage, so that our Nation can once again reveal itself by the men it \nhonors and the men it remembers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation and \nI yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. News & World Report,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: This letter is to advise that I fully \n     and completely support the Bill which you are introducing to \n     permit U.S. Army consideration of delayed awards \n     recommendations for some individuals who fought in the Pleiku \n     (Ia Drang) Campaign in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam \n     in October and November, 1965.\n       I was present on a number of those battlefields as a \n     civilian war correspondent for United Press International, in \n     the campaign which begin with the siege of Plei Me Special \n     Forces Camp on 23 October, 1965, and ended with the tragic \n     clash at Landing Zone Albany, 17-18 November, 1965.\n       I personally witnessed repeated acts of valor and sacrifice \n     in three days and nights at Landing Zone X-Ray, 14-16 \n     November, 1965, and at that time assumed that such acts would \n     in due course be recognized by the Army by appropriate awards \n     of valor.\n       It was not until Lt. Gen. (ret.) Hal Moore and I had begun \n     the detailed interviews and research that would lead to \n     publication of our book, ``We Were Soldiers Once . . . and \n     Young,'' that we realized how many men had been completely \n     overlooked, and why.\n       There is, for instance, the tale of the two Charlie \n     Companies, 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry. At \n     LZ X-Ray on the terrible morning of 15 November, 1965, \n     Charlie Company 1/7 Cavalry held the line for all of us \n     against a full battalion of the 66th North Vietnamese Army \n     Regiment, reinforced by another battalion of Main Force Viet \n     Cong. The company began that morning with 5 officers and 107 \n     men on its roster. By noon it had no officers and only 49 men \n     left standing. A total of 42 officers and men had died and 20 \n     more had been wounded in two and one-half hours of hand-to-\n     hand combat. Yet they held the line and saved the rest of the \n     battalion.\n       Two days later, two and a half miles away at LZ Albany, \n     Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion 7th Cavalry began the day with \n     112 officers and men. By the following morning, 18 November, \n     there were only eight officers and men present and accounted \n     for. All the others were either dead, wounded or missing in \n     action. The battalion had been ambushed in thick jungle \n     and tall elephant grass; the company commanders had all \n     been called to the head of the column and were not with \n     their men. Of all the companies present, Charlie Company \n     2/7 died on its feet in a desperate charge into the \n     muzzles of the machine guns trying to save the battalion. \n     They died following the bravest of the brave, company \n     executive officer Lt. Don C. Cornett, who died leading \n     them.\n       Who knows their stories? Who writes their award \n     recommendations in the shock and immediacy of the moment when \n     battalions are being loaded down with replacements and\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n     the few surviving officers sit under gasoline lanterns in \n     base camp tents, night after night, writing letters of \n     condolence to the mothers and fathers, wives and children of \n     those men?\n       Three-hundred-six American soldiers and one U.S. Air Force \n     pilot died in the Pleiku Campaign, in the first major battle \n     of the Vietnam War between U.S. and North Vietnamese Army \n     regulars. Ours was a peacetime Army just getting it war legs \n     under it--an Army without even a proper casualty notification \n     system. The families learned news of their loved one's death \n     from telegrams delivered by taxi drivers, often at 2 or 3 \n     a.m. This was an Army still operating on peacetime awards \n     policies, miserly and damned proud of being miserly when it \n     came time to recognize the soldier in the ranks.\n       All these things conspired to insure that those men, living \n     and dead, who had fought the first and bloodiest battle of a \n     10-year war, would in large measure find that their deeds \n     went unrecognized. And, as for the thanks of a grateful \n     nation, well, we all know how that song went.\n       What I found in interviewing the survivors, my battlefield \n     comrades, is that these are the most modest of men. They, \n     each of them, seek nothing for themselves. But each will tell \n     you how his closest buddy sacrificed his life to save another \n     man. Or how the skinny young medic from Washington, D.C., \n     tried to shelter the wounded with his body as enemy guns \n     homed in on them. Or how Charles R. (Doc) Lose, the medic of \n     the Lost Platoon (B Company, 1/7 Cavalry) at LZ X-Ray, used \n     up all his bandages, all his morphine and then used c-ration \n     toilet paper and strips torn off his own tee-shirt and \n     somehow kept 13 badly wounded men alive for 26 harrowing \n     hours under direct enemy fire. Only Doc Lose moved on that \n     tiny knoll surrounded by the enemy, moving ceaselessly from \n     man to man, tending his patients. During that time Doc Lose \n     was himself wounded two times.\n       So many of those who would have stepped forward to \n     recommend awards for the heroic actions they had witnessed \n     were wounded and evacuated to hospitals in the United States. \n     Many others had only a few days left on their term of service \n     in the Army when they emerged from the Ia Drang battles. They \n     were processed out and put on planes bound for home and \n     civilian life, beginning one or two days later.\n       This legislation seeks no wholesales bemedalling of old \n     soldiers for deeds long forgotten. It simply seeks an \n     opportunity, a window, by which official Army awards channels \n     can legally consider Ia Drang awards recommendations, \n     properly drawn and properly endorsed by witnesses and the \n     officers and non-commissioned officers of the units involved. \n     It is a small opportunity to convey the country's and the \n     Army's thanks and recognition to a few dozen men, living and \n     dead, who did far more than simple duty demanded in the \n     service of the United States.\n       These men are America's neighbors. They come from virtually \n     every state in the Union. They are quiet and productive \n     citizens. I was proud to stand beside them in the Ia Drang \n     Valley in 1965, and it is a great honor and privilege to \n     stand up for them and the families who lost loved ones in \n     these battles and urge favorable consideration of this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph L. Galloway,\n     Senior Writer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     ABC News,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As a decorated veteran of the Battle of \n     the Ia Drang Valley, 14-18 November, 1965, in the Republic of \n     Vietnam, I strongly endorse your efforts to re-open the \n     awards process for the men who fought in that major \n     engagement and in the Pleiku Campaign (October-November, \n     1965) of which it was a part.\n       It was at the Ia Drang that US soldiers fought their first \n     pitched battle against North Vietnamese regulars. The 1st \n     Cavalry Division (Airmobile) decisively defeated a North \n     Vietnamese division in one of the fiercest clashes of the \n     war. My company, C company, 2d Battalion, 7th Cavalry \n     Regiment, for instance, suffered 93% casualties. I was \n     wounded twice, and am 20% disabled. (I am now a correspondent \n     for ABC News in Washington, till recently on This Week with \n     David Brinkley, and we have met.)\n       The heroism of many deserving friends and fellow-Cav \n     troopers was overlooked in the aftermath of the battle. \n     Partly because of the terrible losses suffered by some US \n     units and the Army's consequent effort to sanitize the battle \n     for public relations purposes, and partly because in many \n     cases there were simply too few survivors to document the \n     heroism that occurred in a timely fashion.\n       Even though the Army is now understandably reluctant to re-\n     open the awards process for fear of being overwhelmed by a \n     flood of frivolous claims, I believe the fears are \n     groundless. No one is talking about the wholesale revision of \n     awards, rather a long-overdue chance to allow consideration \n     of delayed award recommendations for acts of heroism that \n     went unreported at the time.\n       The fighting was so ferocious, the action so important, and \n     the valor of those who fought so exemplary that introducing a \n     bill to do this, as you are doing, is a public service. It is \n     an opportunity to convey the nation's thanks to a few men who \n     answered their country's call and did more than duty \n     demanded, but who afterwards were overlooked.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Smith,\n     Correspondent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, last Friday I joined with the people \nof Maine and America in celebrating the life of Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith, who had a distinguished 32 years of service in Congress on \nbehalf of my home State of Maine.\n  Senator Smith passed away this Memorial Day at the age of 97. With \ncharacteristic modesty, she asked that no funeral be held, and that \ninstead that a memorial service be scheduled at a later date. That \nservice is scheduled to occur this afternoon in Senator Smith's home \ntown of Skowhegan, ME, at the Margaret Chase Smith Library.\n  During her tenure in Congress, Margaret Chase Smith became known for \nher independence and her conscience as well as for her legislative \naccomplishments. In 1953, she identified her creed that guided her both \nin life and in the Senate.\n  Her creed is as follows:\n\n       My Creed is that public service must be more than doing a \n     job efficiently and honestly. It must be a complete \n     dedication to the people and to the nation with full \n     recognition that every human being is entitled to courtesy \n     and consideration, that constructive criticism is not only to \n     be expected but sought, that smears are not only to be \n     expected but fought, that honor is to be earned but not \n     bought.--Margaret Chase Smith, November 11, 1953.\n\n  Senator Smith--always prepared to speak for what is right in \nsociety--also identified, in her book ``Declaration of Conscience,'' \nsome of the perils that face our society. I think that, as we mark \nSenator Smith's passing today, it is appropriate to again consider \nMargaret Chase Smith's ``tribute to the square'':\n\n       In today's growing, but tragic emphasis on materialism, we \n     find a perversion of the values of things in life as we once \n     knew them. For example, the creed once taught children as \n     they grew up was that the most important thing was not in \n     whether you won or lost the game, but in ``how you played the \n     game''.\n       That high level attitude that stresses the moral side no \n     longer predominates in this age of pragmatic materialism that \n     increasingly worships the opposite creed that ``the end \n     justifies the means'' or in the attitude of\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\n     get what you can in any way, manner, or means that you can . \n     . .--``A Ttribute to the Square,'' December 21, 1964, Quoted \n     in Margaret Chase Smith, ``Declaration of Conscience.''\n\n  Now, three decades after Senator Smith wrote those words and four \ndecades after her ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech, her words ring \nas true as they did when Margaret Chase Smith first uttered them. We \nmay learn from them even today, as we celebrate Senator Smith's memory, \nher conscience, and her values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9101-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ATF FIREARMS TRACE STUDY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I would like to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to a recent report released by the southern \nCalifornia field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \n[BATF]. This report details a firearms trace study conducted on \nfirearms found in crime scenes in southern California. The BATF's \nobjective in conducting this study was to help determine the source of \ncrime guns and suggest practices to counter the threat posed by illicit \ntraffic in firearms. The results of the study provide evidence that \nmany firearms used in crimes come from licensed firearms dealers. The \nresults also reveal the problems of interstate trafficking in firearms, \nand the need for uniform, national firearms regulations.\n  The report, titled ``Sources of Crime guns in Southern California'' \ndescribes the results of a firearms trace study in which special agents \nand intelligence analysts reviewed police reports and submitted trace \nrequests for 1,764 guns recovered by selected law enforcement agencies \nin Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties between January 1, 1994 \nand November 10, 1994.\n  The results of the study raise serious questions about some of the \nrhetoric used to oppose firearms regulations. Last year, as I worked to \ntighten licensing requirements for Federal firearms dealers, many who \nopposed my proposals claimed that licensed gun dealers are not the \nsource of guns used in crimes. This report shows that, at least in \nsouthern California, that is just not true. The ATF report outlined six \nsources of the guns recovered from crime scenes. By far the largest \nsource was licensed gun dealers: Commercial gun dealers accounted for \n80 percent of the guns recovered.\n  According to the study, many significant gun trafficking cases \ninvolved at-home dealers who purchased large quantities of firearms \nfrom distributors, then resold them without paperwork. Recent \nlegislation, from the Brady law to my gun dealer licensing reforms in \nlast year's crime bill, has begun to address the serious lack of \noversight on licensed gun dealers. As a result of my reforms, Federal \nfirearms licenses now require a photograph and fingerprints, dealers \nare required to comply with State and local laws, and the ATF now has \n60 days, instead of 45, to investigate before granting a license. \nAdditional reforms raised the licensing fee from a mere $30 to $200. In \nfact, several recent cases have led to prosecution and conviction on \nfelony licensing and recordkeeping violations.\n  The report also shows the problems with interstate trafficking of \nfirearms, and provides yet another argument in favor of national \nfirearms regulations. Many of the guns recovered from crime scenes in \nsouthern California were traced to dealers in neighboring States with \nless stringent regulations: 30 percent of the guns included in the \nstudy were traced to dealers in 40 States other than California. \nArizona and Nevada comprised 25 percent of the out-of-State purchases.\n  California is a State with strong gun trafficking laws. All gun \ntransfers, including those involving private parties, must go through a \ndealer and be approved by the California Department of Justice. \nProspective purchasers of handguns and long guns are screened during a \n15-day waiting period and approved buyers are perpetually recorded in a \ncomputer database. California forbids the possession of certain assault \nweapons and forbids felons from possessing any type of firearm \nwhatsoever.\n  By comparison, the laws of surrounding States, such as Nevada and \nArizona, are highly permissive. Neither State imposes any restrictions \nother than the minimum Brady Bill requirements. Long gun sales and \nprivate transactions are not regulated and there is no central registry \nof handgun sales.\n  I would like to commend the ATF for conducting this important \nfirearms trace study. The results of their report should help to inform \nthe debate on gun control legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9102-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9102-S9103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE LIFE OF GEORGE HENRY WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, throughout its colorful history, \nthe State of Oregon has been blessed with the talents of many \ndistinguished leaders. In my readings, I have been struck by the number \nof these great Oregon citizens who have received little notice from the \nwriters of U.S. history. One such individual is Senator George Henry \nWilliams.\n  I was reminded of Judge Williams' important role in Oregon history by \nan article which recently appeared in the Oregon State Bar Bulletin. \nThe article, excerpted from Judge Williams' obituary, was skillfully \nedited by Julie Hankin of the Bulletin. This excellent piece of history \ngives us a glimpse into the extraordinary life of a great American and \nI recommend it to my colleagues.\n  A contemporary and close friend of Abraham Lincoln, Judge Williams \ncame to Oregon following his appointment as Chief Justice of the Oregon \nterritory in 1853. His ambition, however, was to serve in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Having worked actively as a Free Soil Democrat, he eventually left \nthe party for that of Lincoln and was elected to the U.S. Senate in \n1864 on the Republican ticket. There, he quickly earned the respect of \nhis colleagues and, later, the notice of his President, Gen. Ulysses S. \nGrant. President Grant nominated Williams to serve as his Attorney \nGeneral. Williams withdrew his name from consideration, however, \nfollowing a set of intriguing circumstances, all of which are detailed \nin the article which I will submit for the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, in a city guided all too often by ego, I am always \npleased to discover unsung heros, those who sought only to serve their \ncountrymen, not themselves. As noted author Walter Lippman once said: \n``The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind in other men the \nconviction and the will to carry on.'' George Henry Williams was such \nan inspirational figure.\n  I ask that the article from the Oregon State Bar Bulletin appear in \nthe Record.\n\n             [From the Oregon State Bar Bulletin, May 1995]\n\n  Oregon's Gentle Giant--The Life of George Henry Williams: Senator, \n                      Attorney General, and Lawyer\n\n                            (By C.E.S. Wood)\n\n       George Henry Williams was born in a log cabin in New York \n     state in 1823. Both of his grandfathers served in the \n     Continental Army during the Revolutionary war. He studied \n     law, and in 1844, at the age of 21, he was admitted to the \n     bar at Syracuse. Soon afterward he started West to seek his \n     fortunes as a lawyer.\n       Nationwide there were but a few miles of railroad at the \n     time--none west of Indiana. There were no telegraph lines. \n     Travel was by river, canal and coach. Pittsburgh and St. \n     Louis were the Western frontier. Chicago did not exist. He \n     made his way by the Erie Canal, the Ohio Canal, the Ohio \n     River as far as St. Louis and then up the Mississippi to Fort \n     Madison, Iowa. His wealth was the Statutes of New York and \n     some bank notes of New York state banks.\n       Unfortunately, while Williams was counting backnotes in \n     Pittsburgh in order to exchange them for western notes, they \n     were snatched from him in a robbery. By virtue of his honest \n     face he procured passage on boats to St. Louis and then Fort \n     Madison.\n       In 1847, on the admission of Iowa as a state, he was \n     elected a district judge. The same year he first met Abraham \n     Lincoln at a conference in Chicago. Here began a great, \n     lifelong friendship between these two with much background in \n     common--born in poverty in log cabins, growing to the rugged \n     strength and height of giants, athletic and sympathetic to \n     the great masses. Judge Williams would later be selected as \n     one of the escorts of honor and one of the pall bearers at \n     Lincoln's funeral.\n       As an anti-slavery Democrat, Judge Williams campaigned \n     throughout Iowa for Franklin Pierce and was elected one of \n     the presidential electors on the Democratic ticket. Shortly \n     after Pierce's inauguration in 1853, at the suggestion of his \n     friend, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, Williams was appointed chief \n     justice of Oregon Territory. He was 30 years old. The \n     appointment was without his knowledge and contrary to his \n     wish.\n       He had gotten married in 1850 in Iowa to Miss Kate Van \n     Antwerp and found his $1,000\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\n     annual salary as an Iowa district judge too small to meet the \n     expenses of married life. He sent in his resignation, with \n     the intention of resuming the practice of law. Lawyers of \n     both Whig and Democrat persuasion begged him to remain on the \n     bench.\n       In the end, the young and romantic Mrs. Williams decided \n     their fortunes. Oregon was the unknown land of the West, and \n     the excitement of voyaging there appealed to her. The couple \n     fully intended to return to Iowa as soon as Judge Williams' \n     term in Oregon expired.\n       The young couple made their home in Salem. President \n     Buchanan appointed Judge Williams to a second term, but \n     private practice still tempted him. He resigned, and in 1858 \n     opened an office in Portland in a small frame building on the \n     river bank between Washington and Alder streets.\n       These were stirring times in Oregon. The admission of the \n     territory into the Union as a state was a vital issue and \n     necessarily involved whether it should come in as a free or \n     as a slave state. One of the desires that induced Williams to \n     leave the bench was not only to add to his income by \n     practicing law, but that he might enter the active arena of \n     politics. His ambition was to be United States senator.\n       As a Democrat he championed the anti-slavery cause. He \n     became a Free Soil Democrat, elected to the state \n     constitutional convention and appointed chairman of the \n     judiciary committee there. Apparently by the force of \n     argument and eloquence, he greatly aided in having the free \n     constitution adopted by the state.\n       Judge Williams' strong anti-slavery work in Oregon had \n     antagonized the administration in Washington, with the \n     result that he was not appointed United States senator. \n     Also at the first election he was defeated by the \n     opposition.\n       Judge Williams had joined in the call for an amalgamation \n     of anti-slavery-war-Democrats with Republicans, to be called \n     the Union Party, and by this transition he entered the \n     Republican party and in 1864 was elected to the United States \n     Senate. His long-held ambition was fulfilled. He entered the \n     Senate at the close of the war and beginning of the \n     reconstruction period. He was the sole author of the \n     Reconstruction Act substantially as it was adopted. He drew \n     the 15th Amendment essentially as it now stands. hew was a \n     member of the Joint High Commission, which met in Washington \n     to determine how the disputes between Great Britain and the \n     United States should be settled. He was a leader in the \n     Senate during the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.\n       The enforcement of his Reconstruction Act also fell to \n     Williams as Grant's attorney general at the expiration of his \n     senatorial term: In all the troubled times following the \n     Civil War, the responsibility of enforcement law and order by \n     civil remedies was on Williams' shoulders. The task included \n     confronting the Ku Klux Klan's lawlessness. Also, he had to \n     decide between two governments in Louisiana, Alabama and \n     Arkansas, conflicts which he resolved in favor of the \n     Republicans in Louisiana, the Democrats in Arkansas and by a \n     compromise in Alabama.\n       If therefore surprised no one (except Oregonians) that \n     General Grant sent his name to the Senate to be chief justice \n     of the United States. Judge Williams eventually insisted on \n     his name being withdrawn. The causes have been variously \n     stated as political animosity in the East due to his \n     reconstruction work and Republican partisanship; social \n     antagonism to his second wife, then ambitious to be a leader \n     in Washington society; and opposition in Oregon, because in \n     the course of his Washington career, he had necessarily \n     failed to please everyone back home.\n       As the story goes, he went to see Grant to insist that his \n     name be withdrawn. They drove out behind Grant's favorite \n     pair of trotters, and the president became so absorbed in the \n     discussion that he overdrove the horses and one of them died. \n     I the end, Grant took Williams' suggestion of Morrison R. \n     Waite of Ohio, saying, ``Wire him in your own name and ask \n     him if he will take the office of chief justice of the United \n     States.'' The result is a matter of history.\n       It seems that Judge Williams only narrowly missed being \n     chief justice, but he used to sum up the whole matter by \n     saying, ``I believe I have lived longer and happier than if I \n     had been raised to that exalted office.''\n       He returned to Portland and resumed the practice of law. He \n     was a two-term mayor of the city from 1902-1905. He died in \n     his sleep at home in Portland, April 4, 1910.\n\n\n                        What Kind of Man was he?\n\n       These are the milestones in Williams' life. Taken alone, \n     they are impressive enough. On the other hand, other men have \n     held high office and lived long lives, busy in civic affairs \n     on all levels. Those who knew Judge Williams want to \n     emphasize what manner of man he was.\n       In all that he did he was filled with common sense and the \n     spirit of justice. As a judge he was calm, impersonal and \n     impartial, sensible, passionless and just. As a lawyer he was \n     forceful, eloquent, sincere and never let justice be obscured \n     by technicalities. Although learned in the law, his ruling \n     trait was plain, good sense. He disliked dissension or \n     contention either in public or private life.\n       At 87 he was still youthful in mind, belonging to the \n     present and not the past. He was as interested in the \n     problems of the day and as progressive in thought as a man of \n     25.\n       He exhibited his own childlike simplicity of character in \n     his fondness for children. One of the last images his \n     partners had of him was of Williams gazing gravely at a 2-\n     year old girl was had toddled into his office from the \n     hallway and stood staring at him.\n       After a moment's mutual viewing each other in silence, not \n     knowing they were observed, the judge was heard to say \n     solemnly to his small visitor, ``Were you looking for a \n     lawyer?'' In a few days he was dead, and there passed one of \n     the kindliest and most lovable of men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9102-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONTINUE THE OFFSHORE DRILLING BAN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to efforts by some in the House of Representatives to remove \nthe current moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Last Tuesday, the House Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee voted to lift this 14-year-old ban without soliciting any \ninput from the coastal states directly affected. The full committee \nwill have an opportunity to reverse this misguided action this week, \nand I call on them to reinstate this prohibition.\n  Mr. President, lifting this moratorium is short-sighted and \nunnecessary, and threatens to litter our coastline with mammoth \ndrilling rigs. This will only increase the likelihood of oil and gas \nspills and other environmental disasters.\n  We faced this battle roughly 20 years ago in Delaware when oil and \ngas interests wanted to drill in the Baltimore Canyon off the coast of \nthe Delmarva Peninsula. This is clearly one instance where Federal law \nis necessary and effective and we ought to keep the ban.\n  Mr. President, I am terribly concerned that this move is yet another \npart of an overall antienvironmental agenda now being advanced. Whether \nit is the air we breath, the water we drink or the food we eat, there \nare increasing attempts to do away with reasonable health and safety \nprotections.\n  Lifting the ban on offshore drilling--at a time when world oil supply \nand prices remain stable, and when the Republican budget proposal \nincludes billions in oil sales from the north slope of Alaska--is \nunnecessary, misguided and just plain wrong.\n  Just one oil or natural gas spill, similar to the tragic Valdez \naccident, could permanently destroy miles and miles of pristine State \nbeaches and boardwalk. Such an accident could also easily erase the \ndecade of progress made in restoring the fragile ecosystems of the \nChesapeake and Delaware Bays.\n  Due largely to concerns over these environmental risks, the Congress, \nin 1982, struck a fair balance between the need for expedited \nexploration and development, and the need to protect coastal \nenvironments.\n  This policy has been effective and has enjoyed bipartisan support. \nOil and natural gas extraction in the most abundant areas has continued \nand even increased, generating tens of billions of Federal revenue, \nwhile the sanctity, beauty and safety of our coastlines has been \npreserved. A fair balance.\n  Yet now, in total disregard for the interests of coastal states, and \n``States rights'' which is so often invoked and embraced, the House is \nattempting to upset this balance.\n  Mr. President, this is a perfect example of the proper role for \nGovernment in ensuring the safety of our environment and the health of \nour citizens. At a bare minimum, coastal states should have the \nauthority to extend the moratorium to the Outer Continental Shelf \nadjacent to the States' coastline. That is why I have joined with the \ndistinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] in introducing \nlegislation enabling States to reimpose this needed drilling \nrestriction on their Outer Continental Shelf waters.\n  Yet, I remain terribly concerned that a more comprehensive approach, \ncovering all of the Outer Continental Shelf, as we have had in the \npast, is what is needed.\n  Mr. President, I intend to fight vigorously to ensure the continued \nsanctity of our coastal communities and remain committed to the ban on \noffshore drilling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9103-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9103-S9104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 1995 ELLIS ISLAND MEDALS OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. PRESSLER.

NECO also serves as a watchdog for ethnic, racial, and \nreligious injustice, and has been a constant voice and vigorous \nadvocate for ethnic unity and pride in America. One of its programs is \nthe Ellis Island Medals of Honor.\n  Each year since 1986, NECO has recognized America's ethnic diversity \nby honoring the achievements and contributions of ethnic Americans in \nall professions, including government, entertainment, business and \nindustry, sports, health care, and communications. NECO's Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor embody the true spirit of what makes the United States \nunique among the world's nations.\n  Many of our country's ethnic groups have no direct connection to \nEllis Island. However, NECO rightly views Ellis Island as a landmark \nand symbol of the shared experiences of all immigrant groups that have \nlanded on our soil. Most have come to our shores because they were the \ntargets of ethnic, racial, and religious hatred, discrimination, \nstereotyping, and prejudice. Many continued to experience this \nintolerance in America itself.\n  NECO strives to eliminate this hatred. Through the Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor, NECO celebrates ethnic diversity and the great \ncontributions of immigrants to the American experience. Whether they \nhave entered past Lady Liberty in New York Harbor, John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport, or through San Francisco Bay; whether they are \nnative Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, or others who \nhave not entered this country through Ellis Island; NECO's Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor embrace all ethnic Americans who call this great \ncountry home.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record the National \nEthnic Coalition of Organizations 1995 Ellis Island Medals of Honor \nrecipients.

Mr. President, during the ongoing debate about \nautos and autoparts, much has been said about how our domestic \ncompanies have been denied a chance to compete in Japan on the basis of \nquality and price. I rise today to describe to my colleagues a similar \nproblem faced by United States companies seeking to enter the trade \ncarrying automobiles between Japan and the United States under the \nUnited States flag.\n  At present, only three United States-flag vessels operate in the \nUnited States-Japan trade. I understand the Department of Defense and \nour trade negotiators are aware of proposals to increase United States-\nflag participation in this trade, including a significant one to \nconstruct a fleet of 10 refrigerated car carriers to carry vehicles \nfrom Japan to the United States and produce and other refrigerated \nproducts, as well as automobiles, to Japan at commercially competitive \nrates.\n  I am particularly interested in this type of proposal because it \nwould lead to the construction of new ships in U.S. shipyards. As my \ncolleagues no doubt appreciate, we must do something to help our \nshipyards supplement their military work with commercial orders. The \npresident of the American Shipbuilding Association, for example, \nrecently pointed out in a letter to Members of Congress that \n``[c]onstruction of military sealift ships is critical to the Nation's \ndefense, to sustaining the Navy's shipbuilding base, and to our \nindustry's efforts to supplement declining orders with commercial \nwork.'' By encouraging the entry of new U.S.-built vessels equipped \nwith national defense features in this trade, Congress and the \nadministration can help preserve rapidly dwindling seafaring manpower \nand skills, save or create a significant number of jobs in the \nshipbuilding and supplier industrial base, and assist U.S. shipyards in \nreentering the commercial shipbuilding market.\n  At my request, the Department of Defense recently completed a study \nof the costs and benefits of an active Ready Reserve Force Program \nemploying privately owned commercial ships equipped with national \ndefense features as an alternative to the currently inactive Ready \nReserve Force fleet. The report demonstrates that an active Ready \nReserve Force Program, comprised of newly U.S.-built commercial vehicle \ncarriers equipped with national defense features, would have important \nbenefits and would be substantially more cost effective than acquiring \nand converting existing foreign-built ships. The report noted, however, \nthat securing entry into the commercial market will be a critical \nelement for the success of the program.\n  In my view, entry of these vessels into the United States-Japan trade \nwould enhance our national security. Equipped with national defense \nfeatures, such as hoistable strengthened decks, these vessels would be \nwell adapted for carrying both heavy equipment and ammunition. \nMoreover, a fleet of this size in normal commercial operation in the \nUnited States-Japan auto trade would ensure vessels would be available \nfor loading at designated ports of embarkation within the time demands \nfor the Ready Reserve Force contemplated in an emergency.\n  I therefore urge the Department of Defense and our trade negotiators \nin ongoing discussions and negotiations to emphasize to the Government \nof Japan the importance of augmenting American participation in this \ntrade as a means of advancing the mutual defense and security interests \nof our two nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9104-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9104-S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DR.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize an outstanding Minnesotan who has been chosen as the American \nOptometric Association's 1995 ``Optometrist of the Year.''\n  A resident of Brainerd, MI, Dr. Kerry Beebe was selected from more \nthan 27,000 doctors for his significant contributions to the discipline \nof optometry.\n  Since 1985, Dr. Beebe has taken an active role in promoting the \nagenda of Minnesota's Optometric Association's legislative steering \ncommittee by spending countless hours lobbying, fundraising and \nspeaking on issues important to optometry and the patients it serves.\n  In addition, Dr. Beebe has participated in a number of community \nservice activities including serving as a member of the Brainerd Area \nChamber of Commerce, Brainerd Lions Club, Brainerd Jaycees, Ducks \nUnlimited, and as an advisory board member to the Kingwood Good \nSamaritan Nursing Home.\n  In 1992, Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson appointed Dr. Beebe to the Rural \nHealth Advisory Commission which was established to facilitate the \nimplementation of health care reform on a regional basis. He was also \nappointed by the Minnesota Commissioner of\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nHealth to serve on the universal standard benefit set committee to \nrecommend a benefit set of services.\n  I would like to quote from Dr. Beebe's hometown paper, the Brainerd \nDaily Dispatch:\n\n       He has to be one of, if not the most patient, understanding \n     and courteous business/non-business persons I have \n     encountered. . . . During all the years I have dealt with Dr. \n     Beebe, he has never failed in his friendly, courteous and \n     patient manner.''\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that our Senate colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating one of America's outstanding health care providers. Dr. \nBeebe has made Minnesota proud and today, Dr. Beebe is making America \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/26/senate-section/article/S9104-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-10\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.
