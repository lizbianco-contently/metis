Mr. President, let me move quickly into what I thought \nmight be appropriate. I, of course, spent my time at home during the \nMemorial Day recess,\n and I returned again to Wyoming this weekend. I would just like to \ncomment very briefly on my impression of what we are doing here, after \nhaving been here nearly 6 months, and the impression that I received \nfrom those at home.\n\n  First of all, let me say that I think there is an anxiousness in the \nelectorate for the Congress to move forward. I wish, for example, and I \nwant to just observe things as they occurred in 6 months from some \nprevious experiences in the House.\n  It seems to me we have a difficulty in setting priorities. It is too \nbad. There are some things surely most Members would agree are more \nimportant than others. It would seem we really do not have a set of \npriorities. I wish we could do that. Priorities on issues are fairly \nwell-defined in the country, not certainly so well-defined here.\n  It seems to me we ought to be able to manage time better than we do. \nTime, after all, is the resource that we have here, and certainly we \nconsume too much doing many things. Time becomes sort of a political \nstrategy, not particularly useful in debate, but rather being used to \nposture ourselves one way or the other. [[Page S8200]] \n  The balanced budget debate, for example, and certainly the issues, \nwere exhausted relatively early, but the decisions did not come until \nthe Members were exhausted. Perhaps that is the way it works. It does \nnot seem like a good use of time.\n  I suspect there is a great deal of posturing for the media. I have a \nhunch, and of course I was not here before the activities of the floor \nwere shown on TV, but I suspect the conversations were somewhat shorter \nthan they are now.\n  It is difficult, and this is an irony, I do not know what we do about \nit. We have a better opportunity to communicate much more quickly than \nwe have had in the history. Captain O'Grady shows up, and everyone \nknows about it 10 minutes afterward. That is wonderful, and that is the \nkind of communication we have. Yet we still seem to communicate in \nsound bites, where people really do not know the facts. That is too \nbad.\n  I happened to see the Chief of Staff of the White House on ``Meet the \nPress'' the other day. It is almost as if a robot pushed a button and \nthe same thing came forward time after time.\n  I think it is exciting that we have an opportunity. I think there are \nissues out there. People are still concerned about taxes and spending. \nThey think this Government is too big and costs too much.\n  I think people sincerely want a balanced budget although there will \nbe some pain. I think people are willing to undertake that pain, to be \nresponsible in a financial area.\n  I think regulatory relief is something that almost everyone would \nagree with. Most anyone would say we are overregulated in this country \nand we need to move more quickly to do something about that.\n  Real tort reform. We have played with that some. It is not true yet, \nbut it is real tort reform on the edges. We need to do something. Our \nfolks say we need to do something about that.\n  Welfare reform, I understand, will come next. I am pleased for that. \nIt is something that surely needs to happen.\n  Health care has moved off of the highest level of visibility, but it \ndoes not mean we do not have to do something. It does not mean that \nhealth care does not need some restructuring. We ought to have a chance \nto do that.\n  States rights. Everyone understands that, if we can move Government a \nlittle closer to people, we will have better decisions, Mr. President.\n  Those are, I believe, clearly the agenda of people in this country. I \nthink the agenda of this body and the agenda of the Congress ought to \nmore properly reflect that.\n  I am a little discouraged. We have lots of efforts to block what is \ngoing on simply for the purpose of blocking. I am discouraged we do not \nhave more leadership from the White House in terms of issues we are \nworking on.\n  I am encouraged, on the other hand, that there is a willingness to \nchange. There is a willingness to move forward, particularly, I think, \non the part of new Members. I think there is a willingness to make \nfundamental changes in the way the Government works and, for the first \ntime in a very long time, to analyze some of the programs and say, is \nthere a better way? Can we do it? Indeed, does it need to be done by \nthe Federal Government?\n  Mr. President, that is a quick, personal analysis of where we are. \nObviously, it is thrilling and exciting to be here. I think this \nsession has new opportunities to look at things.\n  I urge that we do set a priority. I urge we do move forward with full \ndebate, but not skidding our feet and trying to stop things from \nhappening. People expect more of Government than that. I think the real \nmeasure of good Government is responding to what the voters have said.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the next 6 months. I hope it is at \nleast as productive, and hopefully more productive, than the past. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, under the order I was to be recognized at \nthis point for 10 minutes. The distinguished President pro tempore has \nan appointment, and I ask unanimous consent that he may precede me, and \nI may then follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8199-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONCERNING THE RESCUE OF CAPT. SCOTT O'GRADY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able and \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy and kindness.\n  Mr. President, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that each \nof us breathed a sigh of relief when we learned last Friday of the \nrescue of Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady, whose F-16 was shot down over \nwar-torn Bosnia earlier this month.\n  Probably no one was more relieved by the rescue of Captain O'Grady \nthan the young pilot himself. After spending 6 days eluding hostile \nforces, enduring the wicked weather of the rugged Bosnian mountains, \nand surviving on bugs, rainwater, and vegetation, Captain O'Grady \nsummed up his feelings when he yelled to his rescuers, ``I'm ready to \nget the Hell out of here.'' I am confident that was a sentiment that \nwould be shared by anyone else who went through the experience Captain \nO'Grady did.\n  Six days in the woods, hiding from enemy soldiers and surviving on \nthings that you or I would rake up out of our garden or spray to \nexterminate is certainly an amazing feat. It is primarily thanks to the \nskills and knowledge that Captain O'Grady learned through Air Force \nescape and evasion training that he was able to come through this \nexperience alive and unharmed.\n  At every step of Captain O'Grady's 6 day ordeal, training was key. It \nwas training that allowed Captain O'Grady to beat the Serbs in a high-\nstakes match of hide and seek; it was training that taught Captain \nO'Grady how to survive the elements with only the clothes he wore when \nhe ejected from his plane; and it was training in tactical operations \nthat allowed the U.S. Marines to fly into hostile territory and pull \nCaptain O'Grady out of the reach of the Bosnian Serbs. If nothing else, \nthis ordeal has hammered home the maxim ``train hard in peace to avoid \nmistakes in combat.''\n  Mr. President, let me change tack just for a moment to praise the \nefforts of all the individuals involved in this rescue operation, \nespecially those of the U.S. Marines. Though each of the services have \ntheir own special operations forces, each with their important and \nvital missions, the Marines have once again demonstrated their worth as \na force capable of going anywhere at anytime. I have no doubt that \nCaptain O'Grady now has a special understanding of just what exactly \nthe phrase, ``The Marines have landed,'' means.\n  In many ways, what has transpired over the last week is a testament \nto the investment the United States has made in its Armed Forces, \nbeginning about 15 years ago. Captain O'Grady's survival efforts were \naided by the fact that he wore clothing designed to help withstand the \nharshest elements and he carried sophisticated communications and \nhoming equipment that aided those searching for the captain in finding \nhim. Had O'Grady actually had to defend himself against the enemy, he \nwas carrying a modern sidearm that packs more than a dozen rounds in \nits magazine, a far cry from the .38 pistol that pilots of just a \ngeneration ago relied on as a survival and defense tool. Perhaps most \nimpressive is that with a minimal amount of preparation and planning \ntime, a rescue operation was mounted that required the combined efforts \nof at least the Marines, Navy, and Air Force. Such interservice \ncooperation and efficiency was not in existence just 12 years ago when \nthe United States intervened in Grenada.\n  Regrettably, all the things that we have worked so hard to achieve--a \nprofessional, well educated, well equipped military--that worked so \nwell in Panama, Desert Storm, and now in Bosnia, are being threatened \nby those who would cut the defense budget. This is simply unacceptable, \nthe United States needs a strong military that is ready and capable of \nmeeting any enemy, anytime, anywhere.\n  Let us hope that there is one more happy circumstance to come out of \nCaptain O'Grady's survival and rescue--that President Clinton realizes \nwe must keep defense spending at a level which ensures we maintain the \nbest military forces ever known to man. That is the only appropriate \ncourse of action for our Nation to pursue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8200-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8201-S8203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I noted with interest an article in the June \n7th issue of the Washington Times entitled ``GOP Puts Line-Item Veto on \nSlow Track.''\n  The first paragraph of the article reads as follows:\n\n       Republicans are waiting until fall to enact a line-item \n     veto out of concern that President Clinton might try to use \n     it as leverage to reshape the GOP's tax-cut and balanced \n     budget legislation.\n\n  As Senators might expect, I was amazed to learn that apparently some \nRepublicans, who have so often in the past urged the Senate to enact a \nline-item veto, have now decided to withhold its enactment until after \nCongress completes work on a tax cut and balanced-budget legislation. \nIn other words, the Republican plan is apparently to hold off on final \npassage of the line-item veto until after completion of congressional \naction on this year's massive reconciliation bill, which will contain \nchanges in entitlement spending, and on the 13 annual appropriation \nbills for fiscal year 1996, which will total around $540 billion; and, \nif the Republicans have their way, on a major tax cut for the Nation's \nwealthiest individuals and corporations.\n  The article then quotes two of the Senate's leading proponents of \nline-item veto as to why it is that Republicans want to deny this \ndeficit-reducing tool to President Clinton.\n  ``There is a great concern in the Senate. We see this as a once-in-a-\ngeneration opportunity to put forward a balanced budget. We would hate \nto have it threatened for political reasons,'' said one Republican \nSenator.\n  Lo, and behold, we have here a direct quote from a Republican Senator \nwhich tells us, in effect, that if President Clinton is given the \nauthority to line out items in appropriation and tax bills, he might \nuse that authority to threaten these Republican bills ``for political \nreasons.'' Can you imagine that?\n  The quote goes on to tell us that,\n       There is a concern that the veto might be used not for its \n     intended purpose, which is to delete extraneous pork-barrel \n     spending from appropriations bills, but used instead to \n     redefine the meaning of tax cuts.\n  The Senator who has been quoted has put his finger on a problem which \nI have pointed out to the Senate on a number of occasions in the past; \nnamely, that Presidents will invariably use the line-item veto to \naffect policy. They will line out items and language in bills which do \nnot comport with their policies and, in so doing, will be able to \ndelete such items from tax, appropriation, and other measures. Under \nboth the House-passed enhanced rescissions bill and the Senate-passed \nseparate enrollment bill, Congress will then have the burden of \nreenacting items which a President rejects, by a two-thirds vote of \nboth Houses.\n  The fact that the quoted Senator believes that this authority should \nonly be used for its intended purpose, which, in his words, ``is to \ndelete extraneous pork-barrel spending from appropriations bills'' is \nof no consequence. Once we give any President--not just this President \nbut including this President--such authority, it will be used by that \nPresident to its fullest extent in ways that will thwart the will of \nCongress and will enhance that President's agenda. This is precisely \nthe reason why I have so strenuously opposed both enhanced rescissions \nand item veto bills, such as the Senate-passed separate enrollment \nbill.\n  The Washington Times article gives further support to my concerns by \nquoting another Senator as follows:\n\n       Many don't want the line-item veto because it represents \n     the biggest shift of power in this century.\n\n  Indeed it does, Mr. President. Precisely. And to give to any \nPresident--any President--such a massive increase in authority over \nspending bills would be a grave mistake. The system of checks and \nbalances and the separation of powers set forth in the Constitution \nhave proved over and over again the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. \nThere is no compelling case to overturn their judgment by handing over \nto the Executive the power to excise items from appropriations bills, \nand, in so doing, require a two-thirds override vote of both Houses in \norder to secure spending decisions approved by Congress.\n  This is not to say that there are not improvements that could be made \nin the existing rescissions process. We could, for example, enact \nlegislation that will ensure that Presidents get a vote on their \nproposed rescissions. We should also broaden the rescission process to \ninclude not only appropriations spending, but all spending, whether it \nis contained in tax bills, or in entitlement legislation. Surely all \nSenators know by now that the major cause of the deficits is not the \nappropriations bills. It is the growth in tax expenditures and in \nentitlement spending. That is what has to be cut if we are to have any \nreal chance of balancing the Federal budget. And yet, nothing in any \nline-item veto or enhanced rescissions or expedited rescissions or \nseparate enrollment bills would contain the growth in entitlements. \nFurthermore, and just as importantly, nothing in any of these quick \nfixes would cut one thin dime from the more than $450 billion in tax \nbreaks that are already in the Tax Code--many of them have been there \nfor decades--and which will continue to exist and to grow until we have \nthe courage to reexamine each of them, and to cut back and eliminate \nthose which no longer can be justified.\n  I can certainly understand why any President would want line-item \nveto authority. It gives a President a club which he can wield to beat \nMembers of Congress into submission in support of administration \npolicies. Therein lies the danger in the power shift that is talked \nabout in the Washington Times article.\n  Be that as it may, developments in the line-item veto saga have \ncertainly taken a strange turn in recent days. On May 8, 1995, \nPresident Clinton wrote to the Speaker of the House urging that \nCongress quickly complete work on the line-item veto legislation, and \nespecially citing the need for the ``* * * authority to eliminate \nspecial interest provisions, such as the tax benefits that were \ntargeted to individual businesses earlier this year in H.R. 831.'' The \nPresident was apparently referring to a provision of that bill which \nenabled a very wealthy individual, Rupert Murdoch, to sell a television \nstation to a minority-owned firm and to defer paying any capital gains \ntaxes on that sale.\n  More recently in the debate on the budget resolution, we heard a lot \nof sound and fury from the White House about the unfairness of savaging \nMedicare and Medicaid while building in tax breaks for the rich in the \nname of deficit reduction.\n  Lo, and behold, just last week, I was provided with a copy of a \nletter dated June 7, 1995, wherein the President pledges to the Senate \nmajority leader that he will not use the line-item veto authority on \ntax expenditures in this year's budget.\n  Apparently, suddenly those tax breaks for the wealthy, that we have \nheard so much about, are really not so unfair after all--at least not \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely dismayed with this sudden reversal by \nthe White House.\n  A 180-degree turn of this sort by the White House on matters which \nare purported to be of utmost importance to the Democratic Party and to \nthe American people in terms of fairness, good policy, and deficit \nreduction should leave all thinking Members of Congress and the public \nwondering just why this administration is willing to make such an \noutrageous pledge in order to get this new item veto authority in its \nHouse-passed form.\n  What is suddenly so sacrosanct about tax expenditures? Why in the \nworld would this President make such an unwise and damaging\n pledge to the majority leader of the Senate?\n\n  This President campaigned on the need to beef up infrastructure. What \nis infrastructure? It comes from that portion of the budget which is \ncalled non-defense discretionary spending and it is contained in annual \nappropriations acts. It is that portion of the budget which funds not \nonly roads, bridges, airports, sewer projects, water projects, and all \nthe things that keep American commerce flowing, and promotes the well-\nbeing of communities and individuals.\n  It is also education. It is all the investments we make in our own \npeople. Let us remember that this President just vetoed a rescissions \nbill because education funding, he said, was cut too much. Now we have \nthis preposterous [[Page S8202]] pledge by the White House, by the \nPresident, to use the line-item veto only to cut spending and not to \neliminate tax giveaways to the rich. And one can only assume that the \nPresident is referring to domestic discretionary spending, since he has \nruled Pentagon spending completely out of bounds, off limits and to be \nsacred from the budget knife. I see that the President has even \nreferred to all congressional spending as ``pork'' in his unfortunate \nletter to the majority leader. Apparently there is not one single \nmorsel of ``pork'' in the military budget, even though a Washington \nPost story of a few weeks ago reported gross waste, mismanagement, and \nextreme sloppiness at the Pentagon in handling the people's tax \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, over the past 15 years, with the exception of 3 years \nfollowing the 1990 budget summit, the discretionary portion of the \nFederal budget has suffered drastic cuts. Yet, under the budget \nresolution which recently passed the Senate, non-defense discretionary \nspending will be further decimated. In fact, under the Senate-passed \nbudget resolution, non-defense discretionary spending over the next 7 \nyears will be cut $190 billion below a 1995 freeze; that is the \nequivalent of a $300 billion cut below the levels in the President's \nbudget. By the year 2002, nondefense discretionary spending will have \nbeen cut by nearly one-third, declining to 2.5 percent of GDP, a record \nlow. Surely the President understands that this will mean that we will \nhave no option but to cut infrastructure spending in all areas and cut \nit to the bone. Whether it is education, child care, veterans benefits, \nenvironmental cleanup, transportation infrastructure, or any other \ninfrastructure investments--they will all--all--suffer wholesale cuts. \nCertainly these vital investments in our own people cannot all be \nsimply labeled as ``pork'' and put on the chopping block to protect tax \ngoodies for the rich.\n  Tax expenditures can certainly be branded with the ``pork'' label as \nwell. In many cases, tax loopholes are nothing more than ``pork'' for \nthe rich. And to make matters worse, each tax break for the well-to-do \nmeans that other Americans must pay a little more in taxes to make up \nthe lost revenue. Furthermore, every time we give the wealthy \nindividuals or the big corporations a tax break, infrastructure \ninvestments that benefit us all have to be cut in order to meet deficit \nreduction targets.\n  How can the President capitulate on the matter of tax expenditures \nafter a debate like the one we just had on the budget resolution which \nhighlighted the unfairness of granting tax breaks at the expense of \nMedicare as a national policy? What could possibly be the motive behind \nsuch a direct flip-flop by this administration? I submit that it could \nonly be a burning desire to get the line item veto authority, and \nespecially the authority to cut, to use as a weapon to gain political \nadvantage.\n  To all Members of Congress regardless of party, I say, read the tea \nleaves and know that we are about to make a fundamental, monumental \nmistake by giving this President, or any President, line-item veto in \nthe form in which the House has passed it. It would be an evisceration \nof the people's power through their elected representatives. It would \nbe a violation of our oath of office to support and defend this \nConstitution. It would be a world-class blunder and a colossal mistake.\n  Mr. President, it is not too late for the Senate to come to its \nsenses and to realize the vastness of the mistake it will make should \nit agree to the enactment of any legislation to give a President the \nability to veto spending items and, thereby, to require a two-thirds \nsupermajority of both Houses to ensure that Congress' spending \ndecisions are carried out. If we do so, I fear that we will have \nstarted down an inexorable path that will ultimately lead to the \ndestruction of our Republican system of government which our \nforefathers so wisely and carefully crafted for this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record, and such other material as I will \nsupply.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 7, 1995]\n\n                 GOP Puts Line-Item Veto on Slow Track\n\n                           (By Patrice Hill)\n\n       Republicans are waiting until fall to enact a line-item \n     veto out of concern that President Clinton might try to use \n     it as leverage to reshape the GOP's tax-cut and balanced-\n     budget legislation.\n       ``There is a great concern in the Senate. We see this as a \n     once-in-a-generation opportunity to put forward a balanced \n     budget. We would hate to have it threatened for political \n     reasons,'' said Sen. Daniel R. Coats, Indiana Republican and \n     co-author of the Senate version of the line-item veto bill.\n       ``This year is unique,'' Mr. Coats said, because of the \n     extraordinary number of major tax and spending overhaul bills \n     going through Congress, including the House's $354 billion \n     tax-cut bill, $540 billion in appropriation bills and about \n     $650 billion in bills reforming Medicare, Medicaid, welfare \n     and other entitlement programs.\n       ``There is a concern that the veto might be used not for \n     its intended purpose, which is to delete extraneous pork-\n     barrel spending from appropriations bills, but used instead \n     to redefine the meaning of tax cuts,'' he said.\n       Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican and co-author of the \n     line-item veto proposal, confirmed that Congress will put off \n     the legislation until it completes work on this year's \n     massive balanced-budget legislation.\n       ``Many don't want the line-item veto because it represents \n     the biggest shift of power in this century,'' he said.\n       Their comments were greeted with surprise and dismay at the \n     White House and by some House Republicans, who in January \n     listed the line-item veto as one of three top items in their \n     ``Contract With America'' that they hoped to place on Mr. \n     Clinton's desk by his State of the Union address.\n       The House passed its version of the line-item veto on Feb. \n     6, but it got stalled in the Senate, where it was \n     substantially rewritten and did not pass until March 23. \n     House and Senate leaders still have not appointed conferees \n     to iron out the differences between the two versions.\n       Since then, Mr. Clinton has adopted a ``veto strategy'' \n     against key GOP legislation, including Congress' $16.4 \n     billion spending-cut bill, with veiled or explicit veto \n     threats hanging over the House's tax-cut and welfare-reform \n     bills as well.\n       ``I don't agree'' that line-item veto power should be \n     withheld from President Clinton, said Rep. Gerald B.H. \n     Solomon, New York Republican and a House sponsor of the \n     legislation. ``I think whoever the president is, we ought to \n     give him this power.''\n       But he agreed that the legislation should be delayed until \n     fall, contending that time will not permit the House and \n     Senate to resolve their differences now.\n       ``Perhaps the best thing is to wait until fall when the \n     budget is finished. There is no sense in going through it \n     now,'' he said. ``They don't have the votes in the Senate for \n     the House bill, and we won't accept their watered-down \n     version.''\n       One White House official said Republican leaders are \n     reneging on their promise to pass the bill.\n       ``We have taken it on good faith that the congressional \n     leadership wanted to pass line-item veto legislation so it \n     could be used as soon as possible,'' the official said. \n     ``It's hard to believe that supporters of the line-item veto \n     are saying it makes sense for every president but a \n     Democratic president.. . . [The Republicans are] delaying the \n     bill for partisan reasons.''\n       ``They must be planning a lot of tax loopholes,'' said Sen. \n     Bill Bradley, New Jersey Democrat. He says he supports the \n     line-item veto because ``the one thing it does is allow the \n     President to shine the light on something that's \n     indefensible.''\n       In a letter last month urging House and Senate leaders to \n     move quickly on the legislation, Mr. Clinton cited tax breaks \n     for minority-owned broadcasters as the kind of special-\n     interest tax item he would target for a veto. ``The job is \n     not complete until a bill is sent to my desk,'' he wrote.\n       Mr. Clinton's emphasis on using the veto authority to \n     eliminate tax preferences, and his enforcement of the House \n     bill as ``stronger and more workable'' than the Senate bill, \n     many have swayed some in favor of delaying the legislation.\n       Republicans on Capital Hill have been reeling from \n     Democratic charges that they are cutting spending on welfare, \n     Medicaid and other programs benefiting the poor and the \n     middle class to pay for tax cuts that largely help the \n     wealthy.\n       Tony Blankley, spokesman for House Speaker Newt Gingrich, \n     Georgia Republican, denied that Republicans are thinking of \n     delaying the line-item veto because of the differences \n     between the parties on tax and spending priorities.\n       ``We have been moving along on front-burner items. The \n     budget has naturally had precedence,'' Mr. Blankley said, \n     ``My suspicion is we haven't focused on going to closure \n     because we've been focusing on the balanced budget.''\n       He wasn't surprised that some Senators were talking abut \n     delay. ``The natural instinct for the Senate is to delay,'' \n     he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                          Washington, May 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I am writing to urge that Congress \n     quickly complete work on line-item veto legislation so I can \n     use it-- [[Page S8203]] this year--to curb wasteful tax and \n     spending provisions.\n       We must not let another year go by without the President \n     having authority to eliminate special interest provisions, \n     such as the tax benefits that were targeted to individual \n     businesses earlier this year in H.R. 831.\n       I am disappointed that six weeks after the Senate passed \n     its version of line-item veto legislation, neither body has \n     appointed conferees. As you may recall, I commended the House \n     and the Senate last month for passing line-item veto \n     legislation. However, the job is not complete until a bill is \n     sent to my desk that provides strong line-item veto authority \n     that can be used this year.\n       I have consistently urged the Congress to pass the \n     strongest possible line-item veto. While both the House and \n     Senate versions would provide authority to eliminate wasteful \n     spending and tax provisions, the House-passed bill is much \n     stronger--and more workable.\n       I appreciate your making passage of line-item veto \n     legislation a priority. I look forward to working with the \n     Congress to enact the line-item veto quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, June 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am deeply alarmed by today's press \n     report that some Republicans in the House and Senate want to \n     continue to hold back the line-item veto so that I don't have \n     it during this year's budget process. The line-item veto is a \n     vital tool to cut pork from the budget. If this Congress is \n     serious about deficit reduction, it must pass the strongest \n     possible line-item veto immediately, and send it to my desk \n     so I can sign it right away.\n       This is not a partisan issue. Presidents Reagans and Bush \n     asked Congress for it time and again, and so have I. It was \n     part of the Republican Contract with America. It has strong \n     support from members of Congress in both parties and both \n     houses. No matter what party the President belongs to or what \n     party has a majority in Congress, the line-item veto would be \n     good for America.\n       If Congress will send me the line-item veto immediately, I \n     am willing to pledge that this year, I will use it only to \n     cut spending, not on tax expenditures in this year's budget. \n     I have already put you on notice that I will veto any budget \n     that is loaded with excessive tax breaks for the wealthy. But \n     I need the line-item veto now to hold the line against pork \n     in every bill the Congress sends me.\n       The American people have waited long enough. Congress \n     should give them and the Presidency the line-item veto \n     without further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Washington be given 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In addition to the Senator from California's 7 \nminutes?\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n7 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8201-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8203-S8204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as my mother always told me when I was \ngrowing up--as a matter of fact, until I was very grown up--if you have \nyour health you have everything. She said you can face anything, \nwhatever the problem, if you have your health. You can handle it, and \nyou can give it your best. I do not think that anyone disagrees with \nthat, and I think it applies to our country as well. Clearly, if we, as \nAmericans, live longer with a better quality of life, if we have \nchildren who are born healthy, who are born wanted, who are born loved, \nif our work force is healthy, we are more productive and our people can \ntruly enjoy the blessings of liberty.\n  I do not think there would be much argument with that, even in this \nSenate where we argue about everything. I really do believe people \nwould agree with that. If America is healthier, America is stronger, \nmore productive.\n  So let us for the sake of debate agree on that point and move on. And \nI would think if we were to agree on that point, we would agree that it \nis time to vote on the Surgeon General, that it would be a good idea to \nconfirm the one person who really is charged with guarding the Nation's \nhealth. That person is Dr. Henry Foster, President Clinton's nominee \nfor Surgeon General. Dr. Henry Foster was nominated by President \nClinton on February 2. He sent the nomination formally to the Senate on \nFebruary 28. On May 2 and May 3, the hearings on Dr. Foster's \nnomination were held in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nand on May 26 the committee favorably reported out the nomination by a \nvote of 9 to 7. Now it is June 13. This man was sent forward in \nFebruary. It is June 13. We do not have a Surgeon General. We do not \nhave a No. 1 doctor looking out for the health of this the greatest \nNation of all. It is time to bring the nomination forward.\n  I do wish the majority leader were on the floor now because I had \nplanned to ask him what his plans are for bringing the nomination \nforward. There have been some confusing signals. Sometimes I think it \nis going to come forward, and sometimes I am not so sure.\n  Dr. Henry Foster deserves a vote. It is the American way. We believe \nin fairness in our Nation. The bar was set very high for Dr. Foster. \nWhy? Because he is an OB-GYN, an obstetrician/ gynecologist and, \ntherefore, yes, he has treated his patients as a good doctor would in \nthis country, respecting their right to choose, guaranteeing their \nhealth, bringing thousands of babies into the world. And, yes, a very \nsmall percent of his practice involved a woman's right to choose.\n  Are we going to punish him because he is an OB-GYN? Are we going to \nbe afraid of a few in this country who have tried to destroy Dr. \nFoster? This is the time to stand up and be counted. Whether you are \nfor a woman's right to choose or not, you do not punish a fine man like \nthis who has brought thousands of babies into the world, who has helped \ncountless people, many too poor to afford to pay.\n  Now, the majority leader sent out a proposed schedule from May to \nAugust. I have it here. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Proposed Schedule, May-August 4\n\n\n                                  may\n\n       Budget resolution.\n       Supplemental--Rescission conference report.\n       Anti-terrorism bill.\n\n\n                                  june\n\n       Telecommunications.\n       Welfare reform.\n       Regulatory reform.\n       Defense authorization.\n       Foreign operations authorization.\n       State reorganization/reauthorization.\n       Gift ban.\n       Appropriations--as available.\n       [Term Limits?].\n\n\n                                  july\n\n       Reconciliation.\n       Farm bill.\n       Crime bill.\n       Securities litigation reform.\n       Highway bill/Davis-Bacon repeal.\n       Appropriations--as available.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have many things that we have to do, and they are all \nvery important. But, my goodness, May, June, July, and nothing here \nabout a vote on Dr. Foster. Are things so wonderful in our Nation in \nterms of our health that we can afford to go without a Surgeon General? \nI think my friend from Washington, immediately following my remarks, is \ngoing to show the problems that we face in this Nation in terms of our \nhealth.\n  Have we solved the problem of teen pregnancy--the epidemic, I should \nsay, of teen pregnancy? Clearly not. Have we solved the problem of the \nresurgence of tuberculosis? Clearly not. Have we solved the problem of \nthe AIDS epidemic? Alzheimer's? Lung cancer? Breast cancer? \nParkinson's? Ovarian cancer? Heart disease? I am just naming a few.\n  Clearly, we have not solved those problems. In many of those areas, \nthey are getting worse. And we deserve a Surgeon General to look after \nthose problems day after day and hour after hour.\n  We face thousands of issues, you and I, Mr. President, from parks and \nopen space to flood control to crime to foreign policy. The Surgeon \nGeneral will look after the health of America 24 hours a day. We have a \nman who is up to the job and has shown his courage and his leadership. \nStanding up to the harshest and most unfair attacks, he came out of the \ncommittee on a 9-to-7 vote.\n  Why are we not taking up this nomination? I will tell you why. It is \npolitics. It is Presidential politics. And that is wrong. We have lots \nof time for that. We have terrific candidates, and [[Page S8204]] we \nhave a great President, and it is going to be a great campaign, but we \nshould not bring it to this floor and hold up the nomination of the \nSurgeon General because everyone is going after some block of voters to \nprove that they can be more antichoice than the next candidate. That is \nwrong. A woman has a right to choose in this country.\n  The fact is we have a Surgeon General nominee who has the greatest \nrecord in stopping teen pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, there are those who say: What does the Surgeon General \ndo anyway? I am going to go through a little of this, and if my time \nruns out, I will be back tomorrow. I am going to be back every day, \nevery day, asking where is this nomination. It is not the American way \nto keep a kind and decent man waiting like this since February. We have \nhad Surgeon Generals who have done some incredibly important things in \nterms of the fight against smoking, syphilis, AIDS--it goes on. I will \nsave that for another time.\n  So in my remaining moments here, Mr. President, I will summarize in \nthis way. There is no reason not to schedule this vote. This man passed \nout of the committee on a 9-to-7 vote. He is fully qualified. He has \nmet every test. And, yes, he is an OB-GYN. And I say to my friends, it \nis about time we had someone with that kind of experience of bringing \nbabies into the world and taking care of women's health in the position \nof Surgeon General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8203-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE CLOCK IS TICKING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I, too, today rise to urge the majority \nleader to bring the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, Jr., for U.S. \nSurgeon General to the Senate floor for a vote.\n  I am very excited about the nomination of Dr. Foster to be U.S. \nSurgeon General. Dr. Foster is an OB-GYN, and I appreciate the \nimportance of his practice area to families and children. For far too \nlong in this Nation, women's health concerns have been neglected by our \nGovernment. One example tells a whole story.\n  A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute study of 22,000 \nphysicians begun in 1981 found that men who took aspirin every other \nday reduced their incidence of heart attacks. The Institute claimed \nthat women were not included in the study because to do so would have \nincreased the cost. As a result, today we do not know whether this \nprevention strategy would help women, harm them, or have no effect.\n  Gender equity in medical research has received increased attention \nover the past few years. We no longer will tolerate a Government-funded \nheart disease study which includes 22,000 men and excludes women \naltogether. Given that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, we \nexpect women to be included in clinical trials.\n  We still have a long way to go. Women are the fastest growing \ndemographic group among those diagnosed with HIV. We suffer from \nclinical depression at rates twice that of men. And we frequently are \nthe victims of domestic violence.\n  It is imperative that the leading public health official in our \nNation be a forceful spokesperson on these issues.\n  Everyone agrees we need to reduce teen pregnancy because it is a \nnational priority. We need a Surgeon General who understands the link \nbetween sexual abuse, adolescent pregnancy, and building self-esteem \namong at-risk youth.\n  Dr. Foster has experience in reducing teen pregnancy. His ``I Have a \nFuture'' program was named a ``Point of Light'' by President Bush \nbecause of its pioneering work. Dr. Foster has successfully \ndemonstrated his ideas about public health strategies that can greatly \nbenefit our Nation. He has focused not only on preventing teen \npregnancy but on preventing drug abuse, reducing infant mortality and \nending smoking by children. He is a physician with vision, and he is a \ncaring and honorable man.\n  When I first met with him a few months ago, he mentioned the opening \nlecture he gives to medical students. He spoke passionately about the \nimportance of obstetrics and gynecology. He told me he reminds new OB-\nGYN's that without their work there would be no art or architecture; \nwithout healthy women and children there would be nothing.\n  Some politicians would have the Senate exclude Dr. Foster from \nconsideration because he has performed abortions. I disagree. Abortion \nshould not be the determining factor in the selection of a Surgeon \nGeneral. Let us not tolerate the disqualification of this candidate \nbecause of his basic practice area. Dr. Foster has dedicated his life \nto women's health, the welfare of children, and the well-being of \nfamilies.\n  Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. Dr. Joycelyn Elders resigned her \npost, as was stated, on December 9, 1994. This nomination was sent to \nthe Senate on February 2, the nomination papers were filed February 28, \nand the committee voted this out on May 26, 1995. Our Nation has now \ngone 6 months without a Surgeon General, and the clock is ticking.\n  Every 15 seconds a woman is battered. And that is not all. Let me \nshare with my colleagues that the clock is ticking and every 59 seconds \na baby is born to a teen mother. Every year, alcohol causes the death \nof nearly 20,000 Americans. Every 17 minutes, AIDS takes another \nAmerican life. Every year, over 144,000 Americans will suffer a stroke. \nWe need a national public health spokesperson, and we need a Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  This year alone, 95,400 men will die of lung cancer; 62,000 women \nwill die of lung cancer; 51,000 Americans will die of AIDS; 46,000 \nwomen will die of breast cancer; 40,000 men will die of prostate \ncancer; and 14,500 women will die of ovarian cancer.\n  Mr. President, we need a national public health spokesperson. We need \na Surgeon General, and we need a vote in the Chamber of the Senate on \nthe nomination of Surgeon General.\n  I, too, will be back on this floor reminding my colleagues it has \nbeen 6 months and the clock keeps ticking. We want a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8204-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO W.W. ``SON'' WEATHERFORD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, we were greatly saddened on May 24 by the \ndeath of W.W. Weatherford. At 81 years of age, ``Son,'' as he was \nwidely know, had lived a life in which he devoted much of his time and \nenergy to his local community.\n  Son Weatherford served others just by carrying out the activities of \nhis day-to-day life. He ran the family business--the Weatherford Store, \nin Vina, AL, and was a member of the First Baptist Church of \nRussellville, serving as both a deacon and a Sunday School teacher.\n  Son improved his community through the offices he held and the \norganizations to which he belonged. He was probate judge for Franklin \nCounty, eventually becoming president of the Alabama Probate Judges \nAssociation. He was the chairman of the Franklin County, Commission, \npresident of the Alabama Association of County Commissioners, and \nserved as State director of the State Mental Health Board. He fought \nfor his country in World War II and became a member of the American \nVeterans Association and the Red Bay American Legion. Son was also a \nMason and a charter member of the Bear Creek Watershed Association. He \nwas president of the Russellville Chamber of Commerce and was once \nrecognized by that community as its Outstanding Citizen of the Year.\n  W.W. ``Son'' Weatherford will be sorely missed by the people of the \ntown to which he devoted so much of his energy, the family that he \nleaves behind, and all those fortunate enough to have known him over \nthe years. I offer my condolences to his wife, Iva Jo, and their entire \nfamily in the wake of this tremendous loss.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8204-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8204-S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COMDR. ROBERT MEISSNER, USN\n\n  MR. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism of Comdr. Robert M. Meissner, U.S. Navy, \non the occasion of his retirement after 20 years of faithful service to \nour Nation.\n  Today Commander Meissner, a 1975 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, \nis [[Page S8205]] serving his last day of a 12-month assignment as the \nDirector of Senate Affairs for the Secretary of Defense. During this \nand previous assignments over the past decade in the legislative \naffairs offices of the Department of the Navy and the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense [OSD] and in Senator Gramm's office, many of us \nhave come to know Bob Meissner well and he has earned the admiration \nand respect of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Legislative liaison is often a thankless job. Interpreting the \nPentagon to the Congress and the Congress to the Pentagon is certainly \nno easy task. There is a well-known tendency in Washington to shoot \nmessengers of bad tidings. Commander Meissner has had to convey bad \nnews both to Members of Congress and to senior Department of Defense \nofficials on many occasions. The fact that he has survived to his \nretirement, and not only survived, but thrived and continually advanced \nin responsibility, is testament to his grace, skill, honesty, and \nstrong commitment to excellence in carrying out his duties.\n  Commander Meissner also brought a keen sense of humor to the job, \nwhich is probably an essential qualification for any legislative \nliaison officer. I am sure that many of my colleagues would join me in \nsaying that Commander Bob Meissner represents the epitome of the \nPentagon legislative liaison officer and we will miss his contributions \nto our joint effort with the Pentagon to advance our Nation's security.\n  Let me briefly now summarize Commander Meissner's career as a Naval \nofficer.\n  Commander Meissner holds a master's degree in government with \ndistinction, from Georgetown University, and is a graduate of Harvard's \nJohn F. Kennedy School of Government's Senior Officials in National \nSecurity Program. His military experience includes four operational \ncarrier deployments, two with an air antisubmarine squadron and two as \na strike operations officer with the ship's company, a staff assignment \nas aide and executive assistant, post graduate studies, and several \njoint duty staff assignments. He is an antisubmarine warfare mission \ncommander in the S-3A aircraft and qualified as an underway command \nduty officer.\n  In October l983, as the U.S. task force's only on-scene strike \noperations officer, Commander Meissner singularly scheduled and planned \nthe weapons for all Navy tactical combat air missions during the first \n5 days of the successful Grenada Operation Urgent Fury. Two months \nlater he was cited for his extraordinary contribution in the successful \nexecution of the December 1983 retaliatory air strike over Beirut and \nthe Bekaa Valley. In March 1985, Commander Meissner reported to the \nNavy's Office of Legislative Affairs as a Senate liaison officer, where \nhe assisted the Office of the Secretary of the Navy on political and \nlegislative issues before the U.S. Senate. In early 1987, he was \nselected to serve on the Secretary of Defense's Legislative Affairs \nstaff as an Assistant, responsible for weapon systems' procurement \nlegislation.\n  After the U.S.S. Stark was attacked in the Persian Gulf in May 1987, \nCommander Meissner became Secretary of Defense Weinberger's legislative \npoint of contact to Congress on the Kuwaiti reflagging and escort \nissue. Within 9 months, he coordinated over 50 congressional briefings \nand hearings, made 10 trips to the region with 28 Members of Congress, \nand was cited by Congressmen, U.S. State Department officials, and \nMiddle East foreign leaders for his efforts in promoting the \nadministration's successful Persian Gulf policy. He assisted in writing \na section of the Persian Gulf chapter of former Secretary of Defense \nWeinberger's book, Fighting for Peace.\n  In March 1988, he was selected by the Secretary of Navy as the first \nnaval officer to receive a LEGIS congressional fellowship. He was \nassigned to the personal staff of Senator Phil Gramm, then the ranking \nmember on the Armed Services Defense Industry and Technology \nSubcommittee, and served as his senior defense advisor and National \nSecurity Affairs legislative assistant. Upon completion of his \nfellowship, Commander Meissner returned to OSD [Legislative Affairs], \nwhere he assumed the responsibilities of the assistant for research, \ndevelopment, test and evaluation.\n  In June 1990, he was promoted to Director for House Affairs, where he \nprovided direct liaison between the Secretary of Defense and the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. In early 1991, Commander Meissner left the \nOSD staff and reported to the President's General Advisory Committee on \nArms Control and Disarmament as its Executive Director. Commander \nMeissner returned to OSD [Legislative Affairs] in January 1993 and \nassumed responsibility for the Research and Technology legislative \nportfolio with particular emphasis on representing the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency [ARPA] and the administration's dual-use and \ntechnology reinvestment programs.\n  In May 1994, Commander Meissner assumed his current position as the \nDirector of Senate Affairs for the Department of Defense. Commander \nMeissner has lectured at the Naval Postgraduate School and the Defense \nSystem's Management College on civil-military affairs and congressional \nrelations.\n  His military awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the \nDefense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Navy Commendation Medal [fourth award], and several unit \ncommendations, expeditionary, and service ribbons. Bob is married and \nresides with his wife, Denise, in Falls Church, VA.\n  Our Nation, the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense as a whole, and \nespecially his wife, Denise, can truly be proud of Commander Meissner's \nmany accomplishments. A man of his extraordinary talent and integrity \nis rare indeed. While his honorable service will be genuinely missed in \nthe Department of Defense and here in the Senate, it gives me great \npleasure to recognize Comdr. Bob Meissner before my colleagues and send \nhim all of our best wishes in his new and exciting career.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8204-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

MICHAEL V. HARPER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the career and \naccomplishments of Col. Michael V. Harper, who is retiring after 26 \nyears of distinguished service to the Army and the Nation.\n  Colonel Harper began his career as a Distinguished Military Graduate \nwhen [[Page S8206]] he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute \nin 1969 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry. In the \nmonths following his graduation from Infantry Officers Basic School, \nLieutenant Harper earned two of the Army's most cherished qualification \nbadges, airborne wings and a Ranger tab. After a tour with America's \nfamed Honor Guard, the 82d Airborne Division, Colonel Harper was \nordered to the Republic of Vietnam where he was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion (Airmobile), 327th Infantry, setting in motion a career that \nwould bring him many commands and responsibilities.\n  Among his many assignments over the next two decades, the colonel \nserved as: commander, A Company, 18th Infantry; Executive Officer, 1st \nBattalion (Mechanized) 36th Infantry at Friedberg, Federal Republic of \nGermany; and, he commanded the 2d Battalion (Mechanized), 16th Infantry \nat Fort Riley, KS. In addition to his troop leading time, Colonel \nHarper attended the Command and General Staff College and the Naval War \nCollege; served as a staff officer and Chief of the War Plans Division; \nand finally, as Director of the Chief of Staff of the Army's personal \nstaff group. In his capacity as General Sullivan's staff director, \nColonel Harper helped the Chief of Staff transform the Army from a Cold \nWar, forward deployed force into a power projection force ready to \ndefend the Nation anywhere. Colonel Harper's keen insight, sound \njudgment, and able intellect have made a lasting contribution to the \nfuture of the Army and the continued security of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, Colonel Harper has been a model soldier throughout his \ncareer. He embodies the traits that the military expects of those who \nchoose to serve: integrity; loyalty, selfless service: and, concern for \nsoldiers. He is a man who has served the Nation well and he has our \nappreciation for his dedication and sacrifices over the past 26 years, \nI join his friends and colleagues in wishing him good health and great \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8205-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 652, the telecommunications \nbill, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 652) to provide for a procompetitive, \n     deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Dorgan modified amendment No. 1264, to require \n     Department of Justice approval for regional Bell operating \n     company entry into long distance services, based on the \n     VIII(c) standard.\n       (2) Thurmond modified amendment No. 1265 (to amendment No. \n     1264) to provide for the review by the Attorney General of \n     the United States of the entry of the Bell operating \n     companies into interexchange telecommunications and \n     manufacturing markets.\n       Subsequently, the amendment was modified further.\n       (3) Feinstein-Kempthorne amendment No. 1270, to strike the \n     authority of the Federal Communications Commission to preempt \n     State or local regulations that establish barriers to entry \n     for interstate or intrastate telecommunications services.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Mississippi \nis waiting to speak, and I have some business to take care of, which we \nare going to make some corrections on. I urge all my colleagues to \nbring their amendments to the floor. We are trying to move this bill \nforward. We are trying to get agreement on a lot of the amendments, and \nwe are working feverishly on several amendments that we hope we can get \nagreements on. Those Senators who wish to speak or offer amendments, I \nhope they will bring them to the floor.\n  We do have the vote on the underlying Dorgan amendment at 12:30 p.m. \nand we will be looking forward to having several stacked votes later in \nthe afternoon.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1265, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the Dorgan-\nThurmond amendment that would put the Department of Justice into the \nmiddle of this telecommunications entry question. This issue really is \nbeing pushed primarily by the Department of Justice but, of course, a \nnumber of long distance companies are very much interested in it, and \nthey are asking that the Justice Department be given a decisionmaking \nrole in the process of reviewing applications for the Bell company \nentry into the long distance telephone service.\n  A grant of that type of authority to the Justice Department, in my \nopinion, is unprecedented. It goes far beyond the historical \nresponsibility of Justice. It is a significant expansion of the \nDepartment's current authority under the MFJ, and it raises \nconstitutional questions of due process and separation of powers. In \nshort, I think it is a bad idea.\n  Who among us thinks that after all the other things that we have put \nin this telecommunications bill that we should have one more extremely \nhigh hurdle, and that is the Antitrust Division of the Justice \nDepartment, which would clearly complicate and certainly delay the very \ndelicately balanced entry arrangement that is included in this bill, \nand that is the purpose of the amendment. It is one more dilatory \nhurdle that should not be included.\n  The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has one duty, and \nthat is to enforce the antitrust laws, primarily the Sherman and \nClayton Acts. It has never had a decisionmaking role in connection with \nregulated industries. The Department has always been required to \ninitiate a lawsuit in the event it concluded that the antitrust laws \nhad been violated. It has no power to disapprove transactions or issue \norders on its own.\n  While the U.S. district court has used the Department of Justice to \nreview requests for waivers of the MFJ, the Department has no \nindependent decisionmaking authority. That authority remains with the \ncourts. In transportation, in energy, in financial services and other \nregulated businesses, Congress has delegated decisionmaking authority \nfor approval of transactions that could have competitive implications \nwith the agency of expertise; in this case, the FCC.\n  The Congress has typically directed the agency to consider factors \nbroader than simply the impact upon competition in making \ndeterminations. This approach has worked well. Why do we want to change \nit? It contrasts with the role Justice seeks with regard to \ntelecommunications and the telephone entry. Telecommunications is not \nthe only industrial sector to have a specific group at the Justice \nDepartment. It has antitrust activity in a transportation, energy and \nagriculture section, a computers and finance section, a foreign \ncommerce section and a professions and intellectual property section.\n  The size of the staff devoted to some of these sections is roughly \nequivalent to that devoted to telecommunications and, I might add, it \nis too many in every case. If we want to do a favor to the American \npeople, we should move half the lawyers in the Justice Department out \nof the city and put them out in the real world where they belong, \nworking in the U.S. attorneys' offices fighting real crime. But, no, we \nhave them piled up over in these various sections and, in many cases, \nin my opinion, not being helpful; in fact, being harmful.\n  If the Department has special expertise in telecommunications such \nthat it should be given a decisionmaking role in the regulatory \nprocess, does it not also have a special expertise in other fields as \nwell? Today's computer, financial services, transportation, energy and \ntelecommunications industries are far too complex and too important to \nour Nation's economy to elevate antitrust policy above all other \nconsiderations in regulatory decisions.\n  The Justice Department, in requesting a decisionmaking role in \nreviewing Bell company applications, for entry into long distance \ntelephone service, seeks to assume for itself the role currently \nperformed by U.S. District [[Page S8207]] Judge Harold Greene. It does \nso without defining by whom and under what standards its actions should \nbe reviewed.\n  Typically, as a prosecutorial law enforcement agency, actions by the \nDepartment of Justice have largely been free of judicial review. In \nthis case, the Department also seeks a decisionmaking role. As a \ndecisionmaker, would the Antitrust Division's determinations be subject \nto the procedural protections and administrative due process safeguards \nof the Administrative Procedures Act? I do not know what the answer is \nto that question, but it is an important one.\n  What does this do to the Department's ability to function as a \nprosecutorial agency? Should one agency be both prosecutor and \ntribunal? That is what they are trying to do here. This is a power \ngrab. We should not do this. Congress should reject the idea of giving \nthe Justice Department a decisionmaking role in reviewing Bell company \napplications to enter the long distance telephone business. It is bad \npolicy, bad procedure and clearly a bad precedent.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Exon of Nebraska very eloquently explained \nlast Friday--I believe it was in the afternoon--Congress has passed \nmany deregulation measures--airlines, trucking, railroads, buses, \nnatural gas, banking, and finance. None of those measures was given \nexecutive department coequal status with regulators. What the Justice \nDepartment is seeking here is essentially a front-line role with ad hoc \nveto powers. Justice would be converted from a law enforcement to a \nregulatory agency, and it should not be. They would end up focusing \nchiefly on just this sector of the economy. We just do not need to \ncreate the equivalent of a whole new bureaucracy and regulatory agency \njust for telecommunications.\n  Let us look at the nearly two dozen existing safeguards that are \nalready contemplated and required by this bill. Some people say, ``Wait \na minute, you were looking at some things like this last year,'' the \nVIII(c) test. That was a year ago, and it did not get through. It is a \ndifferent world. The committee has continued to work with all parties \ninvolved, the experts in the field, and we have laboriously come up \nwith what I think is an understandable and fair process to open up \nthese telephone markets.\n  First of all, a comprehensive, competitive checklist with 14 separate \ncompliance points, including interconnection, unbundling, number \nportability. That is the heart of what we would do in the entry test.\n  It also has the requirement that State regulators certify compliance. \nThere is the requirement that the Federal Communications Commission \nmake an affirmative public interest finding. We have already fought \nthis battle. We had an amendment to knock out the public interest \nrequirements and, quite frankly, that was a tough one for me. I really \nunderstand that there is some ambiguity and some concern about what is \nthis public interest test. But we have the hurdle of the checklist, we \nhave the State regulators and we also have the public interest test. So \nthat is three hurdles already.\n  There is the requirement that the Bell companies comply with separate \nsubsidiary requirements. We want some protections, some firewalls, if \nyou will. So there would be this separate subsidiary requirement. There \nis the requirement that the FCC allow for full public comment and \nparticipation, including full participation by the Antitrust Division \nof the Justice Department and all of its various proceedings. They are \nnot excluded, they have a consultative role. They will be involved, but \nthey just are not going to be a regulator under this interest test.\n  There is the requirement that the Bell companies comply with all \nexisting FCC rules and regulations that are already on the books, \nincluding annual attestation, which is very rigorous in its auditing \nprocedures; second, an elaborate cost-accounting manual and procedure; \ncomputer assisted reporting and analysis systems; and all of the \nexisting tariff and pricing rules. There is also still the full \nparticipation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act \nregarding mergers.\n  There is the full application of the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nPrenotification Act, which requires Justice clearance of most \nacquisitions. So Justice will be involved under the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nAct. Also the full application of the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act of the \nCommunications Act, which makes the Antitrust Division automatically an \nindependent party in every FCC common carrier and rulemaking appeal.\n  The approach in this bill was hammered out in the most bipartisan \npossible way, with great effort by the distinguished chairman and the \ndistinguished ranking member, and it involved give and take. It was not \neasy. I think the thing that makes me realize it is probably the best \ntest we can probably have is that nobody is perfectly happy with it. \nEverybody is a little unhappy with it, showing to me that it is \nprobably fair. After all, as I said in my opening speech on this \nsubject, what we are dealing with here is an effort by everybody to get \njust a fair advantage. Everybody just wants a little edge on the other \none. We have tried to say, no, we are going to have a clear \nunderstanding here. Here is the checklist, the public interest tests, \nand all these FCC and Justice Department involvements. This is fair to \nboth sides. And now they want to add one more long jump to the \nprocess--to put the Justice Department in a regulatory role. Big \nmistake. This has strong support on both sides of the aisle. It is not \npartisan whatsoever.\n  Let us use our common sense here. You know, that is a unique thing. \nLet us try to apply some common sense to this law and what we are \ntrying to accomplish. Let us go with the Commerce Committee experts who \ndrafted this bipartisan legislation. There are more than enough \nsafeguards already in this bill and in existing law. Congress is also \ngoing to move this slowly. These changes will not happen overnight. It \nwill take a while. And we will find some points that probably need to \nbe addressed later on. We can still do that.\n  If any competitive challenges arise because the Antitrust Division is \nnot allowed to convert itself into a telecommunications regulatory \nagency, then Congress can come back and revisit the issue. We are not \nfinishing this once and for all.\n  I just want to say that of all the bad ideas I have seen around here \nthis year, the idea that we come in here and put the Justice Department \nin a regulatory role is the worst one I have seen. It attacks the core, \nthe center of this bill. We have addressed the questions of \nbroadcasting and cable and fairness in radio, television, as well as \nthe Bells and the long distance companies. This is a broad, massive \nbill. But the core of it all is the entry test. If we pull that thread \nloose, this whole thing comes undone.\n  Also, I want to say that I am convinced that the leaders of this \ncommittee will continue to move it forward in good faith. If we find \nthere are some problems, or if we find when we get into conference that \nthe House has a better idea on some of these things, there will be give \nand take. But this is the critical amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Dorgan amendment, vote to \ntable the Dorgan amendment, and do not be confused by the Thurmond \nsecond-degree amendment, because it is a smaller version of the Dorgan \namendment. It is the old camel nose under the tent. We should not start \ndown that trail at this point.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi is really analyzing in a most cogent fashion what \ndiscourages this Senator even further. I wondered if the Senator from \nMississippi agrees that it will not only bring in the Department of \nJustice in a regulatory fashion and responsibility, but they actually \neliminate the Federal Communications Commission measuring of market \ncompetition. Listening to the language: ``In making its determination \nwhether the requested authorization is consistent with the public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall not consider \nthe antitrust effects of such authorization in any market for which \nauthorization is sought.''\n  So when they say antitrust, that means competitive effects. They lock \nout the word on competition, but that is the intent. You can see how it \nhas been drawn. ``* * * shall not consider the * * * effects of such \nauthorization'' on competition.\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\n  So they insert the word ``antitrust'' and do not put in \n``competition''. But that is the intent. So where you have the most \nrecent and leading decision here, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Warner \nversus Federal Communications Commission, where they stated right to \nthe point, ``The Commission struck an appropriate balance between the \ncompeting interests of the cable companies and their subscribers,'' \ngiving the good government award to the FCC on measuring market \ncompetition.\n  You see, the thrust of this amendment, where they get this idea, is \nthat somehow the expertise is over in the Department of Justice, and \nnone whatever, no experience or track record whatever in the Federal \nCommunications Commission, which is totally false. They have been doing \nit. I listed numerous competitive initiatives by the FCC in the past 10 \nyears. And right to the point here, when we told them, look, in \nregulating the cable TV folks, find out whether or not effective \ncompetition has developed within the market. Once the market is \npermeated with effective competition, no longer is regulation \nnecessary.\n  So my question is not just the matter of putting the nose of the \ncamel under the tent, he is putting the whole blooming camel in and \ncrowds out the FCC. It said, look, we do not want the FCC measuring \ncompetition and the market. ``Shall not.'' Now, say I am a \ncommunications lawyer, so I read that and I say, the FCC is doing it, \nbut the law says, by the Congress, you have this betwixt and between. \nIt is really confusion. Do you not see it a danger to the fundamental \nauthority and responsibility of the FCC?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely, I think you put your finger right on it. In \nthat amendment, they not only want to add Justice Department, they want \nto supplant the FCC role here. And that, to me, again, as I have said \nin my remarks, is unprecedented. I think that the FCC clearly is an \nagency where the expertise exists. We have tried to make this bill as \nderegulatory and competitive as possible. But as we move toward this \nmore competitive arena, we must have some process to look and see that \nthe requirements of the bill have been met. The FCC is the one that \nshould do that, not the Justice Department. So I thank the former \nchairman for his comments in this regard.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield for a question, my question is, \ndoes this go to the very nature of the role of the Justice Department?\n  It is my understanding that the enabling act that created the \nDepartment of Justice, and the enabling legislation that created the \nAntitrust Subdivision of the Department of Justice, has them as the \nenforcer of antitrust law, and the Justice Department is the enforcer \nof law. They have a prosecutorial capability. And under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, if you go before the FCC, you have \ncertain rights. The FCC has to be open. The FCC gives certain ex parte \nrights. The Justice Department can operate in secret because it is a \nprosecutorial agency. The Administrative Procedures Act does not fully \napply. So the nature of the two agencies is different.\n  But, for the first time, under the Dorgan amendment, we would be \ncreating a regulatory role, permanently. Granted, the district court \njudge, Judge Greene, made a regulatory role for some Justice Department \nlawyers who actually worked for him, by his orders. But this would be \nthe first time as far as our research can find, that the Justice \nDepartment has been given a permanent regulatory decisionmaking role. \nSo does not this go to the very nature of the division of power to the \nvery nature of the Justice Department?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it clearly does. I think it clearly is \nunprecedented. It would give this regulatory authority to an agency \nthat has not been and should not be a regulatory agency. I think there \nis clearly a conflict here.\n  For those who do feel like the Justice Department must be involved, \nfor those on the Judiciary Committee that worry about this sort of \nthing--and I am not one of them, thank goodness, I want to emphasize--\nthis does not take away the existing law.\n  The Justice Department will have a consultant role. They will have \nrights under the antitrust laws. The Sherman Act will still be in \nplace, as the Clayton Act will be in place, the Administrative \nProcedures Act will be in place, the Hobbs will be applicable and the \nHart-Scott-Rodino will be in place. All will be there.\n  The Justice Department will be able to perform its normal role that \nit performs in all other areas where we have moved toward deregulation. \nThat is what their role should be. Not this new added power.\n  Just in conclusion, Mr. President, I urge, again, our colleagues to \nsupport the chairman's motion to table the Dorgan amendment. That will \noccur at 12:30.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If I could ask a quick question of my colleague. The \nJustice Department, under the Hobbs Appeal Act, any time somebody goes \nto the FCC and they get a decision that they do not like and they \nappeal it, the Justice Department can be a party to that right now and \nunder our legislation. So the Justice Department is a very active \nparticipant in every FCC case.\n  In fact, our legislation requires consultation between the FCC and \nthe Attorney General. But aside from that, is it not true that they \nhave an active, aggressive role in what they are supposed to be, the \nlegal agency of the Government, under the Hobbs Act in appeals so they \ncan be involved as an independent party in every appeal? And just the \nthreat of that would be very great, would it not?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly that threat would be very great.\n  Here is my question beyond what the Senator is saying. How would the \nAntitrust Division of the Justice Department handle that Hobbs Civil \nAppeals Act appeal by the Antitrust Division?\n  They are automatically an independent party. However, under this \namendment, they will have already ruled in a regulatory way. How will \nthey do that? How can you rule in a regulatory decision and then be an \nindependent party under the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act? Would they be \nacting against themselves? I do not see how we make that work.\n  I thank my colleague on the committee for the question. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, and if \nother Senators wish to speak, I will yield immediately. If other \nSenators wish to come to the floor to offer amendments or to speak, I \nwill eagerly yield. We are trying to move this bill forward.\n  I know there are some events this morning that have detained some \nSenators, and there is the Les Aspin memorial service this afternoon \nthat will detain some of our Members.\n  We are trying to move the tortuous Senate process forward at a faster \nrate.\n  I want to take a few minutes to discuss yet another example of why \nthe Justice Department should not be given the burden to carry out the \nintent of the amendment offered by Senator Dorgan.\n  I have previously established a clear, unequivocal record. DOJ does \nnot act in a timely manner. Last night I had several charts here \nshowing how the Department, although it was asked to do things within a \n30-day period, has dragged things out over 3 years or more.\n  Additionally and importantly, the Department cannot be trusted to \nenforce the standard of review. Currently, the DOJ and the court, under \nthe MFJ, are to apply an VIII(c) test. That is also the standard in the \nDorgan amendment. The recent Ameritech plan changes the VIII(c) test.\n  Now, the Department has announced a plan to delay new competition in \nlong distance until the Department's blueprint for local telephone \nmarkets has been implemented. The plan is styled as an agreement with \nAmeritech.\n  According to the New York Times, the announcement on Monday is \nclearly timed to coincide with events in Congress. Perhaps most \nimportant from a political standpoint, the Justice Department wants to \npreserve an important role in determining when the Bells should win \nfreedom--this, according to an article by Edmund Andrews in the New \nYork Times, April 2, 1995.\n  I think that goes to the heart of it. The Justice Department is \ntrying to preserve a role here. For the first time in my years up here, \nI see a major Department seeking and demanding a role and lobbying for \nit. That troubles me a great deal.\n  [[Page S8209]] Despite its length and complexity, many key details of \nthe blueprint await further Department review and approval. This is the \nAmeritech agreement. The Department has rushed the announcement prior \nto the completion of the period for public comments on the plan in an \neffort to derail legislation pending in Congress that would limit the \nDepartment's role in regulating the telecommunications industry.\n  I see a colleague has arrived. I will yield to any Senator who has an \namendment or a speech. We are trying to move this bill forward. I am \ndelighted to yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will have an amendment in a minute to bring to the \nfloor. I am very pleased that the Senator from South Dakota, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, solicits a speech from me. It \nis not very often. It must be an ample indication of the boredom that \nhas set in here on the floor.\n  While I am waiting to propose the amendment, I would like to \nreiterate my appreciation for the enormous effort expended by the \nchairman of the committee who has done just a superhuman job of trying \nto shepherd this extremely complex and difficult piece of legislation \nthrough this body.\n  Again, I want to thank him for all of the cooperation and courtesy \nthat he has shown me and other Members of this body as we have gone \nthrough this effort. I hope that there is light at the end of the \ntunnel, to borrow an old Vietnam phrase, that we are nearing the end of \nthe consideration of this very important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1276\n\n    (Purpose: To require a voucher system to provide for payment of \n                           universal service)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1276.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 43, strike out line 2 and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: Act.\n       ``(k) Transition to Alternative Support System.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, beginning 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1995, support payments for universal service under \n     this Act shall occur in accordance with the provisions of \n     subsection (l) rather than any other provisions of this Act.\n       ``(l) Voucher System.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, the \n     Commission shall prescribe regulations to provide for the \n     payment of support payments for universal service through a \n     voucher system under this subsection.\n       ``(2) Individuals eligible to make payments by voucher.--\n     Payment of support payments for universal service by voucher \n     under this subsection may be made only by individuals--\n       ``(A) who are customers of telecommunications carriers \n     described in paragraph (3); and\n       ``(B) whose income in the preceding year was an amount \n     equal to or less than the amount equal to 200 percent of the \n     poverty level for that year.\n       ``(3) Carriers eligible to receive vouchers.--\n     Telecommunications carriers eligible to receive support \n     payments for universal service by voucher under this \n     subsection are telecommunications carriers designated as \n     essential telecommunications carriers in accordance with \n     subsection (f).\n       ``(4) Vouchers.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Commission shall provide in the \n     regulations under this subsection for the distribution to \n     individuals described in paragraph (2) of vouchers that may \n     be used by such individuals as payment for telecommunications \n     services received by such individuals from telecommunications \n     carriers described in paragraph (3).\n       ``(B) Value of vouchers.--The Commission shall determine \n     the value of vouchers distributed under this paragraph.\n       ``(C) Use of vouchers.--Individuals to whom vouchers are \n     distributed under this paragraph may utilize such vouchers as \n     payment for the charges for telecommunications services that \n     are imposed on such persons by telecommunications carriers \n     referred to in subparagraph (A).\n       ``(D) Acceptance of vouchers.--Each telecommunications \n     carrier referred to in subparagraph (A) shall accept vouchers \n     under this paragraph as payment for charges for \n     telecommunications services that are imposed by the \n     telecommunications carrier on individuals described in \n     paragraph (2).\n       ``(E) Reimbursement.--The Commission shall, upon submittal \n     of vouchers by a telecommunications carrier, reimburse the \n     telecommunications carrier in an amount equal to the value of \n     the vouchers submitted. Amounts necessary for reimbursements \n     under this subparagraph shall be derived from contributions \n     for universal support under subsection (c).''.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at the outset, I have no illusions about \nthe ability to adopt this amendment. I do not think it will be adopted. \nI do, however, think that it is a defining issue in how we view the \nrole of Government and the role of our regulatory bodies.\n  In an attempt to deregulate telecommunications in America, and I \nthink it is a defining issue very frankly, in whether we want to \ncontinue the complex, myriad, incomprehensible method that we are using \ntoday to try to attempt to provide access by all Americans to \ntelecommunications facility.\n  Right now, I do not know of anyone who knows how we subsidize, \nexactly, people who are in need of the basic telecommunications \nservices in this country. This amendment would make it very clear and \nvery simple. It would be the provision of vouchers for those who need \nthose services. It would replace the current telecommunications subsidy \nscheme.\n  Mr. President, both the current system and that envisioned by the \npending legislation mandates subsidy flows from company to company. As \none former council to the FCC stated, ``From one rich person to another \nrich person.''\n  This amendment would fundamentally change that system.\n  Sixty-one years ago, the Congress passed the Communications Act of \n1934. The Act mandated that every American, regardless of where they \nlived, receive basic telephone service at approximately the same rate. \nTherefore, individuals whether they live in urban America or rural \nAmerica would pay the same rate for telephone service, regardless of \ndisparities in cost of supplying such service.\n  This concept of urban-rural equality known as ``universal service'' \nwas predicated on the agrarian/rural based demographics of our Nation \nat that time. Poorer rural areas required urban subsidies to meet the \ngoal of universal service. However, demographics have changed since \n1934. Today, the majority of Americans now live in urban settings. \nTelecommunications subsidy schemes, however, have not changed and the \nurban poor are being unfairly forced to pay for telephone service for \nthose who can much better afford it.\n  It is simply not fair for those living at the poverty level in the \ninner city to have to pay for telephone service to the ultra wealthy \nwith second homes in places such as Telluride, Vail, Martha's Vineyard, \nand the Boulders Resort Area of Arizona.\n  It is time for a fresh look. As we debate communications law reform, \nwe must step back and ask who is paying for what services. The answer \nis that those who live in urban areas, as envisioned in 1934, are \nsubsidizing telephone services for those who live in rural areas.\n  The belief that a universal service subsidy mechanism designed in the \n1930's is relevant today and must continue is preposterous. Not only \ndoes it unfairly punish lower income, inner city Americans, but it \ndiscourages future competition in the local loop.\n  Vigorous competition with its many benefits to the consumer will only \nflourish in a free market environment in which entrepreneurs believe \nthey can enter a line of business and make a profit. However, since the \ncurrent telephone subsidy scheme\n gives all benefits to the incumbent company, the question arises: What \nsmart businessman or women would want to compete against the entrenched \nexisting company? The answer is none. Thus, if we truly believe in \ncompetition for telephone services, we should advocate an end to \nsubsidies.\n\n  We should consider a phase out of existing cross-subsidy mechanisms, \nincluding long-distance access charges, subsidization of residential \nrates by business rates, subsidization of rural rates by urban rates, \nand other rate [[Page S8210]] averaging mechanisms in order to ensure \nthat market prices accurately reflect the true cost of providing \nservice. Eliminating these barriers to the free market will enhance \ncompetition and experience has proven that competition causes prices to \nfall and improves customer service. When as many subsidies as possible \nare eliminated, when free market economics has substantially replaced \ndepression-era subsidies, the universal service goal that is contained \nin existing law could be achieved by instituting a means-tested voucher \nsystem to ensure that everyone has the ability to receive telephone \nservice.\n  Under a voucher system, any household, regardless of where they live, \nwho earns under 200 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for \ntelephone vouchers. Recipients could use the vouchers to pay for any \nlocal telephone service they desired, including cellular or in the near \nfuture, satellite communications systems such as PCS. The States, not \nthe Federal Government should administer the voucher system because \nthey can best respond to local priorities and needs.\n  Vouchers could be reclaimed for dollars by local telephone companies \nchosen by the consumer to provide service. Therefore, the economic \nviability of companies who have benefits from the current subsidy \nscheme will only be in jeopardy if their customers decide they no \nlonger like their current phone company and seek a new provider, in \nother words free-market economics at work.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that a voucher system may not be \nimmediately embraced by small rural telephone companies. They are happy \nwith the status quo that ensures them a steady revenue stream. A \nvoucher system does not recognize incumbency, it recognizes merit.\n  Reality tells us that the elimination of subsidies and the creation \nof a voucher system would not only empower individuals but would \nencourage telephone companies to compete more for local business. A \nvoucher system is still a subsidy, but it is a much more benign subsidy \nthen the anticompetitive one which currently exists.\n  Although the food stamp program is not embraced by all, it is \nimportant to note that we do not send money directly to the local \nSafeway, telling them to bag a government proscribed list\n of groceries, and then to deliver them to everyone in a certain \nneighborhood, regardless of income. However, that is precisely what we \ndo with local telephone service. There is simply no logic in today's \nsociety for continuation of the current subsidy mechanisms.\n\n  Last, it is important to note that while 99 percent of Americans have \npurchased televisions without the benefit of a subsidy, only 93 percent \nof all households have telephones. Perhaps due to the empowerment of \nindividuals that a voucher system would perpetuate, as many American \nwill have telephones as have televisions.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a radical change from the status \nquo, and therefore I am under no allusion that it will pass today. I do \nbelieve it lays the groundwork for the future and should be supported \nby the Senate.\n  There have been a number of interesting articles written about the \nvoucher system and the present system. One of them was in the Wall \nStreet Journal last January 20. It is by Mr. Adam Thierer, who is an \nanalyst with the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n  I would like to quote from some of this article, because I think it \nframes the issue pretty well. It begins by saying:\n       Republicans in Congress will soon introduce deregulatory \n     legislation that could revolutionize the way America's \n     telecommunications sector works. An outline of the proposed \n     legislation in the Senate reveals that Republicans plan to \n     eliminate remaining barriers to market entry * * * the \n     Republican plan at least starts off on the right foot.\n       Yet it is evident from the outline that Republicans are no \n     different from Democrats when it comes to the Holy Grail of \n     telecommunications--universal service. The GOP lawmaker's \n     plan for universal service may place everything else they \n     hope to accomplish at risk.\n       The desire to create a ubiquitous telecommunications system \n     is indeed noble. The problem is that, by mandating universal \n     telephone service, policy makers effectively required that a \n     monopolistic system be developed to deliver service to all. \n     That meant devising a crazy-quilt of internal industry taxes \n     that force low-cost providers to cross-subsidize high-cost \n     providers. Hence, billions of dollars of subsidies now flow \n     from long-distance to local providers, from businesses to \n     residences, and from urban to rural users.\n       But, despite these bountiful subsidies, roughly one \n     American out of every 17 still does not have a telephone in \n     his home.\n     \n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n       Worse yet, by arbitrarily averaging rates across the \n     nation, policy makers have unintentionally created a \n     remarkably regressive tax. Hence, a poor single mother on \n     welfare in the inner city is often paying artificially high \n     rates to help subsidize service to wealthy families who live \n     in nearby rural areas. There is nothing equitable about a \n     system that arbitrarily assesses billions of dollars of \n     internal industry taxes on consumers while failing to provide \n     service to all.\n       Yet policy makers continue to support the current cross-\n     subsidy taxes in the mistaken belief that they encourage \n     ever-increasing subscribership levels. Economists David \n     Kaserman and John Mayo have appropriately labeled this belief \n     a ``fairy tale,'' since no causal relationship exists between \n     subsidies and subscribership levels. In fact, the exact \n     opposite is the case. The 1980s saw decreased subsidies and \n     increased subscribership levels.\n     \n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n       If a free-market approach is unpalatable, Republicans \n     should consider means-tested telecom vouchers. State and \n     local governments, not the feds, could simply offer poor \n     residents a voucher to purchase service from a provider of \n     their choice. Make no mistake, this is still a subsidy, but \n     at least it is one that will not discourage competitive \n     entry. It would be funded through general tax revenues, to \n     encourage legislators to target the subsidy as narrowly as \n     possible.\n       One GOP staffer recently told me this approach is ``ahead \n     of its time.'' In fact, this idea is somewhat behind the \n     times, but it is still the only solution that could co-exist \n     with a competitive marketplace. Free markets, open access, \n     and consumer choice are the better guarantors of innovative \n     goods, lower prices, and true universal service. If policy \n     makers instead continue to place faith in the fairy tale of \n     mandated universal service, they will still be discussing how \n     to create a competitive marketplace at the turn of the \n     century.\n\n  I am afraid that Mr. Thierer's prediction is, unfortunately, all too \ntrue. On January 11, 1995, in the Investors Business Daily, there was \nan article that I think has some interesting facts in it.\n\n       About 6% of all American homes are still without \n     telephones. But the U.S. Census Bureau reports 99% own \n     radios, 98% have televisions and 75% video cassette \n     recorders--a technology barely 20 years old.\n       Discounting the implied subsidies of free airwaves for \n     broadcasters, radios and TVs haven't been bolstered by \n     anything like the complex web of subsidies and regulations \n     created over the years to foster universal telephone service.\n       Several federal agencies manage about $1 billion in \n     payments made by big phone companies and put in the pockets \n     of small ones. But the phone companies themselves set aside \n     and transfer funds, as required by federal rules, to \n     subsidize service to the needy and rural communities.\n       These subsidies, which total billions of dollars, come from \n     three sources: business users, long distance calls and urban \n     customers, including residential. They are used to \n     artificially reduce the cost of serving rural areas, and to \n     provide below-cost service to poorer households.\n       But analysts say the administrators of universal service \n     funds, whether at federal agencies or in phone companies, do \n     little to assess the need for assistance. And rate averaging, \n     used by large phone companies, often forces the poorest \n     inner-city households to subsidize rural service for even the \n     richest gentlemen farmers and jet-setting skiers.\n       ``The telecommunications welfare state has been a \n     disaster,'' asserted Heritage Foundation analyst Adam Thierer \n     in a study published recently. ``The regulatory model of the \n     past six decades has failed.''\n       In a study released Jan. 5, for instance, Wayne Leighton of \n     the Center for Market Processes in Fairfax, Va., and Citizens \n     for a Sound Economy in Washington, describes how the tiny \n     resort community of Bretton Woods, N.H., received $22,153 in \n     subsidies last year, because its remote location on the \n     shoulders of the White Mountains makes it a ``high-cost'' \n     area to serve. That equates to $82 for each of the \n     community's 269 phone lines--many of which serve luxury \n     hotels.\n       ``High-cost is not the same as high need,'' Leighton said.\n       ``Indeed,'' Leighton added, ``poor inner-city residents \n     rarely benefit from these programs, since their telephone \n     companies spread costs over a great many users. . . . The \n     result is subsidies often help middle- and upper-class \n     subscribers lower their monthly phone bills.''\n       The giant regional telephone monopolies, which want to be \n     allowed to compete with long-distance and cable television \n     companies in those markets, say universal service subsidies \n     cost about $20 billion a year.\n       Leighton, citing a study by the Telecommunications \n     Industries Analysis Project, estimates the net transfer from \n     urban customers to rural at $9.3 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\n                               who pays?\n\n       ``A lot of money can be pulled from an urban area, without \n     regarding who it's being pulled from,'' noted Heritage's \n     Thierer.\n       To see the effects of subsidies, compare the annual average \n     household cost for telephone service in rural and urban \n     areas. According to a Federal Communications Commission study \n     published in July 1994, the average ``rural'' household spent \n     $549 in 1990, while in big cities like New York, Chicago and \n     Los Angeles, the comparable figures were $770, $660 and $748, \n     respectively.\n       Interestingly, a majority of the residents in all three of \n     these major cities are either black or Hispanic. In other \n     major cities with large minority populations, like Detroit, \n     Atlanta, Washington and Houston, the pattern is similar--all \n     had substantially higher average household phone bills than \n     did rural households.\n\n  I do not understand how we defend a system that charges higher rates \nfor some of the poorest people in America and minorities. We are having \na great debate and we are going to continue to have a great debate over \naffirmative action. But it seems to me that at least we ought to cure \nwhat is clearly reverse affirmation actions.\n\n       Consider just the poorest Americans, who presumably would \n     qualify for subsidized rates as low as $6 a month. The fact \n     that only 73% of households with annual incomes of less than \n     $5,000 had phones in 1993 again suggests that the subsidies \n     do not reach their intended targets.\n\n  Let me point out again that 73 percent of households in America with \nannual incomes of less than $5,000 had phones in 1993.\n\n       * * * But by one government estimate, 91% of all ``poor'' \n     households owned color televisions by 1990.\n       The FCC data also show that between 1984 and 1992, \n     America's black households on average spent between 12% and \n     23% more on phone services each month than did white \n     households.\n       And according to 1990 census data, 68% of all blacks lived \n     in the nation's 75 largest urban areas--traditionally the \n     source of most phone company revenues.\n       Broken down by race, 77% of white households in the poorest \n     segment had phones, while just 65% of blacks did. In the next \n     highest income group, from $5,000 to $7,499, the percentages \n     rose to 86% of whites and 78% of blacks.\n       The sole reason telecommunications is not as competitive as \n     these other high-technology sectors is that, unlike them, it \n     is not governed primarily by consumer choice.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``There are other options,'' Thierer observed, ``but we're \n     just so scared about letting go of the past.''\n       But so much has changed, critics of the current system \n     point out that a wealth of new technologies makes the old \n     ways completely obsolete. Today, cable television, electric \n     power and wireless systems can all compete with telephone \n     networks.\n       Free-market reformers could grow more optimistic, if they \n     listen to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. In recent \n     testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, Gingrich \n     suggested new policies should reflect thinking ``beyond the \n     norm.''\n\n  Mr. President, I am first to admit that a system of vouchers would be \nclearly beyond the norm.\n  Mr. President, I received a study called ``Local Competition and \nUniversal Service, New Solutions and Old Myths.''\n  The mechanism that they propose to address any such ``market \nfailure'' would be:\n\n       . . . an explicit, market-compatible subsidy system with \n     three primary components. (1) universal service subsidies \n     should be provided directly to end users, (2) all subsidies \n     must be clearly defined and designed to terminate over time, \n     and (3) all funding must be raised explicitly as a telephone \n     subsidy.\n\n  On the issue of furnishing the subsidy to end users:\n\n       There are numerous advantages to this approach. Combined \n     with means testing, it would ensure that only those customers \n     in need of a subsidy would receive money. Therefore, to \n     minimize market interference, subsidies should be provided \n     directly to the end users--in the form of telephone stamps--\n     who are the intended beneficiaries of the subsidy. This is a \n     three-step process: identify end users who cannot afford \n     service; calculate the differential between what they can \n     afford and the price of service; then provide an appropriate \n     amount of subsidy directly to the consumer. Carefully \n     tailored means testing should minimize any abuse of the \n     program.\n       This approach reduces marketplace interference by \n     permitting the customers to choose how they spend their \n     ``telephone stamps.'' For example, some urban customers might \n     choose among competitively-priced alternatives such as \n     cellular or PCS service rather than ordinary wireline service \n     as better suiting their multiple-job lifestyles, while still \n     being available for use at home. Rural residents individually \n     might also prefer a wireless to a wired service, or might \n     collectively for their region obtain bids from multiple \n     providers of multiple technologies.\n       And this mechanism of distributing funds directly to end \n     users also avoids the pre-selection of a particular provider. \n     Since customers can spend their ``telephone stamps'' as they \n     wish, they will choose the technology and provider who best \n     matches their needs and budget. It may be that in some \n     locations, only one provider makes service available; in that \n     case that provider will receive all the subsidy money, but by \n     operation of the marketplace rather than by regulatory fiat. \n     But it may also be that the availability of the pool of money \n     represented by the sum of all the ``telephone stamps'' acts \n     as an incentive to draw alternative providers and alternative \n     technologies into the area.\n\n  The most difficult problem facing direct user subsidization is the \ndesign of an appropriately tailored mechanism for distribution which \nwill take many forms such as tax breaks, telephone stamps, or service \ncredits. These credits should be awarded on a needs basis as determined \nthrough some more means testing, perhaps by tying it to other means-\ntested assistance programs in the State; that is, anyone who qualifies \nfor any program on the State's list of means-tested programs also \nqualifies for a preset level of telephone assistance set to enable them \nto obtain basic telephone access.\n  There would be no need to create a separate bureaucracy. Similarly, \nthe State agency that currently issues assistance, such as food stamps, \ncan also issue the telephone stamps. The consumer could use the \nequivalent telephone stamps to purchase network service capability if \nthey want by mailing in the stamps with their bill.\n  As competition drives down the price of technological alternatives, \nconsumers could choose from an expanding array of network alternatives. \nThis would allow customers to maximize the use of the network by \nplacing at their disposal the technology best suited to their means, \nlifestyles, and location. The providers cash in telephone stamps just \nas grocery stores do with food stamps.\n  Mr. President, universal service historically has been the subject of \nmore assumptions than studies and discussions of the issue and have \ngenerated more heat than light.\n  The presumptions of the past have governed the debate for far too \nlong. Rethinking these assumptions clears the way and focuses the \ndiscussion on the issues that face telecommunications today. The issue \ntoday is not the creation of universal service but its preservation. \nServices are available today to most Americans. The remaining issue is \nservice activation and affordability. Open competition among fully \ninoperative networks for local service priced at its true cost, \ncombined with our proposed explicit and targeted approach to any \nnecessary subsidies, is the best way to maintain universal service \nwhile bringing the benefits of a competitive marketplace to all \ntelephone customers.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The yeas and nays have been requested. Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the McCain amendment, \nwhich is No. 1276.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we return to \nthe Feinstein-Kempthorne amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just proposed an amendment. I had anticipated that we \nwould debate the amendment and vote on it at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I hope that the Senator will not object. The Senate has \nalmost completed its debate on a Feinstein-Kempthorne amendment which \nwas proposed last night. I have a second-degree amendment for that \nwhich I would like to get in so that the body [[Page S8212]] will \nunderstand exactly what it is going to be voting on on that issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me say to my friend, I was over in a hearing. The \nrequest was to come over and propose amendments because amendments were \nneeded in the Chamber. I then left the hearing. I came over here with \nmy amendment, asked that the pending amendment be set aside at the \nrequest of the distinguished chairman, proposed the amendment, and \nfully anticipated debate and a vote on that amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my colleague will yield, we are going to \naccommodate. The problem, I am told this morning, is that one of our \nMembers is at a Vietnam veterans ceremony. We are going to try to stack \nthe votes, if we could have the vote at 4 o'clock. That is what the \nleadership tells me, they are going to try to stack votes; that we have \nvotes after the Les Aspin memorial service this afternoon.\n  I did not create these things, but that is the situation we are in.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Who has the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I made a unanimous consent request and the Senator from \nArizona objected.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would like to continue with the consideration of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we return to \nthe Feinstein-Kempthorne amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1277 to Amendment No. 1270\n\n    (Purpose: To limit, rather than strike, the preemption language)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \nFeinstein-Kempthorne amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1277 to amendment No. 1270.\n       In the matter proposed to be stricken, strike ``or is \n     inconsistent with this section, the Commission shall \n     promptly'' and insert ``subsection (a) or (b), the Commission \n     shall''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last night, our distinguished colleagues \nfrom California and Idaho proposed an amendment with respect to a \nsection entitled ``Removal of Barriers to Entry.'' That section in toto \nsays that the States and local communities cannot impose State or local \nrequirements that may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the \nability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate \ntelecommunications services.\n  Mr. President, that, of course, is a very, very broad prohibition \nagainst State and local activities. And so thereafter there follow two \nsubsections that attempt to carve out reasonable exemptions to that \nState and local authority. One has to do specifically with \ntelecommunications providers themselves and speaks in the general term \nof allowing States to preserve and advance universal service, protect \nthe public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of \ntelecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers, \nwhich are, of course, the precise goals of this Federal statute itself.\n  However, the third exception is ``Local Government Authority.'' That \nlocal government authority relates to the right of local governments to \nmanage public rights-of-way, require fair and reasonable compensation \nto telecommunications providers, the use of public rights-of-way on a \nnondiscriminatory basis, and so on.\n  Then the final subsection is a preemptive subsection, Mr. President, \nand it reads:\n\n       If, after notice and an opportunity for public comment, the \n     Commission determines that a State or local government has \n     permitted or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal \n     requirement that violates or is inconsistent with this \n     section, the Commission shall immediately preempt the \n     enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal requirement \n     to the extent necessary to correct such violation or \n     inconsistency.\n\n  Now, our two distinguished colleagues said that that preemption was \nmuch too broad, that its effect would be to say to a major \ntelecommunications provider or utility all you have to do, if the city \nof San Francisco or the city of Boise attempts to tell you what hours \nyou can dig in the city streets or how much noise you can make or how \nyou have to reimburse the city for the damage to its public rights-of-\nway, that all that the utility would have to do would be to appeal to \nthe Federal Communications Commission in Washington, DC, and thereby \nremove what is primarily a local question and make a Federal question \nout of it which had to be decided in Washington, DC, by the Federal \nCommunications Commission. And so the Feinstein-Kempthorne amendment \nstrikes this entire preemption section.\n  Now, the Senator from California I think very properly tells us what \nthe impact of that will be. It does not impact the substance of the \nfirst three subsections of this section at all, but it does shift the \nforum in which a question about those three subsections is decided. \nInstead of being the Federal Communications Commission with an appeal \nto a Federal court here in the District of Columbia, those \ncontroversies will be decided by the various district courts of the \nUnited States from one part of this country across to every other \nsingle one.\n  Now, Mr. President, in the view of this Senator, there is real \njustification in the argument for both sides of this question. The \nargument in favor of the section as it has been reported by the \nCommerce Committee is that we are talking about the promotion of \ncompetition. We are talking about a nationwide telecommunications \nsystem.\n  There ought to be one center place where these questions are \nappropriately decided by one Federal entity which recognizes the impact \nof these rules from one part of the country to another and one Federal \ncourt of appeals.\n  On the other hand, the localism argument that cities, counties, local \ncommunities should control the use of their own streets and should not \nbe required to come to Washington, DC, to defend a permit action for \ndigging up a street, for improving or building a new utility also has \ngreat force and effect, Mr. President. I think it is a persuasive \nargument.\n  So in order to try to balance the general authority of a single \nFederal Communications Commission against the specific authority of \nlocal communities, I have offered a second-degree amendment to the \nFeinstein-Kempthorne amendment. I hope that the sponsors of the \namendment will consider it to be a friendly one.\n  More often than not in this body, second-degree amendments are \ndesigned to totally subvert first-degree amendments to move in a \ncompletely different direction, sometimes to save Members from \nembarrassing votes. This is not such a case.\n  I have read the arguments that were made by the two Senators who \nsponsored the first-degree amendment. I agree with them, but almost \nwithout exception, their arguments speak about the control by cities \nand other local communities over their own rights of way, an area in \nwhich their authority should clearly be preserved, a field in which \nthey should not be required to have to come to Washington, DC, in order \nto defend their local permitting or ordinance-setting actions.\n  I agree with those two Senators in that respect, but I do not agree \nthat we should sweep away all of the preemption from an entire section, \nwhich is entitled ``Removal of Barriers to Entry''; that fundamental \nremoval to those barriers, an action by a State or a city which says \nonly one telephone company can operate in a given field, for example, \nor only one cable system can operate in a given field, should not be \nexempted from a preemption and from a national policy set by the \nFederal Communications Commission. [[Page S8213]] \n  So this amendment does two things, both significant. The first is \nthat it narrows the preemption by striking the phrase ``is inconsistent \nwith'' so that it now allows for a preemption only for a requirement \nthat violates the section. And second, it changes it by limiting the \npreemption section to the first two subsections of new section 254; \nthat is, the general statement and the State control over utilities.\n  There is no preemption, even if my second-degree amendment is \nadopted, Mr. President, for subsection (c) which is entitled, ``Local \nGovernment Authority,'' and which is the subsection which preserves to \nlocal governments control over their public rights of way. It accepts \nthe proposition from those two Senators that these local powers should \nbe retained locally, that any challenge to them take place in the \nFederal district court in that locality and that the Federal \nCommunications Commission not be able to preempt such actions.\n  So I hope that it is a way out of the dilemma in which we find \nourselves, the preservation of that local authority without subverting \nwhat ought to be nationwide authority. It will be a while, I think, \nbefore this comes to a vote. I commend this middle ground to both the \nmanagers of the bill and the sponsors of the amendment. I hope that \nthey will accept it.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1278\n\n (Purpose: To provide for Federal Communications Commission review of \n              television broadcast ownership restrictions)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I offer a \nfirst-degree amendment on the issue of broadcast ownership \nrestrictions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Helms and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1278.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section (207) and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(b) Review and Modification of Broadcast Rules.--The \n     Commission shall:\n       ``(1) modify or remove such national and local ownership \n     rules on radio and television broadcasters as are necessary \n     to ensure that broadcasters are able to compete fairly with \n     other media providers while ensuring that the public receives \n     information from a diversity of media sources and localism \n     and service in the public interest is protected, taking into \n     consideration the economic dominance of providers in a market \n     and\n       ``(2) review the ownership restriction in section \n     613(a)(1).''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am scheduled to testify before a base \nclosing hearing in the Cannon Building in a matter of minutes, so I \nmust leave the floor. I did want to offer this first-degree amendment. \nIt would essentially eliminate two provisions, the provisions in the \nunderlying bill that now abolish the current ownership restrictions on \ntelevision stations.\n  We currently have a 12-station ownership limitation on television \nstations and a 25-percent-of-the-national-audience cap. I believe we \nought to restore that and provide the authority to the FCC to make \nthose determinations. I think it makes no sense to include in this bill \na provision that simply withdraws those restrictions on ownership.\n  This bill talks about competition. If we allow this to continue in \nthis bill, we will see a greater concentration of television ownership \nin this country, and we will end up with a half a dozen companies \ncontrolling virtually all the television stations in America. I do not \nthink anybody can honestly disagree that that is the result of the \nprovision in the underlying bill.\n  I think we ought to restore the 12-station limit and the 25-percent-\nnational-audience cap and give the FCC the authority to make its own \njudgment and evaluate what kind of competition exists and what is in \nthe public interest with respect to this competition. This provision \nmakes no sense at all in the underlying bill.\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays at an appropriate point. I must \nleave to testify before the Base Closing Commission, and then I will \nreturn to debate this legislation. My understanding is the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, wants to speak on this. I am pleased he will \ndo so while I am absent from the Chamber.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, before the Senator from North Dakota \nleaves, it is my intent, unless he objects now, after making my \ncomments to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, unless the \nSenator will object to my asking at the end of my remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe Senator Helms wants to speak on it and probably \nSenator Simon as well. The Senator can ask for the yeas and nays, sure.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, let me say that the central point \nof this whole legislation has been that we are trying to create a \nregulatory environment where competition can produce lower prices and \nhigher quality service for the American consumer. The service that is \nbeing sold is information. Unlike many other commodities that we buy--\nnatural gas, for example, transportation, and so forth--this is a very \nunusual commodity that we are buying, information, although maybe \ncommodity is not exactly the precise words like you are buying hardware \nand other sorts of things.\n  It really is an issue of giving power to somebody to control to a \nvery great extent the information that we get.\n  You say, ``Well, I have community standards in place.'' That is true, \nthe FCC does have control over community standards, and there are lots \nof other regulatory determinations that could be made by the FCC, but \nit is the power to broadcast, the power to publish, the power to \ntransmit information.\n It is the word, Mr. President. Unlike other commodities, I have only \n24 hours in the day in which I can process this information, in which I \ncan either listen to the radio or watch television or read a newspaper, \nor go on-line, or call my kids, or listen to my kids, or engage in some \nmanner, shape, or form in purchasing or using the information services \nor equipment that this $800 to $900 billion industry is out there \nmanufacturing and producing and trying to get me to buy. So I have 24 \nhours a day. That is all anybody has.\n\n  What we have, over the years, understood is that the person who \ncontrols that information very often controls a great deal more than \njust the right to sell to you. The person who controls the right to own \na station, radio or television, or who controls the newspaper, who \ncontrols some other information source, they are in control of much \nmore than just the right to sell you some product. In fact, rarely--I \nam not sure I can even cite an owner that does not respect that they \nhave more than just a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. They \nunderstand that they have a responsibility that is larger than that.\n  This amendment, I believe, maintains what we have traditionally done, \nand that is to say you can get all the competition you want with 12 \nstations and all the competition you want with 25 percent--25 percent \nownership in a service area. That has worked. Again, I have not heard \nconsumers come to me on this one and say, gee, could you lift the \nownership restrictions because we are not getting the kind of quality \nservice we want, and we believe that if we have 35 percent ownership of \nour television and radio stations in a service area, that that will \nimprove the quality of our product, and if we concentrate this industry \neven more, we are going to get improved quality of product.\n  I believe that the amendment before us illustrates this issue that I \nhave been raising a time or two on the floor, which is that at stake \nhere is the power of a business or an individual to do something--the \npower of an individual or a corporation, mostly, to do something that \nthey are currently prohibited from doing. A corporation that \n[[Page S8214]] owns radio or television stations currently has certain \nrestrictions placed on them, and the bill, as currently described, \nwould lift a number of those restrictions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in this \nmorning's Washington Post by Tom Shales be printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 1995]\n\n                       Fat Cat Broadcast Bonanza\n\n                            (By Tom Shales)\n\n       It's happening again. Congress is going ever so slightly \n     insane. The telecommunications deregulation bill now being \n     debated in the Senate, with a vote expected today or \n     tomorrow, is a monstrosity. In the guise of encouraging \n     competition, it will help create huge new concentrations of \n     media power.\n       There's something for everybody in the package, with the \n     notable exception of you and me. Broadcasters, cablecasters, \n     telephone companies and gigantic media conglomerates all get \n     fabulous prizes. Congress is parceling out the future among \n     the communications superpowers, which stand to get more super \n     and more powerful, and certainly more profitable, as a \n     result.\n       Limits on multiple ownership would be eased by the bill, so \n     that any individual owner could control stations serving up \n     to 35 percent of the country (50 percent in the even crazier \n     House version), versus 25 percent now. There would be no \n     limit on the number of radio stations owned. Cable and phone \n     companies could merge in municipalities with populations up \n     to 50,000.\n       Broadcast licenses of local TV stations would be extended \n     from a five-year to a 10-year term and would be even more \n     easily renewed than they are now. It would become nearly \n     impossible for angry civic groups or individuals to challenge \n     the licenses of even the most irresponsible broadcasters.\n       In addition, the rate controls that were imposed on the \n     cable industry in 1992, and have saved consumers $3 billion \n     in the years since, would be abolished, so that your local \n     cable company could hike those rates right back up again.\n       Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), majority leader and presidential \n     candidate, is trying to ram the legislation through as \n     quickly as possible. Tomorrow he wants to take up the issue \n     of welfare reform, which is rather ironic considering that \n     his deregulation efforts amount to a bounteous welfare \n     program for the very, very, very rich.\n       Dole made news recently when he took Time Warner Co. to \n     task for releasing violent movies and rap records with \n     incendiary lyrics. His little tirade was a sham and a smoke \n     screen. Measures Dole supports would enable corporate giants \n     such as Time Warner to grow exponentially.\n       ``Here's the hypocrisy,'' says media activist Andrew Jay \n     Schwartzman. ``Bob Dole sits there on `Meet the Press' and \n     says, yes, he got $23,000 from Time Warner in campaign \n     contributions, and that just proves he can't be bought.'' He \n     criticizes Time Warner's corporate responsibility and acts \n     like he's being tough on them, but it's in a way that won't \n     affect their bottom line at all.\n       ``Meanwhile he is rushing to the floor with a bill that \n     will deregulate cable rates and expedite the entry of cable \n     into local telephone service, and no company is pressing \n     harder for this bill than--guess who--Time Warner.''\n       Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access \n     Project, says that the legislation does a lot of ``awful \n     things'' but that the worst may be opening the doors to ``a \n     huge consolidation of broadcast ownership, so that four, \n     five, six or seven companies could own virtually all the \n     television stations in the United States.''\n       Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, calls the \n     legislation ``deregulatory gobbledygook'' and says it would \n     remove virtually every obstacle to concentration of ownership \n     in mass media. The deregulation of cable rates with no \n     competition to cable firmly in place is ``just a travesty,'' \n     Kimmelman says, and allowing more joint ventures and mergers \n     among media giants is ``the most illogical policy decision \n     you could make if you want a competitive marketplace.''\n       The legislation would also hand over a new chunk of the \n     broadcast spectrum to commercial broadcasters to do with, and \n     profit from, as they please. Digital compression of broadcast \n     signals will soon make more signal space available, space \n     that Schwartzman refers to as ``beachfront property.'' Before \n     it even exists, Congress wants to give it away.\n       Broadcasters could use the additional channels for pay TV \n     or home shopping channels or anything else that might fatten \n     their bank accounts.\n       There's more. Those politicians who are always saying they \n     want to get the government off our backs don't mind letting \n     it into our homes. Senators have been rushing forth with \n     amendments designed to censor content, whether on cable TV or \n     in the cyberspace of the Internet. The provisions would \n     probably be struck down by courts as antithetical to the \n     First Amendment anyway, but legislators know how well it \n     plays back home when they attack ``indecency'' on the House \n     or Senate floor.\n       Late yesterday Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Trent \n     Lott (R-Miss.) called for an amendment requiring cablecasters \n     to ``scramble'' the signals of adults-only channels offering \n     sexually explicit programming. The signals already are \n     scrambled, and you have to request them and pay for them to \n     get them. Not enough, Feinstein and Lott said; they must be \n     scrambled more.\n       The amendment passed 91-0.\n       It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.\n       An amendment expected to be introduced today would require \n     that the infamous V-chip be installed in all new television \n     sets, and that networks and stations be forced to encode \n     their broadcasts in compliance. The V-chip would allow \n     parents to prevent violent programs from being seen on their \n     TV sets. Of course, they could turn them off, or switch to \n     another channel, but that's so much trouble. Why not have Big \n     Brother do it for you?\n       The telecommunications legislation is being sponsored in \n     the Senate by Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-\n     S.D.), whose initial proposal was that all limits on multiple \n     ownership be dropped. Even his supporters laughed at that \n     one.\n       Dole is the one who's ramrodding the legislation through, \n     and it's apparently part of an overall Republican plan for \n     American media, and most parts of the plan are bad. They \n     include defunding and essentially destroying public \n     television, one of the few wee alternatives to commercial \n     broadcasting and its junkiness, and even, in the Newt \n     Gingrich wing of the party, abolishing the Federal \n     Communications Commission, put in place decades ago to \n     safeguard the public's ``interest, convenience and \n     necessity.''\n       It's the interest, convenience and necessity of media \n     magnates that appears to be the sole priority now. ``The big \n     loser in all this, of course, is the public,'' wrote media \n     expert Ken Auletta in a recent New Yorker piece about the \n     lavishness of media contributions to politicians. The \n     communications industry is the sixth-largest PAC giver, \n     Auletta noted.\n       Viacom, a huge media conglomerate, had plans to sponsor a \n     big fund-raising breakfast for Pressler this month, Auletta \n     reported, but the plans were dropped once Auletta started \n     making inquiries: ``Asked through a spokeswoman about the \n     propriety of a committee chairman's shopping for money from \n     industries he regulated, Pressler declined to respond.''\n       The perfect future envisioned by the Republicans and some \n     conservative Democrats seems to consist of media ownership in \n     very few hands, but hands that hold tight rein over the \n     political content of reporting and entertainment programming. \n     Gingrich recently appeared before an assemblage of mass media \n     CEOs at a dinner sponsored by the right-wing Heritage \n     Foundation and reportedly got loud approval when he griped \n     about the oh-so-rough treatment he and fellow conservatives \n     allegedly get from the press.\n       Reuven Frank, former president of NBC News, wrote about \n     that meeting, and other troubling developments, in his column \n     for the New Leader. ``It is daily becoming more obvious that \n     the biggest threat to a free press and the circulation of \n     ideas,'' Frank wrote, ``is the steady absorption of \n     newspapers, television networks and other vehicles of \n     information into enormous corporations that know how to turn \n     knowledge into profit--but are not equally committed to \n     inquiry or debate or to the First Amendment.''\n       The further to the right media magnates are, the more \n     kindly Congress is likely to regard them. Most dramatic and, \n     indeed, obnoxious case in point: Rupert Murdoch, the fox \n     mogul whom Frank calls ``today's most powerful international \n     media baron.'' The Australian-born Murdoch has consistently \n     received gentle, kid-glove, look-the-other-way treatment from \n     Congress and even the regulatory agencies. When the FCC got \n     brave not long ago and tried to sanction Murdoch for \n     allegedly deceiving the commission about where he got the \n     money to buy six TV stations in 1986, loud voices in Congress \n     cried foul.\n       These included Reps. Jack Fields (R-Tex.) and Mike Oxley \n     (R-Ohio). Daily Variety's headline for the story: ``GOP \n     Lawmakers Stand by Murdoch.'' They always do. Indeed, Oxley \n     was behind a movement to lift entirely the ban on foreign \n     ownership of U.S. television and radio stations. He wanted \n     that to be part of the House bill, but by some miracle, this \n     is one cockamamie scheme that got quashed.\n       Murdoch, of course, is the man who wanted to give Gingrich \n     a $4.5 million advance to write a book called ``To Renew \n     America,'' until a public outcry forced the House speaker to \n     turn it down. He is still writing the book for Murdoch's \n     HarperCollins publishing company. The huge advance was \n     announced last winter, not long after Murdoch had paid a very \n     friendly visit to Gingrich on the Hill to whine about his \n     foreign ownership problems, with the FCC.\n       Everyone knows that America is on the edge of vast \n     uncharted territory where telecommunications is concerned. \n     We've all read about the 500-channel universe and the entry \n     of telephone companies into the cable business and some sort \n     of linking up between home computers and home entertainment \n     centers. In Senate debate on the deregulation bill last week, \n     senators invoked images of the Gold Rush and the Oklahoma \n     land rush in their visions of this future.\n       But this gold rush is apparently open only to those already \n     rolling in gold, and the land is available only to those who \n     are already big landowners--to a small private club \n     [[Page S8215]] whose members are all enormously wealthy and \n     well connected and, by and large, politically conservative. \n     It isn't very encouraging. In fact, it's enough to make you \n     think that the future is already over. Ah, well. It was nice \n     while it lasted.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. The headline of this article says, ``Fat Cat Broadcast \nBonanza.''\n  I admit that is a useful headline for me to make my point, but listen \nto the argument here.\n\n       Limits on multiple ownership would be eased by the bill, so \n     that any individual owner could control stations serving up \n     to 35 percent of the country . . .\n\n  The House, by the way, goes to 50 percent versus the 25 percent now.\n\n       There would be no limit on the number of radio stations \n     owned. Cable and phone companies could merge in \n     municipalities with populations up to 50,000.\n       Broadcast licenses of local TV stations would be extended \n     from a 5-year to a 10-year term and would be even more easily \n     renewed than they are now. It would become nearly impossible \n     for angry civic groups or individuals to challenge the \n     licenses of even the most irresponsible broadcasters.\n       In addition, the rate controls that were imposed on the \n     cable industry in 1992, and have saved consumers $3 billion \n     in the years since, would be abolished, so that your local \n     cable company could hike those rates right back up again.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that those, like myself, who want a \ncompetitive environment in telecommunications, who want to support a \nbill that moves us from a monopoly at the local level to a competitive \nenvironment, who believe that you can get benefits from competition, \nthat consumers, taxpayers, and citizens, will say, Senator, I am glad \nyou voted for that bill. I believe we can get that kind of competition \nwithout changing the ownership rules for our broadcasters. I just do \nnot see a compelling reason for it. I do not see, indeed, increased \ncompetition. I think an argument can be made, in fact, that it is \nmoving in the wrong direction, much more toward a concentration and \nless competition, and thus I support the Dorgan amendment before us \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wish to continue the speech that I \nbegan regarding the standard of review in the Justice Department. If \nother Senators wish to offer amendments--I see that my colleague from \nMissouri has arrived. If he wishes to speak, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you. I would be pleased to speak, but I would \nlike to gather my thoughts.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that the speech I am giving \nwill continue at the point I broke off to yield to other Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1265, as Modified\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am speaking about the role of the \nDepartment of Justice. The Department of Justice seems to be seeking a \nregulatory role, which is unnecessary in this bill--a role that the FCC \nplays. When we table the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment at 12:30, it will be \nbecause of some of the problems. I am citing the Ameritech experience, \nand I cited an article in the New York Times that said that it appears \nthat the Justice Department is determined to win a permanent role in \ndetermining when the Bells should win freedom.\n  Ameritech may have thought that it had no choice but to accept the \ndeal that was offered. But the Department's ability to force its will \nupon one company does not render the so-called Ameritech plan a model \nfor the industry. Indeed the plan simply highlights that the 1982 AT \nconsent decree has broken down. It is time to return regulation of \ntelephone markets to Congress, the FCC, and the States.\n  The Ameritech plan, which was agreed to about 2 months ago, has been \ntouted as opening markets, both local and long distance, to increased \ncompetition. What it is, in fact, is a sketchy proposal for a complete \nrestructuring of how local telephone service is provided and billed. If \nit is ever implemented, it will bring about a massive shift of power \nfrom State and Federal regulators and the decreeing court to the \nDepartment of Justice. At the very least, the plan would compel local \ntelephone companies to change to usage-sensitive billing of the kind \nthat Ameritech has already implemented in Chicago. In other words, all \nresidential subscribers would end up paying a flat up-front fee for \nevery local call they make, plus additional measured charges for every \nminute of local usage. Ameritech has been filing tariffs since 1992 to \nmove in this direction. Those tariffs have been accepted in Illinois \nbut nowhere else.\n  Most States and most residential consumers will find this repudiation \nof price-averaging and universal service wholly unacceptable. What the \nDepartment hopes to do is to force these other States, against their \nbetter judgment, to go along with its sketchy proposal as the price of \nensuring that their local telephone companies are able to provide a \nfull range of services. While the plan may or may not be workable in \nparts of Ameritech's service area, it would upset the fundamental \nregulatory schemes of most States if applied more broadly, leading to \ndramatically higher prices for many residential customers.\n  Moreover, even after implementing the mandates of the Department, \nAmeritech will not get long distance relief until the Department of \nJustice, in its discretion, decides it should. Thus, the Department of \nJustice will become the Federal regulator, State regulator, and judge, \nall rolled into one.\n  For some reason, that seems to be what the Department of Justice \nwants. It wants to take on this regulating role, which is not in its \nenabling statute. Its enabling statute is that it is supposed to be an \nenforcer of law. It is no small wonder the Department favors the plan \nand strongly favors a similar role under the proposed amendment before \nus today. Yet, it is the Department itself that is the greatest \nobstacle to progress under the current decree, and the least capable of \ntaking on such regulatory responsibilities. All requests for waivers of \nthe decree must be processed by the Department before they are \npresented to the district court. The Department has proven completely \nincapable of performing that function. Delays of 3 to 5 years in the \nprocessing of even simple waivers are commonplace. Yet, the Department \nis now trying for greatly increased powers and vastly expanded \nresponsibilities.\n  The Department's new plan, in fact, constitutes a repudiation of the \nbasic tests for relief contained in the AT consent decree. Instead of \nsimply demonstrating to the court that it cannot impede competition in \nthe market it seeks to enter--which is all the decree requires--\nAmeritech must first implement a series of changes in its local \ntelephone operations, all of which are outside of the scope of the \ndecree.\n  This is a betrayal of the bargain reached in 1982.\n  The Department, in attempting to take on the roles of State public \nutility commission, FCC, and decree court, is guilty of gross \noverreaching. It is also playing into the hands of those who hope to \nkill the legislation and further delay the opening of \ntelecommunications markets to genuine competition.\n  It also clearly demonstrates that debate over this amendment is not \nabout the appropriate standard for review, but whether any DOJ role is \nappropriate given the poor track record at Justice.\n  Now, the proposed order is a blueprint for additional proposed \norders. The order that the Department is proposing for Judge Greene's \nsignature is a long, rambling, and almost impenetrable legal document. \nIt is also not self-effectuating.\n  Even if Judge Greene signed the order today, nothing would happen. \nAmeritech would not be permitted to enter any interexchange market. \nThere is no deadline for when it comes.\n  The order demands many further layers of review by the Department and \npermits the possibility of Bell having long distance at uncertain \nfuture dates at two areas that serve 1.2 percent of the population. The \norder is 39 pages long and contains 50 main paragraphs.\n  This decree, the Ameritech decree, is twice as long as the consent \ndecree that broke up the old Bell system in 1984. That is a reflection \nof lawyers at work, I suppose.\n  The proposed order is being described as one that will permit a Bell \ncompany to enter the long distance market. The order contains no such \npermission. It [[Page S8216]] does not grant Ameritech the right to \nprovide interexchange services in the temporary waiver territory.\n  All the order itself achieves is a wholesale transfer of power from \nJudge Greene to the Department of Justice. If the order is entered, it \nwill be up to the Department in the exercise of its discretion to \ndetermine when, if ever, Ameritech will be allowed to provide long \ndistance service in any market.\n  The order has this effect because key conditions on Ameritech's entry \nare undefinable, indeed, so vague as to be undefinable, because the \norder asked the district court simply to let the Department declare \nwhen the conditions have been met.\n  Paragraph 9, for example, states that Ameritech shall not offer \ninterexchange telecommunications pursuant to this order until the \nDepartment has approved the offering of such telecommunications \npursuant to the standard set forth in paragraph 11.\n  Paragraph 11, however, simply describes an open-ended process of \nfurther review. Among other things, the order empowers the Department \nto hire experts to review Ameritech's future proposals and declares \nAmeritech must pay for them. The Department, it appears, expects to \nspend not only time but significant sums of money in evaluating \nAmeritech's proposals when they are finally put forward.\n  The order also allows the Department, in its sole discretion, to \ncondition relief upon any other terms that may be appropriate. When and \nif some Ameritech plan is ultimately approved and put into effect, the \nDepartment retains authority to terminate at will by sending a letter \nto Ameritech telling them to stop. Ameritech will be permitted to \npetition Judge Greene for review, a right it already has today.\n  The proposed order is reflective of nothing so much as the \nDepartment's desire to micromanage all aspects of the \ntelecommunications industry.\n  It seems inconceivable that Judge Greene will approve or could \nlawfully approve such a wholesale transfer of power from his courtroom \nto the Department's Assistant Attorney General for antitrust. Under \nboth the standard provisions of district court jurisdiction and express \njurisdictional terms, the divestiture decree, the Bell companies are \nentitled to timely district court review of motions for relief from the \nline-of-business restrictions.\n  A district court has a general duty under the Federal rules of civil \nprocedure to entertain motions of parties and rule on them in an \norderly and timely fashion. This is clearly a serious and important \nresponsibility, particularly in a case such as this one that has \nremained under the district court's jurisdiction for 21 years. It is \nnot a duty that can be delegated to anyone else.\n  I see my friend from Missouri is prepared to speak. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment which \nwould place the Department in the process of authorizing the entry by \nthe Bell operating companies into the long distance markets.\n  Senate bill 652, which was the study result of much activity in \ncommittee and a long period of investigation, places the responsibility \nfor making that judgment in the FCC. It is important to understand what \nthe Federal Communication Commission is, how it is composed, why it is \nthe appropriate agency to make those kinds of decisions.\n  The Federal Communications Commission is a quasi-judicial body not \naffected by politics. Appointees are appointed for an extended period. \nThere are longer periods of appointments than the President's term is. \nIt is designed to be insulated from politics, to make professional \njudgments that are technical and appropriate to the field that the \nFederal Communications Commission oversees, and is technically \ncompetent and expert in the area of communications.\n  The amendment which we are considering now and upon which the Senate \nof the United States will act at 12:30 today is an amendment which \nwould have the Department come in and second-guess the judgment of the \nFederal Communications Commission by adding a Department-consent \nrequirement before these companies could move on to compete and extend \nand enhance the competition in the long-distance market.\n  I do not believe that kind of layering of the bureaucracies, I do not \nbelieve that kind of additional Federal and governmental involvement, \nwould promote competition.\n  As a matter of fact, that kind of bureaucratic involvement very \nfrequently does the opposite of promoting competition. The more \nbureaucracy that is involved, frequently the more difficult it is for \nenterprises to have the kind of flexibility that we really want \nenterprise to have to be competitive in an international marketplace \nwhich demands higher and higher levels of productivity.\n  Now, the bill as presented to this body by the committee, S. 652, is \nvery clear about the way it expects the decision to be made regarding \nthe entry of these competitors into the long-distance marketplace. As a \nmatter of fact, it says to the FCC that there is a list, a specific \nrecipe of conditions, that have to be met. In addition to the 14 or so \nconditions that are listed in the bill, there is another interest that \nis charged to the FCC that they must consider. It is the public \ninterest.\n  Here what we have in the bill is a governmental body, a quasi-\njudicial body, the regulatory commission called the FCC, the Federal \nCommunications Commission. The Congress in this body is telling them \nspecifically to make the decision based on these criteria and adds to \nthe 14 criteria the public interest.\n  Now, that ought to be enough governmental involvement to assure that \nwe make good decisions and the right decisions. However, the amendment \nwhich is now being considered would add the Department in a totally new \nand different and unprecedented role for the Department, one in which \nthey have not been involved before. The Department would be asked to \nimplement a supervisory authority here and to make a final decision \nabout whether these companies could enter the long-distance competitive \nmarketplace.\n  That final decision is something they have never exercised before. \nEven under the court orders relating to the divestiture from AT of \nthe Bell companies and setting up the Bell operating companies around \nthe country, the regional Bell companies, the Department did not have \nfinal authority. The Department went before a judicial decisionmaker \nand advocated a position.\n  Now, the Department should not be given a decisionmaking authority in \nthis matter because the decisionmaking authority is given to the FCC. \nThe Department should be given an advisory role just like it has an \nadvisory or advocacy role in the current situation.\n  One important thing to remember is that Senate bill 652 does, in \nfact, provide for an advisory role for the Department. The FCC, in \nmaking its final determination about whether or not it will release the \nregional Bell operating companies to participate in the competition of \nthe long-distance markets, the FCC is directed to consult with and to \nseek the advice of the Justice Department.\n But, it would be unprecedented for us to move beyond that traditional \nrole of the Justice Department to ask the Justice Department to be \nmaking final decisions. Because, as a matter of fact, that has never \nbeen its role in any previous situation and should not be its role now. \nThe FCC is that Commission that is a quasi-judicial body that can make \nthose decisions, is trained to make them, is expert in the \ncommunications industry, and ought to be the final authority.\n\n  So it is pretty clear to me, and I believe it ought to be clear to \nthe U.S. Senate, that the FCC should retain that final authority and \nthat the Department of Justice be maintained in its advisory authority \nthat the bill, S. 652, provides. The amendment which would enhance the \nadvisory authority is unnecessary and would be counterproductive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that we have \ncontrolled debate beginning at the hour of 11:30.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 having arrived, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the Dorgan and Thurmond \namendments, with 1 hour equally divided prior to a motion to table.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Parliamentary inquiry, who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the two managers of \nthe bill.\n[[Page S8217]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous-consent \nagreement I will have to yield 5 minutes off the amendment's time, from \nwhat I understand of the parliamentary situation. I am prepared to \nyield 5 minutes, but I make it clear I will reserve the last 15 minutes \nfor managers of the bill to speak. I believe we should reserve about 15 \nminutes for Senators Dorgan and Thurmond to speak, if they come to the \nfloor.\n  So I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In that event, I withdraw my request for unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business and ask the Chair to inform me \nwhen 5 minutes has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there has been quite a bit of debate on \nthis issue. It has been suggested that those of us who oppose the \nDepartment of Justice having a special and unprecedented role of final \ndecisionmaking in this arena do not trust the Department of Justice.\n  We trust the Department of Justice. But we trust it to maintain its \ntraditional role. We trust it to be a law enforcement agency and an \nadvisor as it relates to legality and propriety of measures that relate \nto the law. But we do not trust it to do something totally new, \nsomething different, nor do we trust it to second-guess an \nadministrative agency that has expertise in this area, the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  So, this is not a question about whether the Department of Justice \nwill have a role. That question was laid to rest long ago. The FCC is \nrequired to consult, according to the language of the bill, with the \nAttorney General regarding the application during the 90-day period. \nThe Attorney General may analyze a Bell operating company's application \nunder any legal standard, including the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, \nand other antitrust laws, and those standards of the Clayton Act and \nthe Sherman Act are the kinds of standards that are suggested by the \namendment.\n  The difference between the bill, this bill, and the amendment which \nis proposed, is whether or not the Justice Department would have final \ndecisionmaking authority. All of its ability to advise and to argue and \nto participate by virtue of supplying its views are preserved and \nprotected under this bill. But to say the Department of Justice has \nseparate veto authority over the agency of expertise here would be to \ninject the Department of Justice at a policymaking level never before \nprovided for the Department of Justice, not only in this arena but in \nother arenas as well.\n  I just suggest that we do not need to change the character of the \nJustice Department from an enforcement arena and prosecutorial arena to \na policy-making arena. The policy should be judged by the Congress of \nthe United States and the policy is set forth clearly here, in the kind \nof guidelines that we would seek to suggest for the Federal \nCommunications Commission. This amendment will make a mandate of the \nadvisory role of the Department of Justice, a mandated final \ndecisionmaking role, and it will provide for confusion with two Federal \nagencies seeking to make final decisions instead of one.\n  The Federal Communications Commission is a professional, quasi-\njudicial organization with 5-year terms. The Department of Justice is \nan appointed position, appointed by the President of the United States. \nIt has all the benefits of political involvement and has the drawbacks \nof political involvement. I do not believe we want political decisions \nto be made, the influence or contamination of politics to find their \nway into this particular set of decisions.\n  I believe it is important for us to reject this overlapping, doubling \nup of enforcement at the Federal level, the duplication of \ndecisionmaking. The professional, trained, expert Federal \nCommunications Commission can make this decision with the advice of the \nDepartment of Justice. For us to try to have redundant and duplicative \nFederal control here is for us to reject the promise of the future. \nSome look into the future and shrink back in fear. I think this is a \ngreat opportunity.\n  In closing, I would say I do not think the competitors of the United \nStates, as they are working on a framework for operations for \ntelecommunications, are going to be thinking about how many layers of \nregulation they can place on top of this industry. I do not think they \nare going to think about how much duplicative and redundant control, or \nwhether they are going to convert what had otherwise been law \nenforcement agencies into policymaking agencies and to have a tug of \nwar between two agencies of the Federal Government which would stymie \nexpansion and development and growth in the industry.\n  I think our competitors around the world are going to try to seize \nand regain the advantage that America currently has in \ntelecommunications. For us to add the Department of Justice, not as an \nadviser--that is already in the bill--but as a final decisionmaker to \ncompete with another agency trained to get this job done would be \nunwise.\n  So I urge the rejection of the amendment which would make the \nDepartment of Justice a final decisionmaker in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand it, time is divided \nbetween the two managers. I take it on this side we would manage the 30 \nminutes for the proponents. In no way do I propose this amendment. I \nhope to kill it. But I yield such time as the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate the kindness.\n  I can read the handwriting on the wall, Mr. President. The majority \nleader opposes this amendment, the Democratic leader opposes it, the \nDemocratic whip, the Republican whip, the manager of the bill, the \nRepublican chairman, the Democratic ranking member--all oppose this \namendment.\n  So what I find interesting is the hyperbole that gets layered upon \nthe argument against that the Department of Justice is overreaching, \nthat they are incompetent. That is an argument that I just heard the \nSenator from South Dakota use against the Department to demonstrate \nthat they are incompetent. It takes a long time, 1,500 days I heard \nfrom the Senator from South Dakota say.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example of the reason it takes a long \ntime. Maybe the Senator from South Dakota thinks the Department of \nJustice should have this waiver. In 1994, Southwestern Bell and three \nother RBOC's filed a request to vacate the final modified judgment to \nsimply completely eliminate its restrictions without replacing those \nrestrictions with any consumer safeguard, with any requirement such as \nthose contained in S. 652. That was the waiver application. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from Missouri talk about all this \noverreaching regulation. Perhaps they would like to have the Department \nof Justice approve this waiver, get it out of the way in a hurry.\n  Is that what the Senator from South Dakota has been arguing for when \nhe talks about delays? Is this the sort of thing he wants them to \napprove? Let us not come to the floor and talk about 1,500-day delays. \nIt is being delayed because of this kind of thing. Nobody, I do not \nbelieve anybody; maybe there is; maybe someone down here says what we \nshould have had was the Department of Justice approving this kind of \nwaiver. Then S. 652 would not be necessary. Maybe that is the feeling \nhere, we do not want any consumer protection. We do not care if there \nis local competition. Forget the checklist. Forget the VIII(c) test, \nand all that nonsense. Let these guys go out and have at it, take their \nmonopoly and run with it, and use the power in any fashion they want.\n  I do not think so. I think the structure of this bill implies that we \nare concerned about this monopoly power and that we want some restraint \nas we move to a competitive environment. And the Department of Justice \nhas been attempting to measure that as [[Page S8218]] they evaluate \nthese waivers. My colleagues will come down and say, ``Oh, no. Another \nlayer of bureaucracy.''\n  Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past. I call my colleagues' \nattention to the last major deregulation action in airlines when the \nDepartment of Justice again was given a consultative role. They \nbasically had the opportunity to file a brief. They would just as well \nwrite their opinion on the wall of a bathroom for all the impact it \nhas.\n  Now we have in this case the airlines being deregulated. Now comes \nTWA and a hub in St. Louis wanting to acquire Ozark Airlines. The \nDepartment of Transportation gets the application as the FCC would in \nthis case. Now we have Northwest Airlines trying to acquire Republic \nAirlines in the hub serving Minneapolis. The Department of Justice \nsaid: In our opinion, you will get less competition. That is our \nopinion. That is all the law allows, just an expression of their \nopinion. They vigorously, in fact, said you are going to get less \ncompetition. The Department of Transportation says your opinion is as \ngood as anybody else's. We ignore it. Guess what? There is less \ncompetition and higher prices in both of those hubs as a consequence of \nthose actions.\n  We are not talking about another layer of regulation. The Department \nof Justice is not asking to intervene and get involved in something \nabout which they know nothing.\n  We are asking with this amendment, which is obviously going to get \ndefeated--the opponents of this deal are lined up, in effect. We have \nbeen working long and hard, and are likely to get 40 votes for this \nthing. But I will stand here and predict that the Department of Justice \nis going to issue an opinion on an action taken by a local telephone \ncompany that the consumers are going to get less competition, not more. \nThey are going to get less competition. They are going to file an \nopinion. That opinion will be ignored by the FCC, and Members will be \nup here saying, ``Gee, that was not quite what we had in mind.''\n  So we are not asking for increased regulatory authority. Please do \nnot talk about the delays unless you are prepared to identify a \nspecific waiver that you think should be approved. Let us talk about \nthe waiver. I alert my colleagues that we will have an opportunity on \nadditional amendments to revisit this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill, and I \nalso thank the chairman of the full Commerce Committee, who has really \ndone a marvelous job, along with the ranking member and former \nchairman, Senator Hollings.\n  We are not newcomers to this issue. I do not doubt for a minute the \ndedication that the Senator from Nebraska has in modernizing \ntelecommunications, because we have been on panels together and we have \nbeen to different places together, and understand in his State, where \ndistance learning and telemedicine is becoming very, very important, \nand also the new technology and the policy it is going to take to force \nthat new technology into the rural areas. That is where our first love \nlies. I think the same could be said about South Carolina and the same \ncould be said about South Dakota. But S. 652 already gives the Justice \nDepartment a role. It is spelled out clearly.\n  It says, before making any determination:\n\n       The Commission shall consult the Attorney General regarding \n     the application. In consulting with the Commission, the \n     Attorney General may apply any appropriate standard.\n\n  That is the language that is in this bill. Do we start talking about \nthose who have the expertise in regulating or do we talk about an \norganization that has the expertise in litigating? What is the primary \npurpose of the Department of Justice? I would say if the administration \nin their view thinks that some Federal law has been broken, they advise \nthe Department of Justice to look into it. The same with the Congress. \nThat is what the Department of Justice does. They are not in the \nprocess of rulemaking. I think that is left to the FCC and, of course, \nthose of us who want to take the responsibility of setting policy where \nit should be set, here in this body, and not shirk our responsibilities \nor our duties in order to set that policy.\n  The Senator from Nebraska says that there should be a larger role. \nThat is what he is advocating. All we have to do is look back at the \nmodified final judgment. How is it being administered today? It is \nbeing administered by the court, by Judge Greene, who has done an \nadmirable job? Nobody can criticize Judge Greene. But the U.S. district \ncourt retains jurisdiction over those companies that were party to the \nMFJ. The court then asked the Justice Department, the Antitrust \nDivision, to assume postdecree duties--``post,'' after it is all over, \nit is asked to do those duties. The antitrust division provides Judge \nHarold Greene of the district court with the recommendations regarding \nwaivers and other matters regarding the administration of MFJ.\n  Before we can do anything to deal with new technology, to force those \nnew technologies and those tools out to the American people, yes, there \nhave to be rules of entry. But we do not have to add layer upon layer \nof bureaucracy. If there is one thing that is being talked about around \nthis town right now, it is the budget and spending. What do we spend \nour money for? It is my determination, after being here about 6 years, \nthat if there is one thing that absolutely costs the taxpayers more \nmoney and the waste of money in Government, it is not that they are not \ndoing a good job. It is called redundancy. Everybody wants to do the \nsame thing. Everybody wants their finger in the same pie. Just look at \nthe Department of the Interior. It is probably the greatest example. \nEvery Department has a wildlife biologist. Wildlife biologists, by the \nway, are kind of like attorneys. If you get three of them together, you \nare not going to get an agreement. Everybody has a different approach.\n  So basically what my position and my opinion is is that this is just \nanother layer, another hoop to jump through before we finally \nderegulate. We want to be regulatory in nature and not more regulation \nor redundancy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be defeated. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 18 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor the proponents be managed by the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. They are \nthe proponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to designate the \nmanager.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota yield \nto me 15 seconds to correct a statement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. Earlier I said that the opponents of this included the \nDemocratic leader. The Democratic leader is on our side. He is against \nthe law in its current form, and is in support of the Dorgan-Thurmond \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I might say that when Senator Thurmond comes, he will want to be \nable to speak. So I will speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, how much time does each side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 18\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from North Dakota has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a lot of statements have been made in this \ndebate about the role of the Justice Department. Many of the statements \nthat were made were surprising to me.\n  Let us back up just for a moment and ask ourselves who investigated \nand sued to break up the Bell system monopoly which resulted in the \nvery competition that is extolled here on the floor of the Senate as \ndriving down prices in the long distance market? Who did that? It was \nthe Justice Department that did that. Yet, we are confronted with the \ndebate today that says, ``Gee, the Justice Department is a roadblock. \nThe Justice Department is a problem. We are talking about layers \n[[Page S8219]] of bureaucracy and layers of complexity.''\n  If you stand here and extol the virtues of competition in long \ndistance and talk about the fact there are now over 500 companies from \nwhich you can choose to get long distance service and therefore lower \nprices because there is such robust competition, you must, it seems to \nme, recognize we got to that point because of the Justice Department. \nAnd if you recognize we got there because of the Justice Department, \nyou cannot stand on this amendment and say somehow the Justice \nDepartment is a roadblock. I am telling you it is interesting to me to \nhear people preach about competition but then not be willing to vote \nfor the things that promote the very competition they preach about.\n  Competition works when you have many competitors in a competitive \nenvironment with the price as the mechanism for competition. \nCompetition works in a free market when the market is free. But \ncompetition does not work when you have concentrations such that some \ncan begin to control portions of the marketplace.\n  Now, all we are asking in this amendment that is now a second-degree \namendment supported by Senator Thurmond, myself, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Kerrey, and others, is that the Justice Department have a role \nto play on the issue of antitrust, on the Clayton 7 standard, and we \nhave delineated the difference between the FCC role and the Justice \nrole.\n  Next time somebody stands up and says there is overlapping \nresponsibilities, that is nonsense, total nonsense. There is not an \noverlap here. It is precisely the purpose of this amendment. So it just \ndoes not work to claim that this is overlap and complexity. It is not \ntrue. It is not the case. But you cannot preach about competition and \nthen indicate that you support taking the agency out of this process \nthat is the agency which evaluates competition and makes sure there is \ncompetition in the marketplace. It just does not square with good logic \nthat if you are a friend of the free marketplace you would not support \nthe things that are necessary and important to keep the marketplace \nfree.\n  I offered an amendment earlier, and I was not benefited by hearing \nthe Senator from Nebraska speak on it. I am sure he says it was \nwonderful and eloquent, and I am sure that may well have been the case, \nbut I missed it, nonetheless. It is likely he will repeat it, I am \nsure, so I will probably have the benefit of hearing it in the future. \nBut I offered the amendment on broadcast ownership, and it is exactly \nthe same principle as the issue of the Justice Department. Those who \nsay let us have robust competition in telecommunications and then say, \nby the way, we are going to eliminate the ownership restrictions--you \ncan go out and buy 85 television stations if you like; it does not \nmatter to us what kind of concentration exists--well, they are no \nfriend of competition. That is not being a friend of the free \nmarketplace.\n  I am just saying on these amendments, especially this Justice \namendment but also, when that is done, the amendment on broadcast \nownership, if you really believe--and I do--in the free marketplace, \nthen you have to be a shepherd out here making sure that the \nmarketplace remains free. There are all kinds of natural economic \ncircumstances that move to attempt to impinge on the free marketplace. \nConcentration, concentration of assets and concentration of ownership \nis always, I repeat always, a circumstance where you see less \ncompetition and a marketplace that is less free. Concentration is, in \nmy judgment, the kind of circumstance that tends to erode free markets \nand tends to undermine competition. The underlying amendment that we \nare going to discuss and vote on as the Justice Department amendment is \nsimply an amendment that says when you are evaluating when there is \ncompetition in the local exchanges so then that the regional Bell \noperating companies are free to go compete in long distance, we want \nthe Justice Department to have a role in that evaluation because they \nare the experts in antitrust. That is the issue here.\n  Now, one can vote against this amendment, I suppose, and claim, well, \nthis bill is a free market bill that frees the free market forces; it \nstokes the juices of competition; it is going to be wonderful for the \nAmerican people; it is nirvana in the future.\n  It is nonsense. It is all doubletalk if one does not support the \nbasic tenets of keeping the free market free. And one of those basic \ntenets, in my judgment, is to make sure that the Justice Department has \na role in this circumstance.\n  So I have been involved in these discussions before, as has the \nSenator from Nebraska, and others in this Chamber about deregulation. \n``Deregulation,'' they just chant that. They ought to wear robes and \nchant it around here--deregulation, deregulation.\n  So we deregulated airlines. Guess what, we deregulated the airlines. \nWonderful. I said it before. If you are from Chicago, God bless you; \nyou sure got the benefits from deregulation. If your cousin lives in \nLos Angeles, boy, you got a great deal. If you go out of O'Hare and fly \nto Los Angeles, you get dirt cheap prices. You have all kinds of \ncarriers competing. That is competition. But go to Nebraska and see \nwhat you get from deregulation of airline service, or go to North \nDakota and see what you get, or go to South Dakota and see what you get \nfrom deregulation of the airline service. It is not pretty. You do not \nhave robust competition. You do not have prices, a competitive \nallocatur here. What you have is less service and higher costs.\n  And in the airline deregulation, it is interesting; we have, in my \njudgment, a parallel because in airline deregulation, when we talk \nabout whether airlines should be allowed to merge and whether we should \nhave these concentrations, the issue was should the Department of \nTransportation allow the merger to happen. And the Department of \nJustice was asked in a consultative role.\n  Well, what we see as a result of airline deregulation is that big \nairlines have gotten much, much bigger. How? They have gotten bigger by \nbuying all of their regional competitors, and the Department of Justice \nin some of those cases said it is not in the public interest. And the \nDepartment of Transportation said tough luck; we are going to allow the \nmerger anyway.\n  We have experience directly on this point, and if in the rush to \nderegulation we do not have the kind of care and patience to make \ncertain that the free market is free and that robust competition \nexists, we will do the consumers of this country no favor, I guarantee \nyou. We will have had a lot of dialog; we will have used a lot of \nslogans; and we will have waved our hankies around talking about \ncompetition and all the wonderful words that have been focus grouped \nand tested, and so on, but all of them will not be worth a pile of \nrefuse if we do not do the right thing to make sure that competition \nexists.\n  You cannot preach competition and then be unwilling to practice it in \nterms of the safeguards that are necessary to assure that free markets \nare free, and that is the purpose of this amendment. I hope those who \ncare about real competition and care about real free markets and those \nwho are willing to make sure the guardians of free markets are able to \nhave a role here, I hope they will come and vote yes on the Thurmond-\nDorgan second-degree amendment. I understand the motion will be to \ntable, so I guess in that case I will hope that they will come and \noppose the motion to table so that we can pass our amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I understand \nSenator Thurmond will wish to access some of the time when he arrives \nin the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the previous order, at 12:30 I be recognized to make a \nmotion to table the Thurmond amendment 1265, as modified and, if the \namendment is tabled, amendment 1264 be automatically withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I did not \nunderstand the last portion of the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Amendment 1264 be automatically withdrawn. That will be \nthe Senator's underlying amendment.\n[[Page S8220]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is talking about if the motion to table \nprevails.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is correct. I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, at 12:30 I be recognized to make a \nmotion to table the Thurmond amendment, as modified and, if the \namendment is tabled, amendment 1264 be automatically withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this has been a long debate and many \nspeakers have come to the floor on each side. I strongly believe that \nwe should vote to table the Thurmond amendment because it creates a new \nrole, an unprecedented, unnecessary role for the Department of Justice.\n  Presently, there are many safeguards to consumers and to companies \nand to the public built into this legislation. This legislation was the \nresult of meeting after meeting for over 3 months, every night and \nSaturday and Sunday among Republicans and Democrats, to come together \nto reach a bipartisan bill. We came up with a plan that the regulatory \nagency, the FCC, would be the decisionmaker while the Justice \nDepartment would still be involved.\n  In the first step, when a company is applying, the State certifies \ncompliance with a market-opening requirement. So that is a safeguard. \nSecond, the FCC affirms public interest, necessity, and convenience.\n  We had a vote here the other day on this floor preserving public \ninterest, so the FCC can use the public interest standard.\n  Third of all, the FCC certifies compliance with a 14-point checklist. \nI have the 14 points listed here in another chart. The point is that in \nthe bipartisan meetings and building on the legislation of last year \nand building on efforts of many Senators--indeed, all 100 Senators were \nconsulted during this process leading up to the markup in the Senate \nCommerce Committee--there was a question: Shall we use the VIII(c) \ntest, which is a complicated test, or shall we use the Clayton 7 test, \nand we decided to come up with a checklist, a competitive checklist.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Dakota yield \nfor one quick moment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I shall not interrupt at length. I did want to point out \nthe Senator from South Dakota is correct, an enormous amount of work \nwent into the construct of the compromise. It is also true, is it not, \nthat the Commerce Committee held this legislation up? The intent was to \nwant to move this along quickly, and many of us were cooperative with \nthat.\n But we at the committee hearing indicated that we were uncomfortable \nwith several of these provisions and intended to deal with them on the \nfloor of the Senate. So these issues, many of them, were raised in the \nmarkup of the Commerce Committee and only with the cooperation of \nMembers who decided to raise the issues on the floor rather than in the \ncommittee was the bill able to be brought to the floor.\n\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is correct. I welcome amendments. I welcome this \namendment. I am giving a history of how we came to this checklist. I \nthink the point I am making is that we have had a very bipartisan \neffort here, and we welcomed amendments there in the committee, and we \nwelcome amendments here. Obviously, every member of every committee can \nbring something to the floor. But this checklist was worked out an a \nbipartisan basis. Before the local Bell company can be declared as \nhaving an open market, it has to interconnect. That is the first point. \nThat is, they have to open up their wires so others can come in. They \nhave to show the capability to exchange telecommunications between Bell \ncustomers and competitor's customers, access to poles, ducts, conduits \nand rights-of-way; the three unbundling standards, where they have to \nunbundle the system so other people can get in; access to 911 and \nenhanced 911; directory assistance and operator call completion \nservices; white pages directory listing; access to telephone number \nassignment; access to data bases and network signaling; number \nportability; local dialing parity; reciprocal compensation, and the \nresale rules.\n  That is a checklist that the FCC must go through to determine if the \nBell company has opened up its business so other competitors have a \nfair opportunity to compete in the local telephone business. I have not \nheard anyone criticize this checklist. It seems to be universally \naccepted. Also, the Bells have additional requirements on them to open \ntheir markets. This is done at the FCC level and not Justice, and the \nBells must comply with a separate subsidiary requirement, \nnondiscrimination requirement and a cross-subsidization ban. The FCC \nmust allow the Department of Justice full participation in all of its \nproceedings. So the Department of Justice is already present without \nthe Thurmond amendment.\n  Now, the Bells must comply with existing FCC rules and rigorous \nannual audits, elaborate cost accounting, computer-assisted reporting, \nand special pricing rules. So there is much involvement. The Sherman \nAntitrust Act is in place. The Clayton Act is in place. The Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act is in place. So the Justice Department has plenty to do. I \nfind this debate very unusual because it implies we are going to get \nthe Justice Department involved. They are involved at every stage. In \naddition, under the Hobbs Civil Appeals Act, the Department of Justice \nis involved as an independent party in all FCC appeals.\n  The Justice Department is involved every step of the way. If there is \ndisagreement and there is an appeal, the Justice Department can be a \nparty to that.\n  Mr. President, the Justice Department is meant to be, under its \nenabling legislation, an enforcer of law. It is trying to become a \nGovernment regulation agency. Now, it did become that to some extent \nunder Judge Greene's 1982 order. That order arose because Congress \nfailed to act. Congress failed to do what we are trying to do now. \nCongress failed to require that the local exchanges be opened up, as \nthe checklist requires. But we are doing that now in this legislation. \nWe are finally doing it. Meanwhile the Department of Justice is very \nmuch intent, it seems, upon becoming a regulatory agency.\n  I have pointed out the length of time it takes the Department of \nJustice to get these things done. Judge Greene suggested 30 days. They \nare up to almost 3 years. I know they have given this excuse or that \nexcuse, but the point is that Judge Greene thought it could be done in \n30 days, originally, in 1982. A bureaucracy such as that will take a \nlong time to produce a piece of paper. That will slow down the process \nand hurt consumers.\n  It is my feeling that if we can pass this bill in a deregulatory \nfashion, it will cause an explosion of new investment in activities and \ndevices. I frequently have compared it to the Oklahoma Land Rush--if we \ncan pass it. Right now, our companies are investing overseas, and they \nare not investing here.\n  People are trying to say this is anticonsumer. That is nonsense. Look \nat what happened when competition opened up the market for cellular \nphones. The price has dropped. Look at what happened when we \nderegulated natural gas. Prices have dropped. It is my opinion that a \nlong distance call should cost only a few cents. It is my opinion that \ncable television rates should drop when there is more competition from \nDBS and video dial tone. If we get yet another regulatory agency \ninvolved, we can delay this thing 2 or 3 years. In fact, based on the \nJustice Department's performance, it will delay this whole operation \nfor 2 to 3 years before we have competition and deregulation.\n  This is a deregulatory, procompetitive bill. We are trying to put \neverybody into everybody else's business. Mr. President, there has been \na lot of talk about corporate activity on these bills. There is an \nimplication that the Commerce Committee bill has a lot of corporate \ninput. But I say to you, read the newspapers of the last 3 weeks, and \nyou will see all those full-page ads. They are paid for by \ncorporations, and I admire them. They are fine corporations, members of \nthe so-called Competitive Long Distance Coalition, which is headed by a \nperson whom I respect very much, a former leader of this body, with \nwhom I disagree on this matter. A vast amount of the corporate \nadvertising in the last month has been [[Page S8221]] by corporations \nopposed to my position. I point that out because there seems to be some \nsuggestion that S. 652 simply represents corporate thinking. Well, all \nthe ads I have seen in the papers--the full-page ads--have been run by \ncorporations that oppose my position and want the extra Justice \nDepartment role. That is because some corporations want to use \nGovernment regulation against competition. That is what is going on \nhere.\n  I think that we should defeat the Thurmond amendment because it is, \nas my colleague from South Carolina said, not only the camel's nose \nunder the tent, it is the whole camel under the tent, so-to-speak, \nbecause once the Justice Department gets in, they will try to expand \ntheir regulatory role, as in the Ameritech case. I cited specifically \nthe regulatory approach they have taken in that case. They want to have \npeople over there writing telephone books--literally writing telephone \nbooks. They are supposed to be lawyers enforcing the antitrust laws in \nthe Justice Department.\n  So I hope that we defeat this amendment. I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time do the proponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 13 minutes \n10 seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOhio, Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it has been argued on this floor time and \ntime again that, under this bill, the Department of Justice could still \nenforce the antitrust laws. That is true. That is technically true.\n  But the facts are that under the bill, the Department could still \nenforce the antitrust laws after--after--the phone companies move into \nthe new markets.\n  That is the problem. That is exactly the problem. It is like, Mr. \nPresident, enforcing the law after the fox has been allowed to guard \nthe chicken coop. At that point, the damage is done. The fox has \nalready eaten the chickens. We can stop the fox, but we cannot get the \nchickens back. It is too late.\n  In this particular case, we would be enforcing the law after \ncompetition has been driven out, after choices have been eliminated. So \nwhile the argument is technically true, it certainly falls short and \ndoes not disclose the full story.\n  Mr. President, we should enforce the law and ensure competition \nbefore competition is driven out.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, in support of the Thurmond second-degree \namendment. The goal of the bill we are considering today is to promote \ncompetition in the telecommunications industry. The Thurmond amendment \nis an attempt to make sure that we use the most effective means toward \nthis end.\n  Mr. President, the American people know when we have competition two \ngood things happen: consumers have more choice, prices go down. This is \nas true in telecommunications as in any other sector of the economy.\n  What we are really debating today is how best to make competition \ntake root in the telecommunications industry. The question is, what \nagency is best equipped to undertake the task of policing competition \nin these markets?\n  It is my belief, Mr. President, that the Thurmond amendment offers \nthe most logical answer to that question.\n  Under this amendment, two agencies of Government play a role. Each of \nthe agencies is to play an important role, a role for which it is \nextremely well suited and in which it has a great deal of relevant \nexpertise. The Federal Communications Commission sets communications \npolicy. That is what the FCC does best. That is what they know how to \ndo.\n  Under the Thurmond amendment, that is what they will be doing. The \nAntitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice enforces \ncompetition. That is what the Justice Department does. That is what \nthey will do under the Thurmond amendment. The Thurmond amendment makes \nthe best possible use of each of these agencies. We do not need the FCC \nto hire a new staff of antitrust lawyers, a new layer of bureaucracy, \nto do something the Justice Department is already equipped to do. We \nneed to liberate the FCC to do what it does best. That is what the \nThurmond amendment does.\n  Equally important, Mr. President, in my opinion, is what the Thurmond \namendment does not do. It does not duplicate functions of Government. \nIt is emphatically not a question of simply adding the Justice \nDepartment on top of the FCC. The FCC has a role. The Justice \nDepartment, under the Thurmond amendment, has another distinctive, \ndifferent role, not duplicating.\n  The system envisioned under the Thurmond amendment, Mr. President, \nwill not cause delays in the licensing process. We have heard that time \nand time again. From the moment an application is made under the \nThurmond amendment, both the FCC and the Justice Department will have \nexactly 90 days, according to law, to make their ruling. These 90-day \nperiods will run concurrently, not sequentially.\n  The Department has experience in this area. They do it for a period \nof time. The Clayton Act sets a 30-day limit. They hit that timeframe. \nUnder this amendment, no layering of bureaucracies, no delays, just an \nintelligent division of labor in U.S. telecommunications policy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, that is what the Thurmond amendment \nwill accomplish. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his bold \nleadership in this area with this specific amendment. I urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wish to speak today in support of the \nDorgan amendment, an amendment, I firmly believe, that is so key for \nthe protection of consumers that frankly I must wonder how this bill \ngot out of committee without its inclusion.\n  Now Mr. President, on the substance of the amendment, I could do no \nbetter than to defer to the comments already made on this issue by my \ntwo colleagues, the distinguished Senators from Nebraska and North \nDakota, both of whom demonstrate a penetrating understanding of this \nvery difficult topic. I would, however, like to take a moment to \naddress this amendment from a perspective we've only occasionally heard \nin the debate on this bill--that of telephone and cable-TV rate-payers, \nboth in my State of Minnesota and across this Nation.\n  I would hazard a guess that all of my colleagues would join with me \nin supporting the stated goal of this legislation: increasing \ncompetition in local phone service as well as cable TV. All of us \nlikely agree that if competition is allowed to flourish, the biggest \nwinners will be the consumers, the ratepayers, the millions of citizens \nwho power the entire industry.\n  But, and here's where some of my colleagues and I part company, not \nall of us are ready simply to throw our trust to the companies that \nstand to profit from deregulation. Competition doesn't just happen, \nsometimes it must be nurtured to protect consumers against monopoly \ncontrol. The Dorgan amendment, by providing a role for the Department \nof Justice, recognizes this economic fact: this amendment is nothing \nmore than a circuit breaker which will trip only if--let me repeat, \nonly if--it is found that it would not be in the consumer's interest \nfor a local phone company to begin to expand its service. That's all \nthat it is.\n  Mr. President, the need for the continuation of consumer protections \nand antitrust circuit breakers is clear. With every passing day, we see \nmore integration in the telecommunications and information marketplace. \nOn Sunday, Mr. President, we saw the Lotus Corp. agree to a friendly \ntakeover by IBM. AT and McCaw Cellular will be joining forces, as \nwill other companies, in preparing for this newly de-regulated \ntelecommunications environment.\n  This integration at the top corporate level and the market position \nof many of these companies demands that consumers be given a voice--a \ntrusted voice--to speak for them in the coming years. No more trusted \nvoice could be found on this subject than that of the Department of \nJustice. It was through that Department's courageous leadership that \nthe old AT Ma Bell monopoly of old was broken apart--it was a long, \ntough fight, but this experience gained by the DOJ has been invaluable \nin guiding the breakup of the Bell system, and the development of \ncompetition in long distance and other services. It only makes sense \nthat we allow the DOJ to put this experience to use \n[[Page S8222]] again as we move into an exciting, but potentially \nrisky, new market.\n  The Dorgan amendment, as modified by the Thurmond second-degree \namendment, prescribes how this experience will be put to\n use. The amendment uses the expertise of both the FCC and the DOJ to \ntheir best advantage. Under the amendment, the FCC will conduct a more \nfocused public interest test to review whether the Bell companies face \ncompetition and adequately meet the checklist of services called for in \nthis bill--topics the FCC is well accustomed to dealing with. The DOJ \nwill conduct an analysis to ensure that a monopoly will not be \ncreated--again, a task that the DOJ is particularly qualified for. In \nthis way, responsibilities are clarified and redundancies between the \nFCC and the DOJ are elminated, and the consumer is protected.\n  Now for those who say this is a partisan issue, or those who would \ncharge that such protections are no longer needed, Mr. President I turn \nto the comments of Judge Robert Bork, a distinguished jurist and \nconservative commentator of the highest regard. Mr. President, Judge \nBork writes:\n\n       These restrictions [on the Bell companies] are still \n     supported by antitrust law and economic theory and should be \n     retained. The Bell companies' argument is that the decree's \n     line-of-business restrictions are relics of the 1970's, the \n     industry has changed dramatically, and the restrictions are \n     the product of outmoded thinking. To the contrary, the basic \n     facts of the industry that required the decree in the first \n     place, basically the monopolies of local service held by the \n     Bell companies, have not changed at all.\n\n  Without this amendment, Mr. President, this bill asks the Senate to \nannounce the equivalent of unilateral disarmament--the disarmament of \nthe consumer. As it stands right now, this bill says: Mr. and Ms. \nConsumer, you should give up the rate protections you've had over the \nyears, you should give up any Department of Justice role in this \nprocess, you should give up the years of antitrust experience built by \nthose who slew the multitentacled AT monopoly in the first place. And \nwhat are we going to replace them with? The promise made to consumers \nby all these unregulated, multinational, multibillion-dollar \ncorporations, that they will do what's in your best interest. A promise \nthat the monopolies of old will behave. A promise that consumers will \nbe protected, that service will be good and that rates will be \nreasonable.\n  Mr. President, I don't buy it. Without this amendment, the public \nwill be stripped of one of the key consumer protections they will ever \nhave in the coming years--the voice of the Department of Justice.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Thurmond and Dorgan. I applaud them for their \nleadership in the effort to provide the Department of Justice with a \nstrong decisionmaking role in the approval of regional bell operating \ncompany entry into long-distance telephony.\n  The importance of this amendment is underscored by the fact that S. \n652 terminates the modified final judgment which settled an antitrust \ncase against AT The MFJ provided a framework by which the regional \nbell operating companies could enter alternative lines of business. The \nDepartment of Justice has had an integral role in protecting consumers \nby applying the 8(c) test to the RBOC application for a waiver to enter \ninto restricted lines of business. The Department of Justice has \nensured that the RBOC's could not use their monopoly power to impinge \nupon the competition that has developed in long distance. However, S. \n652 vitiates the MFJ without providing any substantial safeguards for \nconsumers.\n  Had it not been for the antitrust efforts of the Department of \nJustice, which have been consistent through both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations over the last 25 years, we would not have \nthe competitive environment which exists today in long distance. DOJ \nhas been the watchdog for consumers in telecommunications and that is \nbecause antitrust laws are intended to be pro-competition and pro-\nconsumer. I urge my colleagues to keep in mind that antitrust laws \nexist not for the benefit of the competitors but for the benefits which \ntrue competition yields to consumers.\n  Now, as Congress is working toward deregulating telecommunications \nmarkets we must keep in mind that true competition will not prevail if \none group of players hold all the cards. The power of the local \nmonopoly is without equal in telecommunications markets. The advantages \nprovided to them over those with lesser market power, fewer resources, \nand limited opportunities to control entry by their competitors are \nwithout bounds. As we speak of competition, we must keep in mind that \ncompetition cannot exist in markets in which one player has a \nsubstantially better hand than his rivals--particularly when those \ntrump cards have been provided by the Federal Government in the form of \nregulated monopolies.\n  The Department of Justice is the proper agency to make sure that the \ndeck is not stacked against those attempting to compete fairly in the \nmarkets--that is to be sure that RBOC entry into long distance will not \nsubstantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any \nline of commerce in any section of the country. This test, as contained \nin section 7 of the Clayton Act, is one that has withstood the test of \n80 years of antitrust law. While it is not as strong as the test \ncurrently used by the Department of Justice which I would have \npreferred, known as the 8(c) test, it is a sound test to determine the \nappropriateness of RBOC entry into long distance.\n  Mr. President, this compromise amendment offered by my colleagues \naddresses many of the concerns which have been raised by the opponents \nof a decisionmaking role for the Department of Justice. First, by \nrequiring the Department of Justice to complete their review and make \ntheir recommendation in 90 days from receipt of the application, the \nRBOC's will be assured of an expeditious review of their request. That \nshould alleviate the concerns of those who fear that DOJ will drag \ntheir feet and impede the advancement of competitive telecommunications \nmarkets. It will also provide the RBOC's with an incentive not to \nsubmit overly broad applications that would not likely be approved.\n  Second, by narrowing slightly the breadth of the public interest test \nto be conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, the amendment \noffered by Senators Thurmond and Dorgan should also assuage the \nconcerns of the RBOC's who claim that a Department of Justice would \nonly duplicate the efforts of FCC.\n  Mr. President, I also reject the notion that the Department of \nJustice should only become involved after the damage has been done. \nSome contend that the appropriate role of the Department of Justice is \nonly to take antitrust actions against those engaging in \nanticompetitive behavior. That is, we should have more litigation tying \nup the resources of our Federal courts. I find that argument \nastonishing in a year in which so many of my colleagues are seeking \nlegislation which attempt to reduce unnecessary litigation. Mr. \nPresident, if litigation resulting from inadequate preventative \nmeasures is not unnecessary litigation I don't know what types of \nlawsuits might be categorized unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I continue to support the initial amendment offered by \nmy colleagues from North Dakota which would have used a stronger test \nto ensure there is no possibility that a monopolists could use its \npower to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter. However, \nthe compromise they have presented is a far more appealing than S. 652 \nin its current form which reverse the progress we have made toward \ngreater competition in long distance over the last 25 years. The \namendment before us employs a time-tested standard from the Clayton Act \nwhich should ensure that consumers are protected while RBOC's receive \nthe expeditious review they seek without unnecessary duplication of the \nfunctions of the FCC.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Wisconsin's attorney \ngeneral, James Doyle, supporting a decisionmaking role for the \nDepartment of Justice be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound compromise and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                [[Page S8223]] State of Wisconsin,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                         Madison, WI, May 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I understand that the antitrust \n     subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee today is \n     considering S. 652, Senator Pressler's bill that would lift \n     the court-ordered restrictions that are currently in place on \n     the Regional Bell Operating Companies, allowing RBOC's to \n     enter the fields of long distance services and equipment \n     manufacturing at such time as sufficient local competition \n     exists in their service areas.\n       Several antitrust issues loom large in S. 652. For one \n     thing, despite (or, perhaps, because of) its unmatched skill \n     and expertise in evaluating competition in the \n     telecommunications field, the U.S. Department of Justice is \n     given no role whatsoever under S. 652 in assessing in advance \n     whether local competition exists in each region of the \n     country sufficient to, in turn, give the go ahead to the \n     relevant RBOC to enter the markets for long distance services \n     and equipment manufacturing. Moreover, the Pressler bill \n     repeals the current restriction on cross-ownership of cable \n     and telephone companies in the same service area by \n     permitting telephone companies to buy out local cable \n     companies, their most likely competitor, thereby allowing \n     movement to a ``one-wire world'' with only antitrust \n     litigation to prevent it. In addition, the bill would preempt \n     states from ordering 1+ intraLATA dialing parity until such \n     time as an RBOC was permitted to enter the interLATA long \n     distance market.\n       I am not alone in strongly opposing these features of the \n     bill. For example, a letter dated April 5, 1995, from \n     Congressman Henry Hyde, Chairman of the House Judiciary \n     Committee, to Congressman Thomas Bliley, Jr., chairman of the \n     House Committee on Commerce, stresses the need for a strong \n     role for the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of \n     Justice in any telecommunications legislation:\n       ``[L]egislation directed at changing or replacing an \n     antitrust consent decree, needs to encompass an antitrust \n     law, competition perspective as well as a communications law, \n     regulatory perspective.\n       ``[T]here will * * * have to be an evaluation of \n     marketplace conditions on a case-by-case basis. That is, the \n     actual and potential state of competition--in individual \n     states, metropolitan areas and rural areas--will have to be \n     analyzed.\n       ``Using relevant factors as an administrative checklist [as \n     proposed in S. 652] makes sense, but the key will be the \n     decision-making mechanism regarding whether these conditions \n     are actually present in a particular case. This review should \n     be undertaken simultaneously by both the Justice Department \n     and FCC, with DOJ applying an antitrust standard and FCC \n     applying a communications law test. The statute should \n     contain firm deadlines for review by both agencies.\n       ``DOJ is far less likely to challenge Bell entry if they \n     are involved in the decision-making process leading up to \n     Bell entry.''\n       Significantly, on April 3, Ameritech, the U.S. Department \n     of Justice, AT, MCI and the Consumer's Union announced that \n     they had all agreed (subject, of course, to approval by Judge \n     Greene) to a waiver of the Modified Final Judgment allowing \n     two Ameritech local service areas--Chicago, Illinois, and \n     Grand Rapids, Michigan, to be used as ``test sites.'' At such \n     time as the U.S. Department of Justice determines that actual \n     competition exists in those areas, Ameritech may then enter \n     the market for long distance services originating from those \n     areas. Significantly, both of these developments--the Hyde \n     letter and the Ameritech agreement--occurred in the few days \n     immediately following the Senate Commerce Committee's March \n     31 action on S. 652.\n       The April 3 agreement demonstrates that the most forward-\n     thinking of the RBOC's, Ameritech (branded a ``traitor'' by \n     its fellow RBOC's, all adamantly opposed to a ``gate keeper'' \n     role for the U.S. Department of Justice), appreciates the \n     importance of a meaningful U.S. Department of Justice role in \n     the decision-making process leading to the opening of new \n     telecommunications markets.\n       In my opinion, S. 652 is flawed in certain other respects, \n     not relating to competition law, and I will comment on those \n     features of the bill in due course. Because, however, S. 652 \n     is before your antitrust subcommittee today, I wish to be on \n     record as opposing those features of the bill that offend \n     sound antitrust principles: the elimination of any decision-\n     making role for the U.S. Department of Justice; the repeal of \n     the prohibition against mergers of telephone companies and \n     cable television companies located in the same service areas, \n     and preemption of the state's ability to order 1+ intraLATA \n     dialing party in appropriate cases.\n       It is critical that federal law ensure a competitive \n     environment in telecommunications for the good of the public. \n     Responsibility for making determinations of sufficient \n     competition should remain in the hands of the Antitrust \n     Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E. Doyle,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at a time when we are trying to address the \nderegulation of the telecommunications industry, to further enhance the \nrole of the Department of Justice would be counterproductive.\n  The Federal Communications Commission [FCC] regulates the \ncommunications industry. The Department of Justice [DOJ] enforces \nantitrust laws.\n  The pending legislation, S. 652, supersedes the provisions of \nmodification of final judgment [MFJ], that govern Bell Co. entry into \nbusinesses now prohibited to them. Once legislation is signed into law, \na continued DOJ role in telecommunications policy is no longer \nnecessary except in the area of enforcing the law.\n  The Department of Justice does not need an ongoing regulatory role as \npart of an update of our Nation's communications policy. Actual \nregulatory oversight is not what DOJ is equipped to provide.\n  DOJ's claim that ``it alone among government agencies understands \nmarketplace issues as opposed to regulatory issues,'' is inaccurate. \nThe FCC has a long history of reviewing and analyzing communications \nmarkets. Besides, S. 652 already gives the Justice Department a role \nwhich is clearly defined in the language of the bill.\n  S. 652 states that:\n\n       Before making any determination, the Commission shall \n     consult with the Attorney General regarding the application. \n     In consulting with the Commission, the Attorney General may \n     apply any appropriate standard.\n\n  Dual DOJ and FCC bureaucracies to regulate the communications \nindustry delays the benefits competition brings consumers. if we are \ngoing to strengthen the role of DOJ, why even bother trying to reform \nthe 1934 act? After all, one of the main purposes for passing \ntelecommunications reform legislation is to establish a national policy \nso that the MFJ can be phased out.\n  Mr. President, providing this authority to the Justice Department is \nunprecedented. The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has \nnever had decision-making authority over regulated industries--or any \nindustry. In addition, assigning a decision-making role to the \nDepartment of Justice establishes a dangerous precedent that could be \nexpanded to other industries.\n  Mr. President, more regulation is not what this bill needs. Again, \ndual roles for the DOJ and FCC will only delay competition. It will \nonly delay the benefits of competition such as: Lower prices, new \nservices, and more choice for communications services and new jobs. The \nonly jobs that this amendment will provide is new jobs for lawyers at \nthe Department of Justice.\n  For those who may consider this necessary, let's briefly take a look \nat the job the DOJ has done in administering the MFJ. It is important \nto note that the Antitrust Division at Justice does not currently have \ndecision-making authority over the MFJ. That sole authority is held in \nthe U.S. District Court, in the person of Judge Harold Greene. The \nAntitrust Division essentially serves to staff Judge Greene on the MFJ, \nproviding him with recommendations on waivers and other matters under \nthe administration of the MFJ.\n  In 1984, the average age of waiver requests pending at year end was a \nlittle under 2 months. By the end of 1993, the average age of pending \nwaivers had grown to 3 years. Delays such as these are simply \ninconsistent with an evolving competitive market.\n  In addition, the Justice Department is responsible for conducting \nreviews every 3 years, known as the triennial review, at which \nrecommendations to the court are made regarding the continued need for \nrestrictions implemented under the MFJ.\n  These reviews were to provide the parties to the MFJ a benchmark by \nwhich they could gain relief.\n  Mr. President, since 1982, only one triennial review has been \nconducted.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Department of Justice's track record in \nfulfilling its obligations under the MFJ is poor. Therefore, I would \nquestion the advisability of giving the DOJ an unprecedented role, \nabove and beyond what they currently have under the MFJ.\n  Mr. President, S. 652 contains clear congressional policy. There is \nno reason why two Federal entities should have independent authority \nover determining whether that policy has been met. Again, let us not \nlose sight of what we are trying to achieve here. [[Page S8224]] \n  The ultimate goal of reforming the 1934 act should be to establish a \nnational policy framework that will accelerate the private sector \ndeployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies \nand services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets \nto competition, which will create jobs, increase productivity, and \nprovide better services at a lower cost to consumers.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the motion to table the \nThurmond-D'Amato-DeWine-Inhofe second degree amendment.\n  Many things have been stated in this Chamber over the last several \ndays about my amendment to protect competition and consumers by \nproviding that antitrust principles will be applied by the Department \nof Justice in determining when Bell operating companies should be \nallowed to enter long distance. Now that we are about to vote on a \nmotion to table, it is my belief that we must focus on just three basic \npoints in deciding how to proceed on this pivotal issue.\n  First, the opponents of my amendment assert that I am trying to add a \nsecond agency into the antitrust analysis of Bell entry. In fact, just \nthe opposite is true--my amendment removes an agency. S. 652 currently \nprovides that the FCC shall determine the public interest in \nconsultation with the Justice Department. FCC consideration of the \npublic interest requires\n antitrust analysis, as indicated by the courts and reiterated by FCC \nChairman Hundt in testimony last month before the Congress.\n\n  As drafted, therefore, S. 652 already requires antitrust analysis by \nboth the FCC and Department of Justice. My amendment will reduce this \nredundancy, by prohibiting the FCC from conducting an antitrust \nanalysis when determining the public interest. Instead, the antitrust \nanalysis will be conducted exclusively by the Department of Justice, \nthe antitrust agency with great expertise and specialization in \nanalyzing competition.\n  Second, the antitrust role of the Justice Department in analyzing \nentry under my amendment is in no way unusual or inappropriate. It is \nthe same analysis that the Justice Department conducts routinely in \ndetermining whether companies should be able to proceed into new lines \nof business through mergers and acquisitions. Even the standard--\nsection 7 of the Clayton Act--is identical. Considering whether entry \nwill ``substantially reduce competition'' prior to any harm occurring \nis equally important here as in other section 7 cases involving a \nmerger or acquisition. This process protects competition and the \nAmerican public from harm which can be avoided.\n  Mr. President, we all strongly support competition. The question we \nare resolving today is whether we will continue to rely on antitrust \nlaw administered by the expert agency to protect competition, as we \nhave since the early part of this century. I fear that failure to \nsupport my amendment will harm competition, which ultimately harms our \nconstituents.\n  These issues are critically important, and I believe that it is \nhighly desirable to have an up or down vote on my modified second \ndegree amendment. For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the motion to table.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 6 minutes 32 \nseconds.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate so much the \nSenator from South Carolina. I hate to differ with him, but on this \nissue I do.\n  The reason is because I sat on the committee and I saw how difficult \nit was to get to the goal of deregulation and to try to take the \nharassment off the businesses that we are trying to encourage to come \ninto the marketplace rather than add yet another hurdle that they must \njump before they can get into the marketplace to provide the \ncompetition that gives the consumers the best choices for the lowest \nprices.\n  This amendment is a gutting amendment. That is why I think it is so \nimportant that we stick with the FCC and not add one more layer of the \nDepartment. We have made the decision that the FCC is the one that must \nprotect the diversity of voices in the market. We have said the FCC can \nbe the one that knows when there is competition at the local level so \nthat we can go into long distance. It is that agency that has the \nexpertise, that we have given the expertise. There is no reason to come \nin and add another layer.\n  Antitrust will be taken care of if we increase competition. That is \nwhat this amendment will stop from happening.\n  The committee labored not hours, not days, not weeks; the committee \nhas labored for years to try to level the playing field among all the \ncompetitors that want to be in the telecommunications business. What we \nhave found are some very strong competitive companies that want to jump \ninto local service, to long distance service.\n  We are trying to create that level playing field. We are trying to \ntake the regulators out of the process so that our companies can \ncompete and give consumers the best prices and the best service.\n  If we stick with the committee, that is what we will have: more \ncompetition, easier to get into the competition. We will not put up \nmore hurdles in the process. This is a deregulation bill, not a \nreregulation bill.\n  That is why it is very important for my colleagues, as they look at \nthese choices, to know that the committee has done the work, the \ncommittee has worked for years to try to create this level playing \nfield.\n  I have voted for the long distance companies in some instances. I \nhave voted for the Bells in some instances, to try to make sure that \nthat balance is there.\n  The committee has struck the balance. I thank the Senators who have \nworked so hard, the distinguished chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished ranking member. On this one, I think we must stick with \nthe committee that has done so much work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the choice before Members on the tabling \nmotion will be: Trust the 14-point checklist, basically, that the \ncommittee has offered as an indication; or do we want, in a parallel \nprocess, the Department to make a determination as to whether or not \ncompetition exists at the local level. That is all we are discussing \nand debating.\n I believe we want the Department of Justice to make that \ndetermination. I do not have the confidence in the 14-point checklist \nthat others do. It is as simple as that.\n\n  Many of the statements that have been made about what this amendment \nattempts to do have simply not been true. Many of the statements that \nhave been made about what the Department of Justice is trying to \naccomplish here simply are not true. We are simply saying, with this \namendment, to Members of Congress, the Department of Justice should \nhave a determination role. They should say, ``We have determined that \nthere is competition,'' or ``We have determined that there is not \ncompetition.''\n  I will cite, in a repetitive example, two instances that ought to \ngive, I think, Members of Congress a pause. The Senator from South \nDakota gets up and says all these delays occur. I cited an application \nfor a waiver of the MFJ that was made in 1994 by Southwestern Bell. I \nask the Senator from South Dakota, did he wish that would have been \napproved in 30 days? That waiver application would strike all the MFJ \nrequirements, strike all the restrictions with no determination of \nlocal competition whatsoever. Perhaps the Senator from South Dakota \ndoes not like that delay. Perhaps the Senator from South Dakota and \nother Members would like to have a situation where there is no \ndetermination being made by the Department of Justice. If that is the \ncase, vote to table.\n  But if you want the Department of Justice to have the determination \nrole rather than just ``Here is our opinion about this proposal,'' then \nyou have to vote for this amendment. [[Page S8225]] \n  I believe if you do vote for this amendment, you will be happy you \ndid. At the end of the day you do not want to just try to make sure \nthese folks are happy who are outside the hallway out here, adding up \nvotes trying to figure whether this amendment is going to pass or fail. \nYou want the consumers and the citizens and the taxpayers and the \nvoters of your State to be happy. And the only way they are going to be \nhappy, the only way they are going to say this thing works, is if we \nget real competition at the local level. With real competition at the \nlocal level, there will be choice and there will be decreases in price \nand increases in quality. And that is the only way in my judgment that \nS. 652 is going to produce the benefits that have been promised.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota controls 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I yield \nthe last minute to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I conclude this by saying I love my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond. This appears to be a difference over \njurisdiction. I plead with my colleagues, do vote this amendment down. \nIt is a gutting amendment. It will add more bureaucracy. It goes \nagainst the procompetitive, deregulatory nature of the bill.\n  I respect my colleague from South Carolina so much, but I see this as \na jurisdictional difference. On this occasion I will have to vote to \ntable the Thurmond amendment and continue to love the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska for the last word.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe this is a balanced bill we have \nhere now. The Department of Justice has a statutory consultative role. \nIf it has concerns, the FCC will hear those concerns. The basic thing \nabout this bill is it gets the telecommunications policy out of the \ncourts and out of the Department of Justice and back to the FCC to one \narea. We hope to transition sometime so we do not even have them \ninvolved.\n  I oppose striking the public interest section because it upsets the \nbalance we have worked out. It upsets the balance in favor of the wrong \nparties.\n  I urge support of this motion of the chairman to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have a minute \nand 35 seconds. The opponents of the amendment have a minute and 58 \nseconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will use 30 seconds. The Senator can take the rest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might take just 1 minute and ask \nunanimous consent Senator Feingold be added as a cosponsor to the \nThurmond-Dorgan second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me again say, those who say this \nupsets the balance, this adds layers of bureaucracy, this adds \ncomplexity--in my judgment, respectful judgment, they are just wrong. \nThey are just wrong.\n  This does not have balance unless it has balance in the public \ninterest on behalf of the American consumer making certain the free \nmarket is free. Free market and competition are wonderful to talk about \nbut you have to be stewards, it seems to me, to make sure the free \nmarket is free. The only way to do that is to vote for this amendment.\n  So vote against tabling the Thurmond-Dorgan amendment and give the \nJustice Department the role they should have to do what should be done \nfor the consumers of this country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senate this. This \namendment protects consumers and enhances competition. It does not gut \nthis bill. That is an error. It provides for the Department of Justice \nto carry out the antitrust analysis of Bell company applications to \nenter long distance. This is the special expertise of the Department of \nJustice. My amendment limits the FCC to reviewing other areas and not \nduplicating DOJ. I am confident that this will reduce bureaucracy and \neliminate redundancy of Government between roles of the DOJ and FCC. In \nother words, it leaves with the FCC to determine issues in which they \nhave expertise. It leaves to the Justice Department determinations in \nwhich they have expertise. And that is the way it ought to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 2 minutes--a \nminute and 58 seconds.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield any time I have left.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I make a motion to table the Thurmond \namendment, No. 1265.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Parental Choice in \n     Television Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On average, a child in the United States is exposed to \n     27 hours of television each week and some children are \n     exposed to as much as 11 hours of television each day.\n       (2) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n     100,000 acts of other violence on television by the time the \n     child completes elementary school.\n       (3) By the age of 18 years, the average American teenager \n     has watched 200,000 acts of violence on television, including \n     40,000 murders.\n       (4) On several occasions since 1975, The Journal of the \n     American Medical Association has alerted the medical \n     community to the adverse effects of televised violence on \n     child development, including an increase in the level of \n     aggressive behavior and violent behavior among children who \n     view it.\n       (5) The National Commission on Children recommended in 1991 \n     that producers of television programs exercise greater \n     restraint in the content of programming for children.\n       (6) A report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, \n     dated May 1993, indicates that there is an irrefutable \n     connection between the amount of violence depicted in the \n     television programs watched by children and increased \n     aggressive behavior among children.\n       (7) It is a compelling National interest that parents be \n     empowered with the technology to block the viewing by their \n     children of television programs whose content is overly \n     violent or objectionable for other reasons.\n       (8) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture \n     of television receivers that are capable of permitting \n     parents to block television programs having violent or \n     otherwise objectionable content.\n\n     SEC. 503. ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE RATING CODE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) Prescribe, in consultation with television \n     broadcasters, cable operators, appropriate public interest \n     groups, and interested individuals from the private sector, \n     rules for rating the level of violence or other objectionable \n     content in television programming, including rules for the \n     transmission by television broadcast stations and cable \n     systems of--\n       ``(1) signals containing ratings of the level of violence \n     or objectionable content in such programming; and\n       ``(2) signals containing specifications for blocking such \n     programming.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, but only if the Commission determines, in \n     consultation with appropriate public interest groups and \n     interested individuals from the private sector, on that date \n     that television broadcast stations and cable systems have \n     not--\n       (1) established voluntarily rules for rating the level of \n     violence or other objectionable content in television \n     programming which rules are acceptable to the Commission; and\n       (2) agreed voluntarily to broadcast signals that contain \n     ratings of the level of violence or objectionable content in \n     such programming.\n\n     SEC. 504. REQUIREMENT FOR MANUFACTURE OF TELEVISIONS THAT \n                   BLOCK PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303), as amended \n     by this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(w) Require, in the case of apparatus designed to receive \n     television signals that are manufactured in the United States \n     or imported for use in the United States and that have a \n     picture screen 13 inches or greater in size (measured \n     diagonally), that such apparatus--\n       ``(1) be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers \n     to block the display of channels during particular time \n     slots; and\n       ``(2) enable viewers to block display of all programs with \n     a common rating.''.\n       (b) Implementation.--In adopting the requirement set forth \n     in section 303(w) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added \n     by subsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission, in \n     consultation with the television receiver manufacturing \n     industry, shall determine a date for the applicability of the \n     requirement to the apparatus covered by that section.\n\n     SEC. 505. SHIPPING OR IMPORTING OF TELEVISIONS THAT BLOCK \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--Section 330 (47 U.S.C. 330) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n       (2) by adding after subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection (c):\n       ``(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person \n     shall ship in interstate commerce, manufacture, assemble, or \n     import from any foreign country into the United States any \n     apparatus described in section 303(w) of this Act except in \n     accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant \n     to the authority granted by that section.\n       ``(2) This subsection shall not apply to carriers \n     transporting apparatus referred to in paragraph (1) without \n     trading it.\n       ``(3) The rules prescribed by the Commission under this \n     subsection shall provide performance standards for blocking \n     technology. Such rules shall require that all such apparatus \n     be able to receive transmitted rating signals which conform \n     to the signal and blocking specifications established by the \n     Commission.\n       ``(4) As new video technology is developed, the Commission \n     shall take such action as the Commission determines \n     appropriate to ensure that blocking service continues to be \n     available to consumers.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 330(d), as redesignated \n     by subsection (a)(1), is amended by striking ``section \n     303(s), and section 303(u)'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``and sections 303(s), 303(u), and 303(w)''.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \ntelecommunications bill, which is a bill that is designed to do two \nthings. One, it is designed to empower parents to help make the choices \nof what their children see on television coming into their homes.\n  Mr. President, several years ago, I became very involved in the issue \nof violence in the media, because I became convinced that violence in \nthe media is contributing to violence in society; it is contributing to \nviolence on the streets of America. So I worked to form a national \norganization, which is now some 37 national organizations, all involved \nin an attempt to reduce violence in the media. This is a national \ncoalition that involves organizations like the American Medical \nAssociation, the PTA, the National Council of Churches, the sheriffs, \npolice chiefs, the school psychologists, the school principals, the \nNational Education Association--37 national organizations who are \ncommitted to reducing violence in the media.\n  It is for that reason that I offer what I call the Parental Choice \nand Television Act of 1995.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1347 to Amendment No. 1275\n\n (Purpose: To revise the provisions relating to the establishment of a \n     system for rating violence and other objectionable content on \n                              television)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1347 to amendment No. 1275.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike out line 12 and all that follows through \n     page 4, line 16, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 503.

Mr. President, at this point, I will yield the floor \nand look forward to hearing the remainder of the statement of my friend \nand colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my friend. He has an amendment he is offering in \nthe second degree to refine my amendment. We have worked closely \ntogether on the underlying amendment. I appreciate very much the \nsecond-degree amendment he is offering to make a further refinement \nthat I think will improve the underlying amendment. I greatly \nappreciate the hard work the Senator from Connecticut has put forward \non this issue.\n  As I was saying, several years ago, I became deeply involved in this \nsubject. Frankly, I became involved because of an incident involving my \nwife when she was attacked outside of our home here in Washington, DC.\n  At that time, I concluded that I ought to do everything I can do to \nhelp reduce violence in society. There are many things that contribute \nto violence in this country--drugs, gangs, and a whole series of issues \nthat relate to people that do not have an economic chance. Also, we \nhave to get tough on crime in this country. We have to insist that \nthose who commit crimes do their time. They have to be punished. They \nhave to know they are going to be punished and that punishment ought to \nbe swift and severe.\n  In addition to all of those things, I also am persuaded that violence \nin the media is contributing to violence in our society. That is not \njust my conclusion, that is the conclusion of the vast majority of \npeople in this country. That is the conclusion of the American Medical \nAssociation, who, as I indicated earlier, is one of the charter members \nof the national coalition I have put together on this question of \nviolence in the media.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment does is really two things. It \nprovides that television manufacturers will include in new television \nsets, at a time that they, in consultation with the FCC, determine is \nthe workable time, to require a choice chip in the televisions. Just as \nwe have chips in the television now that provide for closed captioning, \nwe would provide choice chips in new televisions, which would be able \nto empower parents to exclude programming that comes into their homes, \nprogramming that they find objectionable--not any Member of Congress, \nnot the FCC, not anybody else, but what parents find objectionable or \nsomething they do not want to come into their homes. These choice chips \nthat are now under development--in some cases, already well-developed--\nwould enable parents to be involved in their children's viewing habits.\n  As we know, children are watching, in some cases, 27 hours of \ntelevision a week--27 hours of television a week. And all too often \nthey are seeing things that their parents find objectionable. They are \nwatching things that their parents would like to prevent them from \nwatching.\n  Mr. President, many of us believe that parents ought to have that \nright. They ought to be able to determine what comes into their homes. \nThey ought to be able to determine what their kids are watching. They \nought to be able to determine what they find objectionable, not any \nGovernment censor--what the parents find objectionable.\n  So this legislation would create that opportunity. I just point to \nthis USA Weekend Poll that was done from June 2 through June 4. These \nsurvey results are very interesting. Ninety-six percent are very or \nsomewhat concerned about sex on TV; 97 percent are very or somewhat \nconcerned about violence on television. When it comes to the two issues \nincluded in this amendment, overwhelmingly, they say: Let us do it. Let \nus have a choice chip in the television set at a cost of less than $5 \nper television set. In fact, we have just been told that when it is in \nmass production, it may cost as little as 18 cents per television set.\n  Should V-chips or choice chips be installed in TV sets so parents \ncould easily block violent programming? That was a question in the USA \nToday poll. The American people responded ``yes'' 90 percent. Mr. \nPresident, 90 percent want to have the opportunity to choose what comes \ninto their homes.\n  On the second matter that is in this amendment, that is the creation \nof a rating system so that parents can have some idea before the \nprogramming airs what the programming includes, the question was asked: \nDo you favor a rating system similar to that used for movies? Yes, 83 \npercent; no, 17 percent.\n  Overwhelmingly, the American people want choice chips in television, \nand they want a rating system.\n  Mr. President, we heard objections from some that the rating system \nought not to be something determined in the first instance by \nGovernment. The Government should not make this decision. We have heard \nthat complaint. We have heard that criticism. We heard that suggestion.\n  In the amendment that I am offering, we give the industry, working \nwith all interested parties, parent-teacher groups, school administers, \nother interested parties, churches, and others, a 1- \n[[Page S8228]] year window of opportunity to make a decision on what \nthat rating system ought to be. We give the industry, working with all \ninterested parties, a chance, a 1-year chance. Let them decide what the \nrating system should look like.\n  I might just say, Mr. President, we gave another industry a chance to \ndo that. We gave the recreational software industry a chance to create \na rating system. They went out and did it.\n  Here is the rating system they came up with. On violence, their \nadvisory has a thermometer with a 1, 2, 3, 4 scale. We can tell what is \nthe level of violence in that program. We can tell on nudity/sex in the \nsame way. That is the rating. And the same way with respect to language \nthat is used.\n  In Canada, the industry, on a voluntary basis, established a rating \nsystem. They did it. It is in place. It is working. We should give our \nindustry, working in cooperation and in conjunction with all other \ninterested parties--with the parents, with the church leaders, with all \nothers in the community who are interested--a chance to establish a \nrating system so that parents and other viewers have a chance to know \njust what is this program going to be like with respect to violence? \nWhat is it going to be like with respect to sexual activity? What is it \ngoing to be like with respect to language?\n  Then let the viewers decide what it is they want to watch. Let the \nparents decide what the children are going to be exposed to.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is an important question and an \nimportant issue. When I started on this in North Dakota, I called the \nfirst meeting, and I was expecting 10 or 15 people to show up. The \nplace was packed. We had every kind of organization represented there \nin my hometown of Bismarck, ND.\n  One of the things they decided to do was have a national petition \ndrive, to send to the leaders of the media a request that they tone \ndown the violence that is in the media, that is in television, that is \non the movies. Overwhelmingly at that meeting, individual after \nindividual, stood up and said, ``You know, I am absolutely persuaded \nthat violence in the media is contributing to violence on our \nstreets.''\n  I remember very well a school principal standing up in that meeting. \nHe had been a school principal for 20 years in North Dakota. He said, \n``Senator Conrad, I have seen a dramatic change in what our children \nwrite about when we ask them to do an essay.'' He said, ``It is so \ndifferent now than when I started in schools 20 years ago. Twenty years \nago people would write about their experiences on the farm; they would \nwrite about their experiences in a summer job; they would talk about \ngoing to camp in the summer. Today when you ask them to write an essay, \nthey write about what they have seen on television. All too often, the \nimages are images of violence and brutality.'' He said, ``Senator, this \nis affecting our children. It is affecting the way they see life.''\n  We, as adults, ought to do something about it. So the question comes \nbefore the Senate, what do we do? Do we have censors? Do we set up a \ncensorship system? Not in America. That violates the first amendment. \nThat is not in tune with American values.\n  What we can do, what we should do, what we must do, is empower \nparents, give them a chance to intercept this process, give them a \nchance to decide what their kids are going to be exposed to. We already \nknow the children in this country, by the time they are 12 years old, \nhave witnessed 8,000 murders, have witnessed 100,000 assaults. Everyone \nknows that has an effect on those children.\n  Mr. President, we have gone to great lengths to make sure that what \nwe are offering here today is a voluntary system, voluntary in the \nsense that we give the industry a chance to establish that rating \nsystem, voluntary in the sense that the parents are the ones to decide \nwhat comes into their homes for viewing by their children.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent to have printed for the Record a \nseries of letters from organizations supporting this legislation: the \nNational Foundation to Improve Television; the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Medical Association Alliance, the National \nAlliance for Nonviolent Programming, the National Coalition on \nTelevision Violence, the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, Parent Action, the National Association for the Education \nof Young Children, the National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. \nAll of these organizations are supporting this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Foundation\n\n\n                                        To Improve Television,\n\n                                                       Boston, MA.\n  Statement of William S. Abbott, President of National Foundation To \n Improve Television, in Support of Senator Conrad's Parental ``Choice \n                    Chip'' Amendment, June 12, 1995\n\n       I am the president of the National Foundation to Improve \n     Television--a nonprofit educational foundation with an \n     exclusive focus on remedies to the problem of television \n     violence. We have worked for 25 years to alleviate the impact \n     that television violence has on young people. On behalf of \n     the millions of children and parents who are desperately \n     calling for help to rid their homes of brutalizing images of \n     murder and mayhem, we applaud Senator Conrad's introduction \n     of this amendment.\n       The introduction of this amendment is an important step in \n     empowering parents with the help they need to protect their \n     children from the scientifically proven harmful effects of \n     television violence. This amendment does not signal that the \n     government is becoming involved in dictating program content. \n     This amendment does not tell the entertainment industry what \n     kinds of stories they can and cannot tell nor does it trample \n     on anyone's First Amendment rights or creative freedoms.\n       Senator Conrad's amendment requires the installation of a \n     ``choice chip'' in all television sets. While its critics in \n     the TV industry have labelled it a ``blocking chip'', it is \n     important to remember that this chip merely identifies a \n     program as containing harmful violence. It is the individual \n     parent who must actually elect to block violent programs from \n     coming into their home. The introduction of this ``choice \n     chip''--and the development of an accompanying ``violent \n     program ratings system'' devised by the television industry--\n     will be a big step forward for two reasons. First, it will \n     give all parents--including those who must work long hours \n     outside the home and, therefore, cannot constantly supervise \n     their children's viewing--the assistance they need to shield \n     their children from harmful programming, in effect a long-\n     overdue right of self-defense. A concerned parent need only \n     activate the ``choice chip'' and he or she can be certain \n     that the television will no longer assault their children \n     with images of ``Dirty Harry'', ``The Terminator'' and the \n     like. Second, it will unquestionably result in many \n     advertisers pulling their advertising budget from programs \n     with glamorized or excessive violence. Few\n      advertisers will spend their precious dollars running \n     commercials on programs which millions of Americans will \n     have elected to tune out of their homes.\n       The introduction of this new parental choice technology is \n     not revolutionary. It is simply an extension of the current \n     opportunities many parents and viewers have to use their \n     television's cable converter to block out particular cable \n     channels either completely or during a particular time of the \n     day. With this new capability, parents would simply be \n     further empowered to block out all programming which the \n     industry has determined contain harmful depictions of \n     violence. This violence-specific blocking capability, rather \n     than channel-specific capability, is essential when we \n     recognize that in a very short time parents will be \n     confronted with 500 or more channels entering their homes.\n       The industry's response, in order to stave off this new \n     form of parental empowerment which will cost it advertising \n     dollars if they continue to program glamorized violence, will \n     be that such a system is too rigid, that it will impact \n     programs ranging from ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' to \n     ``Roots''. This is, of course, not the case. This plan leaves \n     it to the industry to determine which programs would be \n     tagged with the violence signal. We would trust that the \n     industry would exercise its good judgment in attaching such \n     signal. ``I Spit on Your Grave'' will warrant the signal, \n     which the ``Civil War'' documentary, for example, will not. \n     The television industry is currently placing violence \n     warnings on particular programs which it judges to contain \n     excessive or otherwise harmful violence, so it is clear that \n     it can exercise this kind of judgment if it so chooses.\n       It has been reported that this new technology would add as \n     little as $5 to the price of a new television set. Thus, it \n     is empowerment affordable by all. Properly publicized through \n     an ongoing nationwide public service announcement and \n     parental notification campaign, the technology will become \n     increasingly popular over time. Since television has long \n     contended that the ``public interest'' is simply what \n     interests the public, and that the ultimate responsibility \n     for children's viewing lies with the parents, it should have \n     no quarrel with a mechanism which gives parents the \n     unprecedented opportunity to supervise effectively their \n     children's viewing. [[Page S8229]] \n       For the last 30 years, the American public has told the \n     television industry to lead, follow or get out of the way \n     with regard to reducing the level of glamorized and excessive \n     violence on television. To date, they have certainly not led \n     the way toward resolving the problem. They clearly haven't \n     followed either--as they continue to program high levels of \n     violence despite growing public anger with the amount of \n     violence on television. Through their overwhelming support \n     for Senator Conrad's parental empowerment proposal, the \n     American people are effectively telling the television \n     industry ``Get out of the way''--we're ready to address their \n     problem ourselves. Give us the tools and, with the industry's \n     cooperation, we'll do the job.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n\n                                   601 Thirteenth Street, NW.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, whose 49,000 members are dedicated to promoting \n     the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, \n     adolescents and young adults, I want to commend you for your \n     strong leadership in the area of children's television. \n     Pediatricians have long been concerned about the effects of \n     television on children--from the lack of educational \n     programs, to the high level of violence which we clearly \n     believe has a role in aggression in children, as well as the \n     continual bombardment of advertisements aimed at them. \n     Children are fortunate to have you working so diligently on \n     their behalf.\n       While we don't believe that television is solely \n     responsible for all the violence in our society, we do \n     believe that violent programs contribute to the violence in \n     our society. In our practices, pediatricians observe first-\n     hand that such programming tends to make children more \n     aggressive and more apt to imitate the actions they view.\n       Parents should be responsible for monitoring what their \n     children are viewing. However, over the past years a dramatic \n     alteration of the American family portrait has taken place. \n     To assist families in determining appropriate television \n     programming, we strongly support installation of a micro-chip \n     in all new televisions to allow parents to block violent \n     programs. This provision will allow parents some degree of \n     control of the programs their children watch--an important \n     option for today's programming environment.\n       Thank you again for your staunch advocacy in creating a \n     better television environment for America's children. We look \n     forward to working with you on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          George D. Comerci, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      American Medical Association\n\n\n                                               Alliance, Inc.,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, June 12, 1995.\n       The American Medical Association Alliance, Inc., is pleased \n     to join the AMA and other members of the Citizens' Task Force \n     Against TV Violence in wholeheartedly supporting the parental \n     choice amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and \n     De-regulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).\n       As a national organization of more than 60,000 physicians' \n     spouses, the AMA Alliance fully supports v-chip technology \n     allowing parents and other adults to block programs they deem \n     objectionable, and arming them with a standard violence \n     rating system by which they can make those choices.\n       As a member of the Citizens' Task Force Against TV \n     Violence, the AMA Alliance is committed to curbing the \n     effects of violence in the media as one dimension of its \n     nationwide SAVE Program to Stop America's Violence \n     Everywhere.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nNational Alliance for Non-Violent Programming Supports Conrad Amendment\n\n       The National Alliance for Non-Violent Programming, a \n     network of national women's organizations comprising more \n     than 2700 chapters and 400,000 women, works at the grassroots \n     to counter the impact of media violence without invasion of \n     First Amendment rights. The Alliance's approach, media \n     literacy education as violence prevention, is collaborative \n     and non-partisan. The Alliance lends strong support to the \n     Parental ``Choice Chip'' Amendment to the Telecommunications \n     Act S 652 to be introduced by Senator Kent Conrad of North \n     Dakota.\n       Rapidly developing technologies are ensuring greater and \n     greater access to all forms of electronic media. A non-\n     censorial solution to the widely-acknowledged problem of the \n     influence of television violence, Senator Conrad's amendment \n     would provide parents and caregivers with the information to \n     make responsible decisions about children's television \n     viewing and the technology to block programming they consider \n     objectionable.\n       The Conrad amendment calls on the FCC to act in conjunction \n     with the networks, cable operators, consumer groups and \n     parents to establish a system to rate the level of violence \n     on television. The process itself is therefore inclusive and \n     educational. As consumers informed about what is coming into \n     their homes then utilize circuitry to block out the programs \n     they consider objectionable, parents and caregivers will be \n     able to exercise responsibility rather than feeling \n     uninformed or powerless to bring about positive change.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     NCTV Supports Conrad Amendment\n\n       Washington, DC.--The National Coalition on Television \n     Violence [NCTV] strongly supports the Parental ``Choice \n     Chip'' Amendment to the Telecommunications Act to be \n     introduced by Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota.\n       Dr. Robert Gould, psychiatrist and president of NCTV, \n     commented about the amendment: ``The technological explosion \n     has made it impossible for parents to keep abreast of the \n     media: music, movies and television.''\n       With this in mind, Senator Conrad has taken the leadership \n     in the question of Children's Television, especially the \n     effect of violence on our young people. He has worked long \n     and hard to seek reasonable solutions to this pressing \n     problem. He has pulled together an impressive task force of \n     national organizations from which he has sought information \n     and input to a problem which lends itself to wild rhetoric \n     but no action. The amendment that he proposes is both \n     effective and in no way impinges on anyone's freedom of \n     speech as protected by the First Amendment.\n       Senator Conrad's amendment effectively addresses two of the \n     most pressing problems a parent faces, i.e. how to turn off \n     objectional programming, and how to know what to turn off. A \n     rating system established by the FCC in conjunction with the \n     TV networks, cable operators, consumer groups and parents \n     will give parents necessary information to make informed \n     judgments as to what is appropriate for their children. The \n     technological equipment will allow parents, in their homes, \n     to choose what they wish their children to watch. Technology \n     will finally allow parents to ``If you don't like it, turn it \n     off,'' as has been smugly suggested by the industry for \n     years. The Parental ``Choice Chip'' will make this a real \n     possibility.\n       In supporting this amendment, NCTV draws on years of \n     experience monitoring television violence. While there has \n     been, of late, recognition of the influences of television \n     violence, there is still a serious attempt by the broadcast \n     industry to exempt cartoon violence from the discussion. As a \n     last line of defense, the happy violence of cartoons is still \n     deemed by the broadcast industry as not affecting our \n     children. Now, with the passage of this amendment, we do not \n     have to wait for the broadcast industry to clean up their act \n     in regard to cartoons. Parents who understand and see the \n     effects of cartoon violence will be able to simply block out \n     the offending programs.\n       Dr. Gould further states, ``The rating system is a means of \n     informing parents about what is coming into their homes and \n     the Parental ``Choice Chip'' empowers them to fulfill their \n     proper role as parents.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       The National Association of\n\n\n                                  Secondary School Principals,\n\n                                        Reston, VA, June 12, 1995.\n     Hon.

Your amendment would greatly enhance the national \n     movement to monitor and ultimately decrease violence in \n     television by:\n       Enabling parents to program their television sets to block \n     out objectional or violent television shows; and\n       Calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \n     work with television networks, cable operators, consumer \n     groups, parents, and others to establish a system to rate the \n     level of violence.\n       Our nation is experiencing an unrivaled period of juvenile \n     violent crime perpetrated by youths from all races, social \n     classes, and lifestyles. Without question, the entertainment \n     industry plays a role in fostering this anti-social behavior \n     by promoting instant gratification, glorifying casual sex, \n     and encouraging the use of profanity, nudity, violence, \n     killing, and racial and sexual stereotyping.\n       NASSP urges Congress to support the parental ``choice \n     chip'' amendment, and commends you, Senator Conrad, for your \n     efforts to protect our children and youth from unnecessary \n     exposure to violence in television and the media.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. Timothy J.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: Parent Action of Maryland, a statewide \n     grassroots organization dedicated to helping parents raise \n     families, endorses your Parental Choice and Television \n     amendment to the Telecommunications Act (S. 652).\n       Our children are bombarded with negative and violent images \n     giving them a disturbing view of the world in which we live. \n     By the time a child leaves school, he or she will have \n     witnessed more than 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of \n     violence on television. This unceasing and relentless barrage \n     of violence serves only to inure our children to the results \n     of violence, hinder their ability to [[Page S8230]] learn and \n     teach them that conflicts can be solved by violence.\n       Parents, concerned about the effects of television violence \n     on their children, are looking for ways in which they can \n     make good programming choices for their children. Your \n     amendment makes important strides in that direction.\n       A rating system would provide parents with the information \n     they need to make informed choices of whether a program is \n     appropriate for their children. Installation of a ``Choice \n     Chip'' in television sets then would allow parents block out \n     the programming they find objectionable. The beauty of your \n     amendment is that it protects the First Amendment and gives \n     parents real power at the same time.\n       If we truly believe that our children are America's most \n     valuable resource, then we must begin valuing them. We must \n     treasure and respect their minds and development--not assault \n     them with gratuitous violent images.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      K.C.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The National Association of Elementary \n     School Principals, representing 26,000 elementary and middle \n     school principals nationwide and overseas, is pleased to \n     endorse your Parental Choice Amendment to the Senate \n     telecommunications bill, S. 652.\n       NAESP supports the effort to create a procedure for \n     establishing a ratings system that involves input from \n     interested parties in the public and private sectors. The \n     violence rating code will help parents to gauge the content \n     of individual television programs and thus make informed \n     decisions about which shows they allow their children to see.\n       The requirement that a ``choice chip'' be installed in most \n     new televisions is also an excellent idea. This device will \n     enable parents to have more control over their impressionable \n     children's viewing habits when the parents are unable to \n     monitor television watching directly.\n       Thank you for your ongoing efforts on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sally N. McConnell,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     NAEYC Supports Conrad Amendment To Promote Parental Choice in \n                     Children's Television Viewing\n\n       The National Association of Young Children [NAEYC] strongly \n     supports Senator Kent Conrad's amendment to the \n     telecommunications bill to reduce children's exposure to \n     media violence. The amendment would require television sets \n     to be equipped with technology (V-chip) that allows parents \n     to block objectionable programming and establish a violence \n     rating code. These steps are valuable tools that provide \n     parents greater power in controlling the nature of television \n     programs to which their children are exposed.\n       The negative impact of media violence on children's \n     development and aggressive behavior is clear. Research \n     consistently identifies three problems associated with \n     repeated viewing of television violence:\n       1. Children are more likely to behave in aggressive or \n     harmful ways towards others.\n       2. Children may become less sensitive to the pain and \n     suffering of others.\n       3. Children may become more fearful of the world around \n     them.\n       In addition, more subtle effects of overexposure to \n     television violence can be seen. Repeated viewing of media \n     violence reinforces antisocial behavior and limits children's \n     imaginations. Violent programming typically presents limited \n     models of language development that narrow the range and \n     originality of children's verbal expression at a time when \n     the development of language is critically important.\n       Of all of the sources and manifestations of violence in \n     children's lives, media violence is perhaps the most easily \n     corrected. NAEYC believes that the Conrad amendment is an \n     important step--long overdue--to reduce children's exposure \n     to media violence, and it does so by empowering parents. We \n     strongly urge passage of this amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         American Academy of Child\n\n\n                                    and Adolescent Psychiatry,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1995.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The American Academy of Child and \n     Adolescent Psychiatry is pleased to endorse your \n     telecommunications bill amendment providing for new \n     television sets being required to contain a v-chip that would \n     permit parents to block television programming that includes \n     programming not suitable to their family. The harmful effects \n     of media violence on children and adolescents have been \n     established, and this amendment will empower parents, whether \n     they are at home or not, to monitor and control access to \n     programs. This is one amendment among many, but it is an \n     important commitment by legislators to parents and to child \n     advocates.\n                                           William H. Ayres, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to add Senator Mikulski as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will be happy to debate this issue and answer \nquestions.\n  I want to summarize and say this amendment does two things: It \nprovides for the parental choice chips to be in all new televisions, \nafter the FCC and the industry consult on when is the appropriate time \nfor that requirement to go into effect.\n  Second, we provide for the establishment of a rating system so that \nparents and other consumers have a chance to know what the programming \ncontains before they watch it. Again, we do that on the basis of \nallowing the industry, in consultation with all other interested \nparties, to establish that rating system within 1 year. If they fail to \ndo it within 1 year, we would ask the FCC to become involved in that \nprocess. We see no reason that the industry in 1 year could not arrive, \non a voluntary basis, at an appropriate rating system.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Mikulski and Senator \nLieberman, who have worked with me on this issue.\n  Senator Lieberman now would like to discuss his second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend and colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, for his leadership on this matter and to tell him how \npleased I am to join with him in this effort.\n  This is a complicated problem, to which there is not a clear, perfect \nsolution. What we know is that the values of our society, of our \nchildren, are being threatened, and that the entertainment media too \noften have sent messages to our kids that are different than what we as \nparents are trying to send.\n  I think Senator Conrad has taken a real leadership role here and \nstepped out, stepped forward, with a response that will force this \nSenate, I hope the television industry, and indeed the country, to face \nthe reality of what we and our kids are watching over television and \nwhat we can do about it.\n  Mr. President, the growing public debate over the entertainment \nindustry's contribution to the degradation of our culture could not \nhave come at a more fortuitous time for the Senate Calendar. We are in \nthe process here of considering the most comprehensive rewrite of the \nNation's telecommunications law in 60 years. We are making some pivotal \ndecisions about the future of a most powerful force in American \nculture. That is television.\n  Up to this point in the floor debate, we have heard mostly about the \nwonders of the new technology that will be at our disposal, who will \ncontrol it, and how much it will cost. What has not been heard that \nmuch in all the talk about the wiring, however, is discussion of what \nexactly those wires are going to carry into our homes. Few questions \nhave been asked about the substance of the programs that will be shown \nover the proverbial 500 channels we expect once the road map of \nAmerican telecommunications has been digitized. Even fewer questions \nhave been asked about the quality of programs, of products, to which we \nwill be exposing our children.\n  Now, in many ways, that is understandable. We, as elected officials, \nare traditionally and understandably reluctant to set limits of any \nkind on broadcasters, out of deference to their first amendment \nfreedoms we all are committed to.\n  That is as it should be. Legislators should make laws, not \nprogramming decisions. But we also must remember that we are leaders as \nwell as lawmakers, and we must lead in dealing with America's problems. \nThat is why, again, I commend my colleague, Senator Conrad, for forcing \nthis body to consider and weigh carefully the ramifications of this \nlegislation for America's families and for our moral health.\n  Why is this so important now? Because at the very\n   moment that new technologies are exploding through the roof, the \nstandards of television programmers are heading for the floor dropping \nwith the velocity of a safe dropped off a cliff in a vintage Road \nRunner cartoon. Except, instead of [[Page S8231]] Wile E. Coyote, it is \nthe values and sensibilities of our children that are put in peril.\n\n  More and more these days, the television aimed at our sons and \ndaughters either numbs their minds or thumbs its nose at the values \nmost parents are trying to instill in them. Turn on the TV at night, \nand it's hard to avoid the gratuitous sex and violence that has become \nthe bread and butter of prime time television. The Wall Street Journal \nrecently carried a report detailing how even the 8 p.m. timeslot, once \nthe last bastion of family-oriented shows, has become a hotbed of sex \nand other spicy fare. That is all the more disturbing when you realize \nthat 35 percent of all American children ages 2 to 11 are watching \nduring that hour.\n  If you tune in after school, you have your pick of the parade of talk \nshows edging ever closer toward pornography, often dwelling on \nabnormality, perversion. On Saturday morning, you will be treated to a \nlitany of glossy toy commercials masquerading as real programming. The \nindustry's regard for children and families has grown so low that one \nnetwork, it happened to be ABC, recently announced that it was adding a \ncartoon version of the movie ``Dumb and Dumber'' to its Saturday \nmorning lineup. Television has now officially, with this act, crossed \nthe threshold from covertly encouraging thoughtless behavior to openly \ncelebrating it.\n  Given the direction television is heading, and given the overwhelming \nevidence showing that TV's affinity for violence is a real threat to \nthe development of our children, I think we, as Members of the U.S. \nSenate, should be seriously concerned with where these new technologies \nwill take us. Do we, as a nation, really want to invest billions into \nbuilding an information superhighway only to turn it into a cybernetic \ngarbage disposal? Are we making progress if we offer consumers 500 \ndifferent talk shows rather than just a few dozen? Do we not owe our \nchildren and our country more than that?\n  These are questions we, as a society, must address as we try to make \nsense of the ongoing information revolution, and as we try to deal with \nthe decline in values in our country and our culture. Technology is not \na good in itself, but a tool. The information superhighway could \npotentially help speed the recovery of America's public education \nsystem. It could help elevate our culture and our values. But it also \ncould help accelerate the moral breakdown of our society, and that is \nsomething I believe we need to talk about openly as we go about \nreforming of our telecommunications laws.\n  I recognize that the issue of content, especially as it relates to \ntelevision, is a difficult one. In this case, we are faced with \ncontradictory goals--protecting the right of the media to speak freely \nand independently, and allowing the community to influence them when \nthey go too far. In the past, we have erred on the side of free speech, \nwhich is a testament to our commitment to the first amendment.\n  But in a great constitutional irony, our determination to avoid any \nhint of censorship has been so great that we have effectively chilled \nthe discussion about how we might properly, hopefully working with the \ntelevision industry, improve the quality of television programming. \nThat neglect has come at a heavy cost to society, for we have opened \nthe door to an anything-goes mentality that is contributing \nsignificantly to the crisis of values this country is experiencing.\n  There is no better--or worse, shall I say--example of this mentality \nthan the proliferating legion of sensationalistic talk shows. They are \non the air constantly--by my staff's count there were 23 separate hour-\nlong offering on Washington-area stations in one 9-hour period.\n  You can see this for yourself, Mr. President, on this chart, with the \nboxes colored in with the yellow or orange, however it looks from your \nvantage point, being hour-long talk shows. For the most part, if you \nturn your TV on to these shows you are not going to find wholesome \nfamily fare that you would like your kids to watch.\n  I should point out, in an expression of appreciation of my staff, \nthat ``Regis & Kathie'' Lee are not colored in on this chart. Many of \nthese programs air in the afternoon, when many children are home alone \nbecause their parents at work, or home with their parents but they \nparents may be doing something else.\n  But it is the quality--or lack thereof--that is more disturbing than \nthe quantity. Many of these programs are simply debasing. Their growth \nhas turned daytime television into a waste site of abnormality and \namorality, as Ellen Goodman so aptly put it, which is on the its way \ntoward stamping out any last semblance of standards, and shame when \nthose standards are broken, in this country.\n  The greatest indictment of these shows, as well as the gamut of \nprogramming aimed directly or indirectly at children, comes from kids \nthemselves. A recent poll conducted by the California-based advocacy \ngroup Children Now showed that a majority of youths between 10 and 16 \nsaid that television encourages them to lie, to be disrespectful to \ntheir parents, to engage in aggressive and violent behavior, and, \nperhaps most disturbing of all, to become sexually active too soon.\n  I am the father of a 7-year-old daughter. When I hear about these \nprograms or see them, I can only wonder if those responsible for this \njunk appearing on television are parents themselves. Would they allow \ntheir children to watch the garbage that they are putting on display?\n  Mr. President, I have watched my daughter come home and watch one of \nthe cable networks which has a lot of children's material in it. And \nsuddenly you turn in the afternoon to adolescent fare, which may be OK \nfor adolescents, but certainly is not for a 7-year-old. The same is \ntrue of some of the evening programming, whose content, even in early \nevening hours, is inappropriate for children.\n  I wonder the same thing about those responsible for deciding to \ntarget a version of ``Dumb and Dumber'' to young children. Especially \nthe studio spokesperson who described the upcoming series by saying, \n``It's going to so dumb it's smart. Or so smart it's dumb. I don't know \nwhich''\n  The case of ``Dumb and Dumber'' is particularly distressing, because \non the same day that ABC announced that it was adding ``Dumb and \nDumber'' to its lineup, the network said it was canceling one of its \nfew quality educational programs for kids. That move would be alarming \nin its own right. By all accounts the program ABC was abandoning--a \nscience-oriented show called ``Cro'' that is produced by the same \nhighly regarded group that gave us ``Sesame Street''--was an inventive \nand thought-provoking series.\n  Like too many of the choices made in our entertainment industry these\n   days, this one mocks the efforts of mothers and fathers who are \nstruggling to create a healthy environment for their children to learn \nand grow. There is a place for fun, for laughter, for cartoons. But at \nthe same time, there has to be a place about respecting values, \nintelligence, and good family fare.\n\n  Sadly, ABC's decision is typical of the priorities set by America's \nbig four broadcast networks, and those carried out by their local \naffiliates. According to a congressional hearing held last June, ABC, \nNBC, CBS, and Fox combined to show a total of 8 hours of educational \nprogramming a week in 1993, whereas in 1980, 11 hours was the average \nfor just one network. If that is not distressing enough, a study \nconducted by the Center for Media Education showed that the clear \nmajority of children's educational shows are broadcast when kids were \nusually asleep. That raises real doubts about the commitment of the \nnetworks and the affiliates to these programs.\n  The ritual defense and industry uses to justify their growing \nirresponsibility is that they are providing what the market demands. In \nsome ways it is a persuasive argument in this country, and in most \ncases I am willing to abide by the market and let it be. But when it is \nused to shield behavior that potentially puts America's children at \nrisk, I think we have to figure out a reasonable way to set up some \nwarning signs so parents can protect their own children. As Washington \nPost TV critic Tom Shales said, ``Just because people are willing to \ncome is no defense. There's an audience for bloody traffic accidents \ntoo.''\n  Our colleague Senator Bradley spoke forcefully about this issue in an \nexcellent speech he delivered earlier this year at the National Press \nClub. [[Page S8232]] Yes, we must remain committed to upholding \nfreedom, Senator Bradley said, but we must also guard against the \ncorrosive effect of the liberties we afford the markets, especially the \nentertainment industry. ``The answer is not censorship,'' he said, \n``but more citizenship.''\n  The Senate majority leader spoke out just within the last week or 10 \ndays on this subject forcefully, and I think appropriately. The Senator \nfrom Illinois [Mr. Simon] has been a long-time critic of television \nprogramming, and has appealed to those involved to give better fare to \nour kids. What Senator Bradley and Senator Dole said about this not \nbeing about censorship but citizenship is absolutely right. That is \nwhat H.L. Mencken was talking about when he said long ago that the cure \nto whatever ails democracy is more democracy. Parents must exercise \ntheir primary responsibility and hold television programmers \naccountable and remind them that profits accrued at the expense of our \nchildren are really fool's gold. That means speaking out--loudly--and \nacting as informed consumers. The networks and their local affiliates, \nthe programmers and the syndicators need our help in hearing the call \nthat we expect more in the way of citizenship. And advertisers should \nrecognize their responsibility to the larger civil society that allows \nus all to exist and grow in this great democracy of ours.\n  But the question remains, though, what should the proper response of \nCongress and the law be? I have come to the conclusion myself that talk \nor jawboning is not enough. Talk is not only cheap, as the \nproliferation of talk shows has demonstrated. It also is apparently not \nsufficiently effective in changing the programming climate. Without \nadequate relief in sight, I believe we have an obligation to provide \nparents with the help they need to reduce their children's exposure to \nprograms that the parents find offensive and harmful. And that is what \nSenator Conrad's amendment puts at issue, confronts, and that is why I \nam pleased to be supporting his efforts to make the expanding \ncommunications technology family friendly and to empower parents to \ncontrol the programs that enter their own homes. Rather than placing \nany restraints on content and encroaching on any first amendment \nfreedoms, the Conrad amendment would simply give parents the ability to \nblock programming they do not want their children to see.\n  This technology is readily available, and its addition as a standard \nfeature in televisions sold today would come at a very small cost, by \none estimate less than 5 additional dollars per television set. That is \na small price to pay for gaining control over influences that a lot of \nAmerican families do not want to commit to their home.\n  For this technology to work, network programming must come with some \nform of ratings. With his amendment, Senator Conrad is calling on the \ntelevision industry to do nothing more than the movie makers and the \nvideo game manufacturers have done, and that is to establish a \nvoluntary rating system to evaluate programming for objectionable \ncontent.\n  This amendment, which I am pleased to support, will give the industry \na year to develop such a system on their own. If the broadcasters and \ncable networks for some reason do not respond to this call, then under \nthe proposal of the Senator from North Dakota the FCC would be required \nto promulgate ratings that would trigger the use of the blocking \ntechnology called for in the proposal.\n  While I share Senator Conrad's commitment to ratings, I also \nrecognize that some people have first amendment concerns regarding the \nFCC's direct involvement in developing ratings, and that those concerns \nmay prevent them from supporting this amendment even though they may \nstrongly support its goals.\n  So with that in mind, I have proposed the second-degree amendment \nthat would limit the Government's role, the FCC's role, should the \nindustry refuse to comply to the invitation to self-restraint that is \nat the heart of this amendment. Instead of the FCC stepping in, if the \ntelevision industry fails to develop a voluntary set of standards after \n1 year, this amendment would bring about the creation of an independent \nboard, a joint independent ratings board, comprised of representatives \nof the public and representatives of the television industry to create \nthe ratings necessary under the amendment.\n  The panel would be a mechanism of last resort, if you will, because I \nthink Senator Conrad and I both want to work cooperatively with the \ntelevision industry to see that a truly voluntary system is put in \nplace. That is the best way for this to happen. But if it does not \nhappen, then this second-degree amendment will ensure that the ratings \nsystem that emerges will be born from a true public-private \npartnership, and will be the product of a broad-minded consensus. Based \non my recent experience with the video game industry, I am optimistic \nthat we can reach a constructive solution that would avoid any \nGovernment intervention.\n  As some of my colleagues may recall--and Senator Conrad made \nreference to it--a little more than a year and a half ago, Senator Kohl \nand I held a series of hearings to call attention to the increasingly \ngraphic violent, sometimes sexually abusive, nature of video games \nplayed by our kids. From the outset we appealed to the producers' sense \nof responsibility to give parents information necessary to make the \nright choice for their children. As an incentive, we gave them a choice \nbetween rating the games themselves or having an independent board do \nit.\n  To the credit of the video game makers, and the producers of \nrecreational software that will enable games to be played on personal \ncomputers, the industry itself developed a voluntary system that \nactually was in place less than a year after Senator Kohl and I held \nour first hearing. Now I am pleased to say that almost 600 video game \ntitles have been rated. By this year's Christmas shopping season, we \nhope and believe, based on conversations with the industry itself, that \nalmost all of the video games in the stores will be rated, and, \ntherefore, parents will know the content of the games that they are \nbuying for their children.\n  Mr. President, finally, it is my hope that the television industry \nwill respond similarly to this initiative by the Senator from North \nDakota, by Senator Mikulski from Maryland, and by myself, and accept \nthat it has not only obligations but opportunities as a very important \nmember of the greater American community. I can assure the folks in the \ntelevision and broadcast industry that we stand ready to work with them \nin a cooperative fashion to do what is best for America's families. \nYes, but also ultimately what is best for the American television \nindustry without infringing on any of the freedoms all of us rightly \ncherish and protect. This is not about censorship. It is about choices. \nWe do not want to take away a network's choice to air offensive \nmaterial if that is their choice. We just want to make sure that \nparents and citizens have the choice to prevent their kids or their \nfamilies or, indeed, themselves from watching that material.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to just put into the Record a \nnumber of statements from prominent Americans involved in important \nnational organizations who have been a part of supporting this \nlegislation.\n  First, I would like to quote from Dr. Robert McAfee, the national \npresident of the American Medical Association, who said with respect to \nthe larger legislation from which this amendment is drawn, and I quote. \nThis is Dr. McAfee speaking:\n\n       It is estimated that by the time children leave elementary \n     school, they have viewed 8,000 killings and more than 100,000 \n     other violent acts. Children learn behavior by example. They \n     have an instinctive desire to imitate actions they observe, \n     without always possessing the intellect or maturity to \n     determine if the actions are appropriate. This principle \n     certainly applies to TV violence. Children's exposure to \n     violence in the mass media can have lifelong consequences.\n       We must take strong action now to curb TV violence if we \n     are to have any chance of halting the violent behavior our \n     children learn through watching television. If we fail to do \n     so, it is a virtual certainly the situation will continue to \n     worsen * * *.\n\n  That from the head of the American Medical \nAssociation. [[Page S8233]] \n  Samuel Sava, executive director of the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, said, and I quote:\n\n       The effect of television on children is of great concern to \n     school principals. The family room television is more a \n     persuasive and pervasive educator than all the teachers in \n     America's classrooms. There's no question that the overdose \n     of media violence American children receive is linked to \n     their increasingly violent behavior. But more troubling for \n     parents and educators is the fact that the violence children \n     see, hear, and are entertained by makes them insensitive to \n     real violence.\n  From Timothy Dyer, executive director of the National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, said, and I quote:\n\n       Our nation is experiencing an unrivaled period of juvenile \n     violent crime perpetrated by youths from all races, social \n     classes, and lifestyles. Without question, the entertainment \n     industry plays a role in fostering this anti-social behavior \n     by promoting instant gratification, glorifying casual sex, \n     and encouraging the use of profanity, nudity, violence, \n     killing, and racial and sexual sterotyping.\n\n  Mr. President, that is really at the heart of the amendment we are \noffering today. This amendment says parents--parents--ought to be able \nto choose what comes into their homes. Parents ought to be empowered to \nhelp decide what their children view. Parents ought to have a role in \nmaking these choices.\n  We can help parents have that choice by putting choice chips in the \nnew television sets. The technology is available. It is very low cost. \nLet us give the parents of America what they say they want.\n  Again, I go back to this USA Today poll that was just published: \nShould these kinds of choice chips be installed in TV sets so parents \ncould block violent programming? Yes, 90 percent. Ninety percent of the \nAmerican people say we ought to do this.\n  We have done it in the least intrusive way imaginable. We have done \nit by saying, look, industry, get together with FCC. We are not going \nto tell you when to do it. We leave it up to your judgment. You work \ntogether, FCC and the industry. You get together on when you are \ntechnologically ready to have these available in the television sets.\n  And on a rating system, in the same way we have said, industry, you \nhave a year to work with all interested parties to come up with a \nrating system that makes sense for the American people. And only if you \nfail to act does anything else happen. We give you a year to go forward \nin good faith and get this job done.\n  We think they will do it. Look at the answer to the question: Do you \nfavor a rating system similar to that used for movies? Eighty three \npercent in the USA Today poll say, yes, we want a rating system--83 \npercent. And 90 percent said they wanted the new choice chip in their \nnew television sets.\n  That is what this amendment offers. It does it in a way that is fully \nconstitutional. It does it in a way that is the least intrusive as \npossible, and yet it responds to the real wants of the American public, \nto have parents be able to choose what comes into their homes, to have \nparents be able to decide what their children want.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues would respond favorably to \nthis amendment. I would be happy to answer questions or engage in \nfurther debate.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we are studying this amendment. We have \njust seen the Conrad amendment in the second degree to the Lieberman \namendment for the first time. In the Commerce Committee, there have \nbeen many bills introduced on this subject, including one by the \ndistinguished former chairman, Senator Hollings.\n  It was the intention and is the hope that we could hold full \ncommittee hearings, in fairness to all those Senators. There are so \nmany Senators who have introduced bills on this subject. And when we \nfinish this telecommunications bill, we are in hopes of turning to \nhearings for a number of reasons to give those Senators who have \nintroduced a bill and been waiting a chance to have their bills \nconsidered but also to allow industry and consumer groups to give an \nanalysis of this.\n  We have just seen this amendment in the second degree to the \nLieberman amendment, and I know there is great passion at the moment \nabout this subject throughout our land. I feel very strongly about this \nsubject matter, and we are struggling with trying to find a fair way to \ndeal with this amendment, which Senators have just seen, and dealing \nwith Senator Hollings' bill which was introduced earlier. He had \nalready asked for hearings, and also several other Senators. Also, in \nfairness to industry groups and parents and children, it would seem \nthat testimony at full committee hearings would be a good first step.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield to anyone else who has comments \nat this time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  We have had hearings for years around here on this subject. Everybody \nwants to have more hearings. Frankly, the American people want us to \nact. They want us to work together to achieve something. We have had \nall the hearings we need on this question.\n  I introduced a bill that contained these provisions on February 2 of \nthis year. So it is not the first time anybody has seen this. This has \nbeen in this body since February 2.\n  I just say that these are the national organizations that say vote \nfor this now, no more delay, no more talk. Let us do something. Let us \ndo something that makes sense. Let us do something that is \nconstitutional. Let us do something that empowers parents. Let us do \nsomething that gives a rating system that the industry, on a voluntary \nbasis, is able to create along with all interested parties. We give \nthem a year to get this job done on their own.\n  Let me just read into the Record the national organizations that \nsupport this amendment: the National Association for the Education of \nYoung Children, Future Wave, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Medical Association Alliance, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nNational PTA, Parent Action, the National Foundation To Approve \nTelevision, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, \nthe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National \nCoalition on Television Violence, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe National Association for Family and Community Education, the \nAlliance Against Violence in Entertainment for Children, the American \nNurses Association, the National Council for Children's TV and Media, \nthe National Alliance for Nonviolent Programming, the National \nAssociation of School Psychologists, the Orthodox Union, the National \nEducation Association, and the United Church of Christ.\n  Now, in the broader coalition we also have the sheriffs, police \nchiefs, and many others.\n  These organizations have all studied this issue and studied it and \nstudied it and participated in hearing after hearing after hearing. \nThey say now is the time to act. They are not alone. Ninety percent of \nthe American people say, let us have these choice chips in our \ntelevision sets; 83 percent of them say that they favor a rating \nsystem. We have tried to do this in the least intrusive way possible. \nWe have done it by saying, with respect to choice chips, we will not \nsay by when it should be done. We leave it up to the industry in \nconjunction with the FCC to determine the time at which it is practical \nto have this requirement go into effect. We leave it up to the experts: \nWhen is the time to have it go into effect?\n  With respect to the question of a rating system, we give the industry \na year to work in conjunction with all interested parties on a \nvoluntary basis to determine a rating system. They have done it in \nCanada. As I indicated earlier, the software industry, we gave them the \nsame chance and they responded. They did a good job. So we are saying \nwe believe this industry can do the same thing.\n  I wish to applaud the television manufacturers. They have gone a long \nway toward developing this technology. But clearly, if it is going to \nbe widely disseminated in this country, it is going to require us to do \na little something, just do a little something. The American people \nwant us to act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  [[Page S8234]]\n  \n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I feel like Frank Clement at the 1956 \nconvention. How long, 0, America, how long will we continue to debate \nand not act? I share the same frustration that the distinguished \nSenators from Connecticut and North Dakota share on this particular \nscore.\n  Over 2 years ago, getting right to one of the main points about the \nleast intrusive manner--and the Senator from North Dakota is right on \ntarget there relative to constitutionality because he has read the \ncases, and we have all studied them, and that is what you have to do in \norder to qualify constitutionally in this particular measure--the least \nintrusive measure is with respect to children.\n  Yes, the courts have held you could not regulate violence with \nrespect to the distinguished Presiding Officer and this particular \nSenator as adults. It is unconstitutional to try to even attempt it. So \nwe found that you could do it with children. So having found that it \ncould be done with children, then the least intrusive measure is not as \nsuggested in this particular amendment, plus its perfection by the \nSenator from Connecticut; the least intrusive is limited to that period \nof time during the day when children are a substantial or majority \nportion of the viewing audience. That does not get them all. I feel, as \nthe Senator sponsoring this measure, that I would like to get it all. I \nwould like to get it all the time, but constitutionally I cannot. I \nthink there is too much violence for all of us.\n  But constitutionally, not being able to, that would be one particular \ndefect, as I see it, in the approach that has been brought out in \nhearings heretofore, and hearings heretofore incidentally back in 1993 \nthat we had the present Attorney General study S. 470, which is now \nbefore our committee, a bill by Senator Inouye, myself, and others. And \nAttorney General Reno attested to the fact that she thought it would \ndefinitely pass constitutional muster.\n  There is another feature with respect to this--and I am not just nit-\npicking because, if they call the amendment and we vote it, I would \nstill vote for the amendment, I say to the Senator. Do not worry about \nthat.\n  But what happens is you have a fee in here, also. When we had a fee 2 \nyears ago, Senator Bentsen--no, this was 4 years ago, because 2 years \nago he was the Secretary of Treasury--but 4 years ago when we had a \nsimilar hearing, he said, ``Wait a minute, the fee belongs in the \nFinance Committee,'' and someone later on would raise that point. I \nwould still vote for it.\n  There are these kinds of misgivings. I remember the distinguished \nchairman of the Communications Subcommittee on the House side--the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer would know and be familiar with the \nhonorable Congressman Ed Markey, of Massachusetts. He had what he \ncalled then the V-chip. They are calling this the choice chip. He ran \ninto these similar problems. But it is not my argument.\n  So we have had problems. Like I said, how long, America, are we going \nto consider and do nothing because there is a problem for every \nsolution?\n  I would prefer--it would be up to the sponsors of the bill; I am \nconfident our distinguished chairman would prefer--to take these \nperfecting amendments, with a matter of a fee there, and otherwise, to \nhave a hearing on this and guarantee we will bring out a bill of some \nkind that we think is constitutional.\n  I do not want them to think it is a putoff. I do know there is an \ninherent danger here that I immediately feel, having been in this \nparticular discipline now for a long time. I started off last week in \nthe opening statement I made that evening--I think it was last \nWednesday evening--that any particular entity or discipline in \ncommunications has the power to block the bill.\n  I can see the broadcasters, when they see fees, running around trying \nto block this bill. That, again, is not necessarily a valid argument \nagainst the amendments of the Senators from North Dakota and \nConnecticut. But there are these inherent dangers that immediately \narise. I can think of several others.\n  I have the opportunity to distinguish what we have pending before the \ncommittee. I implore the authors to go along with it, but if they want \nto vote, I am convinced the majority leader is ready to vote for them. \nIs it the desire of these Senators, irregardless, as my Congressman \nRivers used to say down home, irregardless, you are going to want to \nvote one way or the other, period, because I do not know whether it is \nour duty to argue further, I say to the chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished managers of the \nbill, Senator Hollings and Senator Pressler, that we do intend to get a \nvote on this matter. We have many national organizations that have \nwaited years to have Congress speak on this question. We have gone \nthrough draft after draft after draft to address the legitimate \nconcerns of people to make this as reasonable and unintrusive as \npossible.\n  I just say to the Senator from South Carolina, there is no fee in the \nunderlying Conrad amendment. None. There is no fee here. The second-\ndegree amendment has a fee. But the Conrad amendment has no fee; none, \nzero.\n  As I say, we have done this in the least intrusive way possible. We \nare trying to respond to what is the legitimate concern voiced by the \nSenator from South Carolina. I might say, the Senator from South \nCarolina [Senator Hollings] has been a great leader on this issue. He \nhas been someone who is concerned and has repeatedly raised the issue \nof violence in the media. He has said we ought to do something about \nit, and he has been willing to do that.\n  The American people want something done, and the least intrusive way \nto do it is to have choice chips on the televisions. American people \noverwhelmingly want it. It costs less than $5 a television set, and \nindustry representatives just told us this morning that when it is in \nmass production, they believe some of these chips will cost as little \nas 18 cents--18 cents--a television set, to provide parents the right \nto choose what their kids see.\n  In addition, we create a rating system so that parents have some idea \nof what the programming will contain before they see it. Eighty-three \npercent of the American people say they want such a rating system. \nAgain, we have done it in the least intrusive way possible. We do not \nlet the Government decide it. We say, ``Industry, you meet with all \nindustry parties, meet with the parents and teachers, meet with the \nschool principals, meet with all the people who are concerned about \nthis issue, meet with the church leaders and, on a voluntary basis, \ncome up with a rating system and you have a year to do that without any \nGovernment interference or action.''\n  Again, I say to the chairman, who has the difficult challenge of \nmanaging this bill, we would like a vote. I, at this point, ask for the \nyeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would like to reserve the right to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Is there a sufficient second? The Chair did not hear the Senator from \nSouth Dakota. The Chair is asking if there is a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me make a request here. I see the Senator from \nVermont here. If we can lay this aside--the problem we have is the \nmemorial service for Les Aspin. Some Members want to speak, \nparticularly the Senator from Illinois has requested a chance to speak \non this amendment before we made any decision about it. So we already \nmade one decision about it. I am wondering if the Senator from Vermont \ncould offer his amendment, if he will allow us to do that. We have been \nworking under the tortuous process of having all these conflicts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I had discussed with the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina the possibility of going with one of my major amendments. I \nunderstand we have some votes at 4 o'clock, or something to that \neffect. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues and friends that I would \nbe perfectly willing to go forward with the so-called interLATA \namendment, if that would be helpful, right after the vote. I have to \nspeak with some of the other cosponsors, but I would be happy to enter \n[[Page S8235]] into a relatively short time agreement and an agreed-\nupon time to vote on it.\n  As my colleagues know, I rarely bring up anything that is going to \ntake very long. I do not want to hold up people, and I have another \namendment. So I would be very happy, once I bring it up, to enter into \na relatively short time agreement with a time certain for a vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am trying to help Senator Simon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will do it right after the 4 o'clock vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not think Senator Simon is going to be able to \nspeak until 4:15, when the bus gets back from the Les Aspin service. If \nmy friends agree, I ask unanimous-consent that this amendment be laid \naside until Senator Simon can speak and we go to the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the chairman and the ranking member, I will not \nobject, but I just want to say that I ask for the opportunity to answer \nSenator Simon if he makes a statement in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am just trying to accommodate that side of the aisle. \nI do not know if he is for the amendment or against the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not either. I do not need a unanimous-consent \nagreement or anything of the kind. I just ask the chairman for his \nacknowledgment that we will have a chance to debate it.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, yes; absolutely. You shall always have a chance to \nspeak on anything you want as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will be happy to lay it aside.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nI just want to take this moment to respond to the remarks of the \nSenator from South Dakota, to thank him for his support of the concept, \nto acknowledge that he has been on the frontier of this one and has \nbeen a pioneer for quite a while, and also to say, in the interim, \nwhile this amendment is being laid aside, I am going to pursue the \nsuggestion that he made to modify the amendment to remove the fee \nprovision from my second-degree amendment. It was put in there to make \nthis ratings board self-financing. If the distinguished ranking member \nthinks that may complicate the future of the proposal, I will be happy \nto modify it. So I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from South Dakota is agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1348\n\n (Purpose: To protect consumers of electric utility holding companies \nengaged in the provision of telecommunications services, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1348.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 76, after line 10, insert the following new \n     subsection: ``Authority to disallow recovery of certain \n     costs.--Section 318 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 825q) \n     is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 318.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end of thereof the following:\n       ``(b)(1) The Commission shall have the authority to \n     disallow recovery in jurisdictional rates of any costs \n     incurred by a public utility pursuant to a transaction that \n     has been authorized under section 13(b) of the Public Utility \n     Holding Company Act of 1935, including costs allocated to \n     such public utility in accordance with paragraph (d), if the \n     Commission determines that the recovery of such costs is \n     unjust, unreasonable, or unduly preferential or \n     discriminatory under sections 205 or 206 of this Act.\n       ``(2) Nothing in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n     1935, or any actions taken thereunder, shall prevent a State \n     Commission from exercising its jurisdiction to the extent \n     otherwise authorized under applicable law with respect to the \n     recovery by a public utility in its retail rates of costs \n     incurred by such public utility pursuant to a transaction \n     authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission under \n     section 13(b) between an associate company and such public \n     utility, including costs allocated to such public utility in \n     accordance with paragraph (d).\n       ``(c) In any proceeding of the Commission to consider the \n     recovery of costs described in subsection (b)(1), there shall \n     be a rebuttable presumption that such costs are just, \n     reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential \n     within the meaning of this Act.\n       ``(d)(1) In any proceeding of the Commission to consider \n     the recovery of costs, the Commission shall give substantial \n     deference to an allocation of charges for services, \n     construction work, or goods among associate companies under \n     section 13 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, \n     whether made by rule, regulation, or order of the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission prior to or following the enactment \n     of the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995.\n       ``(2) If the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     establishes an allocation of charges that differs from an \n     allocation established by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission with respect to the same charges, the allocation \n     established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall \n     be effective 12 months from the date of the order of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory\n      Commission establishing such allocation, and binding on the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission as of that date.\n       ``(e) An allocation of charges for services, construction \n     work, or goods among associate companies under section 13 of \n     the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, whether made \n     by rule, regulation, or order of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission prior to or following enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, \n     shall prevent a State Commission from using a different \n     allocation with respect to the assignment of costs to any \n     associate company.\n       ``(f) Subsection (b) shall not apply--\n       ``(1) to any cost incurred and recovered prior to July 15, \n     1994, whether or not subject to refund or adjustment;\n       ``(2) to any uncontested settlement approved by the \n     Commission or State Commission prior to the enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995''; or\n       ``(3) to any cost incurred and recovered prior to September \n     1, 1994 pursuant to a contract or other arrangement for the \n     sale of fuel from Windsor Coal Company or Central Ohio Coal \n     Company which has been the subject of a determination by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission prior to September 1, \n     1994, or any cost prudently incurred after that date pursuant \n     to such a contract or other such arrangement before January \n     1, 2001.''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered by \nSenators Daschle and Kerrey and myself. I hope that we might get the \nmanagers of this bill to accept this amendment. It is precisely the \nlanguage that was in last year's telecommunications bill. I do not know \nwhat happened on the way to the forum this year.\n  Somehow or another it did not make it. Since it is the same language \nthat was in last year's bill, perhaps by the time we get around to \nfinishing the debate the floor managers might see fit to accept it.\n  Now, Mr. President, here is what this amendment is about: any company \nthat owns 10 percent of a utility company is considered a utility \nholding company. In 1935, because some public utility holding companies \nwere very big and very powerful, we passed the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act [PUHCA].\n  Holding companies that operate essentially on a multistate basis, 11 \nelectric utility holding companies and three natural gas utility \nholding companies--are what we call registered public utility holding \ncompanies. They must act and conduct themselves in accordance with \nPUHCA.\n  In my State, Arkansas Power & Light is owned by Entergy, a registered \nutility holding company. Entergy also owns utility subsidiaries in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.\n  The other public utility companies have a similar number of utility \nsubsidiaries. These 14 registered public utility holding companies \nserve approximately 50 million households in the United States.\n  The chart I have here contains a map of the affected States. All the \nStates in dark blue, are served by registered utility holding \ncompanies. The States in light blue, including North Dakota, South \nDakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, will be served by registered holding \ncompanies following the completion of proposed mergers. [[Page S8236]] \n  Under the telecommunications bill, PUHCA will be amended to permit \nthese public utility holding companies to get into telecommunications \nactivities. Unlike the baby Bells, they can enter into these businesses \nimmediately after the President puts his signature on this bill. No \nquestions asked.\n  Here is what I am trying to address with this amendment. In 1971, a \nutility subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company, \nAmerican Electric Power, the Ohio Power Co., which is an electric \nutility company, entered into a contract with a sister affiliate, \ncalled Southern Ohio Coal Co.\n  In 1971, 24 years ago, Southern Ohio Coal Company agreed to sell coal \nto Ohio Power under a contract. They said, ``We will sell you coal at \nour cost.'' Think about that. One sister company is saying to another \nsister company ``We will sell you coal at our cost.'' The only agency \nwith authority to scrutinize that contract as to whether it is a good \ncontract or a bad contract for consumers is the Securities and Exchange \nCommission [SEC], as is required by PUHCA.\n  The SEC looked at the contract in 1971 and said ``this is just hunky-\ndory. Fine contract. Off you go.'' The coal company sold its coal to \nits sister company--both of them owned by the same parent--Ohio Power, \nwhich generated electricity and obviously passed the cost of the coal \nas a part of its costs to the ratepayers in Ohio.\n  If you are sitting around at night in your house worrying about your \nelectric bill and that air-conditioner is going full-time because it \nhas been a hot day, you worry about the price of the power, but you \nassume that somebody, somewhere, is making sure what you are paying for \nthat air-conditioning that day is a fair price.\n  Electric rate regulation in this country is conducted at both the \nFederal and State levels. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n[FERC] is the only body that regulates the rates charged for power sold \nat the wholesale level. Everybody here knows what FERC is. FERC \nregulates wholesale sales of power.\n  What is a wholesale sale of power? That is the sale of power to a \nutility which in turn will sell it to the people who buy its power. \nOnly FERC can set those rates.\n  Back to the guy sitting in his living room with the air-conditioning \ngoing. He does not realize that Southern Ohio Coal Company is selling \ncoal to Ohio Power, who is generating electricity for his air-\nconditioner. He did not realize that the coal company was charging Ohio \nPower as much as twice as much as that coal could be bought for on the \nopen market. That is right--100 percent more than their cost.\n  So, the municipalities that bought power from Ohio Power Company got \nto thinking, ``We are getting ripped off.'' So they go to FERC and they \nsay, ``Listen, FERC, we are paying a utility rate for electricity that \nhas been generated with coal from Southern Ohio Coal Co. and Ohio Power \nis giving them as much as 100 percent profit.'' That is right. Ohio \nPower is paying the coal company 100 percent more than they can buy \nfrom anybody else in southern Ohio.\n  They go to FERC and say, ``how about giving us a break on our rates? \nCheck this out and see if it is right.'' So FERC sends a bunch of \ninvestigators out to find out if this is a true story. What do we get? \nIt is. It is true.\n  Ohio Power has been paying up to 100 percent more for coal than they \ncould have bought it from anybody. And they have been putting it in \ntheir rates, and the poor guy sitting in his living room wondering how \nhe will pay for his electricity bill that month suddenly realizes he \nhas been taken.\n  So FERC says, ``This is not right. This is not fair by any standard. \nStop it. We are going to give you people a new rate. We will not sit by \nand tolerate something like this.''\n  What do you think Ohio Power did? Why, they did what any big fat-cat \ncorporation would do that has all the money in the world--they appealed \nthe FERC decision. Who did they appeal it to? The U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  The court of appeals decided that FERC had no jurisdiction. They did \nnot have a right to delve into this issue. The court said the only \nagency with authority to look at this issue is the Securities and \nExchange Commission. They approved the original contract. They said, it \nwas just fine. And 21 years have gone by and they never looked at it \nagain.\n  Incidentally, the poor little municipalities were continuing to get \nripped off. They filed a petition with the SEC in 1989. Guess what the \nSEC has done in the last 6 years with their petition? You guessed it, \nMr. President, nothing. Nothing.\n  When they saw that SEC was not going to do anything, that is the \nreason they took it to FERC and said, ``FERC, why don't you help us? \nYou have the jurisdiction to do it.''\n  FERC said, ``We do, and we will.''\n  The court of appeals said, ``No dice.''\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment is simple, straightforward, and \nfair. There are a lot of people in this body who are apprehensive about \nthis bill. Know why they are apprehensive? Because they are afraid that \nit will wind up being anticompetitive, instead of procompetitive.\n  There is one thing in this bill that everyone should understand. The \nbill addresses public utility holding companies. It talks about public \nutility holding companies. It talks about FERC.\n  And Senator D'Amato, to his credit, put a little proconsumer language \nin this bill. But his language will not ensure that poor old Joe \nLunchbucket sitting in his living room worrying about his air-\nconditioning bill will be protected. Tom Daschle, Bob Kerrey and Dale \nBumpers, we care about what his electric bill will be this month.\n  We are offering this amendment to prohibit cross-subsidization \nbetween affiliates of a public utility holding company. We are saying, \n``We are not going to allow these people to charge 100 percent more \nthan their cost and charge it to this poor guy sitting in his living \nroom watching television.''\n  This amendment is directly related to the telecommunications bill. \nThese public utility holding companies, serving more than 50 million \nhouseholds, want to get involved in the telecommunications business. I \nam for them. I want them in the cable television business. I want \ncompetition in the cable television business.\n  As I said in my opening statement, if the President signs this bill \nthe public utility holding companies can immediately go into the \ntelecommunications business--telephone, cable television, you name it.\n  So what I am saying is I do not want one utility company that \ngenerates electricity ripping off their sister affiliates and charging \nit to poor old Joe Lunchbucket. I do not want sister affiliates \ninflating their costs from one company to another and passing it on to \nany ratepayers.\n  Let me give an illustration. This chart explains precisely what I am \ntalking about. Here is the registered holding company--let us assume \nthis is American Electric Power. Here is a subsidiary which sells both \nfuel and telecommunications services. This subsidiary, we will say, is \nSouthern Ohio Coal Co. They are mining coal and selling it to these \nutilities. But let us assume they are also in the telecommunications \nbusiness, all of a sudden. They start shifting their costs from \ntelecommunications to their coal operations, so they can compete better \nin the telecommunications market. They shift their costs over to the \ncoal company, knowing that nobody is guarding the store, and that they \ncan charge it to these utility companies and put it right back on old \nJoe Lunchbucket again. Not only are they going to charge them this \nexorbitant rate for coal and make him pay for it through his electric \nbill, now they are going to go to the telecommunications business and \nshift the cost from the telecommunications to coal, so their \ntelecommunications cost will be so much less nobody can compete with \nthem here in Washington, DC, or in Little Rock, AR.\n  Here is another example. Here is the same registered utility holding \ncompany. They form a telecommunications subsidiary. In addition, the \nholding company already has a service company which performs certain \nfunctions for the utility subsidiaries.\n  Let us assume that the telecommunications company is going to provide \ntelecommunications services to the service company. They are going to \ncharge them just like the coal company did, a 100 percent profit. And \nthen what is going to happen? They are [[Page S8237]] going to pass it \nright down to the utility companies through the service company \ncontracts and the utilities are going to pass it down to old Joe \nLunchbucket again.\n  Mr. President, this gets a little complicated for people who have not \ndealt with it for the past 3 years, as I have. As I say, I am still a \nlittle nonplused about why my amendment was in the bill last year and \nis not in the bill this year. I guess somebody just felt they had a \nlittle more clout this year. They might not have liked it last year. I \nam not rocking the boat, but a lot of people, as I say, are worried \nabout how the consumer comes out in all of this. If my amendment is not \nadopted, I can tell you exactly how the consumer is going to come out \nif he buys any services from a registered public utility holding \ncompany.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is already at the \ndesk that I have discussed with the managers of this bill. It is \nsimilar to an earlier amendment that was offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania and adopted, I believe 90-something to something, dealing \nwith incidental interLATA relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Bumpers amendment be \nlaid aside temporarily so that we may consider this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on this chart I am going to show the \nproblem. We also have an illustration of why this amendment is needed \nor why we need to change the current method of regulation.\n  We have in the United States of America, since the divestiture in \nAT, created these local access transport areas (LATA's) throughout \nthe country defining what local telephone service is. In northeast \nNebraska, we have two--644 and 630. The red line down the center \nseparates one from the other.\n  We have established a method to get our K through 12 schools hooked \nup to the Internet that requires us to go through a central hub. There \nare a number of them called educational service units.\n  Unfortunately for schools up in the northeastern part of the State, \nthey have to cross one of these artificial boundaries, these LATA \nboundaries, in order to get to this little red dot here which \nrepresents the Wakefield, NE, educational service unit. All of these \nschool districts here--Jackson, South Sioux City, Dakota City, Homer, \nHubbard, Winnebago, Walthill, Macy, Rosalie--all have to cross that \nLATA in order to be able to connect to the educational service unit in \nWakefield. It is about 17 miles total, somewhere in that range, from \none of these towns to this central hub.\n  This problem was identified to me originally by a principal, Chuck \nSquire, of Macy School, as he was trying to get his school hooked up to \nthe Internet. The requirement was again, as I said, to go through \nWakefield. Because it crosses that interLATA boundary, it is no longer \na local call. You have to pay an access charge when you are going from \nhere to any one of these schools over here. The cost for dedicated \nInternet service if the local Bell company could provide the service \nwould be approximately $180 a month, with an $800 installation charge. \nBut for a long distance company, it ends up being almost $1,100 a month \nwith a $1,000 installation charge, because the traffic needs to be \nrouted across the State boundary.\n  What happens is the schools end up with about $10,000 to $12,000 more \nper year in the monthly charge. These are very small school districts, \nmost of them, and $12,000 ends up being a lot of money. They get \nnothing more for it.\n  And this amendment, as I said, that I have discussed both with the \nchairman of the committee and with the ranking member, would grant \nincidental LATA relief to the Bell Operating Companies to provide \ndedicated two-way video or Internet service for this dedicated purpose, \nin this case the K through 12 environment.\n  The hope is, of course, that the legislation itself will eventually \nobliterate the need to ask for this kind of incidental relief. The hope \nis that these kinds of restrictions that make it difficult for prices \nto come down--you can see in a competitive environment, if you had \ncompetition at play here, these prices would go down. This price was \nnot high as a consequence of some cost. It is a consequence entirely of \nthe current regulatory structure.\n  So again, I am finished describing what the amendment does. I hope \nthat the amendment can be simply agreed to at this time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska is waiting for a response from this side, there is an \namendment on interLATA rates which I discussed with the distinguished \nSenator at the time. We wanted to make absolutely clear that we did not \nopen up a big loophole. The distinguished Senator now has it limited. \nIt is dedicated, and I think in good order. We are prepared to accept \nthe amendment on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from South Carolina wait for \na second?\n  We do not have the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will send a copy that I have here to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1335\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the incidental services which Bell operating \ncompanies may provide shall include two-way interactive video services \n    or Internet services to or for elementary and secondary schools)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. KERREY] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1335.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 94, strike out line 16 and all that follows page \n     94, line 23, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(B) providing--\n       ``(i) a telecommunications service, using the transmission \n     facilities of a cable system that is an affiliate of such \n     company, between LATAs within a cable system franchise area \n     in which such company is not, on the date of enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1995, a provider of wireline \n     telephone exchange service, or\n       ``(ii) two-way interactive video services or Internet \n     services over dedicated facilities to or for elementary and \n     secondary schools as defined in section 264(d),''.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we just saw this amendment about 30 \nminutes ago for the first time. We have been juggling six amendments. \nWe would ask that the Senator withhold asking for a vote on it until we \nhave a chance to study this amendment. I commend the Senator from \nNebraska. It looks like something that I am taking a favorable look at. \nBut we have not run it through all the hoops over here.\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not quite follow. I thought earlier we had discussed \nit.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We discussed it last night, and had not agreed to \naccept it. But we just saw it for the first time 30 minutes ago. At \nthat time, the Senator said he was going to supply us with a different \ncopy. Do we have the final copy of the amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. We just sent a copy to the desk.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Do we have a final copy of the amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator should have the final copy now.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will the Senator agree to set it aside and give us a \nchance to look at it? It will take us 15 minutes. We want to take a \nlook at it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Sure. I would be pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. [[Page S8238]] \n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my colleague yield? I have a unanimous-consent \nrequest. May I make this unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have no objection to that at all.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. By the way, we are looking forward very much to hearing \nthe Senator's views on this. We have been holding the option open.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the McCain amendment 1276, to be followed immediately by a vote \non the motion to table the Feinstein amendment number 1270, and that \nthe time between now and 4 p.m, which is 1 minute, be equally divided \nin the usual form for debate on either amendment. So there would be no \nfurther debate. I think we have debated both amendments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, do I \nunderstand the Senator moved to table the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No; we are proceeding to vote on the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to table the McCain amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, the Chair has not ruled \non that request, have you?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, I have not.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Sure.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Sure.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 917 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request is pending.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the request \nis that we vote at 4 o'clock; is that correct?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes; I am trying to get two votes out of the way so we \ncan get moving along, so to speak. We still have some Senators coming \nback from the Les Aspin function. Then we will have a full force, and \nwe will then do some business.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will the manager agree that after that, I be recognized? I \nhave no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the unanimous-\nconsent request is agreed to.\n  There is 1 minute of time divided equally between the manager of the \nbill and the ranking member.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. There must be no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager has control of the time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest that the hour of 4 p.m. has arrived and there \nwould be no time to divide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Chair notes that the Senator from Alaska is seeking recognition. \nDoes the manager wish to yield him his time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may. I simply want to speak very briefly, about 3 \nminutes, in opposition to the Ohio Power amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Then I ask unanimous consent that at the end of 3 \nminutes the Senate will vote on the two votes that have been requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend, the floor manager.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending amendment to \noverturn the Ohio Power court case. I am opposed to it simply because \nit is bad policy, and I will explain briefly why.\n  In the Ohio Power case, the U.S. court of appeals held that the \nCongress gave a single Federal agency--the Securities and Exchange \nCommission--jurisdiction over the interaffiliate transactions of \nregistered electric utility holding companies. Those utilities sell \npower to an estimated 50 million households in 30 States.\n  The court said that a second Federal agency, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, cannot also regulate the same matter. No dual \nregulation, the court said.\n  So, Mr. President, good public policy is that if something must be \nregulated, then one and only one agency should do it, not two, which is \nthe provision in the amendment before us. Utilities should not be \nwhipsawed between the conflicting decisions of two different regulatory \nagencies. Unfortunately, that is precisely what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, the proponent of the amendment argues that the FERC is \na better regulator than the SEC; that we ought to overturn Ohio Power \nso that the FERC can regulate these transactions. But rather than take \njurisdiction away from the SEC and give it to the FERC, the pending \namendment allows both agencies to regulate the same matter.\n  I question the claim that FERC has been a better regulator than the \nSEC. I am less concerned about which agency regulates than having only \none agency regulate. If both agencies use the same statutory standard \nfor making their decisions and if both made their decisions at the same \ntime, then the problems created by dual regulation might be manageable. \nBut that is not how it will work if the pending amendment is adopted.\n  First, the SEC will regulate pursuant to the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act, and the FERC will regulate pursuant to the Federal Power \nAct. These two laws have different statutory standards, and the result \nwill be conflicting regulatory decisions.\n  Second, because of differences in the two statutes, the decisions \nmade by the SEC and the FERC cannot take place at the same time. The \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act requires preapproval by the SEC, \nwhereas the Federal Power Act provides for post-transaction review by \nthe FERC. In the Ohio Power case, for example, the FERC acted 11 years \nafter the SEC made its regulatory decision.\n  In short, the two regulatory systems are incompatible. Neither is \ninherently better than the other, they are simply different. The Ohio \nPower court recognized that fact; the pending amendment ignores it.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that the pending amendment does \nnot respect the sanctity of contracts. It is intended to allow the FERC \nto retroactively overturn longstanding, SEC-approved contracts. Some of \nthese contracts have been in place for more than a decade, and the \nparties have invested many hundreds of millions of dollars. Those \ninvestments will be placed in jeopardy if the pending amendment is \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, the proponent of the amendment also claims that it is \nneeded to restore State public utility commission jurisdiction to where \nit was prior to Ohio Power. However, in some respects, the amendment \nactually has the opposite effect. It specifically prohibits State \npublic utility commissions from using a cost allocation method \ndifferent from one the SEC uses. In short, the pending amendment will \nrequire State public utility commissions to do what the SEC tells them \nto do.\n  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the amendment is its \nresurrection of the very cost trapping the Ohio Power court found \nunacceptable. This will happen when a utility incurs costs pursuant to \nan SEC-approved contract but the FERC subsequently denies the \npassthrough of those approved costs.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the amendment would create a complex, \noverlapping, and confusing regulatory maze. It would allow electric \nagencies to be squeezed between the conflicting agency decisions. That \nis bad public policy.\n  Mr. President, the amendment should be rejected, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  I thank the floor managers for the opportunity to speak in opposition \nto the Bumpers amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Bumpers \namendment be voted on in 10 minutes and the Senator from Mississippi \nhave 10 minutes to speak on it--5 minutes each. At that point we will \nmove to table the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nintend to object, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee if he would add that, after the vote on the Bumpers \namendment, Senator Simon then be recognized for an amendment that he \nhas been seeking recognition on.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement I \nbelieve we have 10 minutes, now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Chamber.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1348\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that we do have 10 minutes now of debate on the \nBumpers amendment, and then we would go to a vote at that point. So I \nwould like to be heard briefly in opposition to the Bumpers amendment.\n  First, before I do that, I thank the Senator from Arkansas. Although \nI cannot support his amendment, I appreciate his willingness to work \nwith me and Senator D'Amato in developing appropriate safeguards as \nregistered utilities enter this telecommunications area. I also thank \nhim for working last year to resolve these issues in the Energy \nCommittee. Of course it involves the Banking Committee as well as the \nEnergy Committee. He was very cooperative in that effort.\n  The amendment he raises today should be considered, but not on this \nlegislation. The Energy Committee has rightfully asked that such \namendment first go through the Energy Committee where it was considered \nlast year in preparation for the telecommunications bill being voted on \nby the Commerce Committee. So I must honor Senator Murkowski's request \nas chairman of the committee on that matter and oppose the amendment on \nthat basis, if no other. Having said that, I want to point to the \nsubstantial safeguards that were included in the managers' amendment to \naddress the concerns of Senators D'Amato and Bumpers.\n  I would also like to take just a moment to point out the critical \nimportance of this provision to the legislation and in particular to \nour region of the country, because it is going to provide an \nopportunity for tremendous services through the utility companies in \nour area and really will go a long way to providing the smart homes we \nhave been talking about in addition to the new smart information \nhighways.\n  What this all involves is the now famous Ohio Power case, and it \ndeals with a Supreme Court ruling that restricts a State's right to \ndisallow certain costs between companies in a registered holding \ncompany system for the purposes of ratemaking. With respect to such \ntransactions related to telecommunications activities, this matter has \nalready been addressed with language that prevents cross-subsidization \nbetween the companies. To the extent there remain unresolved issues \nregarding the broader application of the Ohio Power case, they should \nbe dealt with by the Congress as part of its overall review of the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act, PUHCA.\n  Senator D'Amato has indicated he will hold hearings on it and \nconsider comprehensive PUHCA legislation later this session. I feel \nvery strongly that is needed.\n  For these reasons the Bumpers amendment is not necessary at this time \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The purpose of the telecommunications bill is to allow competition in \nthe broadest sense possible in the provision of telecommunications \nservices. Most utility companies are already able to participate in the \nmarket. However, current law prevents the 14 registered utility holding \ncompanies from fully participating in telecommunications markets. With \nappropriate consumer protections, this amendment allows registered \nutility holding companies to enter this important market on the same \nfooting as other utilities and new market entrants. The amendment would \nallow a registered holding company to create a separate subsidiary \ncompany that would provide telecommunications and information services.\n  The amendment contains numerous consumer protection provisions--the \nbill itself--which would be substantially altered by what the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas is trying to do here.\n  So the public utility company subsidiary of a registered holding \ncompany may not issue securities and assume obligations or pledge or \nmortgage utility assets on behalf of a telecommunications affiliate \nwithout approval by State regulators. Also, protections in the bill say \na telecommunications subsidiary of a registered holding company must \nmaintain separate books, records and accounts and must provide access \nto its books to the States. State regulators may order an independent \naudit and the public utility is required to pay for that audit. If \nordered by State regulators, a public utility may file a quarterly \nreport, if that is ordered by the State regulators. Also, the public \nutility company must notify State regulators within 10 days after the \nacquisition by its parent company of an interest in telecommunications.\n  So there are very strong protections here. I think what we are \ntalking about is making sure these registered utility holding companies \ncan provide these services. It greatly enhances the opportunity for \ninformation and for competition, and I do not believe we need this \namendment for there to be adequate protections for the consumer. They \nare in the bill. [[Page S8240]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. We took great precautions to make sure those protections \nwere included in the bill. So for these reasons outlined, I urge defeat \nof the Bumpers amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues who were \nnot here for the earlier part of this debate, let me just say that my \namendment is what I would call the do-right amendment. It was \nprecipitated by an incorrect decision issued by the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals in the Ohio Power case. In 1992, a bunch of cities who \nbought power from a utility subsidiary of a registered utility holding \ncompany, named Ohio Power. They were buying power from Ohio Power and \nOhio Power was buying coal to generate that power from a sister company \ncalled Southern Ohio Coal.\n  The municipalities went to FERC, because FERC sets wholesale rates; \nthat is power sold from a utility company to a city, for example. And \nthey say, ``We think Ohio Power's rates are too high and the reason \nthey are too high is because this coal company is charging its sister \ncompany an exorbitant rate for coal.'' FERC sends their investigators \nout and what do they find? They found Ohio Power is charging 100 \npercent more for coal than that coal can be bought from anybody else in \nsouthern Ohio. What is happening is Ohio Power is paying twice as much \nfor coal and what are they doing? They are passing it right on down to \nthe municipalities who, in turn, have to pass it right on down to Joe \nLunchbucket, who is worried about how he is going to pay his air-\nconditioning bill this month. It is just that simple. That is all there \nis to this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is this the identical amendment which was passed out of \nthe Energy Committee after a great deal of hearings and work last year, \nI believe it was 14 to 5?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment is the precise language \nreported out of the Energy Committee, 14 to 5 last year. And it was \nincorporated in this bill precisely that way. There is nothing new \nabout it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The problem with the Court of Appeals' decision in Ohio \nPower is that the court said that the SEC is the only regulatory body \nwith authority to protect consumers. And the problem is, the SEC will \nnot, and possibly can not, do it.\n  They approved the original contract and for 24 years have refused to \nlook at it. So what happens? The consumers are paying twice as much for \ncoal as the coal can be bought from anyplace else.\n  I am just simply saying cross-subsidization of these affiliate \ncompanies held by public utility holding companies is wrong. There is \nnot a person within earshot of my voice today who believes it is right. \nWhy would you not vote to stop that? Why would you not give poor old \nJoe Lunchbucket a little bit of a break out of this? If you do not, \nthese same holding companies are going to go into telecommunications, \nand unlike Pacific Bell, Bell South, Southwestern Bell, they go in the \nday the President puts his signature on this bill. They can be in the \ncable business. They can go into anything they want to. They do not \nhave to go to the FCC and the Justice Department.\n  They can also orchestrate transactions between sister companies. Who \nis going to sell what to whom? One sister sells telecommunications \nproducts to another. And maybe that company also sells coal to a \nutility company. They pass it on. Even the telecommunications cost goes \nright down to the utility, right down to poor old Joe Lunchbucket. \nNobody here believes that is right.\n  Do you know who favors my amendment? Every State public service \ncommission. The Consumer Federation of America, the industrial energy \nconsumers, including General Motors and Dow Chemical are even for it. \nThe National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, the Ohio \nWholesale Customers Group, and on and on. They all support the Bumpers \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of anything further that I can say. This \nis an opportunity to protect consumers. If you want competition, you \ncannot have it unless you support this amendment because, if you do \nnot, these anticompetitive practices will continue. It is just that \nsimple.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from South Dakota to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 252 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1348) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow return to the Dorgan amendment No. 1278 and that there be 20 \nminutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form, with no \namendments in order to the Dorgan amendment; that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of time I will be recognized to move to table the Dorgan \namendment 1278, which deals with the 35 percent for national markets \nbeing lowered to 25 percent of the national media market, and this \nwould move us forward. The Dorgan amendment is ready for voting. I \nwould plead with everybody to let us vote on this and then proceed.\n  My motion would ask that we go to the Dorgan amendment 1278.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Lieberman amendment to the Conrad \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Lieberman amendment or the Dorgan amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Lieberman amendment to the Conrad \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the pending business.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President and chairman of the committee, I would be \nreluctant to agree to this request if we cannot get some agreement on \nwhen our amendment would be handled. We are the pending business, the \nLieberman second-degree amendment to the Conrad amendment. We would \nlike to get this matter resolved. We have had a lengthy discussion, and \nI [[Page S8241]] would hope that we could move to a vote on that. And \nso I would be constrained to object unless there was some meeting of \nthe minds with respect to when we would get to our amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me say that the Dorgan amendment came up first, and \nwe are struggling to move forward here. Several Senators are seeking \nagreements that I am not in a position to give. This is something we \ncould get done and behind us in the next 30 to 35 minutes. It is a \nmajor amendment involving the percentage of national media that one \ncompany or group can control. It is now set at 35 percent in the bill. \nThe Dorgan amendment, as I understand it, would strike that and bring \nit back to 25 percent.\n  There has been debate on it. I think there is only one more speaker. \nI ask that we lay aside the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, if he will be kind enough to let us do that, and go to \nthe Dorgan amendment, get a vote on it, and keep on going from there.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say to the chairman, if I could, I have to \nregister objection if there is not some agreement reached----\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOLE. We can bring the Dorgan amendment back by regular order. We \ncan do it that way. Senator Simon has an amendment relating to \nviolence. We would like to have debate on all three amendments--the \nConrad amendment, the second-degree amendment, and then an amendment I \nam offering with Senator Simon, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that \nall relates to TV violence. I wonder if we might have the debate on all \nof those before we start voting. That is the only problem we have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As I understand, the pending business before the Senate \nis----\n  Mr. DOLE. Regular order brings back the Dorgan amendment, so I call \nfor the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is amendment No. 1278.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 20 \nminutes for debate equally divided on amendment No. 1278, and at the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, I be recognized to table the \nDorgan amendment No. 1278.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object. Again, can we not find \nsome way of having a meeting of the minds on what the order will be? I \nwill be happy to accommodate other Senators if there is some \nunderstanding of what the order is going to be.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the order is, after this, we go back to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. If you do not have any objection, the Senator from \nIllinois would like to at least be heard on his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Actually, the previous agreement was the Senator from \nIllinois would be recognized, and we certainly want to accommodate \nthat. But could we have an understanding with respect to what the order \nis then after that? If we can have a unanimous consent agreement, we \ncertainly would be open to entering into a time agreement, whatever \nelse, so there is some understanding, given the fact there are many \nSenators who are interested in this matter.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just say, what we are trying to do is finish the \nbill. All these amendments would fall if cloture is invoked. We could \ngo out and have the cloture vote at 9:30 in the morning. I am not \ncertain cloture would be invoked.\n  I think there has been some agreement. We heard the Conrad amendment, \nthe Lieberman second-degree amendment, some agreement on the Simon \namendment. As far as I am concerned, it is up to the managers. I think \nthey are prepared to vote on all three. I do not know what order.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I make a plea again to my friend from North Dakota, let \nus go to the Dorgan amendment for 20 minutes and vote on it, and \nmeanwhile have intense discussions so we can cover everyone's needs. \nThat would allow us to accomplish one more amendment. I think we are in \na very friendly position trying to work this out.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, could we have the unanimous consent request \nagreed to by the chairman of the committee, the manager of the bill, \nthat we go to Conrad-Lieberman and then go to Simon without putting a \ntime limit on it?\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the motion by the \ndistinguished chairman, that the Conrad-Lieberman amendment be next in \norder and the Simon amendment follow that with any second-degree \namendment in regard to it.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object. I appreciate what the \nSenator is doing. We also have to work in an agreement for debate on \nthe Simon-Dole amendment, if that is to occur.\n  Mr. FORD. There is no agreement as far as time is concerned. I \nrecognize the majority leader would have the right to second-degree the \nsense of the Senate, if that is what he wants to do. You are getting a \npecking order here. A time agreement has not been worked out. The \nmajority leader would not need much time.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, we can have the vote on the \nDorgan amendment and work this out during the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I was trying to work it out so my colleagues on this side \nwill be accommodated. I know the majority leader is trying to do that. \nWe want to get the bill finished as much as he does. If my friends from \nNorth Dakota and Illinois are satisfied, I will be glad to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may I inquire, is there then before us a \nsuggestion by the Senator from Kentucky that we hear from Senator Simon \nafter the Dorgan amendment has been offered, and then we would vote on \nthe Lieberman amendment, then we would vote on the Conrad amendment, \nthen we would vote on whatever amendments will be offered by Senator \nSimon and Senator Dole?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not know. We all need to have a little meeting \nabout that and work that through. Is it possible to go to the Dorgan \namendment for the 20 minutes, get that voted on, and during that time, \nwhen people are speaking on it, we will try to work all this out in \ngood faith? And I will act in very good faith.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object. I have not yet spoken on \nmy amendment because I had to leave for another meeting. I am to speak \nfor 10 minutes. I would like to reserve 5 minutes for Senator Helms as \na cosponsor. He is not in the Chamber at the moment, but I think he \nwould like some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. He is in the Cloakroom and ready to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is we have a unanimous-consent agreement \nfor 20 minutes. My understanding is I will take 10 minutes and 5 \nminutes is reserved for the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1278\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. The \nlegislation that comes to the floor of the Senate changes the ownership \nrules with respect to television stations. We now have a prohibition in \nthis country for anyone to own more than 12 television stations \ncomprising more than 25 percent of the national viewing audience.\n  My amendment restores the 12-television-station limit and the 25-\npercent-of-the-national-audience limit. Why do I do that? Because I \nthink the proper place to make that decision is at the Federal \nCommunications Commission. They are, in fact, studying those limits, \nand I have no objection to those studies. I think that they are useful \nto do because we ought to determine when is there effective competition \nor when would there be control or concentration such that it affects \ncompetition in a negative way.\n  But I do not believe that coming out here and talking about \ncompetition, [[Page S8242]] competition being something that benefits \nthe American people in this legislation on telecommunications, and then \nsaying, ``By the way, we will essentially restrict competition by \nallowing for great concentration in ownership of television stations,'' \nrepresents the public interest.\n  I can understand why some want to do it. I can understand that we \nwill end this process with five, six, or eight behemoth corporations \nowning most of the television stations in our country. But, frankly, \nthat will not serve the public interest.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully tell you the Senate is not now in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order? We will \nnot continue until the Senate has come to order. The Senator from North \nDakota will proceed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is not yet in order. I do not \nintend to proceed until the Senate is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those wishing to continue their conversations, \nplease take them off the floor. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, raising the national ownership limits on television \nstations resulting in concentration of corporate ownership of \ntelevision stations in this country will represent, in my judgment, a \ndramatic shift in power from the local affiliates in our television \nindustry to the national networks. The provision in this bill \nthreatens, in my judgment, local media control, both in terms of \nprogramming and in terms of news content, in favor of national control.\n  One of the amendments that will follow me will be an amendment on \ntelevision violence. I will tell you how to make television more \nviolent, especially in terms of the local markets, and that is have \nyour local television station sold to the networks, and there will not \nbe any local control or discussion about what they are going to show on \nthat local television station, because it will not be a local station \nanymore. You will remove local control, you will remove local \ndecisionmaking, you will concentrate ownership in the hands of a few \nand, in my judgment, that is simply not in the public interest.\n  These changes will result in a nationalization of television \nprogramming and the demise of localism and program decisions made at \nhome in local areas.\n  The bill changes of broadcast ownership rules that now exist at the \nFederal Communications Commission will lead to greater concentration \nand less diversity. I, for the life of me, cannot understand being on \nthe floor of the Senate for 5 or 6 days talking about competition and \nderegulation being the engine of competition in our country and then \nseeing a provision in a bill like this that says, ``Oh, by the way, you \nknow that limit that limits somebody to no more than 12 television \nstations, you can own no more than 12 television stations in the \ncountry; by the way, that limit is gone. You can own 25 television \nstations; in fact, buy 50 of them if you wish; just fine.''\n  Well, it is not fine with me.\n  Concentration does not serve the public interest. Go read a little \nabout Thomas Jefferson. Read a little about what he thought served the \npublic interest in this country--broad economic ownership serves the \npublic interest in America. Broad economic ownership serves the free \nmarket and serves the interests of competition. Not concentration. Not \nbehemoth corporations buying up and accumulating power and centralizing \npower, especially not in this area.\n  I know outside of our doors are plenty of people who want this \nprovision. It is big money and it is big business. I am telling \nSenators the country is moving in the wrong direction when it does \nthis.\n  There are not many voices that cry out on issues of antitrust or \nissues of concentration. There are not many voices raised in the public \ninterest on these issues. I just cannot for the life of me understand \npeople who chant about competition and chant about free markets, who so \nblithely ignore the threats to the free market system that come from \nconcentration of ownership. I feel very strongly that the provision in \nthis bill that eliminates the restriction on ownership is a provision \nthat is bad for this country.\n  Senator Simon from Illinois, I know, has probably spoken on this, and \nis a cosponsor of this amendment; and Senator Helms from North \nCarolina. Maybe we are appealing to the schizophrenics today. Somebody \non that side of the aisle who has a vastly different political outlook \non things than I do, but, frankly, my interest in this is not the \neconomic interests of this conglomerate or that conglomerate or that \ngroup, it is the interest of the public.\n  The public interest is served in America when there is competition \nand broad-based ownership. The public interest, in my judgment, is \nthreatened in this country, especially in this area, when we decide it \ndoes not matter how much you own or who owns it.\n  We have always served the interests of our country in this area by \nlimiting ownership. I think we serve the interests again if we pass my \namendment and restore those sensible provisions in communication law \nthat restrict the ownership of television stations to no more than 12, \nreaching no more than 25 percent of the American populace.\n  Mr. President, I have agreed to a time limit. This is a piece of \nlegislation that on its own should command a day's debate. It is that \nimportant to our country. Yet it is reduced to 20 minutes because we \nare in a hurry and we are busy.\n  My hope is that people who look at this will understand the \nconsequences of what we are doing. I am delighted that the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and some others feel as I do, that there is a way to \nrestore a public interest dimension to this bill by passing this \namendment this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina controls 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as a former executive at a television \nstation, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Dorgan amendment which \nis now pending. This amendment would ensure that local television news \nand programming decisions remain in the hands of local broadcasters.\n  It is a worthy amendment. The Senate ought not to hasten to vote to \ntable it. I will tell Senators why.\n  There is now a delicate balance of power between the network and \ntheir affiliates. I am concerned that if we allow the networks to \nacquire even more stations, the balance will be unwisely tilted. Media \npower should not be concentrated in the hands of network broadcasters. \nI say this as a former broadcaster who has been there.\n  The networks will kick the dickens out of an affiliate if the \naffiliates do not toe the line. On one occasion, my television station \nswitched networks because of the dominance of an overbearing network. \nIt was one of the smartest decisions we ever made. This bill increases \nwhat is known as the national audience cap from the current 25 percent \nto 35 percent. I oppose this increase, because it will allow the \nnetworks to acquire more stations. This, in turn, could very well \nincrease domination by the networks and enhance their ability to \nexercise undue control of television coverage on local events and news \nreports.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about the negative impact of \nallowing cable companies to buy television stations. Consider, if you \nwill, the possibility that Time Warner might buy up local cable station \ncompanies and local television stations.\n  The Dorgan amendment, which I cosponsor, restores, one, the 25 \npercent audience cap; and two, the restriction on cable broadcast \ncross-ownership.\n  If Congress increases the audience cap and thus the number of \nstations a network can acquire, it will be more difficult for a local \naffiliate to preempt a network program.\n  Mr. President, affiliates serve as a very good check against the \nindecent programs being proliferated these days by the networks. The \n``NYPD Blue'' program is an example. Many affiliates consider this show \nto be too violent and otherwise unacceptable because of its content of \noffensive material. When the affiliates objected to the program, the \nnetwork lowered the boom. There are too many indecent, sexually \nexplicit programs on television already.\n  Some time back, Mr. President, I sponsored an amendment to restrict \n[[Page S8243]] the level of indecent material on television. Guess who \nfought that amendment down to the ground and fought it in the courts? \nOf course, the networks. The networks resent being limited in the \namount of indecent material they can pump out over the airwaves. Do we \nreally want to give the networks more power? I say no, and the Dorgan \namendment says no.\n  The children of America, have spoken out about indecent material. In \na recent survey, 77 percent of the children polled said TV too often \nportrays extramarital sex, and 62 percent said sex on television \ninfluences children in that direction.\n  Mr. President, affiliate stations often preempt programming and carry \ninstead regional college sports and such things as Billy Graham's \nCrusade. These are important programs, and they should not be inhibited \nby network power.\n  We should not concentrate too much power in the hands of four \nnational networks. The current provision in S. 652 would make possible \njust that kind of concentration. If this ownership rule had not been in \nplace 10 years ago, the Fox Network could never have been created.\n  Local stations must have the freedom in the future to create and \nselect and control programming, other than programming provided by the \nnetworks.\n  I urge Senators to support this amendment to restore local control of \nbroadcasting decisions. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  I believe we have reached a point where, through competition, we can \nachieve more than by Government regulation to keep certain competitors \ndown.\n  I rather doubt that any one competitor is going to get a huge \ndominance in the American television market, because we have so many \ncompetitors. We have an increasing number.\n  When we have dial video, cable, PBS, the networks, I have here listed \nbefore me, the percentage of national coverage now by the top TV \ngroups, they will face increasing competition.\n  Frequently, business comes to Washington seeking regulation to avoid \ncompetition. To those people who want to put arbitrary limits on how \nmuch success one company can have, I would say that they should be \nprepared to compete.\n  Now, a 25-percent limitation may well force some groups or \nindividuals or companies to operate regionally, or to seek a niche \nmarket.\n  I believe we have enough competition to give a variety of voices. \nThat is particularly true if we pass this bill. There will be an \nexplosion of new services and alternatives.\n  In fact, I would even raise the limit to 50 percent or higher if I \nwere doing it myself. The Commerce Committee worked out a 35-percent \ncompromise--the Democrats and Republicans--on the committee, as well as \nin consultation with many other Senators.\n  I think 35 percent is a good compromise for the Senate. I expect that \nthe House will probably come with 50 percent. I look upon going back to \n25 percent as a move away from competition.\n  Why not 20 percent? Why not 10 percent? Why not 15 percent? All these \npercentages are anticompetitive, because it is businessmen coming to \nWashington who are seeking regulation to keep their competitors out. \nWhat they need to do is to compete, and they will find that they will \ndo well.\n  Mr. President, the broadcasters in cable are not the only means by \nwhich video programming, for example, is distributed to consumers. More \nthan 2 million households receive programming utilizing backyard \ndishes, availing them of numerous free services.\n  SMATV services are utilized by another million subscribers, wireless \ncable has attracted over half a million subscribers.\n  Recently direct broadcast satellite systems began offering very high-\nquality services. It is estimated that these services will attract more \nthan 1 million subscribers in 1995.\n  Looming large on the fringes of the market are the telephone \ncompanies. The telephone companies pose a very highly credible \ncompetitive threat because of their specific identities, the technology \nthey are capable of deploying, the technological evolution their \nnetworks are undergoing for reasons apart from video distribution, and, \nlast but by no means least, their financial strength and perceived \nstaying power. In 1993, the seven regional Bell operating companies \n[RBOC's] and GTE had combined revenues in excess of $100 billion. All \nof the major telephone companies in the United States have plans to \nenter the video distribution business, and several are\n currently striving mightily to do so in the face of heavy cable \nindustry opposition, opposition which speaks for itself in terms of the \nperceived strength of the competition telephone companies are expected \nto bring to bear.\n\n  Recently three of the RBOC's--Bell Atlantic, Nynex, and Pacific \nTelesis--announced the formation of a joint venture, capitalized \ninitially to the tune of $300 million, for the express purpose of \ndeveloping entertainment, information and interactive programming for \nnew telco video distribution systems. This group has hired Howard \nStringer, formerly of CBS, to head the venture and Michael Ovitz of \nCreative Artists Agency of Los Angeles to advise on programming and \ntechnology. A key aspect of this effort is development of navigator \nsoftware that eventually could replace VCR's and remote control units \nto help customers find programs and services. Three other RBOC's--\nBellSouth, Ameritech, and SBC Communications are forming a joint \nventure with Disney, with a combined investment of more than $500 \nmillion during the next 5 years. The goal of this venture is \nspecifically to develop, market and deliver video programming.\n  On top of all this activity involving the creation of new \ndistribution paths and delivery of new entertainment and information \nservices to the home, there has been a simultaneous revolution in the \nsophistication of the communications equipment employed in the home. \nToday more than 84 million U.S. households have VCR's. In 1994, U.S. \nhouseholds spent as much money purchasing and renting videos, $14 \nbillion, as the combined revenues of all basic cable, $4.6, and the \nthree established broadcast networks, $9.4, in 1993. In 1994, 37 \npercent of U.S. households owned personal computers. In 1993, estimated \nretail sales of North American computer software sales were $6.8 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time remains to the sponsors.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, all time has not been yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is correct.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I wish to speak for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the aspect of the \nunanimous consent requiring a tabling motion be vitiated and that we \nhave an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina does not \ncontrol sufficient time to do that. All time must be yielded back at \nthis point for a quorum call to be in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. Please repeat that.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina does not \ncontrol sufficient time to call for a quorum. All time would have to be \nyielded back in order for a quorum call.\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not use all of my time, that 60 seconds. I reserve \nthat so I can suggest the absence of a quorum at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes 55 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I support the Dorgan amendment for the \nreason Senator Dorgan and Senator Helms [[Page S8244]] have outlined, \nbut one other important reason. Economic diversity is important, but \ndiversity in terms of news sources for the American people is extremely \nimportant.\n  I used to be in the newspaper business. Fewer and fewer people own \nthe newspapers of this country. We are headed in the same direction in \ntelevision. It is not a healthy thing for our country. I strongly \nsupport the Dorgan amendment and agree completely--it is not often I \ncan stand up on the Senate floor and say I agree completely with \nSenator Jesse Helms, but I certainly do here today.\n  Mr. HELMS. Right on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Has all time been yielded back except for my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is there any other time outstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me use just a minute of that. If the Senator from \nNorth Carolina needs another minute, I will be happy to yield to him. \nThere is not much remaining to be said.\n  As I indicated earlier, this could be a discussion that should take a \nday and we are going to compress it into 20 minutes. If you look at the \nlandscape of ownership of our television stations 10 years or 20 years \nfrom now, you will, in my judgment, if you vote against this amendment, \nregret the vote. Because I think what you will see is that at a time \nwhen we brought a bill to the floor talking about deregulation and \ncompetition, we included a provision in this bill that will lead to \nconcentration of ownership in an enormously significant way in the \ntelevision industry in this country, and I do not think it is in the \npublic interest.\n  That is the position the Senator from Illinois took, the position the \nSenator from Nebraska discussed, and the Senator from North Carolina, \ntoo. I feel so strongly this is a mistake I just hope my colleagues \nwill take a close, hard look at this and ask themselves, if they are \ntalking about competition, if they are talking about local control, if \nthey are talking about diversity, do they not believe it is in the \npublic interest to have broad-based economic ownership of television \nstations spread around this country? Of course they do.\n  Do they want to see a future in which a half dozen companies in \nAmerica own all the television stations and local control is gone, \ndiversity is gone? I do not think so. And that is exactly what will \nhappen if my amendment is not enacted.\n  So I very much hope my colleagues will understand the importance of \nthis amendment despite the brevity of the debate.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina need additional time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the request to \ntable this amendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. No, no. What was the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To vitiate the motion to table.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--the Senator \nfrom Montana has just arrived. He wishes to speak on this. All of my \ntime is used, but I ask unanimous consent Senator Burns be given 5 \nminutes to speak on this.\n  I have made the request to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senate will vote in 5 minutes, but I also ask \nunanimous consent Senator Simon be recognized--following this upcoming \nvote, Senator Simon be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have more to it. I will go on. I was hoping to get \nthat approved. Relax. It is coming.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator Simon, \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Conrad amendment No. 1275 and \nthere be 20 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form; \nand that following the conclusion or yielding time, I be recognized to \nmake a motion to table the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I \ninquire, is there additional time left on my original time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota still controls \n15 seconds. The Senator from North Carolina has 14 seconds left.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Montana is going to be \ngiven by unanimous consent 5 minutes to address this subject in \nopposition to this amendment, then I ask we be added an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I point out as manager of the bill I cut my time down \nto about 4 minutes to speak against it, to try to keep things moving. \nBut I think the Senator from Montana is so eloquent that his argument--\n--\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator from Montana wishes to speak in favor of \nmy amendment, I would have no objection.\n  Mr. SIMON. Parliamentary inquiry. Have we disposed of the unanimous \nconsent request of Senator Pressler?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I further ask that Senator Simon be recognized \nfollowing the disposition of the Conrad amendment No. 1275. Does that \ntake care of the Senator? Then we have all the problems taken care of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I note for Senators it is \ncustomary if at the time--it has been a long custom here--if all time \nhas expired and somebody asks for additional time to speak on something \nthat is about to be voted on, it is customary to ask for an equal \namount of time for somebody on the other side. They may or may not use \nit, but that is the customary practice.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Fine. I will point out I gave the opposition 15 \nminutes. I just took 5 to try to move this thing along. But, fine, we \nwill give each side 5 more minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is that \nto be added to the 14 seconds remaining of the Senator from North \nCarolina and the 15 seconds remaining to the Senator----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. To the 14 seconds and 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did we also grant the unanimous consent request for the \nrest of the sequencing that the Senator indicated? That was done also?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask the Senator from New Mexico, did he want to speak in \nopposition to this?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No; I am afraid if I were to speak, I might not speak \nin opposition, so I do not choose to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I shall not take 5 minutes. I would say the \nway the trend has been in radio and television station ownership in the \nlast 5 or 10 years, this actually, I think, would stymie any \ndevelopment of further stations in the market.\n  I rather doubt that any one owner wants to own both radio stations or \nthree television stations in the market of Billings, MT. I do not think \nthey want to own all of them. We are not talking about just network \nstations; we are talking about independent stations. We are talking \nabout stations that are not affiliated with any kind of a network on \nthe limits of ownership that you can have in a specific market but \nacross the Nation.\n  So, I am going to yield my time back. I am opposed to this amendment \njust for the simple reason of its effect on the sale of a station. When \none retires or wants to sell a station, then you are going to have to \ngo over and maybe you have a willing buyer that will give so much money \nfor it and then that is closed out because he already owns too many \nstations? Maybe nobody else wants to get into the broadcast business. \nThis also limits your ability to market a station, if you are lucky \nenough to own one.\n  This does not pertain just to television stations. This also pertains \nto radio stations, radio stations as well as television stations. \n[[Page S8245]] \n  So I would oppose this amendment and I ask my colleagues to oppose it \nalso.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8225-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, thank you.\n  As I indicated earlier, this amendment simply conforms with the \nunderlying theme of S. 652 which is that if we have competition the \nconsumers will benefit. The current language of the bill moves us in \nthe direction of less competition. You cannot go from 25 percent \nownership of stations in a service area to 35 percent without \ndecreasing the competition. Inescapably the consequence is decreasing \nthe number of broadcast owners in a particular area.\n  So, in addition to the localism argument, which was very eloquently \nmade by both the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from North \nCarolina, the important issue when you are dealing with news--I point \nout a very important issue--when you are dealing with the question of \nhow does the electorate, how does the public, how do the citizens \nthemselves acquire information, is the issue of concentration of \nownership. That is a very important issue.\n  So in addition to the idea that this shifts us away from local \ncontrol of stations, there is also the very important idea of \nconcentration in the industry, and lack of competition. It is highly \nlikely that companies that we currently see as networks, or companies \nthat we currently see as broadcasters, will be coming in at the local \nlevel saying we would like to provide what we previously regarded as \ndial tone and vice versa. This whole thing is going to get jumbled up \nin a hurry. As the Senator from South Dakota said several times, we \nallow people to get into each other's business. That is basically what \nthe bill does.\n  So I hope Members who want competition, who want the consumers to \nbenefit from that competition, will support the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not use all of the remaining time. \nI am going to send a modification to the desk.\n  If I might have the attention of the Senator from South Dakota, who I \nthink is now looking at the modification, the modification is purely \ntechnical in order to conform the amendment to the manner in which the \nunderlying bill is drafted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have a right to modify the amendment without consent.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We have a problem with one portion, which is to modify \nor remove such national or local ownership of radio and television \nbroadcasting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Radio has never been a part of the amendment that we \noffered today. It was not intended to be a part. I described the \namendment earlier today as only affecting television stations. That is \nthe intent of the amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In the amendment we have national or local ownership of \nradio and television broadcasting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not the intent of the amendment to include radio. \nIt is the intent to only include television, and that is the way I \ndescribed it earlier today just after the noon hour.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. As I understand it, every Senator can modify his \namendment at any time. That changes the amendment based on my \nunderstanding. The amendment I have in my hand reads radio and \ntelevision broadcasting.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. A Senator has a right to modify his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota needs to ask \nunanimous consent in order to modify his amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In view of the fact that the amendment I have in my \nhand is to modify or remove such national or local ownership of radio \nand television broadcasting, and just on the very moment of the vote to \ntake out radio, and I want to consult with some of my colleagues, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding of the parliamentary \nsituation is that once all time is yielded back, under the unanimous-\nconsent request, I would then be allowed to modify my amendment, which \nI sought to do. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It still would require unanimous consent to \nproceed under that scenario.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1278, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto modify my amendment, and I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  I have 2 minutes remaining. In order to accommodate my friend from \nNorth Dakota, I would yield back the remainder of my time so that will \nput his request to modify in correct parliamentary procedure. Is that a \ncorrect assumption?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will not be necessary for the Senator to \nyield back time in order for the unanimous-consent modification of the \namendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Then I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to modify \nthe amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1278), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section (207) and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(1) Review and modification of broadcast rules.--The \n     Commission shall:\n       ``(A) modify or remove such national and local ownership \n     rules only applying to television broadcasters as are \n     necessary to ensure that broadcasters are able to compete \n     fairly with other media providers while ensuring that the \n     public receives information from a diversity of media sources \n     and localism and service in the public interest is protected \n     taking into consideration the economic dominance of providers \n     in a market and [[Page S8246]] \n       ``(B) review the ownership restriction in section \n     613(a)(1).''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not use the entire 2 minutes. Let \nme just say that when I proposed this amendment earlier today, I \nindicated the amendment was about removing the provision in the bill \nthat eliminates the restrictions on broadcast ownership on television \nstations. The bill is drafted that way. The first two sentences strike \nthose provisions dealing with television stations and there was some \nancillary language that relates to the rules that will have to be \nredrawn at the FCC. That referred to the set of rules in which they \nwere dealing with both television and radio stations, so the word \n``radio'' was there but it had nothing to do with the strike. So we \nhave since corrected that so that no one can misunderstand what the \ndiscussion is.\n  The discussion is that we believe the elimination of the ownership \nrules, the ownership restrictions, 12 stations and 25 percent of the \nmarket, the elimination is not in the public interest, and we believe \nvery much that the provision that strikes those prohibitions ought to \nbe taken out of this bill, and the provisions of the 12 television \nstations and 25 percent of the market ought to remain. That is the \npurpose of it. I already described what I think is the importance of \nit, and in the interest of my friend from South Dakota, who has been \nvery cooperative on this, in the interest of his moving this along, I \nwould yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. When you start talking about, I guess, broadcast \ncompanies, I find it unlikely, coming out of that business, that any \none company would come to buy all the broadcast stations, especially in \ntelevision, in a specific market.\n  Now, we have limited it nationally to 25 percent by law under the \ncable rereg bill, 25 percent of the market to a specific company, but \nwe did not say that you were limited to a certain amount of cable \nsystems. In other words, you just do not own so many cable systems if \nthat adds up to 25 percent.\n  What we are saying here is that you are limited not only as to the \nnumber of stations you can own but also a limit on the number of \nlisteners or people who might be in that specific market nationally.\n  So I just think it is bad policy right now. We do not limit any other \nmedia on the amount of ownership nationally across this country.\n  The local station, if it is owned locally, does a much better job in \ncompeting against an absentee owner. And that question came up in the \nhearings. I said even though I might do business in Georgia--and there \nwas a Georgia businessman who owned a station in my State of Montana--\nit is still tough to do business against a local owner of a local \nstation whenever the investment is there and the money is spent there.\n  So again I would say that even the marketplace itself limits \nownership in television and, of course, I am objecting to any kind of \nan ownership restriction on radio stations altogether.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield \nback his time?\n  Mr. HELMS. I certainly do. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1278, as modified. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. MACK (when his name was called). Present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues. I think we are \nholding the committee bill together and moving forward.\n  There is now, under the unanimous consent as I understand it, to be a \nspeech from Senator Simon, which he has been waiting to give. He is \nprepared to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Chamber, please?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1347 to Amendment No. 1275\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. I do this reluctantly, in part \nbecause I agree with them in terms that we have a real problem and we \nhave to confront that problem. The question is how we confront it.\n  Let me commend him, Senator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, also from North \nDakota, and Senator Lieberman, in terms of video games and what he has \nbeen able to do there. Senator Hollings has been a leader in this. \nSenator Hutchison has shown leadership. The problem is real and there \nare those in the industry, just like there are those in the cigarette \nindustry, who deny there is a real problem. But the research is just \noverwhelming. There is no question that a cause--not the cause, because \nthere are many causes--but a cause of violence in our society is the \nviolence people see on entertainment television.\n  I stress entertainment television because on news television --\nsometimes it is more violent than I would like--but on news television \nwhen you see that scene from Bosnia, you see relatives crying, you see \nviolence in its grimness. In entertainment television, there is a \ntendency to glorify violence.\n  When even the President of the United States uses a phrase like \n``make my day,'' using it against Saddam Hussein, what he is saying is \nviolence is a way of solving problems and violence is fun. Those are \nprecisely the wrong messages.\n  We have been working on this for some time. This body, I am pleased \nto say, unanimously passed a bill saying the industry can get together \nwithout violating the antitrust laws to deal with the problem of \nviolence. Since that has happened, there have been steps--major steps, \nfrankly, by the broadcast industry; very small steps by the cable \nindustry--in moving in a more positive direction. That ultimately is \ngoing to have an effect on our society.\n  If you look back at the old television series and movies, you will \nsee our heroes and heroines smoking a great deal, drinking very \nheavily. That just quietly changed. The same thing is happening on \nbroadcast television, but it is not happening, frankly, in the cable \nfield as much as we would like. I applaud the steps that have been \ntaken, but we need to do more.\n  I am also very reluctant to see Government get excessively into this \nproblem. I spoke in Los Angeles in August 1993 to a unique gathering of \n800 television and movie producers and talked about this issue of \nviolence in our films. It was received about as favorably out there as \nSenator Bob Dole's recent comments. Let me just add that I agree with \nthe general thrust of Senator Dole's comments.\n  But one of the things I said in August 1993 was, if the industry was \nwilling to set up monitoring where we could find out what is happening, \nindependent monitoring that is recognized as solid, I would oppose any \nlegislative answers. At first we got a very negative response from the \nindustry. Finally, both the broadcast and cable industries have \nestablished--or have contracted with respected entities, UCLA and \nMediascope, to do this. The first report on broadcast will come in \nSeptember. The report on cable will come in January. And tentatively we \nwill have that for 3 years.\n  I think it is important that we let the industry try to correct its \nproblems on its own, that we applaud the steps that have been taken, \nthat we say more steps are needed. I have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which will be voted upon immediately after we vote on the \nConrad-Lieberman amendment--it is cosponsored by Senator Dole and \nSenator Pressler--which urges the industry to do more in this area but \ndoes not get the Federal Government involved directly. When you start \nmoving in the direction of getting the Federal Government involved--for \nexample this deals with ``the level of violence or objectionable \ncontent.'' When you talk about ``objectionable content,'' you are \ntalking about something that is not very precise. When you talk about \ncontent, I think the Federal Government has to be very, very careful.\n  If the industry on its own gets into this V-chip field, I applaud \nthat. I welcome that. I am reluctant to have the Federal Government \nstart moving into this field of content.\n  Let me add, it is not a substitute for the industry policing itself \nand having good programming, positive programming. Even if this is \nagreed to, we will still face the reality, for example, that in the \nhigh crime areas of our country young people watch a great deal more \ntelevision than they do in the suburbs and rural areas of our country. \nAnd they are going to continue to see much too much violence and \nprograms that I think are objectionable.\n  So my hope is that, frankly, we will defeat the Conrad-Lieberman \namendment because we do not want the Federal Government getting its \nfist in there too heavily. I think we have to be careful. But let us \npass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which will send a signal, a \nvery clear signal, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I assume will \npass unanimously, that sends a signal to the industry: Let us do \nbetter. We have serious concerns.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senate \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will just take a few minutes, I say to \nSenator Simon.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent the vote on the motion to table the \nConrad amendment occur at 8:10 p.m. to be followed immediately by a \nvote on the Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I support the goals of the amendments \noffered by my distinguished colleagues, Senator Conard and Senator \nLieberman.\n  Both Senators are absolutely right to criticize the television \nindustry for programming that too often glorifies mindless violence and \ncasual sex. One recent study commissioned by USA Weekend magazine \nrecorded 370 instances of ``crude language or sexual situations'' \nduring a 5-night period of prime-time programming, or 1 every 8.9 \nminutes; 208 of these incidents occurred between 8 and 9 p.m., the so-\ncalled family hour.\n  According to one study, children will have been exposed to nearly \n18,000 televised murders and 800 televised suicides by the time they \nreach the ripe old age of 18.\n  Clearly, on the issue of violent and sexually oriented programming, \nthe television industry has much, much to explain to concerned parents \nthroughout the country.\n  So, Mr. President, Senator Conard, Senator Lieberman, and I are in \ntotal agreement when it comes to identifying the problem that his \namendment seeks to address. We part ways, however, when it comes to how \nbest to resolve this\n problem in a way that is both effective and consistent with our free-\nspeech traditions.\n\n  Senator Conrad's amendment, as modified by the Lieberman second-\ndegree, may not amount to censorship, but by establishing a 5-member \nPresidential Commission to create a ``violence rating system,'' it \ntakes us one step closer to government control over what we see and \nhear on television. As I have said on numerous occasions, we have more \nto lose than to gain from putting Washington in charge of our culture.\n  I am also concerned about the provisions in Senator Conrad's \namendment that would direct TV stations to transmit the ratings \ndeveloped by the Presidentially appointed Commission as well as require \nthat all TV sets be equipped with chip technology in order to block out \nprogramming found objectionable under the government-rating system.\n  These provisions are inconsistent with the general deregulatory \napproach of this bill--that less government control, less government \nregulations are what is needed most for a strong, competitive, \nconsumer-oriented telecommunications industry.\n  The real solution to the problem of television's\n   corrosive impact on our culture lies with concerned parents, \ninformed consumers who have the good sense to turn off the trash, and \ncorporate executives within the entertainment industry who are willing \nto put common decency above corporate profits.\n\n  That is why I have cosponsored the sense of the Senate amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon. \nThis amendment is right-on-target: It states that ``self-regulation by \nthe private sector is * * * preferable to direct regulation by the \nFederal Government.'' And it urges the entertainment industry ``to do \neverything possible'' to limit the amount of violent and aggressive \nprogramming, particularly during the hours when children are most \nlikely to be watching.\n  In other words: No regulation. No government involvement. No \ncensorship. Just focusing the moral spotlight where it is needed most.\n  Mr. President, the television industry has tremendous power. In fact, \ntelevision is perhaps the most dominant cultural force in America \ntoday. But with this power comes responsibility. It is my hope, and it \nis the hope of millions of Americans across this great country, that \nthe television industry will finally get the message and preform a \nmuch-needed and urgent house-cleaning.\n  Let me also add that when I made a statement about the entertainment \nindustry a couple of weeks ago it did get the attention of a lot of \npeople. But I notice in all the surveys that followed that speech there \nwere about as many people concerned about Government censorship as \nthere were about the violence, the mindless violence, and casual sex in \nmovies and TV.\n  I have been criticized, maybe with some justification, by some who \nsay, ``Bob Dole, Senator Dole, wants censorship.'' I never suggested \ncensorship. I did not suggest the Government do anything. I suggested \nthat shame is a powerful weapon, and that it ought to be used.\n  I also suggested that, while the entertainment industry has its first \namendment rights, we have our first amendment rights to express \noutrage, as the Senator from Illinois has done, the Senator from New \nJersey, Senator Bradley, and many others, in this Senate.\n  So I would hope that we would not let the Government take one inch, \nmake one effort that would indicate that we are headed towards \nGovernment regulation, Government involvement, censorship, if you will, \nand give the industry a chance to clean up its act. The last thing we \nwant is more Government, particularly in a bill. As I have suggested, \nwe are trying to deregulate and be more competitive.\n  I hope that the Conrad amendment and the underlying amendment will be \ntabled, and that the amendment of the Senator from Illinois would then \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois wish to use his \nfinal minutes?\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I would like to reserve the 2 minutes for \nlater, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that Senator Lieberman, Senator Exon, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Nunn, and Senator Feinstein be shown as cosponsors of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, the amendment that I am offering is not governmental \nchoice in television. It is parental choice in television. There is a \nworld of difference, and it is an important difference.\n  The amendment that I am offering provides for choice chips in new \ntelevision sets so that parents can decide what comes into their \nhomes--not the Government; parents. That is what the American people \nwant, and that is what this amendment provides. It says when we start \nbuilding new television sets let us include the new technology that \nwill permit parents to decide what their children see--no Government \nbureaucrat, no Government agency; parents. That is precisely where the \nchoice ought to lie.\n  Madam President, we do not dictate when the industry should provide \nthe choice chip. We provide that there should be consultation between \nthe industry and the FCC to determine the appropriate time for the \nchoice chip to be included in new television sets. But we did say those \nchips ought to be available, and ought to be included in new sets, \nwhether they are manufactured abroad or in this country for use in \nAmerica. The American people want to be able to make these decisions.\n  I would direct my colleagues' attention to a USA Today poll that was \ntaken on June 2 through the 4th. They asked the question:\n\n       Should ``V-chips'' be installed in TV sets so parents could \n     easily block violent programming?\n\n  Yes, 90 percent; 90 percent said yes. They want to have the ability \nto choose. They want to have the ability to make the determination \nabout what their kids see--not Government, parents.\n  This amendment empowers parents. Let parents decide. It leaves the \ndecision where it belongs, with American families--not some Government \nagency, not some Government authority, but the American parents.\n  Second it provides for a rating system.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would prefer not to. I would like to conclude my \nstatement because I have very limited time. [[Page S8249]] \n  Consumers would like to know the content of programming. So we \nprovide for a rating system. In my amendment, it is not determined by \nany Government board. It is determined by industry getting together \nwith all interested parties. They are given 1 year on a voluntary basis \nto determine a rating system--not some Government fiat, not some \nGovernment dictate, but the industry working together with all \ninterested parties on a voluntary basis for 1 year to establish a \nrating system.\n  Do you know? I believe they could do it without any Government \ninterference, without any Government involvement. But if they fail \nafter 1 year, then, yes. We provide that the FCC step in and oversee \nthe creation of the rating system.\n  Do you know what? We have seen this done in other industries. We \nasked the industry that is involved with recreational software to \ndevelop on a voluntary basis a rating system. They did it. They did an \nexcellent job. This is what they came up with--a thermometer that shows \nlevels of violence, shows sexual activity, shows language so that \npeople can make a judgment for themselves. That is what we are calling \nfor here--parental choice, not governmental choice.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, how much time remains, and who is it \nallocated to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 9 minutes, \nand the Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I give 3 minutes to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1347, As Modified, to Amendment No. 1275\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I first want to exercise my ability to send a \nmodification of my second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This is a technical amendment which in part----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I exercised, I say to the chairman of \nthe committee, my right to modify my second-degree amendment. It is a \ntechnical modification which in part responds to the suggestion of the \nranking member of the committee to remove the section of the original \namendment that would have established a system of fees to finance the \ngrading board.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. What is the parliamentary situation? Does this take \nunanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does require unanimous consent.\n  Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I must reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to proceed with my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1347), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike out line 12 and all that follows through \n     page 4, line 16, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. RATING CODE FOR VIOLENCE AND OTHER OBJECTIONABLE \n                   CONTENT ON TELEVISION.\n       (a) Sense of Congress on Voluntary Establishment of Rating \n     Code.--It is the sense of Congress--\n       (1) to encourage appropriate representatives of the \n     broadcast television industry and the cable television \n     industry to establish in a voluntary manner rules for rating \n     the level of violence or other objectionable content in \n     television programming, including rules for the transmission \n     by television broadcast stations and cable systems of--\n       (A) signals containing ratings of the level of violence or \n     objectionable content in such programming; and\n       (B) signals containing specifications for blocking such \n     programming;\n       (2) to encourage such representatives to establish such \n     rules in consultation with appropriate public interest groups \n     and interested individuals from the private sector; and\n       (3) to encourage television broadcasters and cable \n     operators to comply voluntarily with such rules upon the \n     establishment of such rules.\n       (b) Requirement for Establishment of Rating Code.--\n       (1) In general.--If the representatives of the broadcast \n     television industry and the cable television industry do not \n     establish the rules referred to in subsection (a)(1) by the \n     end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, there shall be established on the day \n     following the end of that period a commission to be known as \n     the Television Rating Commission (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``Television Commission''). The Television \n     Commission shall be an independent establishment in the \n     executive branch as defined under section 104 of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Members.--\n       (A) In general.--The Television Commission shall be \n     composed of 5 members appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate, of whom--\n       (i) three shall be individuals who are members of \n     appropriate public interest groups or are interested \n     individuals from the private sector; and\n       (ii) two shall be representatives of the broadcast \n     television industry and the cable television industry.\n       (B) Nomination.--Individuals shall be nominated for \n     appointment under subparagraph (A) not later than 60 days \n     after the date of the establishment of the Television \n     Commission.\n       (D) Terms.--Each member of the Television Commission shall \n     serve until the termination of the commission.\n       (E) Vacancies.--A vacancy on the Television Commission \n     shall be filled in the same manner as the original \n     appointment.\n       (2) Duties of television commission.--The Television \n     Commission shall establish rules for rating the level of \n     violence or other objectionable content in television \n     programming, including rules for the transmission by \n     television broadcast stations and cable systems of--\n       (A) signals containing ratings of the level of violence or \n     objectionable content in such programming; and\n       (B) signals containing specifications for blocking such \n     programming.\n       (3) Compensation of Members.--\n       (A) Chairman.--The Chairman of the Television Commission \n     shall be paid at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the \n     minimum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the \n     Executive Schedule under section 5314 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for each day (including traveltime) during which \n     the Chairman is engaged in the performance of duties vested \n     in the commission.\n       (B) Other members.--Except for the Chairman who shall be \n     paid as provided under subparagraph (A), each member of the \n     Television Commission shall be paid at a rate equal to the \n     daily equivalent of the minimum annual rate of basic pay \n     payable for level V of the Executive Schedule under section \n     5315 of title 5, United States Code, for each day (including \n     traveltime) during which the member is engaged in the \n     performance of duties vested in the commission.\n       (4) Staff.--\n       (A) In general.--The Chairman of the Television Commission \n     may, without regard to the civil service laws and \n     regulations, appoint and terminate an executive director and \n     such other additional personnel as may be necessary to enable \n     the commission to perform its duties. The employment of an \n     executive director shall be subject to confirmation by the \n     commission.\n       (B) Compensation.--The Chairman of the Television \n     Commission may fix the compensation of the executive director \n     and other personnel without regard to the provisions of \n     chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, \n     United States Code, relating to classification of positions \n     and General Schedule pay rates, except that the rate of pay \n     for the executive director and other personnel may not exceed \n     te rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule under \n     section 5316 of such title.\n       (5) Consultants.--The Television Commission may procure by \n     contract, to the extent funds are available, the temporary or \n     intermittent services of experts or consultants under section \n     3109 of title 5, United States Code. The commission shall \n     give public notice of any such contract before entering into \n     such contract.\n       (6) Funding.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Commission such sums as are necessary to enable the \n     Commission to carry out its duties under this Act.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Madam President, again, I am privileged to join with my colleague \nfrom North Dakota in this amendment. The fact is that every study we \nhave seen shows the extraordinary unacceptable amount of violence on \ntelevision. It affects our children. It makes them more violent. The \nfact is that it is hard to believe that amount of inappropriate, \nobjectionable material that the majority leader has referred to as \ncasual sex on television which affects the violence of our kids. \n[[Page S8250]] \n  One survey I quoted in an earlier statement here said the kids \nthemselves admitted that what they saw on television encouraged them to \nbe involved in sexual activity earlier than they should have.\n  It is time finally in our society that we focus on some of the major \nforces that affect our values and our children's values. We are \nconfronting the difficult question of the impact of the entertainment \nmedia which is so powerful on our values and on our lives in our \nsociety.\n  This amendment gives the Members of this Chamber the opportunity to \ndo more than talk about this problem. This is an opportunity to do \nsomething about it--not to create censorship, far from it--but under \nthe terms of this amendment to basically get the attention of the \ntelevision industry.\n  Senator Simon, our colleague, has been a leader in this. But the fact \nis, as I understand it, that it is because of his understanding of the \ntelevision industry that he has offered his sense of the Senate. The \nfact is that the industry has not gotten the message.\n  The programs that our kids are seeing are giving them the wrong \nmessage, and it is affecting their behavior and challenging the ability \nof parents in this country to raise their kids the way they want to \nraise them. This amendment, modified by my second-degree amendment, \nsimply gives the industry a year to create its own standards; if they \ndo not, then sets up a rating board, two members from the industry, \nthree from the public, to do the job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. This Senate ought to act on this \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, it is the intention of the Commerce \nCommittee to hold hearings on this subject in the near future. Indeed, \nSenator Hollings and many others have bills that they have filed, and \nthey have been patiently waiting to have hearings so that we can start \na legislative process.\n  For example, this amendment, before it was amended, said we would \nhave had to look at the impact of assessing fees on broadcasters for \nfunding a national commission on TV.\n  Now, that has been modified, but there still are many questions that \nI have about this. And I would inform Members that a Simon-Dole-\nPressler amendment will be coming calling for renewed efforts by the \nbroadcast industry to regulate violent programming. It is my strongest \nfeeling that we should vote down the first amendment and adopt the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment so that we can clearly state our views on \nthis matter and proceed with legislation in a proper way with hearings \nand a markup.\n  I thought the Senator from Louisiana wished to speak. I would like to \nyield as much time as the Senator from Louisiana would consume.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman. I would just like to ask a question \nof the Senator who is the sponsor of the amendment. He spoke of the--\nwhat was it, the choice chip? It would seem to me that the TV sets \nalready have choice chips. It is called the off and on switch, and when \nthe parent thinks that the program is not proper for a small child in \ntheir home, they just go turn it off. And that is a choice chip by a \ndifferent name. But they have the right to control what their children \nsee right now.\n  I am not sure why we have to order companies to build some other kind \nof switch to regulate what children see. It is a parental \nresponsibility, I think, to say this is a program that is suitable for \nmy child or it is not. And if it is not, you take the little off-on \nswitch and you go ``flick'' or you can take the remote control and go \n``push'' and the program is gone--poof, it is gone, like we already \nhave a choice chip on the TV right now.\n  I would like to ask, what is the problem with the existing chip?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator asks a very good question, and the problem is \nvery often the parents are not home to help participate in that choice. \nMillions of American families have both parents working. Millions of \nAmerican families are so busy that they do not have a chance to monitor \nevery minute of what their children are watching. And so what we are \nproviding is when the parent is absent, they are able to program that \ntelevision to exclude programming they find objectionable. Why not? Why \nshould not parents have an ability to say that not just anyone can come \ninto their home, uninvited, and give any message to their kid that they \nwant to give without the parents being able to stop it?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think the American people want the chance to say no.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think it is a valid response.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank the Chair. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1349\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to take my remaining time. I \nhave an amendment at the desk I would offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself, Mr. \n     Dole, and Mr. Pressler, proposes an amendment numbered 1349.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following.\n\n     SEC.   : FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       Violence is a pervasive and persistent feature of the \n     entertainment industry. According to the Carnegie Council on \n     Adolescent Development, by the age of 18, children will have \n     been exposed to nearly 18,000 televised murders and 800 \n     suicides.\n       Violence on television is likely to have a serious and \n     harmful effect on the emotional development of young \n     children. The American Psychological Association has reported \n     that children who watch ``a large number of aggressive \n     programs tend to hold attitudes and values that favor the use \n     of aggression to solve conflicts.'' The National Institute of \n     Mental Health has stated similarly that ``violence on \n     television does lead to aggressive behavior by children and \n     teenagers.''\n       The Senate recognizes that television violence is not the \n     sole cause of violence in society.\n       There is a broad recognition in the U.S. Congress that the \n     television industry has an obligation to police the content \n     of its own broadcasts to children. That understanding was \n     reflected in the Television Violence Act of 1990, which was \n     specifically designed to permit industry participants to work \n     together to create a self-monitoring system.\n       After years of denying that television violence has any \n     detrimental effect, the entertainment industry has begun to \n     address the problem of television violence. In the Spring of \n     1994, for example, the network and cable industries announced \n     the appointment of an independent monitoring group to assess \n     the amount of violence on television. These reports are due \n     out in the Fall of 1995 and Winter of 1996, respectively.\n       The Senate recognizes that self-regulation by the private \n     sector is generally preferable to direct regulation by the \n     federal government.\n\n     SEC.   : SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the entertainment \n     industry should do everything possible to limit the amount of \n     violent and aggressive programming, particularly during the \n     hours when children are most likely to be watching.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in closing the argument, let me say if the \nindustry on its own moves in this direction, I will applaud the \nindustry for doing it. But let us not make any mistake, we are moving \nbeyond anything Government has ever done before. We are saying, if the \nindustry in 1 year does not get this resolved, then a Government \ncommission is going to determine violence and objectionable content. \nThat is an intrusion that I hope we can avoid. And my reason for hoping \nwe can avoid it is that, frankly, we are making some progress in the \ntelevision industry. On the broadcast side, we are clearly making \nprogress. No one denies that. On the cable side, frankly, very little \nprogress has been made. And there I hope the industry can move ahead. \nBut we are going to have monitoring. We are going to have our first \nreport come in September of this year on broadcast, January of next \nyear on cable. Let us let the industry try to resolve this matter on \ntheir own. It is a genuine problem. I agree with Senator Conrad and \nSenator Lieberman on that. But I think we have to be careful how far \nthe Federal Government goes.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair. [[Page S8251]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 29 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just have to correct the record with \nrespect to the statement Senator Simon made. My amendment does not have \nany Government agency determining what is objectionable content. It is \nnot a governmental decision. It is parental choice. Parents have a \nright to decide. The only involvement of Government is if the industry \ndoes not move forward with putting in chips, the choice chips that will \nallow parents to make these decisions, it will be required on new \ntelevision sets.\n  Second, with respect to a rating system so that parents can determine \nwhat is coming into their homes, if the industry, together with all \ninterested parties, does not reach a determination within 1 year, then \na commission will determine a rating system. They will not determine \nthat something is objectionable and should be blocked from people's \nhomes. Not at all. People can produce anything they want, but parents \nwill have a right to choose what comes into their homes.\n  Under the Dole-Simon amendment, they are saying that the networks can \ncome into your home, talk to your children, say anything they want, and \nyou cannot stop them. We say that is wrong. We say that parents ought \nto be able to choose what their children see.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense amendment that \ngives parents the right to decide what comes into their homes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 3 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will use my time to urge Members to vote to table the \nConrad amendment. And I urge Members to express their concern on this \nsubject by voting for the Dole-Simon-Pressler amendment, which will be \na sense-of-the-Senate, so Members will have an opportunity for a \nfollowup vote.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to vote to table the Conrad \namendment No. 1275.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator from New Jersey wants 1 minute. Even though \nhe is not on my side, I will give him 1 minute but then I want the \nfloor to make my motion.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, this is the opening round of a very important debate. \nNobody disputes that too much violence is coming into the home. It is \ncoming into the home because it sells, because the market works, \nbecause people buy it.\n  So the question is, how do you stop it from coming into the home? My \nfirst preference would be to shame those who are making money out of \nselling trash. But if that fails, Mr. President, then clearly there has \nto be another way to try to prevent the trash from coming into the \nhome. The amendment offered by the distinguished Senators from South \nDakota and Connecticut is the beginning of saying, well, what if the \nmarket will not be subject to shame? What if it will continue to put \nforth trash?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Therefore, Mr. President, I think this is a very \nimportant Senate decision.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I must now move to table the Conrad \namendment. The hour of 8:10 has arrived. I know the Senator from \nFlorida wanted 1 minute. I do not know that that can be worked out, but \nI do now move to table the Conrad amendment No. 1275, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to ask if the Senator from \nSouth Dakota will yield 1 minute of his time to me.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Florida is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of the Conrad-Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is not an issue of censorship or \nexcessive Government intrusion. This is essentially an issue of \nempowerment. We are empowering the parents of children to make an \nintelligent choice, which the children by their immaturity often are \nunable to make. Who better to ask in our society to be responsible for \nwhat comes into the minds of young people than those who love them the \nmost and have the responsibility for their nurturing and upbringing?\n  I believe that we ought to be encouraging responsibility beyond just \nthe pure dictates of the marketplace from many aspects of our society. \nI am very pleased that three Federal agencies --the Department of \nDefense, Amtrak, and the Postal Service--have joined together to \nestablish some standards that will not place Federal advertising into \nprograms that are excessively violent.\n  I hope that would be a standard of social responsibility that other \nsponsors would look to and that we would allow parents to exercise that \nresponsibility by empowering them to control what their children see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield back all my time. This will be a vote on a \nmotion to table.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 1275\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask that the pending amendments be laid aside, and I \nsend an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Exon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], for Mr. Exon, \n     for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1350.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 49, line 15 after ``Government (or its \n     representative)'' add the following: ``provided that the \n     President does not object within 15 days of such \n     determination''\n       On page 50 between line 14 and 15 insert the following:\n       ``(c) The Application of the Exon-Florio Law.--Nothing in \n     this section (47 U.S.C. 310) shall limit in any way the \n     application of 50 U.S.C. App. 2170 (the Exon-Florio law) to \n     any transaction.''\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment related to the \nforeign ownership provisions of the telecommunications bill.\n  S. 652, the pending bill, adds new procedures to permit foreign \nownership of common carrier licenses if the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC] determines that the home country of the proposed \nforeign owner offers reciprocal and equivalent market opportunities to \nAmericans.\n  The Exon-Dorgan-Byrd amendment clarifies that nothing in the new \nsection limits or affects the application of the Exon-Florio law (50 \nApp. 2170) which gives the President the power to investigate and if \nnecessary prohibit or suspend a merger, takeover or acquisition of an \nAmerican company by a foreign entity when the national security may be \naffected by such transaction.\n  Where the proposed FCC procedure would permit the foreign acquisition \nof a U.S. telecommunications company and its common carrier licenses, \nit is important to make clear that the new FCC procedure does not pre-\nempt existing law affecting foreign mergers, acquisitions and \ntakeovers.\n  Most importantly, our proposed amendment would give the President 15 \ndays to review actions of the FCC. Under this provision, the license \ncould be granted only if the President does not object within 15 days. \nAs Commander in Chief, and the conductor of foreign policy, there may \nbe information available to a President which would not or should not \nbe available to the FCC in making its findings under the proposed \nprocedure in S. 652. The Exon-Dorgan-Byrd amendment assures that the \nPresident gets the final say if a common carrier license is granted to \na foreign entity.\n  This amendment should be non-controversial and in no way undermines \nthe foreign investment and ownership reforms of S. 652. It preserves \nimportant national security, foreign policy and law enforcement powers \nof the President.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this short but critically important \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], and am a co-\nsponsor of it along with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \n[Mr. Dorgan]. The international marketplace in telecommunications \nequipment and service is a very robust, lucrative one, and the \nopportunities for U.S. companies abroad are vast. However, this \nmarketplace is subject to many of the same kind of barriers to entry as \nhas been the case for other American business sectors. Currently, the \nUS Trade representative, Ambassador Kantor, has initiated a 301 case \nagainst the Japanese in the area of automobile parts, after years of \nfrustration in trying to gain fair entry into the Japanese market. The \nSenate has strongly endorsed this action by a vote of 88-8 on a \nresolution offered by myself, the two leaders, and other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Similar problems of access to foreign markets exist in the \ntelecommunications sector, and the bill as reported from the Commerce \nCommittee includes a provision to protect our country and our companies \nfrom unfair competition. The bill as reported by the Committee supports \nan incentives-based strategy for foreign countries to open their \ntelecommunications markets to U.S. companies. It does this by \nconditioning new access to the American market upon a showing of \nreciprocity in the markets of the petitioning foreign companies. \nCurrent law, that is section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934, \nprovides that a foreign entity may not obtain a common carrier license \nitself, and may not own more than 25 percent of any corporation which \nowns or controls a common carrier license. This foreign ownership \nlimitation has not been very effective and has not prevented foreign \ncarriers from entering the U.S. market. The FCC has had the discretion \nof waiving this limitation, if it finds that such action does not \nadversely affect the public interest. [[Page S8253]] \n  Nevertheless, maintaining restrictions on foreign ownership is \ngenerally considered by U.S. industry to be useful as one way to raise \nthe issue of unfair foreign competition and to maintain leverage \nabroad. Therefore, the bill established a reciprocal market access \nstandard as a condition for the waiver of Section 310(b). It states \nthat the FCC may grant to an alien, foreign corporation or foreign \ngovernment a common carrier license that would otherwise violate the \nrestriction in Section 310(b) if the FCC finds that there are \nequivalent market opportunities for U.S. companies and citizens in the \nforeign country of origin of the corporation or government.\n  Even though Section 310 has not prevented access into our market, the \nexistence of the section has been used by foreign countries\n as an excuse to deny U.S. companies access to their markets. The \nprovision in S. 652, applying a reciprocity rule, makes it clear that \nour market will be open to others to the same extent that theirs are \nopen to our investment. This is as it should be.\n\n  The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska \nensures that important factors of national security and the overall \nbest interest of the U.S. from the perspective of law enforcement, \nforeign policy, the interpretation of international agreements, and \nnational economic security are protected. The FBI has indicated to me \nits grave concerns over foreign penetration of our telecommunications \nmarket. Foreign governments whose interests are adverse to the U.S., \nforeign drug cartels, international criminal syndicates, terrorist \norganizations, and others who would like to own, operate, or penetrate \nour telecommunications market should be prohibited from doing so. \nTherefore, the Exon-Dorgan-Byrd amendment gives the president the \nauthority to overturn an FCC decision to grant a waiver of the \nrestrictions of Section 310. This is based, of course, on the superior \ninformation available to the President by virtue of the resources \navailable to him across the board in the Executive branch. The \npresident must have a veto in this field, and he should not hesitate to \nexercise this authority.\n  Mr. President, my second degree amendment provides that, in the event \nthat the President should reject a recommendation by the FCC to grant a \nlicense to a foreign entity to operate in our market, the President \nshall provide a report to the Congress on the findings he has made in \nthe particular case and the factors that he took into account in \narriving at his determination. The Congress needs to be kept in the \nloop on the evolution of our telecommunications market. The reports can \nbe provided in classified and/or unclassified form, as appropriate, \nsince many of the national security factors that might pertain in a \nparticular case are sensitive and should be protected.\n  In addition, Mr. President, my amendment has a second section which \ndeals with the issue of the actual nature of the foreign \ntelecommunications market place. Given the highly lucrative nature of \nthe telecommunications marketplace, the stakes of gaining access to \nforeign markets are high. It should be no surprise that securing \neffective market access to many foreign markets, including those of our \nallies, such as France, Germany and Japan, has been very difficult. \nThose markets remain essentially closed to our companies, dominated as \nthey are by large monopolies favored by those governments. In fact, \nmost European markets highly restrict competition in basic voice \nservices and infrastructure. A study by the Economic Strategy \nInstitute, in December 1994, found that ``While the U.S. has encouraged \ncompetition in all telecommunication sectors except the local exchange, \nthe overwhelming majority of nations have discouraged competition and \nmaintained a public monopoly that has\n no incentive to become more efficient. U.S. firms, as a result of \nintense competition here in the U.S., provide the most advanced and \nefficient telecommunications services in the world, and could certainly \ncompete effectively in other markets if given the chance of an open \nplaying field.'' The same study found that ``U.S. firms are blocked \nfrom the majority of lucrative international opportunities by foreign \ngovernment regulations prohibiting or restricting U.S. participation \nand international regulations which intrinsically discriminate and \novercharge U.S. firms and consumers.'' This study found that the total \nloss in revenues to U.S. firms, as a result of foreign barriers, is \nestimated to be close to $100 billion per year between 1992 and the end \nof the century.\n\n  As my colleagues are aware, the negotiations which led to the \nhistoric revision of the GATT agreement, and which created the World \nTrade Organization, were unable to conclude an agreement on \ntelecommunications services. Thus, separate negotiations are underway \nin Geneva today to secure such an agreement, in the context of the \nNegotiating Group on Basic Telecommunications. In the absence of such \nan agreement, we must rely on our own laws to protect our companies and \nto provide leverage over foreign nations to open their markets. To \nforego our own national leverage would do a great disservice to \nAmerican business and would be shortsighted--the result of which would \nbe not only a setback to our strategy to open those markets, but to \npull the rug out from under our negotiators in Geneva seeking to secure \na favorable international agreement for open telecommunications \nmarkets. Indeed, tough U.S. reciprocity laws are clearly needed by our \nnegotiators to gain an acceptable, effective, market-opening agreement \nin Geneva in these so-called GATT (General Agreement on Trade in \nServices) negotiations.\n  The standard for access into the American market in the reported bill \nrequires that the FCC find that market opportunities in the home market \nof the applicant be equivalent to those desired in the U.S. in the \nspecific telecommunications market segment involved. Thus, if an \napplicant wants to get into the American mobile telephone market, the \nmobile telephone market of the applicant must be open. I expect that \nthe FCC will be very tough, and the President will be very tough, as \nprovided for in the underlying amendment pending here, in making a \ndetermination that the home market of the applicant is really open for \nour investment and/or operations. My second degree amendment would also \nrequire the FCC and the President to look beyond that specific \ntelecommunications market segment, and make an evaluation of the \naccessibility of the whole range of telecommunications market segments \nfor American investment and/or operations. This is because the \ntelecommunications market between the U.S. and our trading partners is \noften very asymmetrical. For instance, if a German company wants to get \ninto the U.S. mobile phone market, we might find, and indeed we would \nfind, that the German mobile phone market is open to U.S. business \naccess. But the rest of the German market is mainly closed up tighter \nthan a dry drum to U.S. investment or entry. So we at least need to \ninform ourselves of the real nature of the international marketplace, \nand I would expect that these evaluations would be made available to \nthe public, in detail and in a timely way. Over the long run, if we \ndetermine a persistent pattern of imbalance and unfairness, as a whole, \nexists in telecommunications markets, further action to force foreign \nmarkets open will have to be considered.\n  Mr. President, this is an effort to advance our understanding of the \nnature of the evolving international marketplace for the range of \nexploding technologies in the telecommunications field, and to ensure \nthat America is treated fairly and in a reciprocal manner. I \ncongratulate the committee for the reciprocity provision and I hope \nthat the modest contribution that Senators Exon, Dorgan, and I make \nwith this amendment will add something of value to that provision.\n                Amendment No. 1351 to Amendment No. 1350\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on objections to determinations of the \n   Federal Communications Commission for purposes of termination of \n  foreign ownership restrictions and to revise the determinations of \n                market opportunities for such purposes)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support and cosponsor \nSenator Byrd's amendment to the Exon-Dorgan-Byrd foreign investment \namendment.

A bill to facilitate small business involvement in the \nregulatory development processes of the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Essentially, Mr. President, this bill will establish \nthe process whereby small business in each of our respective States \nwill be involved in the process of writing the rules and regulations \nfor both OSHA and EPA. I think it is an exciting idea that came right \nfrom small business.\n  I note that the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond, is a cosponsor. I thank him for his assistance. Mr. President, on \nbehalf of the small business women and men in America, I am pleased to \noffer a bill to create a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel. This \nbill has been developed because of the suggestions of a committed group \nof New Mexican small business people. I am also pleased that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business is \njoining me as an original cosponsor of this measure. I am also pleased \nto say that the National Federation of Independent Business supports \nthis bill.\n  This week, the White House Conference on Small Business is convening \nhere in Washington. This is an event I am particularly interested in \nsince I introduced the legislation that authorizes these national \nconferences with small business men and women. I would like to welcome \nall the delegates from New Mexico and ask unanimous consent to place a \nlist of their names in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  In early 1994, I formed a Small Business Advocacy Council in New \nMexico. I asked this group to advise me about the problems of small \nbusinesses and how Congress might address some of their concerns. This \ncouncil held 7 meetings in 6 locations throughout the State of New \nMexico with more than 400 businesses participating. The consistent \ntheme at all of these meetings was the appearance of an adversarial \nrelationship between the Federal Government and business, and the lack \nof accountability of regulatory agencies in their dealings with \nbusiness.\n  A few months ago the Senate Small Business Committee kicked off a \nseries of field hearings entitled ``Entrepreneurship in America,'' with \nthe first hearing in Albuquerque. These hearings focused on 7 issues \naffecting American small businesses: the Federal tax burden, cost of \nemployment, environmental compliance, OSHA compliance, government \nintrusion on the family farm, banking system restrictions, and \nunreasonable legal exposure costs. Many members of the Small Business \nAdvocacy Council testified at the Albuquerque field hearing of the \nSenate Small Business Committee chaired by my good friend and \ndistinguished colleague, Kit Bond.\n  The concerns vetted in this field hearing were not unique to New \nMexico. In fact, the Washington Post insert of June 6, ran a very \nillustrative story on the Small Business White House Conference. This \nstory focused on Sal Risalvato, a White House Conference delegate from \nNew Jersey. Mr. Risalvato runs a gasoline service station in \nMorristown, NJ, and he relates a familiar tale of struggling to cope \nwith a continuous stream of new EPA regulations. He cites that these \nregulations are difficult to understand and require the constant \nexpenditure of capital--capital that could have been otherwise used to \nexpand the business and create more jobs. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of this article be inserted in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  In June 1994, the General Accounting Office delivered a report to the \nHouse Committee on Education and Labor entitled ``Workplace \nRegulation--Information on Selected Employer and Union Experiences.''\n  I recently discussed this report with the GAO because I found its \nresults so strikingly similar to the findings of the New Mexico Small \nBusiness Advocacy Council and the gentleman from New Jersey cited in \nthe Post article. The objective of the GAO report was to: First, \nidentify and analyze the characteristics of the major statutes \ncomprising the framework of workplace regulation and, second, describe \nthe actual experiences of a wide range of employer and employee \nrepresentatives with workplace regulation.\n  The GAO identified 26 statutes and one Executive order on workplace \nregulation and sought comments, on a confidential basis, from a broad \nrange of 36 employers and union representatives. Those interviewed \ngenerally accepted the importance of workplace regulations. There were \nfrequently voiced concerns, however, with the operation of the overall \nregulatory process of many agencies and about whether the agencies' \nregulatory goals were being achieved. Last year there were over 8,000 \nrules and regulations that were promulgated. Obviously, not every rule \ncan, or needs to be, reviewed.\n However, there are currently approximately 46 rulemakings pending at \nEPA that are termed significant, with an economic impact exceeding $100 \nmillion.\n\n  The small business men and women of America aren't asking to abolish \nregulations, they are asking for an opportunity to work with agencies \nto establish an effective mechanism for drafting regulations. The New \nMexico Small Business Council members, as well as Sal Risalvato from \nNew Jersey, have said they agree regulation is necessary and everyone \nbenefits from reasonable regulations on health and safety. The small \nbusiness men and women are pleading for a vehicle of cooperation to act \nin an advisory capacity to the government on regulatory impacts and \ncosts.\n  So, at their suggestion, I am pleased to introduce the Small Business \nAdvocacy Act of 1995. This act will establish a small business review \npanel to facilitate small business involvement in the regulatory \ndevelopment process within the EPA and OSHA. These panels will be \nresponsible for providing technical guidance for issues impacting small \nbusinesses, such as applicability, compliance, consistency, redundancy, \nreadability, and any other related concerns that may affect them. This \npanel will then provide recommendations to the appropriate agency \npersonnel responsible for developing and drafting the relevant \nregulations. Why EPA and OSHA? They were repeatedly cited as the most \nonerous and costly agencies to small business.\n  The panel will be chaired by a senior official of the agency and will \ninclude staff responsible for development and drafting of the \nregulation, a representative from OIRA, a member of the SBA advocate \noffice, and up to three representatives from small businesses \nespecially affected. This will allow the actual small business owners, \nor their representative associations, to have a voice in the massive \nregulatory process that affects them so much. The panel has a total of \n45 days to meet and develop its recommendations before a rule is \npromulgated or a final rule is issue. This panel's recommendations, \nboth the majority and minority views, will be reported to the \nappropriate agency personnel before the rulemaking and the agency will \nensure that the panel's recommendations, and the agency's response to \nthem, are included in any notice of final rulemaking.\n  Finally, this act will also provide for a peer review survey to be \nconducted on regulations. This idea is analogous to what the private \nsector routinely practices. A customer survey, contracted and conducted \nwith a private sector firm, will sample a cross-section of the affected \nsmall business community responsible for complying with the sampled \nregulation. This valuable input on regulatory issues impacting small \nbusinesses will be made available to the Small Business Advocacy Review \nBoard to assist in their review [[Page S8256]] processes and will also \nbe made available to interested parties and organizations upon request.\n  I believe that this panel, working together so all viewpoints are \nrepresented, will be the crux of reasonable, consistent and \nunderstandable rulemaking. I am very concerned about the adversarial \nmanner in which our small businesses perceive their government. Much of \nthis adversarial relationship has grown from years of misunderstanding \nof impacts and effects and a lack of communication. I want to improve \nour rulemaking and regulatory process through cooperation and \ncollaboration and I urge my colleagues to support this act.\n  Mr. President, I ask that unanimous consent that additional material \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the Washington Post, June 6, 1995]\n\n A Tale of Pumping Gas With One Hand, Holding Off Government With the \n                                 Other\n\n                           (By Sal Risalvato)\n\n       I wonder if my small business can survive another onslaught \n     of excessive federal regulations. And if it can't, what will \n     happen to my livelihood and that of my employees who depend \n     on me for jobs?\n       I have learned through firsthand experience how the burden \n     created by federal regulations can hurt a small business.\n       Since 1987, when I bought Riverdale Texaco, a gasoline \n     service station in Morris County, N.J., costly regulations \n     have touched every aspect of my small business, from the sale \n     of petroleum products to the repair service my employees \n     provide.\n       My first experience with federal regulations occurred even \n     before I bought the station. Because of the government's \n     response to rising environmental concerns, I had to assemble \n     additional financing in order to make sure that the station I \n     bought had underground storage tanks that were in good shape. \n     The tanks in my new station, for which I did pay a premium, \n     had been installed just a year earlier.\n       However, within five years, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) altered the regulations for underground storage \n     tanks, requiring me to spend another $95,000.\n       Although it wasn't the government's fault, this $95,000 was \n     especially difficult for me to come by. I had been left \n     virtually broke after losing my first service station in 1986 \n     when my landlord wouldn't renew my lease because he believed \n     he could put his rapidly-appreciating property to more \n     profitable use than as a service station.\n       In fact, while operating my new station, I was still paying \n     debts from the station I had lost to its landlord. So, coming \n     up with an additional $95,000 to meet new and unexpected \n     governmental regulations meant borrowing from family members. \n     My father borrowed the money he lent me, using his home as \n     collateral.\n       Fortunately, Texaco also provided me with funds in exchange \n     for a supply contract.\n       To me, this was government extortion because I would have \n     been forced out of business if I hadn't met the EPA's new \n     requirements. Many service station owners without the money \n     to meet the new requirements have gone out of business or \n     have stopped selling gasoline and are trying to get by on the \n     income from other products and services.\n       I had thought the EPA had inflicted enough pain and torture \n     on my business, but the federal government now is attempting \n     to blackmail me, my governor, the motorists of my state, and \n     my fellow service station owners in New Jersey.\n       New Jersey probably has one of the best motor vehicle \n     inspection systems in the country. Under current law, \n     motorists must have their car emissions systems and safety \n     items such as brakes inspected annually, either at a state \n     inspection site or a licensed private repair facility such as \n     mine.\n       In order to meet EPA requirements, the State of New Jersey \n     will have to invest millions of dollars for new equipment at \n     the state inspection sites. And I, along with other private \n     businesses that want to continue performing inspections, will \n     each have to spend $40,000 to $100,000 for new equipment.\n       Since many service stations, including mine, can't afford \n     to buy the new, mandated equipment, we small business owners \n     will be forced to give up an important profit center.\n       I am running out of family members who have money to lend, \n     and those family members who do have money are running out \n     because they always have been lending it to me.\n       N.J. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has been negotiating with \n     the EPA to lessen the burden on our state. But ultimately, if \n     the state refuses to adopt an inspection system suitable to \n     the EPA, the Department of Transportation will withhold $217 \n     million in federal highway funds.\n       This would hurt the whole state.\n       There's no doubt that if these regulations were less \n     stringent or if they were eliminated altogether, I would have \n     more money to expand my business and to create jobs.\n       When I bought my business, my dream was to add on three or \n     four service bays, a sales room, an employee room, and \n     storage and office space to meet what I hoped would be my \n     growing business' needs.\n       Now, to make the best use of space inside the main \n     building, our offices are housed in a trailer on the side of \n     my building. Twice in the past seven years, the local board \n     of adjustment has granted us temporary permission to keep our \n     office. Each time, I explained to the board that costly \n     government regulations are slowing down my expansion plans. \n     And that once I'm able to expand, I'll hire at least seven \n     more people.\n       Anyone can see how federal regulations are stifling my \n     small business. Some people say small-business owners don't \n     care about health and safety or that we are anti-environment. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth.\n       The small-business community agrees that some regulation is \n     necessary. We, too, benefit from reasonable regulations, and \n     I care about employee safety and environmental protection. I \n     drink the same water and breathe the same air as everyone \n     else. I have no desire to see the quality of either \n     jeopardized.\n       But federal bureaucrats need to step back and re-evaluate \n     the damage their actions inflict on the free enterprise \n     system.\n       Congress must make sure that no new requirements are put on \n     the books unless the benefits outweigh the costs, and there \n     should be a clear understanding of what the nation is getting \n     in return.\n       The regulatory situation for small business is approaching \n     crisis proportions.\n       Each year, I spend many hours and dollars completing \n     government paperwork and trying to comply with all the \n     regulations. Besides the time I spend actually filling out \n     the forms, there's the time spent trying to understand the \n     paperwork and identify the information needed.\n       These requirements take valuable time away from running a \n     small business and deplete limited resources that could \n     better be used to expand the business.\n       Among other changes, my fellow small-business owners want \n     paperwork reduction, a review process for regulations and the \n     right to challenge excessive or unnecessary regulations in \n     court.\n       If the burdens of excessive regulations are lifted from our \n     backs, we can do even better what we already are the best \n     at--creating jobs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  List of New Mexico Delegates to the White House Conference on Small \n                          Business, June 12-14\n\n       1.

A bill to prohibit the payment of certain Federal benefits to \nany person not lawfully present within the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the illegal alien benefits prohibition act of 1995\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I introduce a bill intended to eliminate the \npayment of Federal benefits to illegal aliens. I spoke on this issue in \ndetail yesterday and I rise to formally introduce the bill today.\n  I believe that as we begin to debate the welfare reform bill, we have \na golden opportunity to stop, once and for all, paying benefits to \nillegal aliens.

A bill to modify and reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n    THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President: I introduce the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act Amendments of 1995.\n  Child abuse is an issue which provokes our anger and anguish, and \nwhich demands our attention as legislators. Our Nation's outrage on \nthis Topic was renewed with the murder of Susan Smith's children. It is \nimpossible to comprehend how those who are entrusted with protecting \nchildren can hurt them, maim them, and even take their lives. In fact, \nit was cases just like this--involving the severe abuse and death of \nchildren--which led to Senate hearings in 1973, and eventually to the \ndevelopment of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.\n  CAPTA was first authorized in 1974 and is the only Federal program \nspecifically aimed at child abuse prevention and treatment. CAPTA has \nserved as a catalyst, encouraging States to do some important things: \nDevelop programs of prevention and treatment; educate law enforcement \nand judicial personnel; and to develop crisis hotlines, self-help \ngroups, volunteer training, and public awareness campaigns.\n  In 1993, the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse and \nneglect reported that there were 2,898,000 child maltreatment reports. \nThis represents a twentyfold increase from 1963, when there were about \n150,000 reports. Federal and State expenditures for child protection \nprograms and associated foster care programs now exceed $6 billion a \nyear. The heightened awareness in the public regarding the issue of \nchild abuse, and the corresponding increase in Federal and State \ndollars, is partially due to the passage of mandatory reporting laws--\nrequired by CAPTA--and the media campaigns that have accompanied them. \nCertainly, many thousands of children have been saved from serious \ninjury, and even death, during the last 20 years.\n  Unfortunately, a byproduct of this heightened public awareness has \nbeen an explosion in the number of unfounded reports of child abuse and \nneglect. The staggering number of reports that are determined to be \nunfounded tell a disturbing tale. According to the annual 50-State \nsurvey of the National Committee To Prevent Child Abuse, only 34 \npercent of the reports received by child protective services were \nsubstaintiated. This means that two-thirds of all abuse and neglect \nreports are unsubstantiated. When you take into account the\n number of families involved and the numbers duplicate reports, we know \nthat each year as many as 700,000 families are being unnecessarily \ninvestigated--their children are being questioned and family life \ndisrupted.\n\n  This is a concern, but the most important problem is this: \nunnecessary investigations are overwhelming the child protection \nsystem, and thereby preventing caseworkers from getting to those \nchildren who are truly in need of help.\n  It is important to note that few of the unfounded reports are made \nmaliciously. The reporter is usually well-intentioned, but unclear as \nto what constitutes maltreatment. A vague suspicion that something may \nbe wrong sets in motion a legal obligation on the part of child \nprotective services to investigate.\n  This burden of empty accusations helps explain why between 25 to 50 \npercent of child abuse deaths involve children previously known to the \nauthorities. With caseworkers spending significant amounts of time \ninvestigating every allegation of child maltreatment, no matter how \ntenuous, it is understandable that children who are truly in need of \nhelp are missed or ignored.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today addresses \nsome of the failings in the current system, and addresses ways that we \ncan better target attention to those children in desperate need of \nprotection. The legislation proposes to encourage the States through \nthe development of risk assessment protocols, improved training of \nchild protection workers, and enhanced community awareness and public \neducation.\n  The legislation was drafted following a fruitful hearing that \nexamined some of the critical child protection issues facing our Nation \ntoday and particularly their impact on the families and children who \ncome in contact with the child protective system.\n  A great deal is at stake in these matters. The protection of children \nfrom abuse is a demand of our conscience and a demand of our laws. Our \nconcern and compassion should be broad. But the system charged with \nprotecting children must be focused to be effective. And that is the \nonly measure of our success--when a child is effectively shielded from \nabuse and neglect.\n  This requires a serious revision of our current approach--not its \ngoal, but some of its methods. And I hope that with this legislation we \ncan begin that process in earnest.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I will summarize some of the \nprovisions of the bill.\n  Title I reauthorizes State grants and demonstration grants, makes \nreporting and data collection requirements more effective, and \neliminates certain bureaucratic bodies.\n  The bill repeals the current mandates for a National Center on Child \nAbuse and Neglect, for the U.S. Advisory [[Page S8258]] Board on Child \nAbuse and Neglect, and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Child Abuse and \nNeglect. Instead the secretary has discretion to establish an Office on \nChild Abuse and Neglect to coordinate the functions of this Act, and to \nappoint an advisory board to report on specific issues.\n  The data collection function for the National Clearinghouse would be \nexpanded. In addition, the research activities function, coordinated by \nthe Secretary of HHS, is restructured to require a continuing program \nof research aimed at better protecting children from abuse and neglect.\n  The bill authorizes demonstration grants to encourages State and \nlocal innovation in training professionals, families, service \nproviders, and communities and providing information and assistance to \nindividuals, agencies, and organizations through child abuse resource \ncenters; parent mutual support and self help programs; and other \ninnovative programs, such as establishing a triage system which would \nallow and encourage community participation in the prevention and \nresponse to child abuse and neglect.\n  The basic State grant program will continue to support State child \nprotective services by assisting States with: First the intake, \nscreening and investigation of reports of child abuse or neglect; \nsecond, case management and delivery of services provided to children \nand their families; third, improving risk and safety assessment tools, \nfourth, expanding training opportunities for service providers and \nmandated reporters; and fifth; provide for education and training \naddressing ``Baby Doe'' situations of medical neglect.\n  In order to be eligible to receive funds under this section, a State \nmust submit a State plan and annual data reports.\n  The bill continues the current immunity from prosecution for \nindividuals who report a suspicion or incident of child abuse and \nneglect, but adds a requirement that the reports must be made in good \nfaith.\n  This bill clarifies the issue of medical neglect as well, providing \nthat parents are free to make decisions regarding the medical treatment \nof their children, and that States may not find a family using \nspiritual or non-medical means as being neglectful, solely on the basis \nof a religious practice, absent an affirmative finding of abuse or \nneglect on a case-by-case basis. Further, the bill makes clear that \nnothing in this act precludes a State from intervening on behalf of the \nchild where failure or refusal to provide a medical service or \ntreatment will lead to imminent risk of severe harm to the child.\n  Finally, to give better direction to the States, the definition of \nchild abuse and neglect is clarified.\n  Title II consolidates the former community--based family resource \nprograms grant with the Temporary Child Care for Children With \nDisabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act and Title VII(F)--family support \nservices--of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to create \na comprehensive community--based family resource program. The new \nprogram provides for broad-based networks of child abuse and prevention \nprograms and other family resource and support programs.\n  Title III reauthorizes the Family Violence Prevention and Services \nAct, which provides grants to States to assist in supporting programs \nand projects to prevent incidents or family violence and provide \nimmediate shelter for victims of family violence.\n  Title IV reauthorizes the Adoption Opportunities Act, which a few \ntechnical changes and a new requirement that the Secretary report on \nthe efficacy of the current system of recruitment for prospective \nfoster care and/or adoptive parents.\n  Title V reauthorizes the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act, which \nprovides discretionary grants to States to prevent abandonment of \nchildren and to provide for the needs of children who are abandoned, \nespecially those with AIDS.\n  And finally, Title VI provides a 2-year, straight reauthorization of \nthe Missing Children's Assistance Act and section 214B of the Victims \nof Child Abuse Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenator Coats today in introducing the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act Amendments of 1995. This important legislation \nreauthorizes the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act (CAPTA) and \nmakes several important changes to the legislation. CAPTA is the only \nFederal program specifically aimed at the prevention and treatment of \nchild abuse.\n  Federal involvement in child welfare began with the passage of CAPTA \nin 1974. This act has provided critical leadership to help States \nidentify child abuse and neglect, improve State child protective \nsystems, and prevent and treat child abuse and neglect. CAPTA has \nassisted States in establishing mandatory reporting systems of child \nabuse and neglect. In addition, the act provided immunity from \nprosecution for mandated reporters who act in good faith to report \nsuspected cases of child abuse and neglect. This has dramatically \nimproved States' ability to intervene in situations where abuse has \noccurred. The legislation Senator Coats and I are introducing today \nwill make significant improvements to state reporting systems by \nplacing a stronger emphasis on training of mandated reporters and case \nworkers and by building in an assessment component in the reporting and \ninvestigation process.\n  CAPTA has also provided funding for research in the field of child \nabuse and neglect. Research is critical to understanding this issue and \nto providing professionals with the necessary tools to assist children \nand families who may be at risk of child abuse and neglect. In \naddition, CAPTA has established a national clearinghouse to collect \ndata on child abuse and neglect. [[Page S8265]] Amendments to CAPTA \nhave been made to strengthen research efforts and to expand the \nclearinghouse's data collection function to include information on \nsubstantiated, unsubstantiated, and false reports of child abuse and \nneglect.\n  This legislation also seeks to encourage State and local innovation \nthrough demonstration grants in the areas of training and education, \nreporting and investigation of abuse and neglect, and encouraging \nparent mutual support and self-help programs.\n  The reauthorization of CAPTA also includes a prevention component \nthat involves networks of local community-based organizations whose \nprimary purpose is to assist families at risk of child abuse and \nneglect. Title II of this legislation consolidates several programs, \nthe Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Crisis \nNurseries Act and the Family Support Centers under the Stewart B. \nMcKinney Homeless Assistance Act, into the Community-Based Family \nResource Grants program. The programs being consolidated provide a \nrange of services to families, from respite care and support services \nto families with disabled children to assisting families in finding \naffordable housing. The grants are awarded to States that demonstrate a \ncommitment to establishing a network of resources designed to assist \nfamilies and prevent child abuse and neglect and to providing \nleadership in coordinating various programs and activities at the State \nand local levels.\n  The Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act Amendments of 1995 has \nbeen reauthorized at $100 million for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as \nnecessary through fiscal year 2000.\n  The legislation also includes several minor technical amendments to \nthe Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to reconcile \ndifferences between this and the Victims of Crime Act. In addition, \nTitle IV and Title V reauthorize the Adoption Opportunities Act and the \nAbandoned Infants Assistance Act. Several technical changes have been \nmade to the Adoption Opportunities Act to improve this program. Also, a \nprovision has been included to require the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to study and report on the efficacy of requiring States \nto contract with public, private nonprofit, and sectarian institutions \nfor recruitment of prospective foster care and adoptive parents and for \nassistance with the placement of children with special needs. The \nAdoption Opportunities Act has been reauthorized at $20 million for \nfiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary through fiscal year \n2000. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act has been reauthorized at $35 \nmillion for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary through \nfiscal year 2000.\n  Finally, in conjunction with Senator Hatch, several programs under \nthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction that were included \nin Title II of the House welfare reform proposal, have been \nreauthorized under Title VI of CAPTA. They are the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act and the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990. Both \nprograms have been reauthorized through 1997.\n  I believe this legislation will make significant improvements to the \nreporting, prevention, and treatment of child abuse and neglect. I \nwould like to thank Senator Coats for his strong commitment to children \nand his leadership on this very important issue. I hope that this \nlegislation will receive bipartisan support from my colleagues in the \nSenate and that many of you will join with Senator Coats and me in \nensuring its passage on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8255-1", "month": "06", "year":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Parental Choice in \n     Television Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On average, a child in the United States is exposed to \n     27 hours of television each week and some children are \n     exposed to as much as 11 hours of television each day.\n       (2) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n     100,000 acts of other violence on television by the time the \n     child completes elementary school.\n       (3) By the age of 18 years, the average American teenager \n     has watched 200,000 acts of violence on television, including \n     40,000 murders.\n       (4) On several occasions since 1975, The Journal of the \n     American Medical Association has alerted the medical \n     community to the adverse effects of televised violence on \n     child development, including an increase in the level of \n     aggressive behavior and violent behavior among children who \n     view it.\n       (5) The National Commission on Children recommended in 1991 \n     that producers of television programs exercise greater \n     restraint in the content of programming for children.\n       (6) A report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, \n     dated May 1993, indicates that there is an irrefutable \n     connection between the amount of violence depicted in the \n     television programs watched by children and increased \n     aggressive behavior among children.\n       (7) It is a compelling National interest that parents be \n     empowered with the technology to block the viewing by their \n     children of television programs whose content is overly \n     violent or objectionable for other reasons.\n       (8) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture \n     of television receivers that are capable of permitting \n     parents to block television programs having violent or \n     otherwise objectionable content.\n\n     SEC. 503. ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE RATING CODE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) Prescribe, in consultation with television \n     broadcasters, cable operators, appropriate public interest \n     groups, and interested individuals from the private sector, \n     rules for rating the level of violence or other objectionable \n     content in television programming, including rules for the \n     transmission by television broadcast stations and cable \n     systems of--\n       ``(1) signals containing ratings of the level of violence \n     or objectionable content in such programming; and\n       ``(2) signals containing specifications for blocking such \n     programming.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, but only if the Commission determines, in \n     consultation with appropriate public interest groups and \n     interested individuals from the private sector, on that date \n     that television broadcast stations and cable systems have \n     not--\n       (1) established voluntarily rules for rating the level of \n     violence or other objectionable content in television \n     programming which rules are acceptable to the Commission; and\n       (2) agreed voluntarily to broadcast signals that contain \n     ratings of the level of violence or objectionable content in \n     such programming.\n\n     SEC. 504.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has not passed comprehensive changes to the \n     Communications Act of 1934 since that Act was originally \n     passed.\n       (2) Congress must pass comprehensive communications \n     legislation to promote the development and growth of the \n     national information superhighway.\n       (3) Changes in the telecommunications marketplace have made \n     some of the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 \n     obsolete, unnecessary, or inimical to advances in \n     communications technologies and services.\n       (4) Competition has emerged in many services that were \n     previously thought to be natural monopolies, but the \n     Communications Act of 1934 requires all carriers to be \n     regulated as if they were monopolies.\n       (5) As communications markets change, government must \n     ensure that the public interest, convenience, and necessity \n     are preserved. [[Page S8275]] \n       (6) The public interest requires that universal service is \n     protected and advanced, that new telecommunications \n     technologies are deployed rapidly and equitably, and that \n     access by schools, hospitals, public broadcasters, libraries, \n     and museums to advanced telecommunications services is \n     assisted.\n       (7) Access to telecommunications services is fundamental to \n     safety of life and participation in a democratic society.\n       (8) Telecommunications networks make substantial use of \n     public rights of way in real property and in spectrum \n     frequencies, and carriers that make use of such public rights \n     of way have an obligation to provide preferential rates to \n     entities that provide significant public benefits.\n       (9) Advanced telecommunications services can enhance the \n     quality of life and promote economic development and \n     international competitiveness.\n       (10) Telecommunications infrastructure development is \n     particularly crucial to the continued economic development of \n     rural areas that may lack an adequate industrial or service \n     base for continued development.\n       (11) Advancements in the Nation's telecommunications \n     infrastructure will enhance the public welfare by helping to \n     speed the delivery of new services, such as distance \n     learning, remote medical sensing, and distribution of health \n     information.\n       (12) Infrastructure advancement can be assisted by joint \n     planning and infrastructure sharing by carriers and other \n     providers of network facilities and services providing \n     communications services.\n       (13) Increased competition in telecommunications services \n     can, if subject to appropriate safeguards, encourage \n     infrastructure development and have beneficial effects on the \n     price, universal availability, variety, and quality of \n     telecommunications services.\n       (14) The emergence of competition in telecommunications \n     services has already contributed, and can be expected to \n     continue contributing, to the modernization of the \n     infrastructure.\n       (15) Competition in the long distance industry and the \n     communications equipment market has brought about lower \n     prices and higher quality services.\n       (16) Competition for local communications services has \n     already begun to benefit the public; competitive access \n     providers have deployed thousands of miles of optical fiber \n     in their local networks; local exchange carriers have been \n     prompted by competition to accelerate the installation of \n     optical fiber in their own networks.\n       (17) Electric utilities, satellite carriers, and others are \n     prepared to enter the local telephone market over the next \n     few years.\n       (18) A diversity of telecommunications carriers enhances \n     network reliability by providing redundant capacity, thereby \n     lessening the impact of any network failure.\n       (19) Competition must proceed under rules that protect \n     consumers and are fair to all telecommunications carriers.\n       (20) All telecommunications carriers, including competitors \n     to the telephone companies, should contribute to universal \n     service and should make their networks available for \n     interconnection by others.\n       (21) Removal of all State and local barriers to entry into \n     the telecommunications services market and provision of \n     interconnection are warranted after mechanisms to protect \n     universal service and rules are established to ensure that \n     competition develops.\n       (22) Increasing the availability of interconnection and \n     interoperability among the facilities of telecommunications \n     carriers will help stimulate the development of fair \n     competition among providers.\n       (23) The portability of telecommunications numbers will \n     eliminate a significant advantage held by traditional \n     telephone companies over competitors in the provision of \n     telecommunications services.\n       (24) Unreasonable restrictions on resale and sharing of \n     telecommunications networks retard the growth of competition \n     and restrict the diversity of services available to the \n     public.\n       (25) Additional regulatory measures are needed to allow \n     consumers in rural markets and noncompetitive markets the \n     opportunity to benefit from high-quality telecommunications \n     capabilities.\n       (26) Regulatory flexibility for existing providers of \n     telephone exchange service is necessary to allow them to \n     respond to competition.\n       (27) The Federal Communications Commission (referred to \n     elsewhere in this Act as the ``Commission'') and the States \n     must have the flexibility to ad\n      just their regulations of each provider of \n     telecommunications services to serve the public interest.\n       (28) If the efforts of the private sector fail, the \n     Commission should take steps to ensure network reliability \n     and the development of network standards.\n       (29) Access to switched, digital telecommunications service \n     for all segments of the population promotes the core First \n     Amendment goal of diverse information sources by enabling \n     individuals and organizations alike to publish and otherwise \n     make information available in electronic form.\n       (30) The national welfare will be enhanced if community \n     newspapers are provided ease of entry into the operation of \n     information services disseminated through electronic means \n     primarily to customers in the localities served by such \n     newspapers at rates that are not higher, on a per-unit basis, \n     than the rates charged for such services to any other \n     electronic publisher.\n       (31) A clear national mandate is needed for full \n     participation in access to telecommunications networks and \n     services by individuals with disabilities.\n       (32) The obligations of telecommunications carriers include \n     the duty to furnish telecommunications services which are \n     designed to be fully accessible to individuals with \n     disabilities in accordance with such standards as the \n     Commission may prescribe.\n       (33) Permitting the Bell operating companies to enter the \n     manufacturing market will stimulate greater research and \n     development, create more jobs, and enhance our international \n     competitiveness.\n       (34) The Bell operating companies should not be permitted \n     to enter the market for other long distance services until \n     they have eliminated the barriers to competition and \n     interconnection.\n       (35) Safeguards are necessary to ensure that the Bell \n     operating companies do not abuse their market power over \n     local telephone service to discriminate against competitors \n     in the markets for electronic publishing, alarm services, and \n     other information services.\n       (36) Amending the legal barriers to the provision of video \n     programming by telephone companies in their service areas \n     will encourage telephone companies to upgrade their \n     telecommunications facilities to enable them to deliver video \n     programming, as long as telephone companies and cable \n     companies are prohibited from buying or joint venturing with \n     each other in their service areas (except for certain rural \n     areas).\n       (37) As communications technologies and services \n     proliferate, consumers must be given the right to control \n     information concerning their use of those technologies and \n     services.\n       (38) As competition in the media increases, the Commission \n     should re-examine the need for national and local ownership \n     limits on broadcast stations, consistent with the need to \n     maintain diversity of information sources.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Amendment No. 1315\n\n       On page 82, beginning with ``Sec. 255'' on line 11, strike \n     all that follows through line 2, page 99.\n       On page 82, after line 10, add the attached paragraphs, \n     except on page 136, line 7, of attachment strike the word \n

PREVENTION OF UNFAIR BILLING PRACTICES FOR \n                   INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED OVER TOLL-FREE \n                   TELEPHONE CALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Reforms required by the Telephone Disclosure and \n     Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the reputation \n     of the pay-per-call industry and resulted in regulations that \n     have reduced the incidence of misleading practices that are \n     harmful to the public interest.\n       (2) Among the successful reforms is a restriction on \n     charges being assessed for calls to 800 telephone numbers or \n     other telephone numbers advertised or widely understood to be \n     toll free.\n       (3) Nevertheless, certain interstate pay-per-call \n     businesses are taking advantage of an exception in the \n     restriction on charging for information conveyed during a \n     call to a ``toll-free'' number to continue to engage in \n     misleading practices. These practices are not in compliance \n     with the intent of Congress in passing the Telephone \n     Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act.\n       (4) It is necessary for Congress to clarify that its intent \n     is that charges for information provided during a call to an \n     800 number or other number widely advertised and understood \n     to be toll free shall not be assessed to the calling party \n     unless the calling party agrees to be billed according to the \n     terms of a written subscription agreement or by other \n     appropriate means.\n       (b) Prevention of Unfair Billing Practices.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 228(c) (47 U.S.C. 228(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking out subparagraph (C) of paragraph (7) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(C) the calling party being charged for information \n     conveyed during the call unless--\n       ``(i) the calling party has a written agreement (including \n     an agreement transmitted through electronic medium) that \n     meets the requirements of paragraph (8);

According to the Carnegie Council on \n     Adolescent Development, by the age of 18, children will have \n     been exposed to nearly 18,000 televised murders and 800 \n     suicides.\n       Violence on television is likely to have a serious and \n     harmful effect on the emotional development of young \n     children. The American Psychological Association has reported \n     that children who watch ``a large number of aggressive \n     programs tend to hold attitudes and values that favor the use \n     of aggression to solve conflicts.'' The National Institute of \n     Mental health has stated similarly that ``violence on \n     television does lead to aggressive behavior by children and \n     teenagers.''\n       The Senate recognizes that television violence is not the \n     sole cause of violence in society.\n       There is a broad recognition in the U.S. Congress that the \n     television industry has an obligation to police the content \n     of its own broadcasts to children. That understanding was \n     reflected in the Television Violence Act of 1990, which was \n     specifically designed to permit industry participants to work \n     together to create a self-monitoring system.\n       After years of denying that television violence has any \n     detrimental effect, the entertainment industry has begun to \n     address the problem of television violence. In the Spring of \n     1994, for example, the network and cable industries announced \n     the appointment of an independent monitoring group to assess \n     the amount of violence on television. These reports are due \n     out in the Fall of 1995 and Winter of 1996, respectively.\n       The Senate recognizes that self-regulation by the private \n     sector is generally preferable to direct regulation by the \n     federal government.\n\n     SEC.   : SENSE OF THE SENATE--.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the entertainment \n     industry should do everything possible to limit the amount of \n     violent and aggressive entertainment programming, \n     particularly during the hours when children are most likely \n     to be watching.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  EXON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1350\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER (for Mr. Exon, for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Byrd) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 652, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 49, line 15 after ``Government (or its \n     representative)'' add the following: ``provided that the \n     President does not object within 15 days of such \n     determination''\n       On page 50 between line 14 and 15 insert the following:\n       ``(c) The Application of the Exon-Florio Law.--Nothing in \n     this section (47 U.S.C. 310) shall limit in any way the \n     application of 50 U.S.C.

Mr. President, the agreement reached last week by \nBritish and Chinese negotiators for a new Court of Final Appeal in Hong \nKong is a grave setback to the rule of law in the territory. The deal \nviolates the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and its guarantees for \nHong Kong's legal system by building on the 1991 secret deal on the \nCourt, and using the 1990 Basic Law to make end runs around the Joint \nDeclaration. In reaching this deal, the British side also conceded on \nthe important matter of an early establishment of the court to prevent \na gap in appellate jurisdiction in the colony during the transition \nfrom London's Privy Council to the new high court. Governor Patten \nclaims that it was worth waiting until July 1, 1997, for the court to \nbegin its work in exchange for an agreement. But this is really just \npostponement of a bad deal.\n  Under the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong's courts are vested with the \njudicial power, including the power of final adjudication. Also, under \nthe Joint Declaration, judicial independence is explicitly guaranteed, \nand the elected legislature must confirm appointments to the Court of \nFinal Appeal. Each of these explicit promises made in the Joint \nDeclaration, signed in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher and Zhao Ziyang, is \nexpressly violated in last week's deal.\n  I would like to address one aspect of the deal specifically--the \nprovision under which Hong Kong's courts will, after 1997, be prevented \nfrom hearing and adjudicating matters known as ``acts of state.'' I \nspecifically wish to address this because British and Hong Kong \ngovernment officials are quietly advising that the act of state \ndoctrine is extremely complicated and arcane. In effect, they are \nsaying: ``Don't try and understand it.'' That is offensive.\n  The ``acts of state'' doctrine is not difficult to understand. In the \ncommon law, it is a well-known and narrow category involving actions by \none sovereign vis-a-vis another, such as a declaration of war, or a \ntreaty. The last such case arose in Hong Kong in 1947.\n  Under the terms of the agreement, Hong Kong's courts will be \nrestricted from adjudicating ``acts of state'' as defined in the Basic \nLaw of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Beijing passed the \nBasic Law, often referred to as the colony's post-1997 constitution in \n1990. The Basic Law contains numerous and substantial violations of the \nJoint Declaration, yet the uncritical acceptance of the document by \nGreat Britain has allowed the Basic Law to play an insidious role in \nthe transition to PRC rule.\n  Great Britain and the PRC have now agreed that Article 19 of the \nBasic Law will define the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts. Article 19 \nprovides that ``acts of state such as defence and foreign affairs'' \nwill be outside the courts' jurisdiction. The deliberate ambiguity of \nthis formulation leaves the matter up to Beijing which has already \nassigned the power of interpreting the Basic Law to the Standing \nCommittee of the National People's Congress rather than Hong Kong's \ncourts. The Basic Law's definition of acts of state now endorsed by the \nBritish government of Hong Kong is vague and will, without a doubt, be \nused by the People's Republic of China to deny Hong Kong's courts the \nability to hear and adjudicate challenges to the Beijing-appointed \ngovernment after 1997.\n  Both Britain and the People's Republic of China made specific and \ndetailed commitments to preserving Hong Kong's legal system after 1997. \nIn recent years, China has made its intentions regarding those \ncommitments crystal clear: it will not honor them. Britain has been \nmore subtle, styling itself as a defender of Hong Kong while engaging \nin diplomatic backsliding.\n  Great Britain's failure to meet its commitments regarding the rule of \nlaw will irreparably damage its historical legacy in the colony. I hope \nthat in light of the strong criticism and concern that have been \nexpressed at the announcement of this deal, Great Britain will revise \nits legislation on the Court of Final Appeal to make it consistent with \nthe Joint Declaration. Furthermore, Great Britain and the Hong Kong \ngovernment should move with speed and conviction to repeal colonial \nlaws and establish an official human rights commission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8289-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14, 1995\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

I rise to keep vigil with the President on his plans to \nintroduce a balanced budget under the same circumstances that we had to \nin the Senate, with precise cuts, precise reductions in the rate of \ngrowth in some programs, changes in the tax law that would get us to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Just a few minutes ago, the President concluded what he termed --this \nis from the White House press release--The President's Economic Plan: A \nBalanced Budget That Puts People First.\n  He just concluded a minute or two ago. Obviously, I was here on the \nSenate floor. I was not able to see the actual address, but I have \nbefore me--I feel like Johnny Carson--I have before me the actual press \nrelease that outlines how he is going to get to a balanced budget over \n10 years. Now, it is interesting that he is going to take it over a 10-\nyear period. You would think that balancing the budget over a 10- \n[[Page S8290]] year period would make it easier to balance the budget \nin the longer time to do it. That is not the case, however. Because of \nthe demographic trends in our society and the entitlement nature of a \nlot of Government programs we have, spending actually kicks up higher \nand goes up faster in the years 2003, 2004, and 2005, those last 3 \nyears of the 10-year budget, and therefore it is actually harder to get \nto a balanced budget over a 10-year period. In fact, while it takes \nunder our proposal here that passed the Senate roughly $1.2 trillion in \nspending cuts and interest savings to get to a balanced budget in 7 \nyears, it takes about $1.6 trillion in spending cuts and interest \nsavings to get to a balanced budget over 10 years. So of this $1.6 \ntrillion, what does the President come up with? Well, here are the \nspecifics.\n  And before I put this number up, we have had 25 days, counting \nyesterday, 25 days with no proposal to balance the budget from \nPresident Clinton. Now, we are waiting to see whether I have to put 26 \nup or whether the proposal put forward by the President tonight meets \nthe straight-face test, whether the President actually has put forward \na budget that accomplishes balance. This is the operative word--balance \nthe budget, not plan for economic future, not Putting People First but \nbalance the budget in 10 years.\n  So we are going to withhold judgment for now as to whether the \nPresident with the specifics he has offered tonight balances the \nbudget. That is not to say that once he releases his document, which I \nam sure they are working on feverishly over at the White House, once \nthey release this document and have all the specifics down that we will \nnot give the President credit, but all we have is the information \npresented to us at this time, and since the Senate is recessing we have \nto go only by the information that the President provided us. So we \nwill hold 26 here for a minute.\n  Here is what the President has provided in his plan. First steps \ntoward health care reform while strengthening the Medicare trust fund--\nstrengthening, not solving the problems with the Medicare trust fund. \nThe President's plan calls for half the Medicare savings of the \nRepublican plans ($130 billion).\n  For those of you who do not have calculators at home, do not worry. I \nwill in fact be keeping track of the savings here, and I will make sure \nwe add them up and we do get the numbers the President needs to balance \nthe budget.\n  So it is $130 billion in savings for the President for Medicare cuts, \nbut there would be no beneficiary cuts. He does not explain how he does \nthat, but he suggests that he can do it without cutting beneficiaries. \nFine, $130 billion in deficit reduction.\n  Second is $55 billion in Medicaid cuts. Again, that is a third of the \nlevel of what the Republicans proposed in our budgets. That is $55 \nbillion plus $130 billion for the President.\n  Then he goes on and talks about protecting investment in education \nand training. That is paragraph 2 here in his press release. And he \nsays, ``The President's plan puts people first by preserving \ninvestments in education and training, with significant increases in \nHead Start, Goals 2000, AmeriCorps, student aid, a new GI bill of \nrights for workers that increases training through skill grants, and a \n$10,000 education tax deduction.''\n  Now, there is nothing in here that reduces the deficit. In fact, \neverything in here increases the deficit and increases spending. We do \nnot know how much, though. He does not tell us exactly how much. All we \nknow is that there are increases in spending in the President's budget \nthat look to be, with a $10,000 education tax deduction, potentially a \nsignificant amount of money, but again we do not know, we do not know \nwhether any of these are new entitlements and how they will grow in the \nnext 10 years. But we do see, I suggest, significant increases here, \nbut we cannot account for those.\n  Next is a tax cut targeted only to working families. Again, no \ndeficit reduction here. We are talking about the President's middle-\nincome tax cut which he has proposed, which is the education deduction, \ntax credit for children and expanded IRA's.\n  Under the President's original proposal when he proposed his budget \nin February, that plan cost about $65 billion over 5 years. Over 10 \nyears, that number, you would think, would be double that but, in fact, \nbecause of the way it is back-end loaded--he back-end loads that tax \ncut--it is actually dramatically more. We do not have a score in on \nthat, but I suspect it is at least $150 billion, or more, in costs.\n  So on the one side you have $130 billion--try to keep this in your \nmind--on Medicare, $55 billion on Medicaid, and on the other side you \nhave a questionable amount of money on education and about $150 billion \nplus in tax cuts. OK? This is not exactly the straight road to a \nbalanced budget, but we are not done yet.\n  No. 3, components of savings for the balanced budget. Here is where \nwe really get down to the brass tacks and get serious about balancing \nthe budget. He restates his Medicare and Medicaid savings. I hope he \ndoes not count them twice because they appear twice in this document, \nbut they are here for repetition sake. Welfare reform has savings of \n$35 billion--$35 billion. That now goes on the cut side, and we add \nthat to the $130 billion and $55 billion. By the way, that is half of \nwhat the Republicans have proposed in the budget resolution that passed \nthe Senate.\n  Corporate contributions of $25 billion over 7 years through a \nbipartisan effort to close corporate loopholes, special interest tax \nbreaks and unwarranted corporate subsidies. OK, that is another $25 \nbillion on the tax-increase side, but deficit reduction side.\n  Now we go to the last page of these three pages. Other than \neducation, research and selected investments in the environment and \nother areas, domestic discretionary spending is cut by over 20 percent \nin real terms near the end of the plan--near the end of the plan.\n  So what he is suggesting is that over 10 years, we will take the \nnumber of about, I think it is, $270 billion today is what we spend on \ndiscretionary spending overall. Obviously, a chunk of that is education \nand other things he says is taken off the sheet and says we are not \ngoing to cut that. I do not know how much that is. I am working off the \nback of an envelope here. You might not be able to tell that.\n  We have a number less than $270 billion that he is going to reduce by \n20 percent over 10 years. So we are going to get from $270 billion \nroughly down to $215 billion over 10 years.\n  The Republicans, in their budget, I think, get down to over 7 years \nabout $225 billion. So they only take it down a little more than where \nthe Republicans already had it, which is not a substantial savings. I \ndo not know how they do that. I would suspect you are going to see \nsavings generally in the area of around $75 billion overall. So we will \ngive him that amount of money roughly, although we do not know the \nspecifics. I think that is a generous allocation.\n  Finally, defense outlays in the President's plan are above both the \nHouse and Senate levels. Let me repeat that. Defense outlays in the \nPresident's plan are above both the House and Senate levels in fiscal \nyear 2002. So he is talking about higher defense spending than what we \npassed here. Yet, savings are achieved by keeping budget authority \nconstant from 2002 to 2005. In other words, we are going to spend more \nmoney the first 7 years but less money the last 3 years, and that will \noffset the spending here.\n  What it sounds like is defense is a wash. In other words, we are not \ngoing to spend any more or less; there is no real reduction in spending \nin defense. So how do these numbers add up, because that is it, there \nare no more specifics on how the President gets to a balanced budget.\n  I remind you, going back to the beginning of this talk, the \nPresident, in order to balance the budget, has to come up with spending \ncuts and interest savings that total $1.6 trillion over 10 years, and \nthey have to be scored by someone other than someone who is working for \nthe Democratic National Committee, someone who is independent, like the \nCongressional Budget Office, to look at this and score it as to whether \nthese are real: $1.6 trillion, specified cuts in the Clinton bill--\nspecified--$245 billion out of $1.6 trillion, $245 billion are \nspecified.\n  Another $75 billion, I figured out, in discretionary spending could \nbe cut. That is a rough estimate. So we will give the President the \nbenefit of the doubt of $315 billion in spending cuts \n[[Page S8291]] and offset that with at least $150 billion in increases \nbecause of his tax cut, which gives you a net of about $165 billion.\n  Tonight, the President of the United States went on national \ntelevision for 5 minutes with a plan that he submitted--here--to all of \nus and gave us a little cheat sheet on what he was going to talk about \nthat cuts 10 percent of what he needs to get to a balanced budget over \n10 years--10 percent. He puts forward 10 percent of the cuts he needs \nto balance the budget over 10 years.\n  I do not know if that meets the straight-face test. I do not think it \ndoes. I think when the President of the United States comes and says he \nis going to present an economic plan to balance the budget over 10 \nyears, then comes before the American public on national TV, which the \nVice President was able to ascertain for him, and then comes up with \nonly 10 percent of the cuts necessary to get to a balanced budget, I am \nnot too sure that this number ``6'' does not belong up on that board. I \nam not too sure that the President has come to the table yet with a \nserious plan that scores as a balanced budget.\n  Certainly, the details that he has offered and the notes that have \nbeen haphazardly slipped to me by my staff as he listened to his speech \ncertainly do not give me any further indication, any further specifics \nabout how the President accomplishes this goal. But to come forward on \nnational television--on national television--saying he is going to \nbalance the budget and come forward with 10 percent, that is an insult. \nIt is an insult. It is an insult to all of us who sit there and work \nhard to try to make this happen, and it does not do much to elevate the \nstature of the President's office.\n  If you are going to come to the American public, if you are going to \nsay you will play straight, if you are going to be specific on how to \ndo it, do not try to finesse them again. Someone is watching. Someone \nis going to pay attention to the details, and you are not going to be \nable to keep fudging the fact that you are not coming forward with the \ntough decisions. And stretching it out over 10 years, you will find, \ndoes not make it any easier.\n  So tonight I have to put up number ``6.'' Five-minute speeches on \nnational television do not count. Facts, specifics, documents, vision, \nplans count. All of those were in the Senate-passed budget resolution, \nevery one of them. They changed the dynamics of Government. They \nprovided vision of how we are going to challenge the problems, to take \nthose challenges on in the future. We solve the Medicare trust fund \nproblem. The President does not do any of those things. He felt the \npressure.\n  I do not know whether he started off his speech saying, ``Here I \nam,'' in response to my talks on the Senate floor, but if he did, he \ncame up short. He, in fact, is not found yet. We still do not know \nwhere the President is when it comes to putting forth measures to \nbalance this budget.\n  And so while there are many other things I would like to do at 9:20 \nin the evening than come and talk about the President and his inability \nto lead this country, I will continue to come back until I get the \nspecifics of how the President is going to put forward a plan to lead \nthis country into the future. And to date, day 26, the President is \nstill absent without leadership, and has still refused to come to the \ntable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senate would have \nstood in recess until 9 a.m. on June 14. Does the Senator from \nConnecticut rise to ask unanimous consent to speak?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do. I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nable to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/senate-section/article/S8289-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8291-S8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS AT DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I did not intend to come on over to the \nfloor, but I wanted to respond to some of the comments I heard being \nmade about the President's brief remarks this evening on national \ntelevision and the majority leader's remarks which followed the \nPresident's comments, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator \nDole.\n  I know it is not typical at this kind of a moment to want to commend, \nI suppose, the leadership, but I want to do so. I thought the President \ngave a very fine speech this evening, and I want to commend the \nmajority leader for his remarks.\n  One thing that is clear to me is that people in this country would \nlike to see the people in this town put aside the partisan bickering \nand try to come up with some answers to a problem that has been growing \nover the last 15 or 16 years.\n  This President arrived in this town 30 months ago, having served as \nthe Governor of a State, not unlike the Presiding Officer tonight in \nthe Senate, and was not a party to the events which unfolded beginning \nin early 1980.\n  I noted earlier that this President for 30 months now has made a \nsignificant effort, and a successful one, in deficit reduction. For the \nfirst time in many, many years, going back to the Truman \nadministration, we have now had 3 years of significant deficit \nreduction, $600 billion. We still have a long way to go to achieve that \ngoal.\n  I looked at the candidates running for the Presidency, the announced \ncandidates, and I am looking at 100 years collectively of experience in \nthis town. Some go back to 1960; many go back to the 1970's. They were \nhere as this mountain of debt was accumulated. So to point an accusing \nfinger at this President as if somehow it was his fault for what has \nhappened over the last 15 or 16 years I think is unfair.\n  Mr. President, the point is this: We can go through this process over \nthe next 7 or 8 weeks or months and score our political points one on \nthe other, and maybe one party or the other will prevail in the \nelections of November 1996, but if at the end of all of that we have \nnot really done what the American public has asked us to do, then one \nparty or one candidate or another may be successful, but the country \nwill be that much worse off 9 or 10 months from tonight.\n  So I rise to commend the President for offering a proposal, laying \none on the table which is different than what was passed in the House \nand the Senate, but does lay out some options for us to consider;\n hopefully, for some common ground to come around the issue of how we \nreduce this deficit and do so in a balanced and fair way so that the \ncountry moves forward.\n\n  Deficit reduction is a critically important issue. But the wealth of \nthis Nation is not merely tied to just deficit reduction. It is also \nthe investments we make. It is also the pace at which we achieve that \ndeficit reduction.\n  Who pays in the process for trying to achieve that goal? The \nPresident this evening laid out a 10-year proposal rather than a 7-year \nproposal. He offers to cut Medicare by one-third the cuts that have \nbeen proposed by the budget that was adopted in this body and the \nother. He does so by suggesting that those cuts could come not from the \nbeneficiaries but from providers and others.\n  I have my concerns about it, but I see it as a more moderate proposal \nas we try and beef up and shore up the Medicare trust fund.\n  The President has offered a tax cut. I, frankly, would not have any \ntax cuts over the next several years. I think, frankly, deficit \nreduction is a far more important goal. Incorporating the tax cuts in \nthat mix, I think, is unwise.\n  But the President's tax cut proposal is some $66 billion over 7 \nyears, rather than something between $250 and $300 billion over the \nsame period. His tax cuts go toward middle-income people in this \ncountry, particularly those with children and those who have children \nof college age, to try and defer, or at least lessen some of those \ncosts.\n  The President also suggests that we can do this, achieve this \nbalanced budget, in 10 years, by cutting some 20 percent out of the \nexisting programs. That, I am sure, will be a tremendous battle here \nover the coming months.\n  However, he has put a proposal on the table. He has extended the \nhand. He is not a Member of Congress. He is not the head of the \npolitical party. He is not a Governor. He is the President of our \ncountry. He will be so until January 20, 1997, if he is not reelected.\n  The President is leading. He is offering all--Republicans and \nDemocrats in this body--an opportunity to put aside that bickering, to \nput aside that name-calling, and to come to the table and deal with \nAmerica's problems. [[Page S8292]] \n  People in this country do not wake up in the morning thinking of \nthemselves as Democrats or Republicans, conservatives or liberals. They \nget up in the morning and think of themselves in terms of the problems \nthey face--their jobs, their kids' education, their health care. Those \nare things that most Americans worry about--not the process in \nWashington.\n  They would like to see those Members elected to office to try and put \naside some of that political campaign rhetoric, at least for a time, \nand wrestle with their problem.\n  The President has put an offer on the table, and Bob Dole, to his \ncredit, I think, has extended up to that offer, and has suggested that \nwe might come together here and work out these differences.\n  I think the country was well served by both comments tonight, by the \nPresident's speech and by the majority leader's response.\n  I think all in this body have an opportunity now to reach that \njudgment of history and to step forward and try to solve this problem.\n  Stop pointing the fingers. Stop the accusing and name calling. Let \nMembers go to work on the problems that we will all be judged, \nhistorically, as to whether or not we have the courage to meet the \nchallenge.\n  I thank Members for the opportunity to share these few short \ncomments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
