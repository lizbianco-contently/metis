Mr. President, I wanted to just touch briefly on three \nitems this morning. I want to talk about some trade negotiations that \nbegin today in Beijing, China. Unfortunately, it tends to glaze over \nthe eyes of many people once you start talking about international \ntrade.\n  But I will talk about trade because on the car radio this morning I \nheard that the trade figures released this morning show that our trade \ndeficit for November is now close to $10.5 billion, up 4 percent, and \nwe are undoubtedly going to set another record trade deficit in the \nhistory of this country--the largest single trade deficit in the \nhistory of this country. It is a crisis, but you do not hear anybody \naround here gnashing their teeth about it. We talk about the budget \ndeficit, which is also a very serious problem, but the trade deficit \nthat we have with other countries must be ultimately repaid by a lower \nstandard of living in this country.\n  I want to talk about our trade deficit just for a moment because in \nmy judgment it is out of control. It represents a bipartisan failure, \nRepublicans and Democrats, jointly hugging a strategy on trade that is \nfundamentally hurting this country.\n  Today, negotiators from the United States are in Beijing, China, and \nwill begin negotiations with the Chinese. Our trade problem is a \nserious problem that extends in many directions, the most interesting \nof which, and serious of which, are with Japan and China. Japan's trade \nsurplus with this country will exceed $60 billion again this year. \nChina's trade surplus with the United States--or our deficit with \nthem--will come very close to $30 billion.\n  I want to show the Senate a piece of information that I think \ndemonstrates why our trade policies result from a bankrupt strategy. At \na time when China is ratcheting up this enormous surplus with us--in \nother words a deficit that we have with them--shipping us boatloads and \nplaneloads of Chinese goods, flooding our market with Chinese goods, \nthey also need things that we have. Among other things, they need \nwheat. They had a short wheat crop this past year and so they must \n[[Page S1130]] import a lot of it this year--about 11 million tons, the \nDepartment of Agriculture expects.\n  Where are they buying their wheat? From us because they are flooding \nour markets with their goods and running up this trade surplus? Oh, no, \nnot mostly from the United States. They are off price shopping for \nwheat in Canada and Argentina.\n  I want to show a graph that demonstrates the absurdity of what is \ngoing on. This line represents our trade deficit with China. You can \nsee what has happened there--straight up. Straight up. And this line \ndemonstrates the United States share of Chinese wheat purchases. You \ncan see what has happened there--down.\n  As our trade deficit with China goes up because they flood our market \nwith Chinese goods, they are off shopping elsewhere for wheat in Canada \nand Argentina.\n  I come from a very small town. In my town, there is an obligation. If \nsomeone comes and buys from your business, and then you need something \nthat they have, you have an obligation to go buy from them. That is the \nway it works.\n  But that is not the way it works in international trade, \nunfortunately. It is a case of Uncle Sucker saying, ``Our market is \nwide open. Do what you want. You have no reciprocal obligation to our \nproducers who want to sell in your market. You can go buy the things \nyou need elsewhere and you can still access the American market.'' \nSomething is fundamentally haywire in this trade strategy. It is \nhurting this country badly and it must stop.\n  I have written to Agriculture Secretary-designate Glickman and Trade \nAmbassador Kantor today, saying when these negotiators are in Beijing \nthey ought to tell the Chinese they have reciprocal obligations in our \nmarketplace. They need wheat? Then they buy wheat from us. If they need \nwhat we produce in dozens of areas, they buy from us. They have an \nobligation. Either we, with our trading partners, are going to work \ntoward balanced trade relationships or we are not. If they are not \nwilling then we ought to change the trade strategy we employ with those \ntrading partners--and we ought to do it soon.\n\n\n                        Mexico's Monetary Crisis\n\n  Let me make two other points. One, about the issue of the bailout for \nMexico. I have not spoken publicly about it, but I have grave \nreservations about it. And I want to tell you why. Not that I am \nunconcerned about Mexico. It is our neighbor. It faces a financial \ncrisis and we must respond in some manner.\n  But it in some ways relates to what I just spoke about in our trade \nrelationship with China, Japan, and others. That is, trade and business \nrelationships among nations should be reciprocal: There should be a \nsharing of economic responsibilities among nations who trade and do \nbusiness with each other. I am wondering if that kind of shared \nresponsbility is happening among nations who do business with Mexico.\n  What is the current account balance deficit in Mexico? Mexico has had \nto float bonds in order to underwrite a current account deficit. What \ndoes the current account balance deficit in Mexico result from? Largely \nfrom a trade deficit. Who is the trade deficit with? Us? Oh, no. No, \nvery little of it is with the United States. Mostly with others.\n  I do not have all the information because I cannot get it. I have \nasked for it repeatedly from those in our Government who should provide \nit, and I am going to get it today, I guess, after some delay. But at \nleast the sketchy information I do have suggests that a fair portion of \nMexico's trade deficit comes from Japan and a fair portion of Mexico's \ntrade deficit comes from Europe.\n  One would ask the question, then, if they issue public debt in Mexico \nto finance a current account balance, and that current account balance \nresults from trade deficits, and if the trade deficits are deficits \nwith Japan and Europe, should then the American taxpayer be the \nguarantor of a bailout of Mexico's trade relationship with Japan and \nEurope? Or is the new global order one in which there is a \nresponsibility for other countries trading with Mexico, including \nJapan, including the Europeans, and others who have a trade \nrelationship with Mexico, to own up to their responsibility?\n  Why is it only America's responsibility to come forward and protect \nMexico in a monetary crisis? In my judgment this is a time to say to \nthe countries that run a trade surplus with Mexico, or who have \notherwise caused an outflow of money from Mexico, to step forward and \nsay they will bear their share of responsibility. That is an issue \nwhich I think is very important.\n\n  I am greatly troubled by the call for a unilateral bailout of Mexico \nby the United States. I do not have all the information yet, but I \nintend to get it very soon. When I do, my hope is that we will be able \nto discuss this in the context of the obligations of others around the \nworld. What are the obligations of the Japanese and the Europeans, and \nwhy are they not meeting them?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1129-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TOURS OF THE U.S. CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a lot of ideas are floating around the \nHill, some reform, some new, some nutty, and, in a new article I have \nhere, an idea offered by someone from the Heritage Foundation. The \nfoundation is the think tank which helped write the Contract With \nAmerica. This fellow from the Heritage Foundation came to the Hill to \ntestify and said he thinks we ought to charge the American people for \ntouring the Capitol Building. He said they wear down the steps, they \nbrush up against the walls, and apparently he thinks that we should \ncharge the American people for touring the Capitol.\n  I would say that those who belong to a think tank who think this way \nshould eliminate the word ``think'' and call it just a ``tank.'' Does \nanybody really believe it is too old fashioned to think that those who \nown a building ought not to have to pay an admission fee to tour it or \nenter it?\n  There are going to be a lot of things around here under the guise of \nnew ideas or reform. A lot of them are going to be about half goofy, \nincluding this one.\n  I know people do not like to talk honestly about spending and taxing, \nso they come up with all kinds of other devices to avoid it. I guess to \navoid talking about the need for revenue, they say let us talk about \nadmission fees for the American people to the U.S. Capitol.\n  To those who come from think tanks who think this way, I say think \nagain. Not many people who serve in the U.S. Congress would believe it \nappropriate to charge the American people an admission fee to enter and \ntour a building the American people themselves own.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President and my colleagues, I remember when I was \npracticing law in Louisiana as a very young lawyer. One of the senior \nlawyers was explaining to me how we should proceed in a courtroom. His \nsuggestion was,\n\n       If you don't have the facts on your side when you are \n     arguing your case, well, you should talk about the law. But \n     if you do not have the law on your side and you are handling \n     a case in court, you should talk about the facts.\n\n  He went on to suggest if you do not have either one on your side, you \nought to just stand up and shout and walk around the courtroom and act \nlike you know what you are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that some of the Republican rhetoric \nthat I have heard in talking about national service takes the approach \nif you do not have the facts on your side, just make them up and say \nwhatever you want about a program in order to try to show that it is \nnot a good program.\n  I think it is very important that we stick to the facts when we talk \nabout programs and things we do in Government. I think the public gets \nso much misinformation that it is very important to try to point out \nwhen the facts are wrong when we talk about programs.\n  I start off by making these comments because I was really very \nsurprised by the Senator from Iowa, who was on the floor earlier, his \nremarks regarding national service that I read in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  I supported the program. It was the type of initiative that the \nPresident ran on 2 years ago, the type of program that I think is a \ngood program. When I read the gentleman's statements in the \nCongressional Record, I was flabbergasted. I said, This cannot be true.\n  In essence, what the Senator was saying was that the AmeriCorps \nProgram, part of the National Service Program, was costing $70,000 per \nstudent--$70,000 per student--in order to help kids go to college. I \nsaid that is ridiculous; I am not going to spend $70,000 a year to send \nkids to college. I found out some serious mistakes, in my opinion, were \nmade about characterizing this program that is costing $70,000 a \nstudent in Pennsylvania, in the city of Philadelphia.\n  What I found out was that the mistake that was made in using these \nfacts was the fact that they did not take into consideration private \nlaw firms that were contributing to this individual's salary; they did \nnot take into consideration the Philadelphia Bar Association's \ncontribution in this particular area. When he added up what the private \nsector was going to do with up to 11 full-time workers, he came up with \nthe figure of $70,000, when in truth the Federal Government's \ncontribution and the cost to the taxpayers was only $4,911. That is a \nbig difference from $70,000.\n  The AmeriCorps Program, the National Service Program, is really what \nI think Republicans have always been talking about. Let us get away \nfrom giveaway programs. Let Members terminate programs, and just give \nmoney away from Washington to get people to do certain things. The \nessence of what AmeriCorps is all about--and we have had up to 200,000 \nyoung men and women in this country volunteer to participate in the \nAmeriCorps Program. It is a wonderful concept. It builds on the Peace \nCorps Program.\n  By the way, Peace Corps Program volunteers get a stipend; they are \npaid. Just like the Vista Program has young men and women in this \nprogram, that participate in the program and do wonderful things, they \nget a small salary, as well. The concept of AmeriCorps, and why I think \nRepublicans and Democrats alike should be supportive of it, is because \nit is a partnership between the Government and the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  It talks about community, responsibility, reciprocity; it talks about \nsaying if the Government is going to help me to go to college, I have \nan obligation to reciprocate and give something back. What they give \nback in the AmeriCorps Program is doing community work, doing legal \nwork in the communities, working in a law enforcement program, in a \ndrug rehabilitation program, in a nursing program, an environmental \ncleanup program, as they are doing in my State of Louisiana, as we are \ndoing in Louisiana where we have young AmeriCorps students who are \nworking in the sheriffs department and local law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, they are giving something back to a Government that \nhas helped them go to college. It is a partnership. It is not a \ngiveaway program. It does not cost $70,000 for one young student to be \nable to participate in this program. It is asking the local community \nto say, do you need these types of students working in your local town? \nMost of them are saying, Yes, we need some help. We need some help in \nthe environment. We need some help in drug enforcement programs and \ndrug rehabilitation programs.\n  So the AmeriCorps Program is not a giveaway program; it is a program \nthat encourages young people to participate. We have an all-volunteer \narmy. They get paid, too. They get a salary so they can survive and so \nthey can live. I do not think they detract from an all-volunteer \nmilitary. The basic fact is we should be encouraging young men and \nwomen to give something back to a Government that has helped them get \nan education.\n  As President Clinton has said so many times in this country today, \nwhat you earn is going to be based on what you learn. The facts are \ndramatic, that a young person, a young male in this country that \ngraduates from a 4-year college earns about 83 percent more in his \nlifetime than a person who has not been able to go to college; 83 \npercent more in a lifetime. That is not just pie in the sky. That is \nreal facts.\n  That is something that we as a nation should be encouraging. And we \ndo not encourage it under national service by a giveaway program; we \nencourage it to be a partnership by saying to that young man or young \nwoman that if you would like to go to college and you need some help, \nwe will help you pay for your tuition. But it is not free; it is not \nfree. You have an obligation to try to give something back to your \nGovernment--not in India, not in Japan, not in Europe, not in a Third-\nWorld country, but right here in America. That is why it is called \nAmeriCorps. It is not a foreign aid program. We are not sending kids to \nother nations to help them solve their problems. We are saying that if \nyou accept this challenge, we will let you work in your local \ncommunity, back where people know you, where you may ultimately end up \nworking as a citizen in a partnership with your local citizens in your \nlocal community. [[Page S1132]] \n  That is why when someone says, well, this program costs $70,000 a \nstudent, it is absolutely not factual. It does not cost $70,000 for the \ntaxpayers of this country. What we have in Philadelphia in this \ninstance is a situation where the local bar association and several law \nfirms in the country have helped put up money to pay the salaries for \nup to 11 AmeriCorps students who will be working in that community as \nlawyers and as law students, helping people that have problems, helping \npeople understand the Government and this system. The Federal \nGovernment is going to put out $4,900 to allow that student to work in \nthat community. We have helped them get a college education and they \nare paying back with their services, and getting enough of a stipend \nfrom the Federal Government to at least survive and to be able to \ncontinue that work and do it full time. We are talking about full-time \nworkers.\n  This is not a giveaway program. Does it cost anything? Of course, it \ncosts. But how much does it cost to build a prison? We spend $300 \nmillion for a national program to try to get people to have a \npartnership with their Government, to get a college education, and give \nsomething back to the community. We spend billions of dollars, I \nsuggest, building prisons in this country and running prisons in this \ncountry, to incarcerate young men and women who have gone by the \nwayside, maybe because they did not have a National Service Program, \nbecause nobody cared. Nobody told them they have a reciprocal \nobligation to give something back to a Government that has helped them \nget a college education.\n  I have heard Speaker Gingrich in the other body talk, time and time \nagain, about communities, family, and service, and giving something \nback to the communities. This program is an example of giving something \nback to the communities, of national service, of saying: I want to help \nmy Government do better. If my Government helps me get a college \neducation, I am pleased, but I also recognize that it is not free. I \nwill give back to my Government in the same ratio that they have given \nto me.\n  I think that produces a stronger community. I think that produces \nstronger families. I think that produces a sense of what America is all \nabout. So I would suggest when we talk about national service, let \nMembers first get our facts straight. Let Senators first understand the \nreal cost.\n  I suggest, second, let Senators join together if there are problems, \nand let us improve the program. Let us not, by incorrect factual \ninformation, try to kill a program that I suggest is in keeping with \nwhat America is all about.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. President, in less than 2 months the Secretary of \nDefense will forward to the 1995 Base Closure Commission his so-called \n``hit list'' of military base closings. Although it is an excruciating \nexercise, I think we would all agree that closing obsolete military \nbases is a painful necessity.\n  With the end of the cold war, the Pentagon estimated that 30 percent \nof our domestic military bases must be shut down. Due in large part to \nthe efforts of Senator Sam Nunn, of Georgia, and former Senator Alan \nDixon, of Illinois, Congress created a bipartisan Base Closure \nCommission to help us make the necessary choices of which bases to \nclose.\n  I believe the base closure process is sound. It serves as a model of \nhow to make difficult and politically sensitive budget-cutting \ndecisions. The Base Closure Commission successfully completed base \nclosure rounds in 1988, 1991, and 1993.\n  As this chart to my left indicates, these three rounds of base \nclosings eliminated some 70 military bases throughout America. Some \nareas and some States were hit harder than others.\n  On March 1, 1995, the Commission will begin its very important \ndeliberations once again, and before the year is through, the \nCommission will seek congressional and Presidential approval to close \ndozens of additional bases. We have been told that this list will be \nlonger and painful. In fact, it has been said that this base closure \nround will possibly be equal in size to the first three rounds \ncombined.\n  To be certain, base closings hurt. In communities that lose a base, \nthousands of jobs are terminated, businesses close down, millions of \ndollars in annual revenue disappear from sight. Mr. President, I am \npersonally aware of that pain caused by base closure announcements. The \n1991 Commission closed Eaker Air Force Base, a B-52 base located in \nMississippi County, AR. They also took away a majority of the work at \nFort Chaffee near Fort Smith, AR.\n  Most of our colleagues in the Senate have witnessed the departure of \nthe military in at least one community in their State. My colleagues \nfrom California lost eight major military bases in 1993 alone, as this \nmap so indicates.\n  We have seen communities react with anger and frustration to the news \nof base closings. We have witnessed their fear about surviving such a \ntremendous economic blow. For most base closure towns, the military was \nthe largest employer, as in the case of Eaker Air Force Base in \nBlytheville, AR.\n  Mr. President, I visited this base in 1992, 1 year after the closure \nannouncement, to see how the local townspeople were coping with the \nimpending loss of the Air Force.\n  What I found was a community that desperately wanted to beat swords \ninto plowshares. I found also a community that was receiving virtually \nno help whatsoever from the Federal Government. In fact, this community \nclaimed that Washington was their largest roadblock to a speedy \nrecovery. The citizens of Blytheville needed the Air Force's \ncooperation and the Federal Government's resources. What they received \ninstead was bureaucratic lip service and endless red tape.\n  The same was true in other communities across America. The problems \nwere so severe that the former majority leader, Senator George \nMitchell, decided to create a special task force to devise a strategy \nfor easing the impact of defense budget reductions and for making a \nsmooth transition to a post-cold war economy.\n  Senator Mitchell asked me to become the task force chairman. With 24 \nDemocratic Senate colleagues, we began studying what the Federal \nGovernment's role should be, if any, to help in our Nation's ongoing \ntransition from swords to plowshares.\n  Our 1992 task force concluded that the end of the cold war had caught \nour country by surprise, and that we were late in devising a national \nstrategy for helping our cold war workers, communities and companies \nfind a new direction.\n  We also found that the United States of America was better prepared \nto handle a much larger transition in the years following World War II. \nAs early as 1943, 2 years before the war had ended, President Roosevelt \nmade the decision to begin planning for the war's end and the difficult \nconversion to a peacetime economy. He had created the War \nDemobilization Office and charged this new entity with devising a \nnational strategy. From this office emerged the GI bill and many other \ninitiatives that helped our country grow and prosper in the years that \nfollowed.\n  In 1992, however, 3 years after the Iron Curtain began to crack, our \nGovernment still had no comprehensive strategy for beating swords into \nplowshares. History, Mr. President, should have taught us better. The \nlesson learned after World War II, and in other periods of defense \ndownsizing, was that our Government has a duty to provide comprehensive \ntransition assistance to those affected by reductions in our Nation's \ndefense expenditures.\n  Some might say, Mr. President, that this is not the function nor the \nrole of Government. I would submit, however, that our Government should \nbecome a partner in this endeavor and not an obstacle to economic \nrecovery.\n  To compensate for our slow start and to finally allow our Government \nto become a partner instead of an obstacle, [[Page S1133]] our 1992 \ntask force recommended sizable increases in defense reinvestment \nfunding and programs. That same year a Republican task force, \ncommissioned by then-minority leader Senator Dole and chaired by former \nSenator Warren Rudman, drew similar conclusions.\n  This bipartisan agreement allowed Congress to quickly pass sweeping \nlegislation to begin easing the pain of defense cutbacks and to help \nour cold war veterans beat swords into plowshares.\n  In the area of base closures, I am very pleased to report that \nsuccess stories are just beginning to arise in many communities across \nour country. I would like to highlight a few.\n  At Chase Field in Beeville, TX, 1,500 jobs have now been created \nsince the base closed in 1993. Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, NH, \nhas created 1,000 new jobs since it closed in 1991. England Air Force \nBase in Alexandria, LA, has created over 600 new jobs due in large part \nto the J.B. Hunt Trucking Co.'s decision to use the old runways to \ntrain truck drivers.\n  I might add as a personal note, Mr. President, that the J.B. Hunt \nTrucking Co., proudly, is an Arkansas-based firm.\n  Each of these communities is learning that the loss of a military \nbase can often bring opportunities for growth and renewed economic \nactivity. They worked hard to achieve these results. They deserve \ntremendous credit.\n  In each of these cases, however, our defense reinvestment programs \nare helping these communities rebound. Congressionally approved funds \nfor planning grants, worker retraining, environmental cleanup, \ninfrastructure, aviation improvements, and other necessary measures are \nhelping these towns prepare for their future and replace lost military \njobs.\n  Without this assistance, base closure communities would not be able \nto rebound and find new work. But Congress and this administration \nprovided the necessary support for our defense reinvestment programs. \nThese are good investments, and they are just now beginning to bear \nfruit in base closure communities across our country.\n  The same can be said of our technology reinvestment programs that are \nfocusing today on boosting American competitiveness in the private \nsector by integrating our military and civilian technology sectors. \nThese programs are vital to our economic security, and as a result, are \nvital to our national security. They are certainly worthy of \ncongressional support.\n  I am so deeply concerned by the recent statements by some of our \ncolleagues in Congress who are suggesting these programs are pork, that \nthey are a waste of money, and that they are in some way damaging our \nability to fight and win future wars.\n  I truly hope, Mr. President, that our 11 new colleagues in the Senate \ndo not share this view. I would like to caution my new colleagues, and \nthe Senate as a whole, against turning a cold shoulder to the men, the \nwomen, the communities, and the companies that fought and won the cold \nwar. We have only begun to see the results of our wise investments.\n  Mr. President, we are about to enter the base closing season once \nagain. When the Commission submits its final list, workers and \ncommunities in our States will suddenly be thrown into economic \ndownturn and in some cases economic despair. When this occurs, these \ndefense reinvestment programs will not appear wasteful. Rather, they \nwill be a helping hand to our communities' economic recovery efforts.\n  It is my sincere hope that this base closure round, with the pain and \neconomic trauma that it is expected to bring, will once again \nunderscore the importance of helping beat swords into plowshares.\n  Mr. President, last evening I had a visit with Senator Sam Nunn, the \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We have decided, \nMr. President, to invite Defense Secretary Bill Perry to come to \nCapitol Hill shortly following the Clinton administration's budget \nsubmission to brief any and all interested Members of the Senate on the \nimportance of funding these defense reinvestment programs. Secretary \nPerry strongly believes that these programs are worthy of our support, \nand I am proud to join with Senator Nunn in setting up this forum in \nwhich Secretary Perry can come forward and answer our questions about \nthese particular programs and why they should be supported in Congress.\n  I encourage my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to attend \nthis particular briefing, the time and place of which will be announced \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I yield the \nfloor. I see no other Senators on the floor; therefore, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during a too short ministry among us of \nMartin Luther King, Jr., he spoke very eloquently, with great insight \nand I believe with profound wisdom, on many aspects of American life. \nHe taught us about the promise of equality and about the meaning of \ncommunity and about the greatness of our human potential. But of all \nthe many things that Dr. King taught us--and we just memorialized his \nbirthday the beginning of this week--of all the things he taught us, \none in particular has held much meaning for me, particularly in recent \nmonths. And that is the standard he set for human behavior and the \nqualities he identified as being the true measure of humanity.\n  Dr. King challenged us, in his words, to ``rise above the narrow \nconfines of our individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all \nhumanity.''\n  He reminded us that one of the true standards of success is ``the \nquality of our service and relationship to humanity,'' not, as he put \nit, ``the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles.'' Dr. \nKing's standard for humankind, set by him, was a very high one. To take \nresponsibility not only for ourselves but for others as well, to take \nour guide--more as our guide a moral and rich vision of ourselves and \nthe community of man. In this way he challenged us to become the \nguardians of our most precious American legacy, and that is the promise \nthat each of us deserves: an opportunity to fulfill our potential, \nwhatever that potential may be.\n  And that is what I would like to speak to this morning, and about why \nI am concerned that this Nation, and some of our leadership, is turning \naway from that promise.\n  The richness of Martin Luther King's vision has long inspired many \nAmericans but today I find I need, and I believe our country needs, his \ninspiration even more. For today we hear increasingly from those who \nspeak of human potential, not with hope but with hopelessness; whose \nvoices do not celebrate the strength of community, but echo the fear of \ndiversity; and who would abandon the fundamental American principle of \nequal opportunity to the long discredited notions of superiority and \ninferiority.\n  Today we hear from those who confuse the lack of opportunity with the \ninability to achieve.\n  Let me say that again. I think today we are hearing from too many \npeople who confuse the lack of opportunity a person has with the \ninability of that person to achieve.\n  Today, we have a new chorus of voices whose sense of community \nextends no further than those just like themselves and who dismiss the \npotential of others who are different from themselves. Today those \nvoices are drawing support from a book called ``The Bell Curve,'' the \nnew intellectual sophistry, engaged in, as it has been over the past \ntwo centuries in this country, to justify an agenda that is abhorrent, \nin my view, to American principles.\n  This book attempts to persuade us with the language of science to \nforget about hope, to forget opportunity, to [[Page S1134]] forget the \npower of new challenges and the promise of an inspired mind; to forget, \nindeed, the very principles on which this Nation was forged. ``The Bell \nCurve'' tells us that our genes guide us toward a life of fulfillment \nor condemn us to a life of emptiness, and that we can do nothing to \nchange our destiny. This book, written by the conservative social \ncritic Charles Murray, and the late Harvard psychologist, Richard \nHerrnstein, essentially asserts three propositions. And I acknowledge \nin the brevity of time I will not do full justice to the propositions.\n  The first of those propositions asserted is that intelligence can be \ncaptured by a single quantitative measure, expressed as an IQ score. \nThat is the basic premise. That we can determine the intelligence of a \nperson by an IQ score test.\n  Second, that intelligence is genetically based and effectively \nunchangeable.\n  And third, that intelligence, more than any other factor, determines \njob performance, dependency on welfare, rates of birth and \nillegitimacy, crime, and other social behavior.\n  They are the three basic assertions in this book, among others. In \nother words, these modern day Social Darwinists posit that differences \nin what various races achieve result from genetic makeup alone, not \nfrom environmental factors, and that they cannot be changed.\n  Think about the consequences for this country if we adopt that \nproposition.\n  So the authors argue society should stop trying to help anybody who \nis not a member of their so-called intellectual or cognitive elite--\nthat is the phrase they use: the intellectual and cognitive elite.\n  The science of ``The Bell Curve,'' I believe, and I will at a later \ndate speak to this, has been widely and convincingly attacked on many \nlevels by other experts, intellectuals, psychologists, and \npsychiatrists. First, many scientists have pointed out that it is \nwidely disputed whether there is such a thing as intelligence quotient, \nIQ, a single figure that can quantify intellectual capacity, let alone \nmeasure creativity or originality or other productive talents.\n  Second, critics of ``The Bell Curve,'' the scientific critics, have \npointed to all of the existing evidence that IQ scores can be improved, \nthat they are not fixed, that they are not immutable. I ask the parents \nwho may be listening, go look at the IQ test your children took when \nthey entered first grade or second grade. Then, if they have had a good \neducation, look at the IQ test they take as they enter high school. You \nwill find a difference. It is changeable as a consequence of \nopportunity and exposure and education.\n  Indeed, even ``The Bell Curve'' authors acknowledge that improved \nnutrition--improved nutrition, not education--raises IQ: Nutrition.\n  Finally, scientists have rebutted the notion that IQ scores are a \npredictive of a life of accomplishment. They have identified ``The Bell \nCurve'' psychometrics as the latest incarnation of the discredited \npseudoscience of eugenics. Remember back in the 1920's? I remember \nstudying this when I was in undergraduate school. There was a school \nthat talked about whether or not--all you had to do was measure the \ncircumference of the skull and you could determine whether or not \nsomeone had an intellectual capacity that was inferior or superior. \nWhile these so-called researchers measured the circumference of a skull \nin a similarly perverse effort to justify racial discrimination in the \n1920's, we now have those who have a different way of doing the same \nthing. That is, just measure the IQ and you have a determinative of \neverything that is going to happen to that young child.\n  You young pages here, if we measure your IQ and you have a high IQ \nand cognitive ability--and I am sure you all do--then in fact you are \nmarked for success. If you have an average IQ or lower IQ, you are in \ntrouble according to the authors of ``The Bell Curve.''\n  But it seems to me that exposing the weakness of the authors' \nscience, which I have not done fully and I will over a period of the \nnext 6 months, while necessary, is not sufficient. It seems to me that \nDr. King taught us that what is wrong with the conclusions of the \nauthors of ``The Bell Curve'' goes far beyond the errors of their \nscholarship or the weakness of their science.\n  It seems to me that the basic premise of what we all celebrated in \nDr. King's birthday this week is that Dr. King teaches us that the view \nof humanity purveyed by those who speak the language of ``The Bell \nCurve'' is bankrupt because they ignore the very characteristics that \nDr. King knew mark the true measure of humanity.\n  The definition of human value was richer by far than mere IQ, or even \nof intelligence more broadly conceived and measured. Dr. King told us \nthat:\n\n       Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve.\n       You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't \n     have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You \n     don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.\n       You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to \n     serve. You don't have to know the second theory of \n     thermodynamics in physics to serve.\n       You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by \n     love.\n\n  Dr. King's words teach us to think more broadly of human achievement:\n  To think about those achievements that depend on generosity, on \nthoughtfulness, on sacrifice, on respect for others;\n  To think about those that depend on creativity and originality: the \nmost inspired painting, the most soothing melody, the most piercing \nwit, the most graceful dance, the most insightful social commentary, \nthe most unexpected athletic achievement.\n  In other words, we must be guided by the very things that make life \nmost worth living, when we seek to measure human achievement.\n  Is not the acknowledged reality of achievement more important than \nthe mere abstraction of I.Q., particularly when we recognize that \nstatistical abstraction--by its very nature--lends itself all too \nreadily to misconstruction in the service of narrow-minded mischief.\n  Of course, achievement built on talent, discipline and a sense of \nmoral obligation can not be weighed and measured on an arithmetical \nscale.\n  Indeed, as each generation finds new ways to outperform the last, we \nlearn how futile it is to place limits on human accomplishment, and how \nfoolish we would be to forget that our potential is as great as our \nimagination.\n  In this way, Dr. King spoke to the first fallacy of ``The Bell \nCurve''--\n\n       The notion that human intelligence, much less human worth, \n     is so narrow and pinched as to mean only what can be measured \n     by an I.Q. score.\n\n  Even more importantly, Dr. King warned us that ``intelligence is not \nenough''; rather, he said, we must strive for what he called \n``intelligence plus character.''\n  Because, as he reminded us, ``the most dangerous criminal may be the \nman gifted with reason but with no morals.''\n  King saw that intelligence divorced from morality is worth little.\n  As an undergraduate at Morehouse College, he wrote that the \nsegregationist former Georgia Governor, Eugene Talmadge,\n\n     possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America \n     * * * he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key.\n       By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically \n     and intensively; yet he contended that I am an inferior being \n     * * *.\n\n  ``What did he use all that precious knowledge for?''--King asked. \n``To accomplish what?''\n  ``To accomplish what?''\n  Thus, Dr. King spoke to the second fallacy of ``The Bell Curve.''\n\n       The notion that intelligence uninformed by morality can \n     create a worthy woman or man.\n\n  Only an immoral person, no matter how intelligent, could ever think \nit acceptable to judge another on the basis of his or her membership in \na group.\n  King taught us that no one has the right to say that another's fate \nshould be--or can be--enslaved by the color of his or her skin, or by \nthe nature of his or her religious beliefs, or by the origins of his or \nher ancestors, or by the wealth of his or her family.\n  Dr. King understood that there are real differences among \nindividuals.\n  But for him, those differences reflected the richness of the human \ncondition, they were an accepted part of the greater community of man--\nnot a [[Page S1135]] reason for division, and never an excuse for \nrelegating whole groups of people to a permanent underclass.\n  He urged each of us, whatever our talents, to accept responsibility \nfor ourselves and to strive for excellence. He said:\n\n       If it falls to your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep \n     streets like Michelangelo painted pictures, like Shakespeare \n     wrote poetry, like Beethoven composed music;\n       Sweep streets so well that all the host of heaven and earth \n     will have to pause and say, ``here lived a great street \n     sweeper, who swept his job well.\n\n  Of course, he also know what artificial barriers could do to limit \nindividual achievement.\n  He knew that the street sweeper was dealt his hand not solely by the \nconfiguration of his DNA, but was the product of a complex tangle of \nforces shaped by families, by communities, by social and economic \nsystems--and by government.\n  Dr. King's great struggle, first for civil rights and later for \neconomic justice, was itself a testament to his conviction that people \nof all races, colors, creeds, and religions deserve an equal chance to \nachieve their potential--an equal chance, a level playing field.\n  And so we come to the third fallacy of ``The Bell Curve'': that all \npeople stand today on a level playing field, free to reach their \npotential, because implicit in the book and those who are espousing its \nprinciples is that there is already a level playing field.\n\n  The reality, of course, is that we have not yet achieved a society \nwhere all people enjoy equal opportunity.\n  Instead we remain a society where too many minds are stifled by \npoverty, paralyzed by violence, stunted by poor education, starved by \npoor nutrition, and diseased by unsanitary housing.\n  We need only look around us to see how much such deprivation costs us \nas a society, and we need only listen to Martin Luther King to \nunderstand that we can not--indeed, we must not--promise anyone an easy \nway out.\n  Dr. King never promised to make it easier on anyone--he sought equal \nopportunity for all people, but he knew it was up to each individual to \nseize the challenge.\n  By assuming personal responsibility, by preparing for the hard work \nopportunity demands, by striving for excellence in every endeavor, and \nby dedicating achievement always to moral ends.\n  Martin Luther King was by no means an easy taskmaster--but he \nchallenged our society as a whole as much as he challenged each of us \nas individuals.\n  He knew--and this is the crux of his teaching--that personal \nresponsibility and the drive for excellence can develop and succeed \nonly in the context of equal opportunity.\n  Ask yourselves: if your personal achievement was limited or blocked \nby prejudice or by policy.\n  Would you push as hard as you could to get ahead? Would you be able \neven to imagine your potential achievement?\n  Maybe the people on this floor can answer yes to that question. But I \nask it another way. How many of you know people you grew up with, if \nyou did not grow up in affluent circumstances, who are still behind, \nthe exception being a person who makes it here or its comparable place \nin our society when they come from limited means? Why are there so few? \nIs it because we are so special, or is it because the human condition \nis impacted upon and one's potential is impacted upon by what is \nexpected of them and what they are exposed to?\n  When individuals are stereotyped by personal prejudice or by \nprejudicial statistics, bleak expectations become a sober reality. And \nthe natural talents we all possess in some measure rarely blossom in \nthe shadows of such a circumstance. Do not think for a moment that \n``The Bell Curve'' is merely an idle academic debate. The authors do \nnot hesitate to convert their conclusions into policy recommendations, \nand there are many today eager to act on that advice. Indeed, their \nrecommendations sound all too familiar to anyone listening to the \ncurrent debate on education, on aid to pregnant women and children, and \non efforts to respond to job discrimination, among other issues.\n  In short, ``the authors of the Bell Curve'' view all programs \ndesigned to level the playing field as doomed to fail, because \nintelligence--or more precisely, i.q.--is the only thing that matters, \nand it can not be changed, according to them.\n  Government--or private organizations, for that matter--are simply \nincapable of making a difference and shouldn't even try.\n  Now, I believe that a number of Federal programs originally intended \nto level. The playing field are in need of reform.\n  For 22 years here, I have tried to get rid of some, voted against \nothers, and am prepared to jettison still others that I thought had a \nchance but have shown not to work.\n  Some have had unintended, detrimental consequences; all would benefit \nby a sharp look at what is working and can be maintained or expanded, \nand at what is not working and should be jettisoned.\n  But that is beside the point to the authors of ``The Bell Curve,'' \nbecause their attack is aimed at the very concept that Government \nshould try to ensure equal opportunity to all our citizens. The authors \nargue that we should end, not reform, but end such efforts by \nGovernment.\n  The authors say their recommendations are intended to prevent what \nthey see as the inevitable end of the road we are on, a ``custodial'' \nstate, something like a ``high-technology Indian reservation,'' where \nthe permanent underclass is minimally fed and housed.\n  To their credit, the authors say they want to avoid this nightmare \nvision, but what they recommend is obviously insufficient on a \npractical level and entirely unacceptable on a moral one.\n  First, the authors suggest that we abandon our efforts to create the \nequality of condition among all people that our Founding Fathers \nbelieved was a self-evident human heritage.\n  Indeed, they suggest we return to ``an older intellectual \ntradition,'' unburdened by our historic American belief that ``all men \nare created equal.''\n  Instead of trying to ensure equal opportunity so that every person \nhas a fair chance of success, they say we should simply focus on \nimproving the fabric of family and community.\n  They suggest that we return a wide range of social functions to \nneighborhoods or municipalities, to improve our sense of community.\n  They propose that we should simplify Government regulations that make \nit more complicated for people to function--rules governing education, \ntaxes, Government assistance, to name a few.\n  They recommend reforming the criminal justice system to make it \nsimpler to know what is a criminal offense and what is the sanction for \nit.\n  And they suggest reemphasizing the unique legal status of marriage, \nas the only relationship with legal benefits, as well as legal \nobligations. I do not necessarily quarrel with these practical \nrecommendations; it seems to me that some of them may well be worth \npursuing.\n  What I do quarrel with--and vehemently so--is the idea that we, as a \nsociety, should give up what has been a bedrock principle of our \nNation: that all men are created equal, and thereby abandon any idea \nthat Government has a role in seeing that no one is denied an equal \nopportunity to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Government cannot manipulate people's heredity, and it should not \nattempt to do so, but I believe a moral government can--and must--\npursue policies that treat every person as a resource.\n  If low IQ's are the problem, why not try to raise them, through \nbetter nutrition, which the authors of ``The Bell Curve'' acknowledge \ndoes make a difference?\n  If the fabric of families is torn, why not focus on programs that \nenable them to mend themselves--\n  Programs that keep children from going hungry, that help young people \nget off and stay off drugs;\n  That keep the streets safe so local businesses can flourish and \nfamilies can get to and from work and school;\n  Programs that help new factories open and train and retrain our \nworkers for new jobs.\n  As we consider this challenge, we should remember what Martin Luther \nKing never forgot--that opportunity is not a substitute for personal \nresponsibility.\n[[Page S1136]]\n  New ideas are being proposed that build on the twin pillars of \nopportunity and responsibility, and new programs are being tested in \ncommunities across the Nation, such as housing and transportation \nprograms that help minorities move out of ghettos and buy their own \nhomes.\n  If the positive effects of Head Start fade out several years after \nchildren leave the program, why eliminate Head Start rather than \nimprove the rest of the education system to extend its success?\n  If answers tried in the past have failed, it means we should try new \nanswers, not give up on the problem. As a government--and as a \nsociety--our policies must have a moral dimension:\n  They must respect the value of each individual, and never dismiss \nanyone or any group of people as unworthy of a fair chance.\n  Shredding the social safety net will not avert a crisis; in my view, \nit only propels us ever faster toward crisis.\n  It will swell the divisions between rich and poor; it will lead to \nmore racial animosity and ethnic hatred; it will sacrifice the dream--\nthe very American dream of Martin Luther King, who foresaw a day when \nhis four children would, in his words,\n\n       Live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color \n     of their skin, but by the content of their character.\n\n  He spoke of a ``beloved community,'' his vision of an America living \nin racial harmony, where individuals judge each other on individual \nmerit and achievement; where values triumph over charts, graphs, and \nstereotypes; where all people are nourished and expected to succeed.\n  This is a vision of a moral society--the kind of society our \nforefathers saw as their bequest to the Nation--and it stands in stark \ncontrast to the custodial state envisioned in ``The Bell Curve.''\n  Fulfilling Dr. King's vision of a beloved community, founded on both \nindividual responsibility and equal opportunity--a community that \nrewards achievement and places barriers before no one--has always been \nand remains today the foremost challenge for American society.\n  Martin Luther King understood that better, perhaps, than any other \nAmerican of this century, and we can offer him no greater memorial \ntoday--we can offer ourselves no greater assurance of maintaining our \nAmerican heritage--than by rejecting both the arguments and the \nconclusions of ``The Bell Curve'' in favor of that ``beloved \ncommunity'' for which Martin Luther King, Jr., lived and died.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

THE VOTERS SAID ``YES''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. \nConstitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax \nmoney that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress, \nboth the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n  So when you hear a politician or an editor or a commentator declare \nthat ``Reagan ran up the Federal debt'' or that ``Bush ran it up,'' \nbear in mind that it was, and is, the constitutional duty of Congress \nto control Federal spending. We'd better get busy correcting this \nbecause Congress has failed miserably to do it for about 50 years.\n  The fiscal irresponsibility of Congress has created a Federal debt \nwhich stood at $4,806,933,452,098.25 as of the close of business \nWednesday, January 10. Averaged out, every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica owes a share of this massive debt, and that per capita share is \n$18,247.20.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1136-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1136-S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MARIO CUOMO AND COMMON SENSE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the wail and cry around Washington today \nis similar to what we heard 14 years ago when President Reagan came to \ntown--get rid of the Government, downsize, the Government is the enemy. \nToday, like 14 years ago, the game to blame Government sounds good to \nmany voters across the land. But look at the reality that has been \ninflicted on our country by 12 years of Republican rule--a deficit that \nis exploding and a debt that has more than quadrupled. The return of \nthis feel-good kind of blaming in Washington is what Mario Cuomo \nrelated in his last official talk as Governor of New York. As he told \nreporters at the National Press Club on December 17, 1994, the game \nbeing played is ``deja voodoo'' and return to ``plastic populism.''\n  Government is not an evil that the Founding Fathers thrust upon the \npeople. Government in its best form is a means to provide economic \nopportunity, create jobs, and rebuild our American standard of living. \nIt is time for all of us to work together to rebuild America, instead \nof only harping, squawking, and howling at the Moon.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read and study this talk by \nGovernor Cuomo. He speaks commonsense truths that are rooted in \nreality. As he says, we need a cure for our problems not a simple \nreaffirmation of the disease. We have to fix what is broken, but not \nbreak what works. To that end, I ask unanimous consent that his talk be \nreported in its entirety in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the talk was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Remarks of Gov. Mario Cuomo at the National Press Club, December 16, \n                                  1994\n\n       Governor Cuomo. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. \n     There are a lot of things I wanted to say immediately, just \n     in quick response to Gil Klein's introduction. I--the truth \n     about 1992 was that Klein, or somebody like him, just before \n     that plane took off, over the wire came a story in which I \n     was referred to as a consummate liberal. And that did it. I \n     decided to stay behind in New York State. (Laughter.)\n       And I must say this--although I was going to say nothing at \n     all, because I don't want to use the 25 minutes they gave \n     me--there's a lot I do want to tell you. I did note with some \n     interest that the two biggest laughs from this rather \n     difficult looking groups were for the postmaster general and \n     Dan Quayle. (Laughter.)\n       I am going to do something unusual now in this, what \n     appears I think to be the last time I'll be able to speak as \n     a public official, because nothing is going to happen over \n     the [[Page S1137]] next couple of weeks--and that didn't \n     strike me until I sat down and started making some notes. But \n     maybe especially because it is the last opportunity--there is \n     a whole lot I want to get in. And because of that I'll stay \n     close to my notes, closer than I usually do--and I'll rush a \n     bit, if you don't mind, because I want you to have time to do \n     the questions and answers. You know by now that I was elected \n     a private citizen--(laughter)--effective January 1st.\n       It wasn't my first choice. Abraham Lincoln's familiar line \n     in a similar situation, which I think the President used the \n     other day, comes to mind. He said he felt like a young boy \n     who has just stubbed his toe; it hurt too much to laugh, but \n     he was too old to cry. The temptation, you should know, is to \n     whine, you know--(laughter)--at least a bit--Why not?--you \n     served 12 years, you're entitled. And I caught myself doing \n     that.\n       I began pointing out to people that even since the \n     Republican landside on November 8th, it's been getting dark \n     outside a little earlier every day. (Laughter.) You notice \n     that? (Laughter. Applause.) The whining is not what we need. \n     So let me talk to you about some of the things I learned on \n     the way back to private life, and there's a lot. Let's talk \n     just a bit about America and how together we can make her \n     stronger and sweeter. Founded by the most optimistic people \n     in history, in just 200 years, as we all know, would become \n     the most dominant military and economic machine, and the \n     greatest engine of opportunity that the world has ever seen.\n       But recently, say, within the last 15 years, we have made \n     some terrible mistakes as well. We produced two devastating \n     recessions that stripped from millions of our middle--class \n     families the basic promise of the American dream, and even \n     the simple security of steady work; mistakes that for \n     millions more have produced lives of sheer desperation, \n     dependence, and despair.\n       Government did not create all these all these problems, but \n     government didn't solve them either. And the people know \n     that. Many of them are frightened, resentful, even angry. The \n     conservative Republicans measured that seething unhappiness \n     with polls, then designed some painless home remedies which \n     they strung together in a new political agenda that they call \n     now the ``Contract With America.'' And tell us it will solve \n     our problems. I don't think so.\n       Some of the agenda puts the spotlight on relevant issues--\n     at least for the moment. But the truth is, the contract fails \n     to deal substantially with the fundamental problems we face. \n     It's not a plan--it's an echo of selected polls. It adds \n     nothing to the opinion surveys. It makes absolutely no demand \n     on our political leadership, other than that they set sail in \n     whatever direction the political winds appear to be blowing \n     at the moment.\n       It offers a kind of plastic populism, epitomized by its \n     bold promise of a balanced budget that will bend--or probably \n     break--when tested with the full weight of our real problems. \n     We need something much sturdier. We need an agenda that deals \n     with our real problems--all of them, especially the toughest \n     ones--and proposes real, concrete solutions, even if they are \n     politically inconvenient. The truth is--and I think we all \n     know this, too: America is faced with a double-barreled \n     challenge to our future. The most significant is an economy \n     that is rewarding investors for sure, but at the same time \n     threatening our workers.\n       You tell a $30,000-a-year factory worker in Georgia or \n     California that this is a growing economy, this third-wave \n     economy, and see what reaction you get. The second challenge \n     is the frightening cultural corruption of drugs, degradation, \n     violence, and children having children, that's deteriorating \n     our cities, crippling much of our potential work force, and \n     alienating many of us from one another. And it is cultural. \n     It is a cultural problem.\n       But the conservative Republican contract deals only \n     superficially with our economic challenge, and offers us \n     little more than castigation and negativism with respect to \n     our cultural weakness.\n       Now, Democrats should show America that we can do better. \n     We should start by reaffirming our fundamental democratic \n     principles, beginning with the confidence that this country \n     can provide opportunity for everyone willing to earn it. And \n     the first mistake would be to give up on that aspiration, to \n     believe that somehow we are not as strong as we thought we \n     were--we can't do it--take up the gangplank!--we can't afford \n     them: That would be a mistake, an excuse if not a mistake, a \n     cynical excuse for not making the tough decisions that will \n     make it possible for us to realize what is obvious, enormous \n     potential strength still unused.\n       Our strong suit as Democrats has always been our concern \n     for the vast majority of Americans who must work for a \n     living--that's where we come from. That means we are \n     committed to creating good jobs in a strong free-enterprise \n     system, and to making sure that every working family in this \n     country can earn enough to live with a reasonable degree of \n     security and comfort. We believe that as part of the \n     Democratic bargain every American has responsibilities.\n       Everyone who can work should work, instead of expecting \n     others to pay their way. Businesses that thrive should share \n     the rewards with their workers fairly--business has a \n     responsibility as well. And government should help create \n     jobs, not discourage them; nor should it burden the rewards \n     of work with unreasonable heavy taxes.\n       Now, we believe in law and order. I have built more prison \n     cells than all of the governors in history of New York State \n     before me put together. But we will insist on fairness, and \n     privacy, and civil rights. We agree with Lincoln that we \n     should have only the government we need. But we agree with \n     Lincoln, as well, that we must have all the government we \n     need. We must have all the government we need.\n       And so a balanced budget that fails to meet the basic needs \n     of the struggling middle class or the desperate poor would be \n     an emblem of failure. We believe in the common sense value of \n     sticks, but we also believe in the common sense power of \n     carrots. We believe that prevention is always a good idea, \n     and almost always cheaper.\n       We'd rather preserve a family than build an orphanage. We \n     believe that we're too good as a people to seek solutions by \n     hurting the weakest among us--especially our children. And at \n     our wisest--at our wisest, and it's not always true. It is \n     probably not true at this moment. But at our wisest, we \n     believe that we are all in this together, that Jeremiah was \n     right, thousands of years ago, that we will find our own good \n     in the good of the whole community.\n       Now, this is not the time or the place to give all the \n     details of what we can and must do to deal with the \n     challenges and opportunities, while living up to these \n     principles. But we should reflect on enough of them, and I \n     have the responsibility to give you at least enough of them \n     so that you can see that the agenda offered by the Contract \n     is obviously incomplete, and utterly inadequate to this \n     moment in American history. Most of all, we need to generate \n     more jobs.\n       We'll accept that--jobs that pay a living wage and make \n     hope a possibility, and a global economy, where labor often \n     costs less in other places in the world--and that's the key. \n     This is a complex challenge. But the Republicans would have \n     us believe that the solution is remarkably simple.\n       Now, do you know how hard it is? Taiwan and that part of \n     the world, in China, Mexico--they can make things a lot \n     cheaper than you can. That puts an enormous pressure on your \n     manufacturing. How do the Republicans deal with this problem? \n     That's why the $30,000 a year factory worker is scared to \n     death. He knows it. He knows the investors are getting \n     richer, and everybody is downsizing here, and the competition \n     is enormous all over the world--a competition that I grew up \n     without having to face.\n       Well, their proposal--the Republican proposal is right out \n     of the permanent conservative Republican playbook. Cut the \n     tax on capital gains, boost the defense budget, amend the \n     Constitution to enforce a balanced budget. But let's not get \n     bogged down in the awkward details about what we'd actually \n     have to cut. Cut the taxes, boost the defense budget, and \n     then provide a balanced budget. Does it sound familiar to \n     you? Do you remember hearing that before? Cut your income, \n     raise your expenses, and promise the bank that, this time, \n     you're sure you can make ends meet. Does it sound familiar? \n     It's nothing more than deja voodoo. (Laughter.)\n       In the early '80s--in the early '80s, the conservative \n     Republicans promised huge tax cuts, a huge military, and a \n     balanced budget--and we wound up, as we all know, with a deep \n     recession and $4 trillion more in debt. Now, why is it \n     different now? Why would it work any differently now? Has \n     something changed? Has there been some kind of cosmic \n     alteration? Only the language has changed.\n       In the '80s, they talked about the magic of supply side. \n     Now, they have thought up a new way to count. It's called \n     dynamic scoring. Do you know what dynamic scoring means? It \n     means that, for every basket they put in the whole, they get \n     ten points. That's dynamic scoring. And it would be wonderful \n     if it were as easy as that--free up the wealth in the hands \n     of the wealthy, and it will eventually take care of all of \n     us. Now, this country tries that every so often. We tried it \n     in the '80s--the early '80s.\n       But then the truth re-emerges. Life is more complicated and \n     harder. It includes bothersome details, like a national \n     deficit, leashed in by President Clinton, but ready to run \n     wild at the least relaxation or provocation. Life includes \n     popular entitlement programs that won't be around for our \n     children at all, if we cannot bring ourselves to make \n     intelligent, but different sacrifices now. Everybody in this \n     room knows it. In every conversation in Washington or New \n     York or the capitals of the country, where people know what \n     they're talking about, they all say the same thing. ``You \n     must do something about Social Security.'' We all know that. \n     ``You must deal with Medicare.'' You can't deal with our \n     deficit problem without doing something about Social Security \n     and Medicare.\n       However, it's political poison, so we won't do it. But \n     didn't you just tell me that, if we don't do something about \n     it, we're in terrible trouble? Yes. And then you tell me that \n     it's going to be very difficult to deal with it politically. \n     Yes. And what do you prescribe then? Keep yourself alive \n     politically, and let the country die. Am I exaggerating? Do \n     you hear it differently? You write about it. You write about \n     it glibly. Everybody comments on it--most of the time, \n     snidely. But nobody changes it. Warren Rudman leaves. Paul \n     Tsongas creates a group. Peter Peterson writes books.\n       Everybody is saying the same thing, and all the people who \n     are bright, saying they're right, and admitting--at the same \n     time--we do not have the will to change it. Why don't \n     [[Page S1138]] you at least say this to the American people. \n     Why don't you say, ``Look, let's get this clear, because I \n     have the obligation to tell the truth.'' Who knows? Maybe \n     there is a heaven. Worse than that, maybe there's a hell. \n     (Laughter.)\n       Maybe I'm going to be accountable. Maybe I'd better tell \n     you the truth. So, I'm going to take a chance.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, all the tax cuts in the world won't \n     wave you. They're popular, but we need a double bypass--and \n     we're talking about giving you cosmetic surgery. And the \n     reason we're doing that is, it's too tough to give you a \n     bypass. We have to cut with a knife. That's very expensive. \n     It's very costly. It's unpleasant for you. We have to do \n     Social Security. We have to do Medicare. You have to apply a \n     needs test of some kind. Everybody knows it.\n       Now, why, therefore, don't the Republicans tell you that? \n     Well, because they're into popularity. Why don't we tell you \n     that? Because we're into popularity, too. (Laughter.) But \n     we're going to say this to you. As long as the Republicans \n     are in power in the Congress, and as long as it's absolutely \n     clear that they will have a Pavlovian response to whatever \n     you tell them in the polls, start telling them in the polls \n     that you've finally awakened. You know they have to do \n     something about Social Security and Medicare. Please do \n     Social Security and Medicare. They will write a new Contract \n     with America, addendum to the Contract with America. We've \n     seen the latest poll. It just came in over the Internet. \n     Okay. You can have Social Security. (Laughter/Applause.)\n       There's another--there is another inconvenient truth, and \n     that is that you have to make investments if you want to get \n     returns. The Republicans especially should know that. And \n     that means, if we want to be the high tech capital of the \n     world--which you have to be, because if you're going to \n     compete with cheap labor, how are you going to do it? You're \n     going to have to make things with exquisite high tech \n     capacity and superb productivity so that you can make things \n     better and faster and different from the things that they can \n     make--even with cheaper labor.\n       How else do you do it? The only other way is to expand a \n     whole other thing beyond manufacturing, make exquisite \n     improvements in services. We're doing that. We're the service \n     capital of the world already--and we will stay that way for a \n     long time, especially as long as New York stays strong, \n     because you have banking, investment banking, and a lot of \n     that there, publishing, et cetera. We're doing fine with \n     services. On the manufacturing side, you can't do it without \n     high tech. You have to do what we're doing in New York \n     State--make a unique lens that we just sold to the Japanese. \n     And when I complained to the University of Rochester about \n     selling a unique lens to the Japanese, who are so good at \n     replicating our products and getting--and producing something \n     cheaper, they said, ``Don't worry about it. We're working on \n     a second lens.'' (Laughter.)\n       Making a new mammography machine on Long Island through \n     high tech--a mammography machine that solves the problem that \n     the woman has with the old machine, where she has to press \n     herself up against this plate, where there's constriction, \n     discomfort, and a poor picture. This one inclines. Bennett X-\n     ray. You incline and gravity does the work. And there's a \n     full picture. And my daughter, the radiologist loves it. And \n     the woman is pleased by it. And the physician who has to \n     operate feels better about it because he has a better \n     picture. And we sell it to the Germans that make surgical \n     instruments. And when I say to Bennett X-ray, ``I created a \n     center of high technology. Now you take this wonderful \n     product. You send it to the Germans. How long before they \n     replicate it?'' He says, ``Five months.'' I said, ``Well, \n     what are we going to do about that?'' He said, ``Don't worry \n     about it, Governor. We're working on digitalizing it. We're \n     taking the digital engineers from Grumman who have gone down, \n     because they're no longer making planes. They're coming here. \n     They're working on our mammography machine.'' You have to \n     stay one step ahead of them in high tech.\n       That's the way you became great the first time around. You \n     used to make all the things of value in this world. You were \n     the makers and the sellers, the creditors and the bankers. \n     That's how we became dominant. You can't get out of that \n     business now because you're in a global economy. You have to \n     make things. That means high tech. That means research. That \n     means investment, investment, investment. And someone has to \n     pay for it. There are plenty of good way of making our \n     workers better equipped, too. And you can't do that.\n       You can't leave that factory worker where he is now, or she \n     is now, at $30,000, and say, ``Look, in this high tech world \n     where we have to be smarter and slicker than they are, I'm \n     afraid you're going to fall behind because you don't have the \n     training.'' The GI Bill is a good idea for workers. Training \n     vouchers is a good idea. Head Start is absolutely \n     essential--learning technologies.\n       Is there any way you can explain how every kid in the \n     United States of America doesn't have the opportunity to \n     learn at a computer? How do you explain that to yourself? The \n     richest place in world history, with all the tremendous \n     wealth you have. How do you explain to yourself that there \n     are kids who never see a computer--in my state, where people \n     have Porsches parked or BMWs parked next to Jaguars? How do \n     you explain it, when you're selling the airwaves for billions \n     of dollars that you didn't even expect to have? Vice \n     President Al Gore is right. Let's take some of that money and \n     invest it in learning technologies.\n       Tax cut--hell of an idea. Learning technologies--an even \n     better idea. Make your children the smartest in the world. \n     Everybody knows that that's the avenue to the future. You \n     write tracts about it. Kids write essays about it in the 8th \n     grade.\n       But we're not doing it. That's the real world. It means \n     investing, then capitalize, on the most extensive higher \n     education system in the world. Promoting its strength and \n     research, and making sure that it does not--that it becomes \n     accessible to everybody. It means infrastructure. There is no \n     money for infrastructure. Have you heard any Republican step \n     forward and say, ``And another thing we're going to do is \n     we're going to build the infrastructure.'' Why? \n     Infrastructure is an arcane word. You get no political points \n     for infrastructure.\n       I wish I could think of some sexy way to say roads, \n     bridges, telecommunication, fiber optics. Infrastructure. \n     Forty percent of the roads and bridges are in trouble. \n     Overseas, they spent $6 billion, Maglev, they're way ahead of \n     you. You cannot succeed economically unless you invest in \n     infrastructure. Where are you going to get the money? They \n     didn't even mention it. How could you not mention it? Is \n     there anybody alive with any brains at all who knows anything \n     about the economy who would not say to you that, ``Of course, \n     we must invest more in the infrastructure.'' Or do they get \n     challenged?\n       Does the public rise up after they have heard somebody on \n     television say, ``Well, I'll never vote for you. You never \n     even mentioned--what was that--infrastructure.'' \n     Infrastructure. (Laughter.)\n       Those conservative Republicans cannot deny that all of \n     these investments are essential. They simply ignore them \n     because they're politically difficult truths, and because the \n     polls don't give you points for arcane things like \n     infrastructure. They know America needs a double bypass. And \n     they know they're only suggesting cosmetic surgery. But as \n     long as its popular, that's what they're going to give you.\n       Now, massive tax cuts of any kind would surely ring the \n     popularity bell. But would you insist on them, if it meant \n     that local tax rates would explode across the country--which \n     they could, if you cut back programs that the states are \n     going to have to pay for instead. Would they insist on tax \n     cuts if they knew that bridges would collapse, that the \n     deficit might go up again, that you were failing to meet your \n     educational needs? And if we can afford to lower taxes, would \n     you give 70 percent of the immediate benefits to people who \n     make $100,000 a year, or would you give 70 percent of the \n     immediate benefits to the ordinary families across America?\n       And as long as you Republicans are so quick to point out \n     that the people have spoken--who told you? The poll. Why \n     don't you take a poll on it. Mr. and Mrs. America, we're \n     going to give you a tax cut. What do you want? A tax cut the \n     immediate benefit of which goes to--70 percent of which goes \n     to the people above 100,000, or one that goes to people under \n     100,000? What do you think the poll would say? How about this \n     one. Mr. and Mrs. America, would you like to shorten the \n     congressional session and cut everybody's salary in half--\n     senators and congressmen? What do you think they'd say? \n     (Laughter.)\n       Last time I looked, it was 82 percent said yes. I didn't \n     see a single Republican hold up, ``The people have spoken.'' \n     (Laughter.)\n       Of course, Democrats respect and believe in the efficiency \n     of capitalism. A capital gains tax cut, in some \n     circumstances, could be a very, very good thing. \n     Deregulation--a very, very good thing. I did a lot of it in \n     my own state. But if our system works only for investors and \n     leaves millions of our people without the skills or \n     opportunity to do more than tread water against the tide, our \n     system fails. Now, if they're silent on these important \n     things, what are they loudest on? Now, I'm really going to \n     have to rush--and it's a shame.\n       Welfare. Why? Because it's popular. Don't you see what's \n     happened? They've turned the middle class against the crowd \n     beneath them. In the depression, you know, when everybody was \n     angry, in 1932, whom did they blame? They blamed the power. \n     The people who made it happen.\n       The bankers. The government. Everybody turned on the \n     government--and they were right. And what's happened this \n     time? Now they've turned the middle class downward. Instead \n     of looking up at the people with the wealth, they're looking \n     down at the people who are the victims. And who are you \n     blaming?\n       The immigrants. That's easy. They have no political power, \n     really, to speak of. Forget the fact that everybody here is \n     an immigrant and that we all started by killing the only real \n     entitled people to the place--the Native Americans. We \n     butchered them. We savaged them. Everybody else is an \n     intruder by your popular current definition. Forget that, \n     because I'm lucky to be here now. It's the immigrants who are \n     our problem. It's that baby who's making a baby. Forget about \n     the fact that you allowed her, at the age of two, to be a \n     toddler in streets surrounded by pimps and prostitutes and \n     every kind of disorientation, that you allowed her to be \n     seduced by somebody with a crack pipe when she was only nine \n     years old.\n       Forget about that, that you allowed that society, that you \n     allowed it to happen. She's the problem. Punish her. Punish \n     the mother. [[Page S1139]] No benefits for that child. Stick \n     the child in an orphanage. You really think that's the \n     answer? I don't.\n       In New York State we have problems, but we have answers, \n     too, and they're not orphanages. We can show you ways to \n     bring down teenage pregnancy dramatically, and we have with \n     the new Avenues to Dignity program in New York. That's not as \n     popular as draconian devices, like what they want to do with \n     welfare or the death penalty. In the end, behind nearly every \n     one of the Republican proposals lurks the same harshness \n     and negativity. And I think we need better from our \n     leaders than to have them distill our worst instincts and \n     then bottle the bitter juices and offer them back to us as \n     a magic elixir.\n       We need a cure, not a reaffirmation of our distress. We \n     must understand that our great social problems are not \n     visited upon us like earthquakes and floods. They are \n     uniformly avoidable disasters. And with intelligent and \n     timely action, we can prevent them before they pull our \n     children down. Punishment has its place, of course. But \n     prevention requires more than fear. In New York, the movement \n     toward prevention is the strongest element in our approach to \n     health care.\n       Incidentally, that's what reforming health care should be \n     all about, prevention. The reason you need to cover those 39 \n     million people is not compassion. It's not that they're not \n     getting health care. They are getting health care. In my \n     state, everybody gets health care, even the people without \n     insurance. They fall down in the street and they're taken to \n     the emergency room. Or they come with a terrible pain in \n     their belly that would have been nothing if they had been \n     insured and been to a doctor early, but now is acute. And we \n     take care of them. What would we do, let them die? ``You have \n     no Medicaid. You have no insurance. Lay here and die.'' Of \n     course not. We operate. You can find in the hospitals of New \n     York City women and men on machines being kept alive for \n     nobody knows how long except God, without any insurance, \n     without any name, and we take care of them. You can't afford \n     that.\n       Health care costs are going through the roof everywhere \n     except in New York State. And they're high there, but we're \n     the lowest-growing in the United States of America. That \n     surprises a lot of people.\n       You have to do something about those 39 million people. And \n     if Congress closed its eyes because it couldn't find a proper \n     solution last time, you can't simply say, ``This is too \n     difficult; leave the problem there.'' You will go bankrupt. \n     Really? Of course. You all know that. It's not just Ira \n     Magaziner. You can't make it go away by saying, ``Well, it \n     was very unpopular.'' So do something else. Do something like \n     what we're doing in New York. At least let the children of \n     working people get insurance, get them into plans. We \n     subsidize them to get them into plans. Why? Prevention. If \n     you can vaccinate them, it's cheaper than trying to deal with \n     their disease; so, too, with drugs. What is the answer to \n     drugs? Look, you can build all the prisons you want.\n       You can contrive all the draconian punishments you want. \n     You can say what the Republicans say, that more police, more \n     prisons, more executions and reversing the ban on assault \n     weapons will take care of the drugs and take care of the \n     crime. It won't. Forget all about the complicated talk. \n     Imagine this. Imagine a village. Imagine a village where the \n     young people are drinking at a poisoned lake. And it makes \n     them mad, and they come in every night to the village and \n     they commit mayhem. And they rape and they kill and you \n     arrest more and more of them and you stick them into jails in \n     the village, and the jails are getting bigger and bigger and \n     you have more and more village police and the villagers are \n     complaining because they can't afford it.\n       And the generation of criminals keeps pouring out of the \n     hills, having come from the poison lake. Wouldn't somebody \n     with some brains say, ``For God's sakes, let's dry up the \n     lake; let's find another source of water''? Of course you \n     would. But why aren't you doing it here? Why doesn't it \n     occur to you that unless you stop the generation of these \n     drug-ridden people who become criminals and then violent \n     criminals--your biggest problem now in terms of crime: \n     children with guns. You're not going to get at that. Take \n     it from me.\n       I told you, I've built more prison cells than all the \n     governors in history before me put together, and it's not \n     going to work. Ask any policeman. Fifteen years ago they \n     would have told you something else. You have cultural \n     problems. I'm going to have to end it now, and it really is a \n     shame because I'm leaving out a lot of the good stuff. \n     (Laughter.)\n       I really am. But let me leave with maybe the largest point, \n     and maybe the largest point that I have learned in public \n     life, and it's something that I kind of intuited before I was \n     in public life. It's something I spoke about in my first \n     speech before I ever even ran, and this was up in Buffalo in \n     1973 and I was talking about mama and papa and what was \n     important about mama and papa and what they taught me, these \n     two illiterate people, what they taught me by their example.\n       And what they taught me, basically--and then a Vincencian \n     priest, you know, added to it, and then good books, you know, \n     taught you most of all, that you're going to spend your whole \n     life learning things and experiencing things, most of all \n     disappointment and occasionally moments of joy. But in the \n     end, you've got to find some raison d'etre. You have to find \n     some reason for living. You have to find something to believe \n     in. And for it to work, it has to be larger than you, that \n     you will discover that you are not enough to satisfy \n     yourself. Now, you might get to be 70 years old before you \n     figure it out, but sooner or later you'll figure it out, that \n     you must have something larger than yourself to hold on to.\n       Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, Bobby Kennedy, Martin \n     Luther King, Jr.; some great cause, some great purpose? The \n     Second World War did that. I remember a little bit of that. \n     The Second World War was a horrid thing, but it unified \n     everybody in America. They were evil; we were good. They were \n     Satan; we were doing God's work. And everybody got together--\n     the men, the women, the blacks, everybody; forget about poor, \n     forget about middle class, forget about everything else.\n       There's a grander purpose here. There's a greater truth \n     here, something we can give ourselves to, and we'll fight \n     like hell. And we did. We haven't had anything like that \n     since, and you don't have it now.\n       You're turning those white factory workers all over the \n     country against people of color. You're turning them against \n     the immigrants. They're blaming them. And I understand why \n     they're blaming them. their life is vulnerable. They say, \n     ``You're doing nothing for me, everything for them.'' That's \n     the truth of it. You know it. We all talk about it. We don't \n     all write about it that clearly, but you know that the \n     society is being fragmented.\n       It used to be the middle class against the rich, but now \n     somehow, I think with a little encouragement from some of the \n     politicians, you have turned the middle class to look \n     downward instead of up. And they're now pitted against the \n     poorest. So here are the least powerful people in your \n     society, the least fortunate, squabbling with one another.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, unless we find a way to put this \n     whole place together, unless we find a way to see that your \n     interest depends upon your seeing the child in South Jamaica, \n     that Latina, that little Hispanic girl who just had a baby, \n     that little black girl who just had a baby, as your child, or \n     unless you see that factory worker in Georgia as your father \n     about to lose his job, unless you understand that it's not as \n     a matter of love, not even at Christmas and Hanukkah time; I \n     wouldn't ask that of anybody in a political context. It's too \n     much to use the word compassion. Forget that. You'll lose.\n       As a matter of common sense, you cannot afford the loss of \n     productivity. You cannot afford the cost of drug addiction. \n     You cannot afford it. We will not make it in this country \n     unless we invest in dealing with those problems. And to deal \n     with those problems, you have to give them other avenues to \n     dignity instead of streets of despair. You will not frighten \n     them into being good. You will not punish them into stopping \n     drugs. You have to teach them. How to teach them?\n       Have a crusade; not just a rhetorical crusade, a real \n     crusade. Invest in it. How would you teach children not to \n     have sex too soon, to treat it as a great gift, not to be \n     violent, not to take the drugs? How would you teach them? How \n     do you teach anybody? Well, at home; their family is broken. \n     In school; the teacher is too busy. In the church, the \n     temple, the mosque; if they went there, it wouldn't be a \n     problem. How do you teach them? Let the government teach them \n     with laws. There's a role there, yes.\n       What's the best teaching instrument you have? Television. \n     Yes, that's right. Why don't we teach them every night on \n     prime time? Well, we have Partnership for a Drug-Free \n     America. Once every week or two weeks they'll see those great \n     commercials by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. You \n     read the New York Times this week. Drug use is up with \n     teenagers. Why? Part of the reason, Partnership for a Drug-\n     Free America isn't being seen enough. How do you explain that \n     to yourself? You know it works.\n       You know the best thing you can do is teach the children \n     not to take the drugs. The best way to teach them is \n     television. Why aren't you on prime time? How can you settle \n     for once a week or once every two weeks? If you were a mother \n     of a child in South Jamaica, my neighborhood, and you knew \n     that they were out there, going to tempt her with a crack \n     pipe, and you had to go to work, would you settle for a \n     stick-it note on the refrigerator once a week saying, ``Hey, \n     dear, if they come at you with a pipe, make sure you don't \n     take it. See you tonight. Mother.'' Would you settle for \n     that?\n       We're settling for it as a society. You want to talk about \n     tax cuts? You want to talk about all these nice things? Talk \n     about the real problems. Talk about how to invest in your \n     economy, how to create jobs, how to invest in a real crusade \n     that would have to--put up some money. Buy some time. Sit \n     down with Tisch at NBC and all the others. Say, ``We'll put \n     up 5 million bucks. We want you to do the same.'' Let's \n     saturate the place. Let's have billboards. Let the National \n     Press Club write about it. Let all the community groups talk \n     about it. Let's go at this problem for real because it's \n     killing them and it's killing us.\n       Look, I lost an election. I've lost more than one, but I've \n     learned a whole lot on the way, and I haven't forgotten any \n     of it. And I'm telling you that I am absolutely certain we \n     are not being honest about our problems. And the person who \n     stands up and is honest with America and reminds America that \n     [[Page S1140]] they're now in charge--politicians used to \n     think of themselves as shepherds. That's all over now.\n       Now the politicians are following the sheep. Read the \n     polls. They'll tell you where they should go to pasture. And \n     as long as you know that, you had better send the right \n     signals to your government, because if you tell them you want \n     the death penalty, you'll get it. If you tell them you want \n     tax cuts, you'll get it. If you tell them to take up the \n     gangplank, you'll get it. If you tell them to ignore sick \n     people, you'll get it. If you tell them to ignore the poor, \n     you'll get it. If you tell them to victimize young children, \n     you'll get it.\n       Be careful what you ask for, because they're listening for \n     you. And ask for the right things. Ask for the truth. Ask for \n     the real solutions to the real problems. I learned that. I \n     won't forget it. Thank you for your patience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1136-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THE \n                             104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to curb the practice of imposing unfunded \n     Federal mandates on States and local governments; to \n     strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and \n     State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, \n     in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal \n     mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \n     adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the \n     Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those \n     governments in complying with certain requirements under \n     Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Committee amendment No. 11, beginning on page 25, line 11, \n     pertaining to committee jurisdiction.\n       Gorton amendment No. 31 (to committee amendment No. 11) to \n     prohibit the approval of certification of certain national \n     history standards proposed by the National Center for History \n     in Schools.\n       Levin/Kempthorne/Glenn amendment No. 143, to provide for \n     the infeasibility of the Congressional Budget Office making a \n     cost estimate for Federal intergovernmental mandates.\n       Bumpers amendment No. 144 (to amendment No. 31) to \n     authorize collection of certain State and local taxes with \n     respect to the sale, delivery and use of tangible personal \n     property.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there shall now be \n30 minutes for debate to be equally divided between the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Kempthorne] and the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd].\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield time to the assistant majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nfor yielding this time to me. I want to again commend him for the work \nhe has been doing on this very important piece of legislation and for \nthe patience and diligence he has exhibited over the past several days \nas we have crawled toward final passage of this unfunded mandates \nlegislation.\n  We have now spent 5 very full days discussing procedures and \nunrelated matters on this very important legislation. That is the way \nthe Senate works. It is a very deliberative body, and that is the way \nit has been historically.\n  I do want to urge my colleagues this morning to allow us to move \nforward, to debate seriously this very important legislation and to \nstart dealing with germane amendments--amendments [[Page S1141]] that \nreally do relate to the substance of this bill.\n  A lot of charges have been made that this legislation was being moved \ntoo quickly. This obviously is not the case. The distinguished majority \nleader has exercised a lot of patience and has allowed all the time \nthat Members could possibly want to bring up amendments, even unrelated \namendments, and debate them at great length. We have spent 5 entire \ndays, and, yet, we are only beginning to discuss the serious parts of \nthe pending bill. This pace certainly could not be considered rushing \nthe bill through to judgment.\n  Further, this legislation is not a new concept. Senator Kempthorne, \nSenator Roth, Senator Glenn, and others, have been working on this \nlegislation for 2 years. Senator Kempthorne has personally worked with \nour Nation's Governors, mayors, and local legislators, as well as the \nWhite House, to craft a bill that would accommodate all concerns. So \nthe document before us represents a carefully drafted and extensively \nresearched and debated piece of legislation.\n  It has been charged that we did not have a report on time when it was \nbrought to the floor. But now the reports are available. Members have \nhad time to study these reports: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, \nMonday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So certainly there has been time now to \nread and reread the reports and to study the bill.\n  I think it is time we begin to move forward toward final passage of \nthis very important legislation.\n  I hope that there will be a vote in support of the cloture motion \ntoday so we can get to the consideration of germane amendments. Members \nwould not be prohibited from offering the amendments they have filed. \nThere will be plenty of time for extended debate on those amendments, \nand then we could get to the point where we can finally consider final \npassage.\n  One of the things I suggest to our colleagues today is to call home. \nCheck with your Governors, your county commissioners, your mayors, your \nsmall business men and women. Ask them what they think about the \nunfunded Federal mandates they have been dealing with. Ask them how \nmuch it has been costing. Ask them about the harm unfunded mandates \nhave done--the tax burdens, the delays and the numerous other problems \nthese unfunded mandates have inflicted upon counties, cities, States, \nand businesses.\n  The Washington Post reported today that 74.2 percent of State \nmunicipal leagues cited unfunded mandates as the most vexing issue \nlocal government faces, in a survey released by the National League of \nCities. Numerous government and business organizations have endorsed \nunfunded mandates legislation, including the National Governors \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of \nCounties, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the National School Board \nAssociation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  These groups represent the men and women across this country who are \non the front lines, at the State and local level, fighting to do their \njobs. They are urging Congress to examine more carefully the mandates \nthat we place upon them. This legislation just establishes a process so \nwe can seriously consider what we should do with these unfunded \nmandates and a way we can block them if they are not going to be \nproperly funded.\n  The American people are asking us to move this much needed \nlegislation. My prediction is that we will get to final passage of this \nlegislation sometime, if not later this week, next week. But why must \nwe delay the serious consideration of important and germane amendments \nto this legislation? Especially when we all know this bill will pass \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. Even President Clinton has called \nfor enactment of unfunded mandates reform legislation.\n  So I just thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this cloture motion and allow us to move forward \ntoward completion of this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate greatly the comments of \nthe assistant majority leader. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The vote Senators will cast today reflects their determination to \nestablish a new partnership with our State and local and tribal \ngovernments and a better working relationship with the private sector. \nMayors and county commissioners, Governors and school board officials \nand the private sector understand the significance of this vote.\n  This vote is the first test of Senators' commitment to reform \nWashington's dominance of State and local government. For too long \nCongress has been far too willing to merely pass the bill and then pass \nthe buck to the States and localities, but the ultimate billpayer is \nthe same weary American taxpayer.\n  This is a cloture vote on S. 1. S. 1 is nothing but a process to \naddress a rational commonsense way to the long overdue problem of \nunfunded mandates. What this vote means is that Senators are willing to \nstart voting on key issues related to this legislation. We will get on \nwith the business of 30 hours of debate, debate on amendments that are \ngermane to S. 1, debate on the specifics of the bill, debate, if you \nwill, on what S. 1 is all about, which is unfunded Federal mandates.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, as you know, we discussed for a number of \nhours education standards and abortion clinic violence--very important \nissues. But S. 1 is simply about unfunded mandates, and it is time to \nfocus our attention on this very important issue.\n  S. 1 has two simple concepts: First, the National Government should \nknow and pay the costs of mandates before imposing them on State and \nlocal governments.\n  Second, the National Government should know the costs and the impacts \nof mandates before imposing them on the private sector.\n  I support the decision of majority leader, Bob Dole, to have this \ncloture vote. Senators on the other side, as has been pointed out, say \nthat Republicans are rushing this bill; that we are moving too quickly; \nthat we have not had a full debate; that there are serious issues to \nresolve. But Governors, mayors, and county commissioners believe the \nopposite is true. They say Congress has taken too much time and \nmandated and forced them to raise local taxes and cut local services \nand raise property taxes too much. I agree. I know from personal \nexperience as a former mayor what unfunded mandates do. Federal \nmandates divert scarce local resources to Federal priorities, not local \npriorities. Mandates raise property taxes.\n  Ben Nelson, a successful Democrat Governor of Nebraska, I think \nsummed it very well when he said:\n\n       I was elected Governor, not administrator of Federal \n     programs for Nebraska.\n\n  I also know from personal experience as a Senator the difficulty of \npassing reform legislation. I know the months spent last year trying to \ncraft a bipartisan bill and then to see the delays that kept last \nyear's bill from coming to the Senate floor, the effect that nongermane \namendments had in preventing that bill from coming to the floor and \nbeing voted on.\n  I know the efforts I extended to seek what ought to be routine Senate \napproval of committee amendments, many offered by Democrats, that were \nall adopted unanimously by the committees. But as late as last night, \nwe could not get agreement to adopt the remaining committee amendments.\n  I know the Senators I have talked with this week encouraging them to \nbring their amendments to the floor so that we can debate them so that \nwe can vote on them. But I know there are many side issues that have \nbeen at play and situations. These are important issues all on their \nown, but debating those issues only slows down the effort to put in \nplace a process to identify the costs of mandates and have Congress pay \nfor them.\n  So it is time to move ahead and to focus debate on S. 1, a dynamic \nand fundamental change in the process of reestablishing a working \npartnership with our States and localities. S. 1 is bipartisan \nlegislation. S. 1 is supported [[Page S1142]] in this body and in the \nHouse of Representatives. S. 1 is supported throughout the Nation. The \nadoption of S. 1 can serve as a launching pad for other bipartisan \nlegislation in this Congress and, therefore, Mr. President, I urge \nSenators to vote for cloture on S. 1.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the debate prior to \nthe vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And the other side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me compliment the managers of the bill on \nboth sides, each manager, both managers. They have been very courteous, \nvery understanding, and I have been impressed by those managers.\n  This cloture vote, may I say to my friends on both sides, is nothing \nbut a blatant attempt to shut the minority out of the chance to amend \nthis legislation. That is right, I say to the Senator from New Mexico. \nJust as there was an attempt to shut the minority out of offering their \nviews in both the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, now we see the same tactics employed on the Senate floor.\n  There is a supreme arrogance about operating in this manner. We are \nbeing told by the majority: Do it our way or it will not be done at \nall.\n  This is a massive, complicated bill. There are major questions about \nits impact on the private sector, about its impact on the consideration \nof future legislation in terms of points of order, its possible cost, \nthe ability of the Congressional Budget Office to make the required \nestimates, constitutional questions, and agency bureaucrats making \ndecisions that elected officials ought to be making.\n  The people need to hear these things debated, and we Senators have a \nresponsibility to make sure that this legislation is understood, not \nonly by the American people but also by ourselves. How can we serve the \npeople if we give up our right to debate and amend? We came here to \nrepresent our constituents. How does one serve those constituents if \none simply acts like a doormat, if the minority acts like a collective \ndoormat when it comes to the thorough consideration of legislation?\n  I for one cannot be a party to this slam-dunk process. I may vote for \nthe legislation in the final analysis. I do not have any doubt that it \nwill pass overwhelmingly at some point when it is fully debated and we \nhave had an opportunity to amend it. I do not have any doubts that it \nwill pass, but there are problems with this bill and those problems \nneed to be addressed. Blind justice may be fine, but blind legislating \nis dangerous. And with this type of rush, this rush agenda, make no \nmistake about it, we are flying blind.\n  I hear a lot of talk about the so-called Contract With America. Well, \napparently there is a lot of fine print in that contract that somebody \naround here does not want to read. They want to rush it through. Do not \nread the fine print. The American people need to know what is in that \nhard-to-read fine print, and the American people's elected \nrepresentatives in the Senate and House need to know.\n  I wish to know a great deal more about this bill before I cast my \nvote on it. Let us put some sunshine into this process by allowing \namendments and full debate on those amendments. Let us not pull down \nthe blinds, slam the doors, and shut the American people out of the \ndebate. They have had enough of the arrogance of power. They do not \nwant any more of daddy knows best. That is the attitude from \nWashington, DC, the daddy-knows-best attitude. The American people do \nnot want that.\n  When the minority is denied their right to question, to amend, to \ndebate, then the American people are being denied their rights as well. \nI have stood for the rights of the minority heretofore, as Senators \nwill know, when I was in the majority and when I was in the minority. \nAnd when the minority is denied that right to question, to debate, and \nto amend, then the American people are denied their rights as well. \nThey are being denied their right to have important legislation \nthoroughly debated and debugged and made better.\n  That is all that we in the minority are asking. The Senate is the \nonly place where that kind of careful consideration can occur, but the \nprocedure of ramming legislation through the committees and through the \nSenate is the very antithesis of what the Framers and our earlier \nforebears in this Senate had in mind when they crafted the concept of a \nSenate with unlimited debate.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the Senator from Idaho has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I wish to thank the Senator who is \nmanaging this bill for the outstanding job he has done. I once again \ncommend him not only for the management but for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I have great respect for the institution of the \nSenate. Perhaps at this point in time I have too much. Some people \nwould say that I really like the Senate and I like what it does and how \nit operates. Well, I do. But I say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, if \nwe are operating blind, it is not the fault of the majority. We have \nbeen on this for the fifth day. If we are still blind, somebody is \ncausing us not to get to the issues.\n  I submit that the majority leader filed this petition because we have \nbeen sidetracked. If the last election meant anything--and I do not \npurport to be one who knows what it meant in great detail--I think it \nmeant a few things, and I believe honestly it meant that the American \npeople would like to see us get our job done and not to delay and \ndillydally around when we know we ought to do something.\n  Now, that is what the majority leader's petition for cloture is all \nabout. I believe the issues raised by my good friend from West \nVirginia, which he just cited, are important issues. I submit they \ncould have already been discussed.\n  Five days on the floor of the Senate, and I will not recap what we \nhave done, but I believe it is time, No. 1, that we stop the plethora \nof amendments floating to the floor here. The staff and Senators are \nbringing them up in bushels. If we do not impose cloture, the 123 that \nwe have will soon be 250. I would be surprised if very many of them, I \nsay to my good friend, have anything to do with what the Senator states \nbothers him and should bother the American people. They are on all \nkinds of issues. I think our people, the mayors, the Governors, the \ncounty commissioners, and everyone they represent know that is undue \ndelay, to just offer amendments on any subject under the sun on a \nclear-cut proposal that deserves debate.\n  How much debate? How many amendments? We are totally recognizing the \nminority rights. Some of us have been more times than not on the \nminority side. We are merely urging that we get on with the bill.\n  If the cloture does not pass, I hope we have sent a signal. And \nperhaps by the minority side's own analysis, maybe you have received a \nsignal. Maybe you all want to get on with this bill. Maybe my friend \nfrom West Virginia is saying that when he says we deserve the right to \ntell the American people.\n  Do we deserve the right to tell the American people about small \nbusiness and businesses that cannot collect sales tax because they are \nin some kind of catalog business? Do we deserve the right to have that \ndebated on this bill? I think the Senate has the right to say we are \nnot going to do that.\n  That is what this debate is about. Get to the point. Get your \namendments if they are relevant. Come to the floor and let us get the \nquestions answered. How much time do we need to get this bill analyzed \nand answered? We have already had enough. We ought to have cloture \ntoday. If we do not get it today, then we are going to get it pretty \nsoon. And sooner or later, we are going to [[Page S1143]] pass this \nbill by an overwhelming majority, and that point should be made. When \nthat is the case, we are just causing delay because it is going to pass \nby a lot of votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does this Senator control time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think it was only about 100 days ago, as \nI recall, that we were on the floor and the shoe was on the other foot. \nWe were trying desperately to get something through and there was a \nscorched-earth policy on the other side and everything that came up \nattracted amendments like flies to honey and so bogged things down with \nsupernumbers of amendments and filibusters and we could not get \nanything through.\n  I submit this. The congressional coverage bill and the S. 939, which \nis this bill expanded a little bit, were ready for floor action. We \ncould not get them out and get them taken up because there were \nauthorization and appropriations bills that still had to be dealt with. \nSo we put them over to this year.\n  What happened this year? Well, what happened in committee the other \nday was: We submit the bill in committee 1 day, we want markup the next \nday, and passage on the floor the next day. We tried in the committee \nto make amendments to the bill--good amendments, substantial \namendments, genuine things we had concern about--and we were told no, \nwe cannot have that. We will have a party-line vote--and we did. They \ncame out as party-line votes on a number of amendments and we were told \nthat, no, we will take those up on the floor. We will be able to take \nup any amendments on the floor.\n  What happens when we get to the floor? There is no report along with \nthis. We tried to vote that in committee and get a report. We could not \nget it. Senator Byrd, to his credit, brought this up on the floor and \ninsisted that we have it. That delayed this. It delayed things for \nquite some time.\n  We have not been the only ones delaying things. I submit the \namendment of Senator Gorton yesterday afternoon took up about, what, 3, \n3\\1/2\\ hours, I believe. So that was on the other side of the aisle, as \nfar as the delay goes.\n  When we came out on the floor, then I--I am a sponsor of this bill. I \nam part coauthor of this bill. Parts of it, S. 993, we worked on last \nyear. So I am a proponent of this. I want to see this get through. But \nwhen we say we are going to put things on such a fast track that all \nthe rules are going to be set aside and we are somehow going to just \nbring this out on the floor and we will all agree to it, we cannot \naccept that over here. I think due process on something that is \nchanging----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 1 more minute.\n  Mr. GLENN. When we have something as important as this bill, which I \nthink is truly landmark legislation--this starts defining the new \nrelationship that is going to exist from here on, as opposed to what \nhas existed since the days of Franklin Roosevelt and the Federal \nprograms that came in when local communities and States could not take \ncare of their own problems. That set of rules and that set of \nlegislation that has gone through all these years now is going to be \nreversed.\n  Will the States pick this up? Will they pick up the responsibilities \nthey either did not or could not assume at this time? I think we have \nto see on that. But this is the first piece of legislation that really \nstarts defining that new relationship, and as such it is going to be \neffective for a long, long time. I think to hustle it through because \nsomebody set an artificial 100-day limit or whatever it is, I think \njust is not realistic.\n  I hope we will not vote cloture so we can consider this bill and make \nit as good as we possibly can. It is going to be around for a long \ntime, affecting Federal-State relationships for a long period of time.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia for yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee I want to urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion. I \ncannot emphasize too much how critically important this legislation is. \nWhat the American people want is action and not merely talk.\n  Let me point out, as far as this piece of legislation was concerned \nlast year, 993 was not held up by the then-minority side. It was a fact \nthat amendments were offered from the majority side, amendments that \nwere not relevant to the legislation before us that prevented \nconsideration of this bill. In fact, the then-minority sought unanimous \nconsent that this legislation be considered without amendment, but that \nproved impossible because of the action on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. But, as I was saying, the important thing is for us to move \nahead. The public, I might say every level of State and local \ngovernment, have supported this legislation and have asked that we \nenact this legislation as quickly as possible, without major change. \nThis is true of the Governors' Association, the legislatures, the \nmayors, the county commissioners.\n  Mr. President, I urge we act on this legislation and for that reason \nI hope cloture is voted in the immediate future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senate rules do not require that amendments \nbe germane except under rule XVI dealing with appropriations bills. We \nare hearing all this hue and cry the last day or so that some of the \namendments are not germane. I hope Senators will continue to offer \namendments that they feel will improve the bill, remembering that \namendments that were not germane have been offered many times by those \nnow in the majority when they were in the minority. There is no Senate \nrule against nongermane amendments, except under cloture, under rule \nXVI, and when barred by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt we will see a solid party-line vote on \nmy right. Our Republican friends are going to vote solidly. If minority \nrights mean anything in this body, I hope that the minority will stand \nup for its rights. We are in the minority and the American people--talk \nabout what the American people want--the American people want to know \nwhat is in this bill. They also want their Senators to know what is in \nthe bill. They want their Senators to take the time to understand it.\n  We are not up against a fiscal year deadline or an adjournment sine \ndie or a deadline that the debt limit has to be raised. This is not an \nemergency bill. It does not provide moneys for earthquakes or other \ndisasters. This is a bill that is up here on the 19th of January and we \nhave all this rush to go to immediate judgment.\n  What is in the bill that the majority is afraid of? Why not put it \nunder the microscope? Why not give it the strongest scrutiny? That is \nwhat we owe to the American people. We also owe it to ourselves.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not concerned about a Contract With America. \nHere in my hand is my contract, the Constitution of the United States. \nAnd I have some constitutional questions about this legislation.\n  Our forebears in this Senate did away with ``the previous question.'' \nThey have provided for us, since the year 1806, no ``previous \nquestion'' in the rules, no immediate shutting off of debate.\n  We have the cloture rule and we are given an opportunity to shut off \ndebate. I hope we will not shut off debate on this measure until we can \nhave some votes on amendments that the [[Page S1144]] minority feels \nare important. We have that right and we ought to demand it.\n  I know that my good friend on the other side----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will take 1 more minute.\n  I know the majority leader on the other side, Bob Dole--he is my good \nfriend. I am fond of him. But he probably thinks we are going to fall \napart here in the minority. We have a duty to stand up for the rights \nof the minority and the rights of the American people to understand \nwhat is in this legislation before we buy into it.\n  I hope every Member of the minority will show some guts and stand up \nfor the people's right to know. That is what this is all about. What is \nall the rush? We have plenty of time.\n  It is only the 19th of January. Let us take the time to understand \nwhat we are voting on.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 37 seconds \nand the Senator from Idaho has 27 seconds.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in summation, may I just say that this \nvote on cloture does not close off debate. It says we will now have 30 \nhours of debate but the amendments will pertain specifically to the \nlegislation before us. That is what the American people would like. \nThey would like us to deal with unfunded Federal mandates. Our partners \nare in the public and private sector. There would be 30 hours of debate \non amendments specific to S. 1. That is what the American people are \nasking for. We are prepared to deliver.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this bill does not even take effect until \nnext January. Why can't we take a few more days here and have a closer \nlook at this legislation that is included in the so-called ``Contract \nWith America?'' I may favor the final bill. It does not take effect \nuntil January. We have plenty of time, and if the minority has any \nspine, any steel in their spine, and fire in their bellies, they will \nstand up against this effort to stampede and run over the minority. It \nwas done in the committees. It is being tried on the floor. Now is the \ntime, Mr. President, for the minority to take a stand on behalf of the \npeople's right to know.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan, amendment No. 143. On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 26 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnston\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 143) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. What is the pending order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we would go into the \ncloture vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. May we have order, Mr. President, so the Democratic leader \ncan be heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to use a couple of minutes \nof my time, if I could, to talk about the pending vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, may we have order, so the distinguished \nleader can be heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will take their seats.\n  The Senate is still not in order.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will not delay the vote very long, but I want to \nmake a couple of points, if I may.\n  The vote that we are about to cast is not a vote on the bill, nor is \nit a vote on a filibuster. There is no filibuster occuring at this \ntime. In fact, many of us on this side of the aisle support the intent \nof this legislation and very much want to work with our colleagues on \nthe other side in an effort to achieve a resolution to this bill at \nsome point in the not too distant future.\n  There essentially are two issues that relate directly to upcoming \nvote. The first issue relates to the process of considering this bill.\n  There appears to be a rush on the part of the Republicans to pass \nthis legislation. It was rushed through committee. Amendments offered \nby Democrats were defeated on a party-line vote. We were told in \ncommittee, both in the Budget Committee as well as in the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, that we would have the opportunity, ample \nopportunity, to consider amendments here on the floor. And thus the \nbill was rushed through two committees in the course of a few days.\n  The bill was then rushed to the floor. Despite objections by our \nDemocratic colleagues, the decision was made by the Republicans not to \nfile committee reports. Ultimately, reports were filed after the fact, \nonce the bill had been brought to the floor. Now, we are about to vote \non cloture, having only disposed of three Democratic amendments.\n  And, I might say, those amendments were agreed to overwhelmingly. I \ndo not know that there was a negative vote on any of the amendments \nthat were offered on our side. There was one nongermane Republican \namendment on which we spent more time than all of the three Democratic \namendments put together.\n  Yesterday, I offered to the distinguished majority leader a list of \nspecific amendments, a finite list of amendments, that we would like to \nhave considered. We discussed the possibility of considering his list \nand our list. Despite our efforts to reach an agreement, and, as is his \nright, he chose to go forward with the cloture petition we are voting \non today.\n  The problem is simple. If cloture is invoked today, there are many \nDemocratic amendments, relevant amendments, amendments that ought to be \nconsidered, amendments that in good faith we have offered in committee \nand again now on the floor, that we will not be allowed to offer. I am \nvery concerned about that.\n  Under this bill, as it exists, future legislation designed to protect \npeople from age discrimination could be held up by the procedures \nestablished by this bill. We have had assurances from the other side \nthat they would like to correct this. Yet the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan has tried now on several occasions to correct it, to no \navail.\n  The distinguished Senator from Ohio, the ranking member, would like \nto offer a substitute. If cloture is invoked today, he will not even be \nallowed to offer a substitute--a bill that is very similar, if not \nidentical, to the bill that was passed on the floor last year. \n[[Page S1145]] \n  If cloture is invoked, we will not have the right to offer relevant \namendments that, in some cases, may not be germane to the bill. We do \nnot know.\n  As every Senator knows, there is a difference between relevancy and \ngermaneness. There are a number of relevant amendments that will be \nprecluded from consideration by the Senate if cloture is invoked. That \nis the first issue.\n  The second issue is a much larger one. The second issue relates to \nsomething our Republican colleagues certainly appreciate, and that is \nthe rights of the minority--the right to be heard, the right to offer \namendments, the right for them to be considered as we raise these \nissues one by one on the Senate floor. That issue is at stake here \ntoday.\n  All we want is an opportunity to be heard and for our amendments to \nbe considered in a meaningful way. That is all we are asking.\n  Again, let me reiterate, this is not a filibuster. Ultimately, I hope \nthat on a bipartisan basis, we will have a vote on this bill. I hope \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take into account \nour sincere intention to proceed ultimately to a vote on this bill, \nvote ``no'' on the cloture motion, and allow us to offer our \namendments.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Was leaders' time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished \nDemocratic leader has had to say. It may not be intended to be a \nfilibuster, but this is their fifth day. We spent 5 days on the bill \nbefore that that took the House 1 hour and 20 minutes to pass on \ncongressional coverage. That was not intended to be a slowdown either, \nbut we had all these amendments.\n  The next amendment is not germane. It has to do with catalogs; \nnothing to do with unfunded mandates. It has nothing to do with this \nbill, but we will spend probably 2 or 3 hours on that.\n  We spent about 4 hours yesterday on violence at abortion clinics. \nNobody quarrels with that, but it has nothing to do with this bill. We \nspent most of the afternoon either in recess or negotiating what to do \nwith that amendment. It was not germane, not even relevant to this \nbill.\n  I am a very patient person. Of course, you have to be a little \npatient in the Senate, because there are certain things you cannot do. \nYou cannot just say, ``Well, that's it. It's over. Move on to something \nelse.''\n  We have a letter signed by a number of Governors supporting the \ncloture motion today. They know what is happening. The American people \nknow what is happening.\n  We are on the 11th committee amendment. Generally, it is routine to \nadopt all the committee amendments. We are on No. 11. We have had votes \nof 99 to zero, 98 to 1, wasting time with votes of this kind on \namendments that ought to be accepted. Anything to take up time. \nAnything to delay this process. A bill that everybody supported on that \nside of the aisle last year suddenly has become very controversial \nbecause we have had a change of management, apparently.\n  But I notice that Governor Dean from Vermont, Governor Thompson, and \nGovernor Nelson of Nebraska all suggest that we ought to move ahead \nwith this bill and support the vote on cloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter be made part \nof the Record. It is signed by at least 20-some Governors in both \nparties.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of \n           Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures, \n           International City Management Association, National \n           Governors' Association, National League of Cities,\n                                                 January 18, 1995.\n     To Senators Not Cosponsoring S. 1, The Unfunded Mandate \n         Reform Act of 1995:\n       We are writing to urge your support for S. 1, legislation \n     that will relieve state and local governments from the \n     burdens of future unfunded federal mandates. As you know, the \n     bill is pending on the Senate floor. The first few days of \n     consideration have been plagued by parliamentary delaying \n     tactics and ongoing, unlimited debate. To expedite action on \n     pending amendments and final passage of S. 1, Senate Majority \n     Leader Bob Dole filed a motion to invoke cloture on January \n     17 and a vote is expected on January 19.\n       As the elected leaders of State and local governments, we \n     strongly urge your support for the Senate Majority Leader's \n     motion to invoke cloture to allow Members to proceed with \n     consideration of amendments and final passage of S. 1, \n     Senator Dirk Kempthorne's mandate relief bill.\n       Again, thank you for your support. The collective members \n     of our organizations stand ready to assist you in any way we \n     can to ensure the immediate passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Howard Dean, M.D., Governor of Vermont; Chairman, \n           National Governors' Association.\n         Tommy G. Thompson, Governor of Wisconsin; Vice Chairman, \n           National Governors' Association.\n         George V.

Nollenberger, Chief Administrative Officer, \n           Duluth, Minnesota; President, International City and \n           County Management Association.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Now, I assume that if it is a party-line vote, we will not \nget cloture. Maybe not today; maybe not tomorrow; maybe not Saturday. I \ndo not know when we will get cloture.\n  If the other side of the aisle, the minority, is sincere about \namendments, why not give Members a list? We were negotiating yesterday \nabout 38 amendments. We got a list last night of 78 amendments. We \nthought we were going to cut them down. We doubled it, and added two \nfor good measure. There are 117 amendments filed at the desk, and there \nhas been cloture invoked.\n  We can do trimming on this side, too; we have too many amendments, \n30. That is a total of 108 amendments. The way we are grinding along, \nwe would not finish this bill before the Easter recess, or there would \nnot be any Easter recess. Nobody is in a hurry to pass this bill. They \ndo not want to do it before the President gives a State of the Union \nmessage.\n  I say, Mr. President, we have been trying to be helpful on Mexico, \nand we have heard a lot of silence on the other side of the aisle. But \nMexico comes up right after unfunded mandates, after it is completed, \nif it is a week from now or 2 weeks from now. That is up to the \nPresident of the United States and the Democrats in Congress. Maybe it \nis not important to anybody there. This is important to the President, \nand we have made a commitment to the President to try to be helpful.\n  However, it is fairly difficult for me to stand here as a Republican \nleader to try to help the President of the United States and the other \nparty, when the other side in this Chamber has done everything they can \nto prevent a vote on unfunded mandates.\n  Call it what you will. I have learned a lot about delay. In fact, we \ntaught a course in the last 2 years. We got A's, good grades. We \nstopped a lot of things. So I am not here to suggest we should not do \nit, because we have not used the rules, because we have. I have \nlearned--I forget most of it--but everything I learned, I learned from \nmy [[Page S1146]] friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. He knows \nmore than all of us put together, which is dangerous, in a way. I asked \nhim for advice before I talked to him. Can I do this or can I do that? \nI do not want to be embarrassed, and I know he would not do that.\n  In any event, I just suggest as the Republican leader that I know \nthat we want to accommodate our friends on the other side of the aisle. \nSo if there is an effort to give Members a real list of relevant \namendments, maybe we can do business. But do not give me a list of five \namendments for this person, five for this person, everybody take five. \nWe had 78. Give me a list of relevant amendments, relevant to this \nbill, and germane amendments. I bet they would not total over 15 or 20. \nWe will do the same on our side of the aisle, and maybe by 2 or 3 p.m., \nwe will have it down to 30 amendments. Then we might do business. But \nnot with 100 or some.\n  We may never get cloture, but we will continue to try. Maybe the \nGovernors and the mayors and the county commissioners and the taxpayers \nof America will understand, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe \nnot next week, but sooner or later, we need to pass this bill. There \nare not that many amendments. We will have every nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendment anybody has ever thought of. They are cleaning \nout their wastebaskets trying to find amendments.\n  We are prepared to do business. We urge our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to support this cloture motion. That will reduce the \nnumber of amendments drastically, but they would all be relevant. They \nwould all be germane to this bill. They would be important amendments. \nWe will probably spend an hour and a half or 2 hours on the catalog \namendments. We spent an hour last night. It has nothing to do with this \nbill. So we are a little bit frustrated. The American people are \nfrustrated.\n  We promised the American people we would listen to them, and we have \nnot listened to them. We listened to everybody else. The American \npeople want Members to pass this bill. The Governors, Democrats, \nRepublicans, mayors, commissioners, you name it, want the Senate to \npass this bill. We are not going to do it because the minority party \nsays, ``No, we don't want to do it.'' There is no hurry; we do not \nnormally do work in January.\n  This is not a normal year. We are trying to deliver on the message \nthe voters gave us last November, all of us on both sides of the aisle; \nnot just Republicans.\n  However, if we are thwarted from our effort to deliver, they will not \nblame us. So we will stand here every day, at every opportunity, and \ntell the American people why we could not pass unfunded mandates. Two \ndays would have been plenty for this bill; 2 days.\n  So I hope we will invoke cloture and move on to pass this bill, and \nthen try to accommodate the President's wishes on Mexico, and following \nthat, the balanced budget amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1140-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 1, the \nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation.\n  The unfunded mandate reform bill is not only important in its own \nright, but it is also important to ensure that the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution--an amendment which I believe will be \napproved by the Senate and House of Representatives in the coming \nweeks--will be implemented as the American people intend.\n  The ideal balanced budget amendment would do more than just require a \nbalanced budget. It would, in my view, limit Federal spending as well \nas the ability of the Federal Government to impose unfunded mandates.\n  As the Washington Times editorialized recently, ``the real problem,'' \nreferring to the budget deficit, ``is lawmakers' dipsomaniacal spending \nhabits. This is what we must control, one way or another.'' The Times \nwent on to note my balanced budget/spending limitation amendment Senate \nJoint Resolution 3, which includes an explicit spending limitation, \nsaying, ``this version has obvious appeal--it is simple and \nstraightforward,'' and, as such, that ``a spending limit may do the job \nbetter than a tax limit.''\n  Mr. President, I would assert that a spending limit is more than just \n``simple and straightforward.'' Whether or not a spending limitation is \nincluded in the balanced budget amendment, the only way to comply with \na balanced budget requirement will be to limit Federal spending.\n  Some will no doubt argue that tax increases must be part of the \nsolution. [[Page S1147]] But I believe that, if they were, the budget \nwould be balanced by now. We have had record-setting tax increases in \n1990 and 1993. The cold fact is, however, that tax increases do not \nwork--will not work--because tax increases ultimately change people's \nbehavior. Higher tax rates discourage work, production, investment, and \nsavings, so there is less economic activity to tax and less revenue \nthan expected to the Treasury. Lower tax revenues, on the other hand, \nencourage people to work, produce, save, and invest, so more revenue \nflows to the Treasury as a result of increased economic activity.\n  As pointed out in a column which appeared in the Wall Street Journal \nin March 1993 by W. Kurt Hauser, a member of the board of overseers of \nthe Hoover Institution, ``no matter what the tax rates have been, in \npostwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5 percent of \ngross domestic product.'' Hauser went on to write that, ``if history is \nany guide higher taxes will not increase Government's take as a \npercentage of the economy.''\n  Hauser's observation is borne out in President Clinton's last budget, \nwhich reported revenues fluctuating around a relatively narrow band of \nabout 18 to 20 percent of GDP for the last 40 years. That is despite \ntax rate increases and tax cuts, bull and bear markets, and Presidents \nof both political parties.\n  Over that same period, Federal spending has risen from 17.8 percent \nof GDP in 1955 to more than 23 percent in 1991 and 1992, and now stands \nat about 22.5 percent.\n  It is Federal spending that is the problem. Congress spends too much, \nand it will never be able to balance the Federal budget until it \nconstrains spending. With that reality in mind, I believe the ideal \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution ought to include an \nexplicit spending limitation.\n  We will have that debate in the coming weeks. I suspect that the \nvotes aren't there for an explicit spending or tax limitation in the \nbalanced budget amendment, but as legislation to implement and enforce \na balanced budget amendment is considered in the months ahead, I will \nvigorously pursue the issue.\n  Today, however, we are considering a second component of what it \nwould take to implement what I consider to be the ideal balanced budget \namendment. S. 1 represents the first step toward resolving the problem \nof unfunded Federal mandates. Without such legislation, a balanced \nbudget amendment might merely encourage Congress to shift the burden of \nprograms and policies it is unable to fund to State, local and tribal \ngovernments, as well as the private sector. That shifting of the burden \nis not what the American people intended when they overwhelmingly voted \nfor change--and less government--last November.\n  Mr. President, I said that S. 1 represents a first step, a first step \nbecause it only applies to future mandates. It does not address the \nproblem of existing mandates, which already impose a significant burden \non State, local and tribal governments and the private sector. And, it \nis the burden of existing mandates that has so enraged the American \npeople. I believe they care less about this Congress relieving them of \nfuture mandates which we have yet to conceive of or impose, than they \ndo about relieving them of the burden they currently bear, the morass \nof Federal mandates and regulations that are strangling our economy.\n  According to the Clinton adminstration's own National Performance \nReview, the cost of private sector compliance with Federal regulations \nis at least $430 billion a year, or 9 percent of our GDP. Other \neconomists believe the regulatory burden imposed on the private sector \nand State, local and tribal governments is between $500 to $850 billion \nper year, more than the amount collected in personal income taxes in \n1994. Add to that the indirect and cumulative productivity losses from \nFederal regulations, and the annual costs could double.\n  Let me talk for a moment about some of the existing mandates, which \nare discussed in a superb report prepared by the Goldwater Institute in \nArizona, a report aptly titled, ``Summary Orders from Distant Gods.'' \nDr. Douglas Munro, in a preface to the Institute's report, \ncharacterized the problem of unfunded mandates very succinctly: that \nFederal mandating is rooted in the idea ``that the Federal Government's \nsolutions to all problems are preordained to be superior to others.'' \nThey are not.\n  In Arizona, for example, the Salt river is fully regulated and \nmonitored--at State expense--to be in compliance with standards set by \nthe Clean Water Act for fishing and swimming. That is despite the fact \nthat the Salt River is usually dry for 50 of the 52 weeks of the year, \nand when it's running, people do not fish or swim in it.\n  Citing testimony before the Arizona State Legislature by the \npresident of the Water Utility Association of Arizona, Paul Gardner, \nthe Goldwater Institute reports that as many as 200 to 500 small water \nbusinesses in the State are expected to go bankrupt over the next 5 \nyears as a result of the costs of testing for contaminants which are \nvery rarely present. The director of the Arizona Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, Ed Fox, further testified to the problems faced \nby small water companies under the Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA], \nnoting that those small companies must test for an additional 25 or so \nEPA-selected pollutants every 3 years, regardless of whether or not any \npollutants are ever found as part of the regular testing process. But, \nthe access by those small companies to the funds necessary to conduct \nsuch testing is severely limited.\n  According to Goldwater Institute data, the State of Arizona will pay \nat least $184 million in direct, unfunded mandate costs. Add to this \nthe $693 million that the State will spend to secure matching grants \nand the $145 million in maintenance of effort requirements, and the \nresult is about $1.2 billion, or 15 percent of Arizona own-source \nrevenue is directly tied to Federal directives.\n  Probably the largest portion of costs to the State of Arizona--49.5 \npercent of the total--are associated with the provision of services to, \nor incarceration of, undocumented aliens. This, of course, is not the \nresult of a Federal mandate per se, but rather the Federal Government's \nfailure to adequately perform its responsibility to control the \nNation's borders. That, in effect, has the same effect as an unfunded \nFederal mandate. That the Federal Government does not do its job foists \nadditional costs on other levels of Government to fill the gap.\n  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures [NCSL], \nthere are now 192 operative legislative mandates, an all-time high. The \noverall cost of mandates to the State, local and tribal governments is \nhard to pinpoint, but a report by the NCSL put estimates at between $15 \nand $500 billion. Price-Waterhouse reports aggregate fiscal year 1993 \ncosts for just 10 mandates--mainly environmental--at over $54 million \nfor just the 4 Arizona cities of Gilbert, Phoenix, Scottsdale, and \nTucson.\n  I would emphasize, as the Arizona Republic did in a January 11 \neditorial, that resolving the problem of unfunded mandates does not \n``mean, say, that environmental regulations would not be approved. Just \nthat Congress will have to prioritize its spending to fund them.''\n  Most of what S. 1 addresses relates to mandates imposed on State, \nlocal and tribal governments, but the burden of unfunded mandates is \nborne by the private sector as well. S. 1 merely requires reporting of \nthe costs to the private sector of future mandates. It does nothing to \nmake it harder for Congress to impose future mandates on the private \nsector except document their cost, nor does it require the Federal \nGovernment to help offset their cost.\n  That is why I believe S. 1 really represents just a first step. It is \nwhat is doable now, but bolder steps must follow to satisfy the \npublic's demand for real change, for relief from the crushing burden of \nFederal mandates and regulations.\n  If the Federal Government's solutions to problems were indeed \nsuperior, then the Federal Government should be willing to back those \nsolutions, those mandates--future as well as existing mandates--with \nthe funds to implement them. That Congress has not, at least until now, \nbeen willing to fund the mandates it imposes on State, local and tribal \ngovernments, or the private sector, illustrates that either Congress \nhas found a convenient way to elude budget constraints while still \nimposing its will on others, or that it does not [[Page S1148]] believe \nthe mandates are important enough to back them with Federal dollars.\n  Responsible budgeting is a matter of prioritizing. If the functions \nthat the Federal Government mandates on others are truly important, \nthen they should be of high enough priority to warrant a commitment of \nFederal funds to pay for them. Congress and the President must be \nconstrained in the amount of taxpayer dollars they are able to commit, \neither directly or indirectly in the form of unfunded mandates. That is \nthe essence of responsible budgeting, and indeed responsible \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, we should support S. 1 now and immediately go to work \nto protect the private sector from Government mandates and determine \neffective ways to end inappropriate existing mandates on State, local \nand tribal governments and the private sector.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a couple of comments about \nsome of the discussion that was held prior to the last vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. I am uncomfortable leaving that discussion where \nit was left.\n  It is interesting how, in the Senate, two different views of the same \npicture produce two different descriptions of where we are. This is a \nvery important piece of legislation. Reforming unfunded mandates is not \na small undertaking. This bill, which would substantially change the \nway that the Congress has behaved in recent decades, is not a small \nissue or a small matter.\n  Many of us believe that this legislation should move forward. And it \nwill. It will with the votes of many of us on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle, I am convinced. But we are told that at this moment on this \nside of the aisle Members are engaged in tactics to delay, to stall--\ndilatory tactics, some say.\n  Let me again review where we are and why. It is the intention of some \nto move this legislation very, very quickly for their own reasons. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs had a markup on this almost \nimmediately when Congress reconvened. We were told in the committee \nthat it was the intention of the majority to move this legislation to \nthe floor without substantive amendments--and they did that. The \nmajority assured us that amendments could then be offered on the floor. \nBut S. 1 came to the floor from two committees, and the committee \nreports that were appropriate to go with the bill were not made \navailable.\n  The Senator from West Virginia very properly indicated that they \nought to be made available and that we ought not consider this \nlegislation until they were. Dilatory? Hardly. He was simply asking for \nthe sort of information we would expect as legislators.\n  When the reports were made available, a good many of us had \namendments available to be offered on the floor of the Senate. Have we \nbeen able to offer those amendments? No, unfortunately not.\n  It seems to me that we will break this impasse when those who bring \nthis legislation to the floor say all right, we are ready to entertain \nyour amendments. Offer them, debate them, and let us vote on them. \nThose are the assurances we were given in the committee when this \nlegislation moved out of the committee.\n  I know some who have responsibility to run the train want the train \nto run on time. But others who are on the train want to understand \nwhich train it is, which track it is on, and where it is heading. These \ndays, with all the reform ideas and new ideas, and, yes, some nutty \nideas that are bouncing around the Halls of the Congress, I think we \nought to at least slow down the train enough so we understand exactly \nwhat we are hauling and where we are headed.\n  Will we see legislation one of these days that provides for the nutty \nidea of providing tax credits to the poor to buy laptop computers? If \nit is in legislation, I hope it comes through here slow enough so I can \nsee it and flag it.\n  Or the new idea from the Heritage Foundation, that maybe we ought to \ncharge admission for the American people to tour the Capitol? That is a \nnovel, nutty idea--let us charge people to tour the building they own?\n  It is one thing to try to run the train. It is another thing to want \nto do things right. This legislation in my judgment is going to pass \nand be signed into law by the President of the United States. But I \nfind it ironic that the ranking member, Senator Glenn, who has been one \nof the coauthors of this legislation, who has amendments to offer to \nthis legislation--even the ranking member now finds that we do not have \ntime. Gee, we are stalling because we want to offer amendments.\n  I have great respect for my friend, the Senator from Idaho, who I \nthink has done excellent work on this subject. As I have indicated \nbefore, this is a meritorious subject for us to be considering. In the \nend I hope to vote with the Senator from Idaho because I believe in the \nunfunded mandates bill. In fact, I helped write some of it during the \nlast session. Some of the language I helped write with respect to the \nprivate sector is in this bill. But I say to those who are concerned \nabout timing, I say to those: Let us do it. Open the bill up, allow us \nto offer amendments, allow us to debate the amendments, and allow us to \nvote on amendments and we will be through in my judgment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. But if the process is going to be let us do this in a way \nso when we offer amendments you second-degree them all, if we slam-dunk \nthis bill--I am sorry, that is not the way this body works. Senators \nhave certain rights. We have the right to offer amendments and we want \nthem voted on. I would especially say on behalf of my colleague--I am \nsure the ranking member will say this on his own behalf--we have the \nright to do that and we intend to exercise that right. At the end, I \nthink this legislation will be better legislation and will ultimately \npass this Congress.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reiterate--I appreciate what the \nSenator from North Dakota has said and also the leadership he provided \nin constructing many of the provisions in this legislation, in \nparticular helping the private sector.\n  But I want to assure the Senator that invitation is there. I have \nrepeatedly been offering that invitation to please bring your \namendments to the floor, let us deal with them.\n  One of the impediments, apparently, is we have not been able to get \nthrough committee amendments yet. But yesterday and the day before I \nhave been calling Senators on both sides of the aisle encouraging them, \nsaying, I know you have an amendment that affects this legislation, and \nwhile I may or may not agree with it, please bring it to the floor now. \nLet us put it before the desk, and let us debate it. But again there \nhave been other impediments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate that. The Senator from Idaho operates in \ngood faith, as do almost all of our colleagues, and understands the \nrules very well. I was here yesterday. I could not help but hear \nsomeone complain recently about nongermane amendments. We spent 4 hours \nyesterday on the amendment offered by Senator Gorton on this \nlegislation. So it is all in the eyes of the beholder.\n  I was also here yesterday most of the day when Senator Boxer wanted \nto offer her amendment and finally got it, I guess, after 10 hours. I \nwould simply say I have a couple of amendments. I would love to offer \nthem very soon and have a debate and an up-or-down vote. If the Senator \nfrom Idaho is willing to let me do that, let us do that this afternoon. \nI am willing to agree with respect to time limits on my two amendments. \nI expect most other Members on the Democratic side of the aisle would \nsay yes, give us the opportunity to have our amendments brought up and \ndebated. And we will be plenty happy to do that. I know the ranking \nmember, Senator Glenn, wants to speak on this as well. But that is all \nwe ask for at this point.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield? I would just say that I will \ntake the Senator up on that offer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\nMr. BUMPERS. Yes. I will be happy to yield.\n[[Page S1149]]\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I support this legislation. I know the \nnecessity for it, and I want to see this legislation go through. I \nwanted to see its predecessor last fall go through, S. 993, also. That \ngot caught up in all the things we recall all too well of last fall \nwhen there was delay after delay after delay on the floor. And I would \nsay, had there not been that kind of delay, perhaps we would have had \ntime to bring up not only the congressional coverage bill that we \nfinally got through this year, but also S. 993, and we would not have \nto be dealing with those matters in this particular Congress.\n  But more to the point right now, with all due respect, the statement \nwas made that if cloture is invoked, we would still be able to offer \namendments on the bill because we would have 30 hours of debate. But \nyou go under a different set of rules, Mr. President. Different rules \napply once cloture is invoked.\n  After cloture is imposed only germaneness amendments can be offered. \nThe meaning of germaneness is not the same as you may look up in your \noffice or look up in your home in the Webster's definition of \n``germaneness.'' The ordinary meaning of germaneness would mean \n``basically relevant.'' It has a technical meaning here in the Senate \nunder Senate custom and Senate judgment of what that means. That is far \nmore narrow than the word ``relevant.''\n  For example, if I were to offer an amendment to S. 1 that would \nexpand CBO's responsibilities under the bill, which is basically what \nwould happen if I tried to introduce S. 993, even though we all \napproved of that, 67 cosponsors last fall to S. 993, certainly that \nwould not be relevant because, compared with the current legislation we \nare considering, S. 1, it would expand a little bit the CBO's \nresponsibility.\n  So the definition under Senate rules is that it would not be germane \nbecause it expands that responsibility of the bill being considered. \nThat would be the case if we went under cloture.\n  There are many Democratic amendments to this bill, ones that we \nwanted to offer in committee that would improve the bill and would have \nmade it better coming out on the floor. Those were defeated in the \ncommittee by a straight party-line vote.\n  Let me say this. In committee I made a prediction. I said that if we \ndid not take that up, take the relevant amendments up and try to make \nthis as good a bill as we could to come out of committee, when it hit \nthe floor it would attract other amendments like ``flies to honey.'' I \nthink that was the term I used. That has proven true in this case \nbeyond anything that even I foresaw when I said that over in the \ncommittee room the other day.\n  What we have had now, this being the first couple of bills out, the \ncongressional coverage and now this bill, S. 1, this is the first \nopportunity that people have to offer amendments on the floor. Under \nSenate rules they can offer those amendments. Cutting off debate, \ninvoking cloture on this, would mean that a lot of those amendments \nwould no longer be germane, would no longer be germane and could not be \noffered.\n  Ordinarily, you may say that is OK. But the problem is we were not \npermitted to offer amendments in committee that would have improved the \nbill and some of them under cloture would be ruled nongermane now. So \nthat is the reason that I voted to not invoke cloture just a few \nminutes ago.\n  I think this has been pointed out. The message of last November, I \nthink, can be construed in a lot of ways. I think if you ask any two \npeople out on the streets, you are liable to get three, four, or half a \ndozen answers from even two people. But I think there was no message \nthat said we wanted to return a bill that is as important as this \nlegislation.\n  I have said repeatedly that I believe that this is landmark \nlegislation. We are literally changing, starting with this bill to make \nthe first major changes in processes that have been in place in our \nGovernment for over the last 60 years, since the days of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. In those days the communities and States had lost \ncontrol of being able to control their own destiny. Communities no \nlonger were able to really do what had to be done to take care of the \npeople in their communities. They lost control.\n  So for the first time the Federal Government came in and said, if \nStates and local communities cannot do that, the Federal Government \nwill play a role. So a lot of the programs that have developed over the \nlast 60 years, many of which went to excess, many of which should not \nhave gone to the excess that they went to--and I am the first to agree \nwith that--but they filled a role that the States and local communities \nwere not able to fill back in those days of the Great Depression. You \nremember the ``Okies'' heading west with the mattress on top of the car \nor whatever. Those States and local communities could not do the job. \nDid the Federal role then go too far? It may have; probably did.\n  This legislation is landmark in that for the first time now we say \nthat we want to start putting some of those responsibilities back to \nthe States and local communities. They are now able to do many of these \nthings, and we do not need to do it from the Federal level. That is an \nenormous change, going in an enormous difference of direction.\n  While I am for this bill as a way of setting up a framework to say \nthat we in the Congress, as a first step, are forced by our procedures \nhere by a point of order to consider the costs up front and vote on it, \nif the demand is made, we will be forced to take cognizance of the \ncosts up front. And then it does not say in this legislation that we \nhave to furnish the money or the mandate will never be there. It says \nwe have to consider it and have an outline of the money there to vote \non it. And then we can even still say by vote of the Senate, yes, \nStates, you do it; we are not providing one nickle. But it would be a \nconscious up-front acknowledgment of the cost and then the vote, and we \nwould say, yes, it is going to be good for the future of this country, \nfor everybody, and that is it. States still have to do it. But we would \nbe forced to take this into account up front.\n  That has been carefully crafted in this bill. It means that we could \nno longer act as in the past where we just pass something and say, \nStates, take care of it. We are sure you guys can handle it.\n  There are a lot of things now the States cannot necessarily handle. \nThere are a lot of examples of that. I gave some the other day. I live \nin Grandview, OH, a suburb of Columbus, a part of greater Columbus. The \nmayor, who was chairman of the National Council of Mayors for a while, \nhas done a real study in Columbus. They have estimated that just 14 \nmajor environmental mandates, between 1991 and the year 2000 will cost \nthe city of Columbus $1.6 billion, not the biggest city in the country; \n$1.6 billion. Obviously, if you multiply that by all the different \ncities in the country, there is no wonder the mayors and Governors are \nconcerned about this whole problem.\n  So the point I am making is it is a mammoth problem. We for the first \ntime are reversing the trend of the last 60 years. And the point is we \nhad better do this very carefully in making sure that as many of these \nproblems as can be worked out with regard to this legislation had \nbetter be worked out in advance and right here on the floor and not \nunder the pressure of a cloture vote that would cut off debate after 30 \nhours.\n  I do not think that is fair. I do not know what the majority leader's \nplan would be if cloture is invoked. But one of his options is to run \n30 hours right on the bill, right around the clock, and that is it. \nWhat gets in gets in and what is not gotten in at that point is \nout. That might be the way he would do this. I would not want to see \nthat kind of pressure brought on what I view as landmark legislation. \nWe were denied in committee the right to make those changes. I think \ntechnically, from the Republican side, frankly, that was a mistake \nbecause it removed the debate to the floor and did attract amendments \nlike flies to honey, as I said in the committee room the other day. \nThat is what happened on this particular piece of legislation.\n\n  Unfortunately, when you go under cloture, you foreclose not just the \nextraneous amendments, but a lot of good amendments that might not be \nworked in during that time period of 30 hours, which is all that is \npermitted after the vote.\n  I do not want to delay this. I want to see this legislation get \nthrough. But [[Page S1150]] after having lived 60 years with the \nbuildup of things being provided from the Federal Government, I do not \nthink it is too much to ask that we have the opportunity, for just a \nfew days, to make sure we work our way through this. If we do not have \ncloture, is it still in order for other amendments to be brought up--\nwhich I wish would not be brought up, too--but is it legal under Senate \nrules? Yes, unfortunately, it is.\n  Unless cloture has been invoked, the germaneness rule is not \napplicable in the Senate as it is in the House. It is the right of any \nSenators on the floor here to bring up whatever amendments they want \nto. I would rather work through it that way, even though we may have to \ndeal with a lot of things that people consider are not germane to the \nbill. I would rather do that and make sure everybody is dealt with \nfairly and where everybody that has a legitimate concern about this \nbill has an opportunity to get their corrections and their amendments \nin. I would rather see that happen and take the extra time to do it, to \nmake sure this landmark legislation, which literally is changing the \ndirection or starting to change the provisions of what the Federal \nGovernment role has been over the last 60 years, is fully considered. \nWe better do that very, very carefully, or we will find States and \nlocal communities out there still that are not able to cope with this. \nWe will find that our first moves are not satisfactory at this. I want \nto do this carefully.\n  The rush, it seems to me, has been pushed by the fact that somebody \nset up an artificial 100 days to do great and wondrous things. It may \nbe fine to try and match that to the days of the New Deal where they, \ntoo, had there 100-day priority that Roosevelt had back then. We are \nsupposedly having another 100 days to reverse some of that.\n  I think we better be very careful with this, and that is the reason I \ndid not support the move to filibuster.\n  I know the Senator from Arkansas has basically been waiting. I \nappreciate his yielding to me. I wanted to put that into context before \nwe had any offers of other amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 144 to Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may continue on what the Senator from Ohio was \nsaying, I am not a signatory to the contract. I was not asked to sign \nit, and, of course, would not have signed it had I been asked. It does \nnot apply to me. What applies to me is to do what I think is best for \nthe country and to make certain that these bills are not rammed through \nhere before people who have legitimate interest in them, and who want \nto improve them, have an opportunity to do so.\n  I have never seen a time when the Senate, for the most part, was not \nbetter served when it slowed things down and forced the Members of this \nbody to think about it, rather than to do what was political.\n  Last night, the senior Senator from Maine came over and said, first \nof all, he did not know I was going to bring the amendment up. He said \nhe was at home and did not know it was coming up. Let me say to the \nSenator from Maine and everybody else, I am not in the habit of calling \npeople, particularly people I think are going to be opposed to my \namendments, to tell them when I am going to bring up an amendment. \nNobody has ever done that with me, and I do not do it to anybody else. \nThe way this works is, you hang around here until legislation and \namendments are offered, and if you have an interest in them, you go \nover and talk on them.\n  The Senator from Maine also talked about ``business as usual,'' \n``gridlock,'' and that my amendment was ``nongermane.'' Let me make a \ncouple of observations on that. Surely he has not forgotten that in the \n103d Congress Democrats had to file, or vote on, 72 cloture motions--\n72.\n  Senator, after the Republicans brought this place to a standstill \ntime and time and time again last year, and you won overwhelmingly on \nNovember 8, we decided we will try it if it works that well. Maybe in \nthe election in 1996, people will reward us.\n  Mr. COHEN. If the Senator will yield, I assume the Senator from \nArkansas is saying he is going to engage in the delaying tactics you \nthink brought victory to the Republicans; is that what he is saying?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am saying that we have a perfect right to offer our \namendments, and we are not going to be shut out if we can keep enough \ndiscipline to keep 41 votes in the saddle.\n  Mr. COHEN. I would agree with that. If we had a vote on cloture, the \nSenator's amendment would be ruled to be nongermane.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Maine and I both know that the \ngermaneness rule in the Senate will take down almost any amendment. The \nSenator from Maine thinks my amendment is not germane. Let me just \ncover that for a moment. The Senator might want to be seated because I \nam going to wax eloquent here for a while.\n  Mr. COHEN. Well, he is going to wax.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am going to wax eloquent. I hope the Senator from \nMaine will pay close attention, because what I am talking about makes \neminent common sense. Last night, somebody said on the floor of the \nSenate: ``Call your Governor and see how he or she feels about this \nmandate bill. If you call your Governor, your Governor will say: Please \nvote for the Kempthorne bill.''\n  I have a sequel to that: Call your Governor and ask him how he wants \nyou to vote on the Bumpers amendment. All but about eight of them will \nsay: Please, for God's sake, support the Bumpers amendment.\n  Every single Republican will vote the way their Governor wants them \nto on the first, and not one single Republican will vote the way the \nGovernor wants them to vote on my amendment.\n  When it comes to gridlock, we are pretty good students. We have \nwatched the other side bring this place to a standstill time and time \nagain. I do not want to bring it to a standstill. I want to vote on \nthis. But one of the reasons I am not for cloture is--and it is not \njust my amendment, there are other amendments that will make this a \nbetter bill--the debate might dress it up to the point that I would \nvote for it. But when it comes to germaneness, how many times have you \nheard Senators stand on the floor of the Senate and make these great \nspeeches about what a terrible burden the Congress places on the \nStates, cities, and counties? Here is an amendment that would help the \nStates to fund those burdens. It does not require a State to do \nanything.\n  So what happened? Because the Supreme Court says this is a burden on \ninterstate commerce which only Congress can authorize, the burden of \ncollecting the tax now falls on the person who buys the merchandise. \nForty-five States have laws now obligating consumers to pay taxes on \nmerchandise bought out-of-state.\n  I think the State of Arkansas collected $10,000 last year. There is \nnot 1/1,000th of one percent of the people in Arkansas that even know \nthat bill is on the books.\n  In 1992, the Supreme Court said only Congress can permit a State to \nrequire out-of-State companies to collect the use taxes on goods they \nship into the State. That was the case of Quill versus the State of \nNorth Dakota. The Court said, such a collection requirement no longer \nviolates the due process clause and, although such a requirement \nimposes a burden on interstate commerce, Congress has the right to \ndetermine whether that burden will be allowed.\n  So if Congress wants to give the States the discretion--not the \nmandate, but the discretion--of requiring people who ship merchandise \ninto their States to collect sales tax, Congress can do so. That is \nwhat the Bumpers amendment will do.\n  Last night, the junior Senator from Maine said, ``Let the States \ndecide.'' She ought to support my amendment. That is precisely what I \nam saying--let the States decide.\n  Where are all these States righters now? Everybody is talking about \nwhat a terrible burden Congress imposes on the States, and here is an \namendment that says we are going to give the States discretion. And \nthis amendment will not get a single Republican vote--not one.\n  The sum of $3.301 billion is what the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations says this could give the States. This is \nthe amount of money they could use to deal with \n[[Page S1151]] landfills. I mean, after all, the 7,500 mail-order \nhouses in this country contribute 3.3 million tons of garbage in \ncatalogs alone. There are places in this country where it costs $100 a \nton to dispose of that stuff. And what is their contribution to the \nState? Not one thin dime. And it is not just 3.3 million tons of \ncatalogs. It is also those packages that your merchandise comes in. \nThat has to be disposed of, too.\n  This mail-order business is growing like Topsy--$100 billion a year. \nL. L. Bean in Maine is the second biggest mail-order house in the \ncountry, headed for $1 billion in 1995. I am not criticizing the \nSenator from Maine; if I were from Maine, I would probably be making \nthe same speech he is making.\n  But let me ask you this simple question: What if, instead of $100 \nbillion of retail sales a year, these mail-order houses represented \nabout 50 to 70 percent of all the sales in this country and not one \ndime of sales tax or use tax was collected? How would you educate your \nchildren? Who is going to pay the policemen, the firemen? Who is going \nto take care of the landfills?\n  Wal-Mart, KMart, they have made their contribution, to the shuttering \nof Main Street. These mail-order houses are making their contribution, \nand they do not pay anything. And my amendment does not say they have \nto. It simply says, ``Governor, if you and the legislature think they \nshould, you can have that right.''\n  That is what this amendment says. It is just that simple.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I understand it, the Senator is offering a proposal \nthat does not involve a new tax of any kind.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator indicated, when I walked in the Chamber, that \nthe question of whether this is a taxable kind of circumstance is not \nchanged by anything he would propose. If someone makes a major purchase \nfrom a mail-order catalog somewhere and that item is shipped to them, \nthey have a responsibility, under most State laws, to pay a use tax. \nThe fact is almost none of it is ever paid and almost none of it is \never collected.\n  As I further understand the Senator's amendment, he is not suggesting \nthat a State must do one thing or the other. He would simply change the \nlaw to comport with the Supreme Court decision in the Quill case that \nsays the State will have the opportunity. This is an interstate \ncommerce clause issue and the States are now prevented from the \nopportunity of making their own decision. The Senator would simply \nremove that prevention and say, ``Give the States the right to \ndecide.'' That is what I understand the Senator is doing.\n  I might say that I offered a piece of legislation like this in the \nHouse of Representatives when I was a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee. In fact, we voted it out of the subcommittee. Then it looked \nto me like it was snowing in July, because the mail-order catalog \ncompanies began blizzarding the country and Capitol Hill with \npostcards, sending postcards out, asking people to sign them and send \nthem in saying, ``This is a proposal that would increase taxes.'' Of \ncourse, it was simply untrue. No one was proposing that, least of all \nmyself.\n  So I understand, when you raise this issue, it has not snowed yet \nthis winter in Washington, DC, but it may because literally millions of \ncards can be generated quickly by those who are engaged in this \nbusiness.\n  My own view of it is they perform a real service and many of them \noffer some wonderful products and the American people ought to be able \nto take advantage of it.\n  I would only view it, when they come into a State to do business, \nthat they simply be required to subscribe to the same kinds of burdens \nand obligations other people who are now doing business in that State \nmust meet every day.\n  So I think the Senator from Arkansas is making some good points. And \nI do think that we need to underscore that you are not suggesting a new \ntax--that has nothing to do with this proposal--nor are you requiring \nor suggesting the States must do anything. Your proposal simply allows \nthe States the opportunity to make their own judgments about certain \ntax obligations in cases like this.\n  I think the Senator's proposal is very worthwhile. I might suggest, \nif I were writing it--and I have written one in the past--a higher \nthreshold than $3 million which, as I understand it, is the threshold. \nBut that is a technical issue.\n  The fundamental issue the Senator is raising, I think, is right on \npoint. I appreciate the fact that he is raising it today in the Senate.\n  I thank him for yielding to me.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for his comments. He was perhaps \neven more eloquent than I have been and said more concisely and clearly \nwhat I have been trying to say.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator yielding to \nme. My question is only procedural. Would the Senator from Arkansas be \nwilling to enter into a time agreement at this point, with time equally \ndivided?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Not yet. I am not trying to delay. I hope to be through \nhere very shortly. I assume that the floor manager will wish to move to \ntable. As I said, my design is not to try to impede the unfunded \nmandates bill. But 80 percent of the people who walk through that door \nwhen the rollcall buzzer goes off will not have a clue as to what this \namendment is about in a sense that they fully understand. As the \nSenator from North Dakota has just stated, this amendment is \ndiscretionary. It does not require the States to do anything.\n\n  We have had 27 votes since we came back into session, and two \nRepublicans defected on one vote. I do not expect any defections on \nthis one. I am not anticipating a big vote. I am not anticipating \nprevailing, but this is an idea whose time, if it has not yet come, is \ncoming.\n  The National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, \nNational Conference of Mayors, and National Association of Counties, \nall have strongly endorsed this measure. I think we can conclude from \nthat that we really do not care what people think unless it comports \nwith what we think.\n  Now, Mr. President, last night, the senior Senator from Maine talked \nabout what a burden this was. And I alluded to the fact that one of our \nvery own Members, Senator Bennett from Utah, was one of the founders of \na business that ships catalogs of office supplies all over the country, \nover $200 million a year in business. When they started out they made a \nconscious decision to collect sales taxes for every State they shipped \ninto that had a sales tax. He tells me that virtually one press of the \ncomputer button at the end of each month does the whole thing. They \nhave never had a minute's problem with it.\n  Now, why would the States maybe want to do this? Forty-five States \nhave a use tax right now, but it is on the consumer. If I bought a \ncomputer and it was shipped across State lines to me from a mail-order \nhouse, in 45 States I would be obligated to pay use tax on that \ncomputer. Most consumers do not know that, but now some States are \nbeginning to enforce the use tax.\n  Let me show you something. Here in Indiana, some people are getting \nrather rude awakenings. People from the revenue department are knocking \non their door and saying, we know that you bought something from Lands' \nEnd or whoever. You owe us the use tax on that out-of-State product. In \n1993, 10,500 people in Indiana were assessed for unpaid use taxes; in \nNew Jersey, 10,000 people; in Ohio, 7,100 people.\n  Some comment was made last night about Maine having this very unique \nthing on their tax return. Know what it is? I will tell you how unique \nit is. On your State income tax return in Maine it says multiply .0004 \ntimes your adjusted gross income and that is how much you will pay for \nmail-order purchases that you made last year. If I lived in Maine I \nwould contest the constitutionality of that. I did not buy anything \nfrom a mail-order house last year so why should I pay the State of \nMaine a percentage of my adjusted gross income? Other States are doing \ndifferent things to collect use tax to help them comply with all these \nterrible mandates we have been putting on them. [[Page S1152]] \n  Somebody else says this is going to be a terrible burden on mail-\norder companies. I have already alluded to Franklin Quest, the company \nthat Senator Bennett started, and the fact that Franklin Quest collects \ntaxes in every State where they ship products. Look, I have about 50 or \n60 catalogs here. This is a 1-week stock at my house. Here is Franklin \nQuest, Senator Bennett's firm. Franklin Quest says, ``Add sales tax on \nthe subtotal for all States except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New \nHampshire, Oregon, and Puerto Rico.'' Know why? Those States do not \nhave a sales tax. So what does Franklin Quest say for the other 45 \nstates? ``Add sales tax.'' Is that complicated? Of course not.\n  Here is CW. CW is located in North Carolina. They say, ``In \nCalifornia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York, add sales tax. In \nNew York, add applicable sales tax to shipping and handling and express \ndelivery charges, too.'' Complicated? Why, of course not. The reason \nthey are saying add sales tax in those States is because they have a \npresence in those States. And that is all this amendment would do. If \nthe State does not want to implement the legislation, it does not have \nto do so.\n\n  So, Mr. President, you must bear in mind, this is going to happen. It \nis just a question of when. The mail order business is burgeoning--L.L. \nBean had a 17-percent increase in sales last year, whereas retail sales \nin the Nation were fairly static. You put all these mandates on the \nStates and you say, ``We want a point of order raised on every issue as \nto whether or not we are fully funding this mandate,'' but I come in \nwith an amendment on behalf of myself and Mr. Graham, of Florida, \nSenators Dorgan and Conrad, of North Dakota, Senator Harkin, of Iowa--\nwe come in here and offer a real bill to help States comply with \nmandates and they say, ``Well, that's not germane. It would be too big \na burden.''\n  They say:\n\n       Call your Governor and see how he wants you to vote on the \n     mandate bill, but don't call him to ask him how he would vote \n     on the Bumpers amendment. We don't want that. We want the \n     Federal Government to belly up and pay all these mandates.\n\n  Mr. President, let me tell you, in closing, that I understand the \nconcerns behind the unfunded mandates bill. I was a Governor in my \nState for 4 years, and we used to squawk continually about that bad old \nFederal Government, unless we were having a flood or a tornado. Did you \nsee that cartoon in the Washington Post the other day, with the guy \nstanding up on top of his house with flood waters up to the roof? Under \nthe water you can see a sign in his front yard saying: ``Get the \nGovernment off my back.'' And he sees this boat from FEMA coming and \nsays, ``Thank God the bureaucrats are coming.''\n  As I say, as Governor, Federal mandates drove me crazy sometimes. But \nI never hesitated to come to the Federal Government for help when I was \nGovernor, and I usually got it. I am not one of these people who think \nGovernment is the root of all evil. Here is an opportunity for this \nplace to stand up and do something responsible and reasonable and it \nwill actually help.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas kept at least \npart of his pledge. He waxed eloquent but not for his usual length of \ntime. I am sure he has a lot more in store for us this afternoon, but I \ncommend him for the enthusiasm with which he is pursuing his particular \namendment.\n  First, let me clarify that this amendment is not about whether or not \nmail order purchases are subject to State sales taxes. They are. Every \nState, other than the four that have been mentioned, impose taxes on \nmail order purchases.\n  The issue at hand is the method by which these taxes are collected. \nUnder the current law, States cannot force out-of-State mail order \ncompanies to collect taxes for them, and the reason is simple: There \nare over 6,000 different tax jurisdictions in the country, and once you \naccount for all of the various State, county, local taxes, it would be \nabsurd to expect mail order companies to know and understand every tone \nand nuance of these various 6,000 tax jurisdictions. Maine has a snack \ntax it imposes. I have a copy of the Bureau of Taxation document from \nthe State of Maine. It is only a summary, but it takes some seven pages \nto explain just the exemptions. And every State has exemptions from \ntheir sales tax.\n  Here is the Maine regulation dealing with fruit baskets, for example. \nIt says:\n\n       Baskets or dishes filled with fruit or other grocery \n     staples are not subject to tax. If the fruit basket is \n     composed mostly of grocery staples, the addition of a minimal \n     quantity of otherwise taxable items, such as a few small \n     pieces of candy, does not affect the taxability of the fruit \n     basket.\n       If the fruit basket contains nonfood items of a significant \n     value, the seller must either collect sales tax on the price \n     of the basket, or else separately and reasonably account for \n     the taxable and nontaxable portions and collect tax on the \n     taxable items.\n\n  This is proposed amendment would certainly create a lot of work for \ntax lawyers and accountants who advise mail-order companies on tax \nprovisions in Maine and every other State in this country.\n  So this is an example of what would happen if the Bumpers amendment \nwere to become law. The problem is not the rate of taxation. It is 6 \npercent in Maine. That is simple enough to understand. The complexity \nis in determining what the tax applies to? And that is the kind of \nburden we would be imposing on all of these mail order companies. Are \nwe going to expect a fruit basket company in California or Florida or \nWisconsin to understand the intricacies of the sales tax, snack tax, of \nthe State of Maine?\n  The mail order industry for years has said, ``Look, we are willing to \nwork something out with the States in order to satisfy their \nproblems.'' They simply ask that taxes be simplified so they collect \none simplified, uniform tax and not be expected to hire an army of tax \nlawyers and accountants.\n  Second, I point out that about 30 percent of all these purchases \nthrough mail order are paid by check. So if the people involved \nincorrectly make out their check or miscalculate the tax due, the mail \norder company is put in a difficult situation. They then have to go \nback to the consumer and say, ``By the way, you miscalculated. Please \nsend us another check.'' That would undermine one of the essential \nbenefits provided by mail order companies--convenience.\n  The industry, as I indicated, and the revenue agencies in the States \ncame very close to reaching an agreement in 1992. I respectfully \nsuggest that they go back to the bargaining table to see if something \ncan be worked out, but I think for the Senate to adopt this amendment \nwould be a serious mistake. First of all, it is a tax bill. The Finance \nCommittee has not held a single hearing on this issue--not this year, \nnot last year or the year before. There has been no hearing before the \nSenate Finance Committee. As a matter of fact, I have a statement, \nwhich I will insert for the Record, from of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee where he indicates, ``Whether to require out-of-State \ncompanies sales taxes is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Senate \nFinance Committee.''\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee urges that we oppose the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, at least until such \ntime as the Finance Committee has an opportunity to examine this with \nsome scrutiny.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Senator Packwood be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COHEN. I think it would be wrong and inappropriate for the Senate \nto pass judgment on an important matter that I believe deserves at \nleast full-scale hearings before the Senate Finance Committee.\n  At a time when we are trying to put the brakes on the onslaught of \nregulations, the Bumpers amendment would in fact bring a new regulatory \nscheme on mail order companies. There is something in this particular \namendment that caught my eye. Under this amendment, States requiring \nmail order companies to collect out-of-State taxes would be required to \nset up a 1-800 number.\n  It sounds to me like another unfunded mandate. And that is what we \n[[Page S1153]] continue to do here. This is supposed to be a bill to \nreduce unfunded mandates. Yet this amendment appears to contain its own \nunfunded mandate.\n  The notion that mail order companies attract customers because they \noffer some great tax shelter is incorrect. I do not think people buy \nfrom L.L. Bean because they offer a great way to avoid taxes. They buy \nfrom L.L. Bean because they get a great product. They have great \nservice. You call up and order something, or you mail in your order and \noften within 48 hours you have your product. They have a return policy \nthat if you have a product you think is defective, whether you find it \ndefective in 30 days or a year or 2 years or 5 years, you can return \nthe product and have it replaced, no questions asked.\n  That is why L.L. Bean is so well renowned. That is why it is one of \nthe biggest mail-order companies in the country. And that is why people \norder; not because they can buy a sweater from L.L. Bean and avoid \ntaxes. As a matter of fact, if you buy a sweater and you have to pay \nthe shipping and the handling charges, it will exceed any taxes you \ncould save if you were inclined to avoid them. For the Senator from \nArkansas to say only about 1 percent of the people of Arkansas even \nknow that they have to pay a tax when they buy from out of State, the \nanswer is why do we not simply educate the people or impose a \ncollection mechanism like the State of Maine has where there is a \npresumptive amount of tax, based on your income?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for one observation?\n  Mr. COHEN. Please wait until I finish my statement, and I will.\n  Now, I know that the Senator last night was bemoaning the plight of \nsmall shops on Main Street America.\n  I might say that what has probably done more damage to those shops on \nMain Street America is Wal-Mart. If you want to hear complaints from \npeople about what has happened to mom-and-pop stores on Main Street, be \nit Bangor, ME, or elsewhere, look at Wal-Mart.\n  I do not fault Wal-Mart. I think they provide great benefits for \nconsumers. We have one in Bangor, in Portland, and elsewhere. They do a \nvery fine job. But they put many small businesses out of business. I \nsimply want to make the point that this amendment is not about \ndefending small town America or small mom-and-pop shops.\n  In her own statement to the Small Business Committee last year, a \nspokeswoman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, \nsupporters of the Bumpers bill, said that retailers were happy to \ncollect sales taxes because they ``realize that these sales taxes play \nan important role in financing important State and local services on \nwhich the shopping centers rely.''\n  So I would say, if fairness is going to be the issue, is it really \nfair to ask a company some 3,000 miles away to collect another State's \ntaxes? Some would say no. The mail order industry, to its credit, \nhowever, has never said no. As I have pointed out, they have said: We \nare willing to reach an agreement with these State collection agencies, \nbut let us make it a reasonable agreement. Do not expect us to \ncalculate all the taxes and have different taxes and different \nexemptions, and figure out what Maine means versus Vermont or \nMassachusetts or Arkansas or California or Wisconsin or elsewhere.\n  The Senator from Arkansas suggests that this is really a small \nbusiness bill. Well, last fall the National Federation of Business, \nNFIB, polled its members on the issue and found that 67 percent of the \nmembers opposed forcing mail order companies to collect out-of-State \ntaxes, and I think it is probably the best window that we have into the \nsoul of small business in this country.\n  If they oppose the measure so significantly, it is difficult to see \nhow you can portray it as being helpful to small business. But that is \ndebatable, I concede. That is debatable.\n  What I think is not debatable is to bring this tax-related amendment \nup on this bill. It is not germane to the bill. The Senator from \nArkansas is correct. He has every right to bring it up under the Senate \nrules. But, if the Democratic response to what happened last November \nis going to be to stall legislation and think that holds the key to a \nDemocratic victory in 1996, I suggest the Democrats have misread what \nhappened in the elections.\n  I think the people want action to be taken. I think they want to have \nless regulation. I think they want to see both Houses of Congress move \nas expeditiously as possible. And if the Democrats' answer is, well, we \nare just going to stall this thing right into 1966, then I suggest \nthere may be far more Republicans elected in 1996.\n  The success of Republican candidates in November not because \nRepublicans were stalling in the 103d Congress. There was significant \ndisagreement with the health care proposals that were coming before the \nbodies of this Congress. There was substantial reaction to what they \nsaw as a massive centralization of the health care system in this \ncountry. And they saw a drift among Democrats away from the center back \nto the left.\n  That, in my judgment, accounts for what happened in November. And so \nif the answer of the Democratic Party is going to be to just simply \nslow everything down, to come up with whatever amendment they feel is \nimportant, no matter how relevant or germane to the bill at hand, then \nI suggest we are going to see a lot more Republicans in 1996 in the \nSenate and House than we did in 1994.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               EXHIBIT 1\n\n  Statement by Senator Bob Packwood on Bumpers' Mail Order Sales Tax \n                               Amendment\n\n       Whether to require out-of state companies sales taxes is a \n     matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Senate \n     Finance Committee.\n       The conflict in this area is between states wanting to \n     collect revenue, local merchants, mail order companies, like \n     Norm Thompson and Harry and David located in my home state of \n     Oregon, and consumers.\n       However, the conflict does not include the federal \n     government. The American people want less government and \n     fewer federal regulations. The unfunded mandates bill is \n     directed at just this.\n       Currently, states collect their own sales tax without \n     interference from the federal government. Ten states collect \n     these taxes from consumers through a separate line on their \n     state's income tax form.\n       For example, the State of Maine has found an effective \n     solution for collecting mail order sales taxes. It included a \n     default provision for these circumstances. If a taxpayer \n     leaves the sales tax line blank on their income tax form, \n     then the state automatically adds an amount equal to the \n     average tax owed on out-of-state purchases. Maine calculates \n     this amount at 0.0366 percent of the taxpayer's income. In \n     other words, a taxpayer making $30,000 per annum would pay a \n     tax of $11.00.\n       Obviously states are fully capable of dealing with the \n     collection of their sales taxes without the interference of \n     the federal government.\n       For these reasons, I oppose the amendment of the Senator \n     from Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come here today to express my opposition \nto the amendment offered by my colleague from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  I would like to begin by noting the irony of our current situation; \nnamely, that as we attempt to relieve the burdens imposed on State and \nlocal governments, we very well may, unless we reject this amendment, \nend up using the same legislation to impose new mandates on job-\ncreating businesses across our country.\n  Mr. President, the proposed amendment would allow States to require \ncompanies that mail goods to their States to collect taxes on those \ngoods. Under my colleague's proposal, mail order businesses would be \nsaddled with the immense burden of complying with multiple sets of \nprocedures and regulations, different tax rates, and various filing \nrequirements. And in those instances where a State allows a company to \ncollect local taxes according to a blended average local tax rate, \nconsumers, in many cases, could end up paying more tax than they \nactually owe.\n  Mail order companies are part of a growing industry. They serve \npeople who like the convenience of phone shopping or who are unable to \nleave their homes to shop. They also offer rural and small town \nconsumers an unsurpassed variety of goods, many of which are simply \nunavailable in smaller markets. This industry also affords \n[[Page S1154]] small specialty businesses, like the Pleasant Co. of \nMiddleton, WI, the chance to grow into successful big businesses. And \ngrowing mail order business like Swiss Colony and Lands' End, also \nlocated in Wisconsin, account for 5 percent of U.S. employment or \napproximately 5 million jobs.\n  The last time that this measure was considered by Congress, over \n500,000 mail order consumers wrote in to voice their strong objections \nto this measure. They did so because they are tired of the ever \nincreasing mountain of federally mandated paperwork and taxes. I \nbelieve that we need to heed their message and move in the direction of \neliminating, rather than increasing these burdens.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I note that my colleague's proposal has not \nbeen reviewed by the Finance Committee. At a minimum--and certainly \nwithout presuming to speak for either Chairman Packwood or Senator \nMoynihan--I would urge my good friend to work with the Finance \nCommittee to achieve a considered resolution to this matter.\n  In closing Mr. President, it is said that the only sure things in \nlife are death and taxes. This amendment represents both: taxes for \nconsumers and certain death--crushed under a load of tax rules, \nregulations, and requirements--for many mail order companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n20 minutes further debate on the Bumpers amendment, equally divided, \nand that will be controlled by the Senator from Arkansas and the senior \nSenator from Maine; that prior to the motion to table--and at the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time Senator Cohen or his designee \nbe recognized to make a motion to table the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I must object to that at this point. \nSenator Graham wants 10 or 15 minutes and I have 3 or 4 minutes of \nwrap-up I want to do.\n  Could the junior Senator from Maine give us some idea how much time \nshe might wish?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Probably about 8 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. About 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We would be willing to accept 20 minutes on our side and \n8 minutes for her, which would be 28 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I again submit my unanimous-consent \nagreement: That we have 30 minutes, 20 minutes on the Democratic side \nand 10 minutes on the Republican side, at which point then Senator \nCohen will be making a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think the amendment pending before the \nSenate today is an example of why we should have invoked cloture, \nbecause it is nongermane to the pending subject of unfunded mandates.\n  As has already been mentioned during the course of this debate, this \nnongermane amendment has not had a hearing from the committee that \nrightfully would consider it and is responsible for tax legislation--\nthat is, of course, the Finance Committee. There was one hearing on \nthis issue in the last Congress that was held in the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  Last night I joined the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] in opposing \nthis amendment because it not only oversimplifies an issue that should \nbe properly discussed and analyzed by the Finance Committee, but it \nalso disregards the true balance that exists between the mail order \ncompanies and local businesses with the already tested options and the \nviable options that are available to States and mail order companies, \nand certainly the options that have been pursued already by the State \nof Maine.\n  There is nothing that precludes any State in America from collecting \nthese taxes. We have already demonstrated that in the State of Maine. \nTaxpayers in the State have a choice. They either can pay a flat tax \npercentage of their income on their income tax return, or they can pay \nfor the specific tax on their out-of-State purchases.\n  No one questions the veracity of the citizens of the State of Maine \nwith respect to submitting that information on their income tax return. \nIn fact, it is interesting to note that in the last 2 tax years in the \nState of Maine, we have collected more than $3.5 million on sales from \nout-of-State mail order companies or other kinds of purchases from \nother companies. So it can work. And it has worked. And it can work for \nother States as well.\n  What will be the impact of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArkansas? We have already held it is certainly going to exact more \ncosts to companies. They will be required to contend with 46 sets of \nprocedures and 6,000 different tax jurisdictions throughout the United \nStates that will result in 6.5 times greater costs to the mail order \ncompanies in order to comply with this amendment. Who is that fair to? \nShould the consumer be denied a choice in ordering from a mail order \ncompany? No. I happen to live in a very rural State. People like to \nhave choices in rural districts and they certainly should not be denied \nthat choice. In Maine, taxpayers pay for those purchases by, again, \nplacing it on their income tax return.\n  So it is not only going to result in more costs to the mail order \ncompanies, it is certainly going to result in lost jobs because of the \nincreased costs in terms of compliance and increased cost in taxes.\n  Some have suggested a blended tax rate. Who is that fair to, since \nmany of the taxpayers then will have to pay a higher tax rate and some \na lower tax rate than they would already be required to pay? The \nindustry has worked in the past, as Senator Cohen mentioned--they had \nworked out a tentative agreement. I think we should encourage such an \nagreement between the mail order industry and their associations and \ntax administrators and the tax commission, so that we can encourage \nthat kind of resolution to this issue that would be fair and not \nonerous and not be applying greater costs in terms of taxes and \nadministrative burdens on the mail order companies. That is only fair.\n  This is a very complex issue. It does deserve the benefit of \nconsideration, of hearings, and of different perspectives. It certainly \nis going to result in more costs to the mail order companies. In fact--\nwe have mentioned L.L. Bean. Their compliance costs alone would be at \nleast $500,000 in order to hire additional workers for administrative, \nlegal, and accounting costs.\n  So I do not think in the final analysis this benefits anybody. It \ndoes not prevent States right now from collecting this kind of tax.\n  I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will reject such an amendment \nbecause this deserves more consideration than this issue has been given \nhere on the floor, in terms of the ramifications for not only the \ncompanies but also the consumers who live in the various States, who \nchoose to make their purchases through mail order companies.\n  So I urge the defeat of this amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to my colleague from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the statement has been made that this is \nnot a germane amendment. I suggest to the contrary, this goes to the \nvery essence of why we are concerned about unfunded mandates. The basic \nconcern is that the Federal Government has been imposing financial \nresponsibilities on State and local governments without providing the \nmeans by which those responsibilities be discharged. What this \namendment speaks to is enhancing the capacity of State and local \ngovernments to deal with those very responsibilities.\n  It is particularly germane in the context of what I think is going to \nbe a [[Page S1155]] surprise and disappointment to many of the \nsupporters of this bill, of which I am one. That is that the \nlegislation before us only deals with actions which will occur in the \nfuture. Those Governors and mayors and commissioners who have \ncalculated the current cost of unfunded mandates to their States, to \ntheir communities, run the potential of having unrealized expectations \nif they think we are about to do something in this bill that is going \nto lower that current cost of current mandates.\n  What we are doing with this amendment is providing some revenue to \nState and local communities so they can discharge their \nresponsibilities, including those responsibilities which we have in the \npast imposed upon them without funding and for which we do not have any \nintention to provide funding under this legislation.\n  This goes beyond, however, an issue of appropriateness to some issues \nof basic fairness. A constituent of mine in Bonita Springs, FL, is \nnamed Joyce Maloney. In 1994, at the hearing before the Small Business \nCommittee that was alluded to a few moments ago, she testified and she \ntalked about one aspect of unfairness. She talked about how when she \nhad moved into her new home in Bonita Springs, she and her husband \nwanted to buy some furniture and they went down to the local furniture \nstores, they looked at the furniture, looked at the prices. Then \nsomeone called them up and said, ``Could I come out and see you about \npossibly buying your furniture through a mail order house from out of \nState?''\n  In the course of making his presentation on the furniture he \nindicated to them that, ``Since the furniture was to be delivered to \nour home in Florida, no sales tax would be applied to the sales. Beside \nthat, he told us, the delivery charge which you are paying will offset \nthe sales tax that you will not be required to pay.''\n  Of course he was defrauding Ms. Maloney because she was responsible--\nnot for a sales tax but for its exact equivalent, the use tax, upon her \nreceipt.\n  In fact, she ended up being one of the people that the Florida \nDepartment of Revenue contacted about unpaid use tax on this large \nfurniture order. Ms. Maloney received a bill from the Florida \nDepartment of Revenue for $226.26 for unpaid use tax. She was misled. \nShe not only was taken away as a potential customer from the local \nbusiness, but she ended up having to pay a tax, a use tax, the \nequivalent of a sales tax, which she had been led to believe would not \nbe her responsibility.\n  I will just quote, before submitting for the Record the full text of \nMs. Maloney's concluding paragraph:\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, it is time to \n     correct this situation and bring about truth in the \n     marketplace. I have no problem in paying sales tax that is \n     due on any purchase I make. But what I despise is receiving \n     inaccurate and fraudulent information regarding my obligation \n     to remit sales taxes. It is time to shift the sales tax \n     remittance burden from the consumer to the retailer so that \n     everyone plays and pays by the same rules.\n\n  I agree with Ms. Maloney.\n  Mr. President, her letter also indicates the other major area of \nunfairness, and that is unfairness to the local retail community. It is \nvery difficult for the small business person, whether they are selling \nfurniture in Bonita Springs or whether they are selling men's garments \nin Hot Springs, AR, to compete when your competition starts by being \nable to sell 5, 6, or 7 percent below you because they are not being \nrequired to collect and remit the sales tax.\n  Why we would countenance a system that would allow that degree of \ninequality and unfairness in the marketplace is beyond me, except I \nknow why we did it up until 1992. We did it because there was an \nassumption that under the U.S. Constitution, test of reach of one State \nto assess tax in another, it was unconstitutional and unconstitutional \nin a form that was not susceptible to remedy for a State to require an \nout-of-State mail order house to remit sales taxes on items sold.\n  But in 1992, in the case of Quill Corp. versus North Dakota, the \nSupreme Court held that States may not require out-of-State companies \nto collect use tax because to do so would impose a burden on interstate \ncommerce. But the court went further by saying that Congress could \nauthorize such a burden on interstate commerce, and that if it did so, \nStates would then be allowed to make such collection.\n  So it has been since 1992 that the U.S. Supreme Court has extended to \nus the opportunity to do what Senator Bumpers proposes that we do \ntoday. I hope that we will follow his leadership; that is, to authorize \nStates, if they choose to do so, to utilize this new authority to apply \ntheir sales taxes to sales made by firms which solicit business within \na State which mail items into the State but which today are not \nrequired to collect and remit the sales tax on those items.\n  Mr. President, this is not an insignificant issue. Senator Bumpers \nhas distributed the estimate of the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations on what the total potential additional \nrevenue to the States and local communities would be from mail order \nsales using 1994 numbers. In my State of Florida alone, it is estimated \nthat $168.9 million of sales currently is not subject to our State \nsales tax because they are sales from out-of-State mail order houses \nselling into the State of Florida. That $168 million would go a long \nway to funding the mandates that the Federal Government has made on the \nState of Florida and its communities, for which there will be no \ncompensation under this legislation; $168 million would allow the State \nto better meet those standards of expectation which the Federal \nGovernment has set in transportation, in law enforcement, in \nenvironmental protection, and in a whole array of areas in which we \nhave seen fit to impose these burdens on States and communities.\n  I believe that this is an extremely important and germane amendment. \nIt speaks to fundamental issues of fairness and to our responsibility \nas the Federal Government to treat fairly our partners in government at \nthe State and local level, and more importantly, to treat fairly our \ncitizens, citizens whether they are the small merchants trying to \nsurvive in an increasingly competitive market or whether they are the \nmisled purchasers, the Ms. Maloneys of America, that they would also be \ntreated fairly.\n  This will provide to our communities a greater capacity to be able to \naccept the obligations that we have forced upon them in the past, and \nwill continue to apply to them whether this underlying legislation is \nadopted or not.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas \nfor his commitment, his wisdom, and his tenacity in advocating this \nposition. I urge my colleagues to follow his leadership.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First, Mr. President, let me thank very sincerely my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Graham, for his very fine statement, \nvery accurate statement, and very heartfelt statement. Like me, he is a \nformer Governor. He understands precisely what we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Graham, Dorgan, \nConrad, and Harkin be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me address one of the things the \nSenator from Maine, Mr. Cohen, said about 6,000 different tax \njurisdictions in the country. Our bill would involve only 45 different \ntax rates because it provides for a blended rate within each state.\n  As for the exemptions on food, which the State revenue department of \nMaine told the Senator would be an impossible chore, I want to point \nout to you that I believe the biggest seller of food by mail order \nhouses in the country is Harry and David. They ship fruit and they ship \nnonfood articles. What do they say on their order form? ``Please add \nsales tax. See page 2.'' Page 2, ``Sales tax information. We collect \nState and local taxes on all nonfood items delivered to the following \nStates.''\n  Then they have stars and asterisks, and so on. They have about 30 \nStates listed here. Then, down below, it says, ``These States also \nrequire sales tax on all candy items.'' Illinois requires 1 percent tax \non all food items. Then there is a pound mark. ``These States require \nsales tax on all items.'' [[Page S1156]] \n  If Harry and David can handle it with one hand behind them, why is \nthat such a big impediment?\n  The truth of the matter is that is just another smokescreen. The \ntruth of the matter is, there is absolutely no trick to it. Otherwise, \ndozens of companies would not be doing it. If the Boy Scouts of America \ncan collect sales tax on their catalogs, surely L.L. Bean and Lands' \nEnd can.\n  Then, Mr. President, bear in mind, there are 7,500 mail-order houses \nin this country. My amendment would exempt all with sales less than $3 \nmillion a year. So there are no mom-and-pop operators that are going to \nsuffer under this amendment. How many does that leave? It leaves 825, \nand 6,675 are exempt under my amendment. We have a 1-800 number for \nevery State revenue department so any catalog house that has any \nquestion can call toll free to the States and find out what they are \nsupposed to do, if they have any question.\n  The Senator from Maine has very appropriately raised the question \nabout what Wal-Mart--which he knows well is in my home State. We are \nproud of them. We have a lot of billionaires in Arkansas, and we are \nproud of every one of them. But I will tell you what Wal-Mart does. \nThey collect sales tax. They collect sales taxes that go to the local \nschools and other purposes. Their sales in 1994 were over $100 billion, \nand they collect sales tax on every dime of it. You see, Wal-Mart alone \ndoes about the same amount of business that all these mail-order houses \ndo. And the big difference is Wal-Mart is a good citizen, collecting \ntaxes to keep the schools going, to keep the fire department going, to \nkeep the police department going, to keep the landfill going. And many \nmail-order companies collect nothing.\n  It is an elemental question of fairness. I have letters from all over \nthe United States. Here is a woman I happen to know, Debbie White, \nBenton, AR. It says: We have ``a small retail furniture business. I \nhave personally lost individual sales in my area for $15,000 to \n$20,000. They go out of State. They come in here and pick out what they \nwant and they go to the catalog and order it. We support the schools. \nWe have the merchandise here that they can feel and touch. We carry a \nbig inventory and we employ nothing but Arkansas people. We lose \nthousands of dollars of business every year to people who pay \nnothing.''\n  Here is a letter from a little 75-year-old woman in Portland, TN, Mr. \nPresident: ``I buy several hundred dollars' worth of mail-order \nmerchandise per year. I am 75 years old and can no longer drive to the \ncity to shop.'' She said she knows there are a lot in her situation. \n``Since I have always tried to be a law-abiding citizen, I added up all \nmy records--because the other day I found out that our State has a tax \nthat I am supposed to pay on anything I buy from a mail-order house.'' \nShe said she once ordered many Christmas gifts through catalogs. She \nsaid, ``I believe it is the duty of the mail-order companies to collect \nsales taxes due just as other stores and grocers do. Modern computers \ncertainly make it easy for them.''\n  Here is a letter from a man in Hilton Head, SC. Just briefly, \nparaphrasing, he says: ``We bought thousands of dollars' worth of North \nCarolina furniture to furnish our new home in South Carolina because we \nwere told if we bought it in North Carolina and had it shipped in, we \nwould not have to pay any sales tax. So we went up to North Carolina \nand bought all this merchandise and what happens? Four years later, we \ngot a letter from the South Carolina Department of Revenue, saying we \nhave to pay sales tax on this, and because of the penalties, it cost us \n$700.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that all three of those letters be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          White Furniture Co.,\n\n                                     Benton, AR, January 19, 1994.\n     Senator Dale Bumpers,\n     Dirksen Building-229,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: I want to make you aware of an unfair \n     tax situation that has been occurring for years in the \n     furniture business. For quite some time we tried to ignore \n     this, but when you see or hear the results every day of the \n     week you have to finally stop and take notice.\n       My family has a small retail furniture business in \n     Arkansas. We have paid taxes in the same small town for \n     years. Now we have customers who are being educated by \n     advertisers to shop their local retail stores for model \n     numbers and prices--then call North Carolina and order and \n     avoid paying our state sales taxes.\n       I have personally lost individual sales in my area for \n     fifteen to twenty thousand dollars. We have found that the \n     larger sales are the ones that people do out of state because \n     of the high percentage of tax.\n       I'm not crying about the prices; I would just like to have \n     a level playing field. We service our clients with free \n     delivery; we furnish the showrooms where they can touch and \n     feel the merchandise; we finance the merchandise locally, and \n     we employ Arkansas people to sell and deliver the furniture.\n       Last year NBC did a travel segment and, on over 200 \n     stations across our country, showed people how to take their \n     vacations in North Carolina, shop while they are there and \n     save enough in sales tax to pay for their vacation. Then CBS \n     did a week long special on ``Good Morning America,'' devoting \n     one day to furniture, one to cars, and another to clothes, \n     etc.\n       I don't know about the other 49 states, but I do know that \n     our state could use the revenue from those lost sales taxes \n     for our schools, roads, and local government.\n       I will be proud to support you in any effort you can make \n     to help our state collect these unpaid taxes.\n       Thank you.\n     Debbie White.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Portland, TN,\n\n                                                September 8, 1994.\n     Senator Dale Bumpers,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: When I moved from Nashville to a \n     small town a number of years ago, I discovered the \n     convenience of mail-order buying. I buy several hundred \n     dollars worth of merchandise per year. I am 75 years old and \n     can no longer drive to the city to shop. I know there are \n     probably thousands in my situation.\n       Several months ago I heard on our local news that people \n     purchasing goods from mail order catalogs must pay State \n     sales and use tax on these items. That was news to me. I, and \n     I know many others, have always thought that merchandise \n     purchased outside our state was not subject to sales tax \n     unless such a vendor had a store within our state.\n       Since I have always tried to be a law-abiding citizen, I \n     added up from my records all purchases made in recent years, \n     figured the sales tax, and mailed a check to the State \n     Department of Revenue. But what about those many people who \n     still do not know they are liable for these taxes? This \n     situation makes it unfair to those who are paying.\n       I once ordered many Christmas gifts from catalogs. Now I am \n     inclined to send money to my out-of-town relatives, avoiding \n     the hassle of tax-record keeping.\n       I believe it is the duty of mail order companies to collect \n     sales taxes due, just as other stores and grocers do. Modern-\n     day computers certainly make it easy for them.\n       I understand you are working on legislation to correct this \n     situation. I hope you will succeed.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Mamie R. Willis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              Hilton Head, SC,\n\n                                               September 12, 1994.\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. \n         Senate,Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bumpers: While on a trip to North Carolina a \n     few years ago, my wife and I visited a furniture store to \n     look for items for our winter home in Hilton Head, South \n     Carolina. As you are no doubt aware, North Carolina is the \n     furniture center of America. People come from all over \n     America to buy furniture in North Carolina, drawn by word of \n     mouth and various means of advertising.\n       As we shopped at one store in High Point, my wife and I \n     found a number of furniture pieces that we were interested in \n     buying. While considering the purchase, we were told by the \n     sales staff that if this furniture were delivered to our home \n     in South Carolina, no sales tax would be collected. This \n     represented a savings of several hundred dollars, and became \n     one factor in our decision to make the purchase. \n     Subsequently, we concluded the purchase agreement, and the \n     furniture was delivered to our home in South Carolina a short \n     time later.\n       Approximately four years after making that purchase, we \n     were surprised to receive a letter from the South Carolina \n     Department of Revenue informing us that the furniture we had \n     purchased in North Carolina was subject to South Carolina's \n     use tax. (South Carolina had learned about the purchase when \n     North Carolina audited the furniture company and shared the \n     audit information with South Carolina.) In addition to the 5 \n     percent tax, we owed interest and penalties because we had \n     failed to pay the tax promptly. On our furniture purchase of \n     some $10,000, the total amount we owed for tax, interest and \n     penalties was approximately $700.\n       As you can imagine, we were shocked and upset at this news. \n     We had no idea that we [[Page S1157]] owed tax on this \n     purchase. Like most consumers, we were accustomed to having \n     sales taxes collected at the time of purchase, and it seemed \n     odd to expect the customer to know when, where and how much \n     tax to pay. And because the furniture salesman had told us \n     that no tax would be ``collected,'' we assumed that no tax \n     existed.\n       I am not complaining about the tax itself. I certainly do \n     not enjoy paying taxes, but had we known about this tax at \n     the time of purchase, it wouldn't have been so bad. In that \n     case, we could have considered the tax as part of the cost of \n     the transaction and then made an informed decision about \n     whether to make the purchase or not. Indeed, it's quite \n     possible that we would still have bought the furniture. \n     But we were blindsided. We were led to believe that there \n     was no tax, then told four years later that there was a \n     tax. That simply is not fair.\n       The worst part of this situation is that we were expected \n     to pay interest and penalties. As I told the South Carolina \n     Department of Revenue, I felt that this was particularly \n     unreasonable since we didn't even know we owed the tax--and \n     they didn't know we owed the taxes for four years. In the \n     end, I won half the battle: they agreed to waive the \n     penalties, but we still had to pay the interest.\n       I understand that the State of South Carolina cannot \n     control what North Carolina merchants tell their customers. \n     But the United States Congress can and should do so. I urge \n     you to pass legislation immediately correcting this situation \n     so that other consumers do not have the same bad experience \n     we had.\n       In my opinion, you should require merchants who ship goods \n     to other states to inform those customers that taxes may \n     apply. The disclosure should be in writing, and the \n     customer's signature should be required. Any merchant who \n     fails to give the disclosure should have to pay 50 percent of \n     any penalties or interest that occur. I believe this would \n     discourage companies from failing to share important \n     information with the consumer.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you \n     on this issue. I hope that you will move quickly to ensure \n     that other consumers aren't misled the way my wife and I \n     were.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         John Dix.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How would you like to be Debbie White? She also sells \nwallpaper. How would you like to be Debbie White, paying State sales \ntaxes, privilege taxes, every tax under the shining sun the State can \nimpose on you, working just to keep your head above water, and have \nsomebody walk in and take your time for an hour looking through \nwallcoverings, and they walk out saying nothing, and suddenly you \nrealize that they saw this ad that said: ``Shop in your neighborhood, \nwrite down the pattern number, and then call us.''\n  Who here thinks that is fair? Or here, a boat company. I put a letter \nin the Record last night where a woman and her husband in the boat \nbusiness in California spent all kinds of time and thousands of dollars \ntrying to make a $250,000 boat sale. After spending all that money and \ntime trying to sell this boat, the customer says, ``Thank you very much \nfor your time, but we have just discovered we can go to Oregon and buy \nthis boat and keep it out of the State of California for some \nprescribed period of time and bring it here and save ourselves \n$19,000.'' And here, what does this boat company's ad say? ``No sales \ntax added outside of North Carolina.''\n  Who here thinks this is fair? Not one. Not one. I would love to \ndebate this, as I did before the National Governors' Conference last \nyear. I think there were seven Governors in that room who objected to \nthis--the Governor of Wisconsin and others who have big mail order \nhouses in their states. This amendment, I promise you, will provide \nmore relief, by far, to the States than the mandates bill ever will. \nThe problem with the mandates bill is, by the time we debate a point of \norder on every single bill we pass in the future, that is all we will \nhave time to do. You talk about gridlock. You wait until these points \nof order start being raised.\n  Mr. President, when Senator Pryor and I were Governors, we used to \ncondemn the Federal Government for its mandates. If I were Governor \ntoday, I would condemn the Federal Government for not passing this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine controls 4 minutes 3 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I was intrigued with the comments made by \nthe Senator from Florida. He indicated that this was an important \nsubject matter. He said it was not an insignificant issue. I agree. \nThat is precisely my point. This is not an insignificant issue. This is \nsomething that deserves a hearing before the appropriate committee.\n  He also said that $168 million in Florida is not subject to sales \ntax. I do not believe that is correct. It is subject to a sales tax. \nThe State has a right to collect it from its citizens.\n  As my colleague from the State of Maine has indicated, 10 States now, \nsince the Supreme Court decision, have adopted statutes that impose a \ncollection burden upon their own citizens. Other states can do the \nsame. It is not unreasonable to ask the States to educate their own \ncitizens somehow, perhaps with a notice with their income tax forms \nsaying ``If you have made purchases out of State, mail order or \notherwise, a sales tax is owed.''\n  The Senator from Arkansas said, ``If Harry and David can handle the \nsale of candies and sweets through interstate commerce, why cannot \neverybody else?'' I say, what about Thelma and Louise? Harry and David \nmay be able to do it, but maybe the smaller companies cannot. That is \nthe problem with this approach. Again, this is why a thorough hearing \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee is necessary.\n  I quoted earlier from the Senator from Oregon, chairman of the \nFinance Committee. He said:\n\n       Currently States collect their own sales tax without \n     interference from the Federal Government. Ten States collect \n     these taxes from consumers from a separate line on the \n     State's income tax. Obviously, States are fully capable of \n     dealing with the collection of their sales taxes without the \n     interference of the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. President, if Mrs. Maloney was defrauded, she has a legitimate \ncomplaint. But we ought not paint the entire industry with the same \nbrush. No reputable mail-order company is out there willfully \ndefrauding their customers.\n  But again, those are serious matters that deserve to be fully aired \nbefore any legislation is adopted. The Senator mentioned his testimony \nbefore the Governors' Conference, and I respectfully say to him he \nshould bring his debate before the Finance Committee. That is the \nappropriate jurisdiction to argue the merits and equity and seek a \nproper resolution of this issue, not with an amendment to an unfunded \nmandates bill that we are currently considering.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his remaining \ntime?\n\n\n                          Additional Cosponsor\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Before yielding back my time, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to add Senator Domenici to the bill that I introduced \nearlier this morning, the health care fraud bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. COHEN. I renew my motion to table the amendment and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers]. The yeas and nays have been \nordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 25, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 28 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg [[Page S1158]] \n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--25\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n       \n  So, the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 144) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let the Record show that we have now \ncompleted action on another nongermane amendment. We had a cloture vote \nat 12:15. So we have consumed half the day on a nongermane amendment. \nWe have not had a germane amendment yet to this bill. We are on the \nfifth day. If anybody can tell me with a straight face that they are \nserious about passing this bill on the other side, then I would be \nhappy to entertain such thought.\n  We are not getting anywhere with this bill. We are getting calls in \nour office from mayors and county commissioners and Governors: ``Why \nwon't you pass this bill?'' I am prepared to pass the bill. We are \nprepared to listen to real amendments. We have not had any real \namendments. Then we get some nongermane amendment and took an hour last \nnight and 2 hours today--3 hours on an amendment that does not even \nbelong on this bill.\n  So I guess the question is, are we going to have any real amendments \nor are we going to continue this game of nongermane, nonrelevant \namendments just so we can eat up the time and suddenly just let this \nbill go away, I guess.\n  But, again, I urge the President of the United States, who supports \nthis bill, maybe to call some of his colleagues and say, ``Why don't \nyou pass the bill?'' The Governors want it, the President wants it, \nDemocrats, Republicans. Why do we have to have 78 amendments? What is \nwrong with the U.S. Senate? Why can we not move?\n  My view is the American people, whether they are watching or not, \nknow what is happening--nothing; nothing is happening. If it is not \ngoing to happen today, it is going to happen tomorrow, it is going to \nhappen Monday. It is going to be late, late, late tonight, late, late, \nlate tomorrow night, if we have to go through the amendments one at a \ntime and waste 3 hours on a nongermane amendment. If we cannot get time \nagreements on some of these amendments, that is fine; we understand the \ngame that is being played. The American people do not, but they will \nbefore it is over. This is day No. 5, and we have yet to have a germane \namendment to this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with great respect, let me rise to \nclarify what I think the situation is. We had a Levin-Kempthorne \namendment this morning. As I understand, it was germane. If people are \nnow coming to the floor offering their nongermane amendments, in part \nit may be because they are worried about invoking cloture and again not \nhaving the ability to offer amendments, whether they are relevant or \ngermane or not.\n  But I will say again to all of my colleagues that we are prepared to \nwork through the pending amendments, maybe in some cases come to some \ntime agreement, whittle away some of the amendments that may not be \nnecessary. I have already been able to get an agreement from some of \nour colleagues that they will not offer some of the amendments that \nwere on the list that I presented to the distinguished majority leader \nyesterday.\n  So let there be no mistake, this may be day five, but this was only \nthe fourth or fifth amendment that we have had the ability to debate.\n  So I hope that we can continue to work away in good faith on these \namendments. I hope that before the end of the day, we might again have \nanother list which will give both the majority leader and myself the \nopportunity to see where we are realistically and certainly move ahead \nwith this legislation. There is no one on this side who does not want a \nvote on final passage at some point on this bill. We simply want our \nability to offer amendments and to raise legitimate concerns protected.\n  I hope we can work together to accomplish that. I know we can. And I \nhope that in the not-too-distant future, we can find an agreement and \nultimately come to some meaningful conclusion of this legislation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will propose maybe a different line here. \nLast year, we brought out S. 993, and for reasons we are all familiar \nwith and I will not go back over again, we were not able to get it \nthrough last year. It was a good bill. We worked on it very hard. \nSenator Kempthorne had taken the lead on that and did a terrific job in \nputting that together. I worked with him. We brought it out of \ncommittee.\n  We had 67 cosponsors, I will tell the majority leader. On S. 993, we \nhad 67 cosponsors, and I think almost all those people would still be \navailable if we proposed S. 993. That was supported by the big seven \ngroups of State, local, and county officials, and so on. Under cloture, \nI guess there might be a germaneness rule against that only because our \nprovisions in that bill for CBO had some additional requirements that \nS. 1 does not now have.\n  S. 1 was to be an improvement over S. 993, but what it does basically \nis it changes some of the ways the points of order are administered. \nBut S. 993 is still a basic bill, a little simpler than this. It still \nwould draw major support on our side. I would think we could get an \nearly vote on that. Maybe that would be one option here.\n  Let me just add while we have the majority leader on the floor that I \nsaid in committee that I hope we could consider all these different \nthings that would improve S. 1 in committee because when we got to the \nfloor, it was going to draw amendments like flies. I did not know how \ntrue that was going to be.\n  But maybe going back to S. 993 would be a very rapid way to get out \nof this because we had 67 cosponsors last year. I doubt we would lose \nmany of them now. I think we would gain back some of the people who are \nobjecting to some of the procedures on S. 1.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask the majority leader's opinion as to whether we \nshould go back to S. 993.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not have an opinion on that. I think we have a good \nproduct before us, if we could just move on it. S. 993 may have been \ngood. This may be even a little better.\n  I think it is still a bipartisan effort, the last I understood. It \nwas not a partisan effort. We do not want to make it a partisan effort, \nbut we want to finish the bill. I want to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest when the Senator from Ohio----\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I made this request last night. Again, I \nwill say generally it is just routine around here that we adopt the \ncommittee amendments. Any former chairman or present chairman knows \nthat we adopt the committee amendments. Now and then--rarely--you get \nan objection. We are only on, what, No. 11, 5 days. We had to table \nsome. Just to get action, we tabled some of the committee amendments.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that all remaining committee amendments be \n[[Page S1159]] agreed to en bloc and treated as original text for the \npurpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object. What is the pending order \nof business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Gorton amendment No. 31, as amended, is \nthe pending question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous-consent request has been \npropounded. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. The absence of a quorum was suggested.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the majority leader yield while I give a statement \non another matter? Perhaps he can work this out while I give a \nstatement on another matter, 10 minutes total? Thank you.\n  Mr. DOLE. Maybe you can talk some of your people out of objecting to \nthese routine requests while we are at it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 2 seconds?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The reason I objected was I thought--more appropriately, I \nwould like to reserve the right to object, but since the minority \nleader asked for a quorum call--I assume to talk with the majority \nleader--that is why I objected. I have no intention of objecting, if \nthey can agree, and I would just like to point out, as back in the bad \nold days when I was chairman of the committee, this floor never agreed \nto the amendments from the Judiciary Committee on a bill.\n  So it is a practice that maybe we should establish, but in my \nexperience in 6 years as chairman of that committee I can never \nremember one single occasion when I came to the floor where we \nroutinely agreed to the committee amendments from the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first want to commend the majority \nleader, who I know is trying to get a very important bill passed, as \nwell as the distinguished manager of the bill, Senator Kempthorne from \nIdaho, who I think has done yeoman's work, a very good job of managing \nthis bill, as well as the Senator from Ohio.\n  I think all of us in the Chamber know that this bill is going to be \nenacted, it is going to pass. I think all of us want it to be a good, \nsolid piece of legislation, and in putting it together, I urge my \ncolleagues, those on the other side of the aisle, to give Senators who \nhave legitimate amendments time to offer their amendments.\n  It is a very important bill. It is very complicated. It is not at all \nunderstood. Speaking for myself, I could tell the majority leader that \nI support the underlying legislation and I think a lot of Senators do. \nWe would just like to have legitimate time to get the amendments. This \nis not a filibuster to kill a bill. It is not a filibuster to kill a \nbill. It is just an opportunity to offer amendments so we can vote on \nfinal passage on a bill that is probably improved upon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1146-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1159-S1160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BRINGING MICRON TO BUTTE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncitizens of Butte, MT, and other Montana communities, in their efforts \nto bring Micron Technology, Inc., a major U.S. semiconductor \nmanufacturer, to Montana.\n  Butte-Silver Bow County is a finalist for a $1.3 billion Micron \nmanufacturing plant. The plant would create 3,000 to 4,000 jobs with an \nannual payroll of $200 million. Good paying, high technology jobs that \nwould bring a better standard of living to both Butte and Montana. \nMicron would also propel Butte forward on its journey as a major U.S. \ntechnological center.\n  The possibility of Micron locating to Montana has banded the citizens \nof Butte together--in fact, the entire State together--in a very \ninspiring way. I wish you could see it, Mr. President. It has been \nexciting and heartening for me to experience and be part of the \nenthusiasm and vigor by which Montanans have gone after this golden \nopportunity.\n  For those of you who have never been to Butte--and I guess that would \ninclude most of you--Butte is truly a unique, all-American city. It is \nknown throughout Montana as the Can Do City, and if ever a city in this \ncountry could do it, it is Butte.\n  There was a time, after the Anaconda Co. shut down its mines, that \nButte was believed to be destined to join the many ghost towns dotting \nthe Rockies. Yet, through hard work, loyalty, determination, and a very \nstrong entrepreneurial spirit, the people of Butte-Silver Bow fought \ntheir way back.\n  They have made Butte a national center for the development, testing, \nand application of revolutionary environmental technologies. They are \nmaking the Port of Butte a major hub for intermodal shipping across the \nNation. And they created a top educational institution--Montana Tech--\nvoted by college presidents in a U.S. News & World Report poll as the \ntop-ranked science program in the United States among smaller \ncomprehensive colleges.\n  Newsweek has described Butte as the ``bright spot amidst the \ntumbleweed'' in the West and commended the community for \n``engineer[ing] the most dramatic turnaround.''\n  See this poster behind me? The local newspaper in Butte printed it up \nso thousands, and thousands, of Butte citizens could hang it in their \nwindows, displaying to Micron--and Micron, I hope you are watching \nthis--their enthusiasm and support. And see this stack of papers? They \nare editorials and articles from all over Montana, written in support \nof Micron. Editorials have been pouring in on a daily basis.\n  Take the editorial from the Missoulian, for example. As the editorial \nboard penned:\n\n       The people of Butte are survivors proud and passionate \n     about their community * * *. If Micron's managers have any \n     yearning to be adored and supported by an entire community in \n     their every endeavor, they will build in Butte.\n\n  Similarly, the editors of the Independent Record in Helena write, \n``it is difficult to think of a town in the country that deserves as \nmuch admiration as Butte, a city that doesn't know how to quit.''\n  And the Billings Gazette board stated last week that ``Butte, MT, can \noffer everything that Micron seeks and more. It also offers an intense \ndesire to attract companies such as Micron, to treat them well and to \nprovide incentives for relocation.''\n  I think Daniel Berube, chairman and CEO of the Montana Power Co. in a \nguest editorial in the Montana Standard sums it up right: Butte is ``a \ngood place to live, a good place to work, and a good place to raise a \nfamily.'' I strongly share his belief that there cannot be a better \nmatched city for Micron than the city of Butte.\n  Like Butte, Micron based its phenomenal growth and success on the \nWestern ideals of working hard and thinking big.\n  Like Butte, Micron has become a leader in its field, serving as a \nshining light for the rest of the Northwest.\n  And like Butte, Micron is preparing itself for the 21st century, \nwhile at the same time, maintaining the unique quality of life and \nscenic location found only in Montana and the Northwest.\n  I cannot think of a better home for Micron than in Butte. And I \ncommend the community and the State of Montana in their efforts to \ndeliver this message to Micron.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I must respond to this statement by \nthe Senator from Montana. He is so correct in pointing out that Micron \nis worth attracting to your State. Micron is an outstanding industry, \nand I know that because Micron is located in Boise, ID, of which I was \nmayor for 7 years. There are a number of communities in Idaho that also \nare desirous of the expansion of Micron. So I commend my colleague from \nMontana. He knows something good. I just say that we certainly intend \nto keep an eye on it.\n[[Page S1160]]\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to commend the \ndistinguished manager of this bill, a former mayor of Boise, ID, home \nof Micron. We all are together. We very strongly support and are \nenthusiastic admirers of Micron and what they have done over the years. \nIt is a good competition going on here to get Micron. The depth of \ncompetition indicates the quality of the company. And I just say to my \nfriend, may the best city win. And we very much hope that Butte, MT, is \nthe finalist in the plant location.\n  I thank my good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1159-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1160-S1189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 151\n\n     (Purpose: To exclude laws and regulations applying equally to \n             governmental entities and the private sector)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would call up amendment No. 151.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, and the following:\n       ``(6) Exclusion.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the \n     term `Federal intergovernmental mandates' shall not include a \n     provision in any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, \n     or conference report that would apply in the same manner to \n     the activities, facilities, or services of State, local, or \n     tribal governments and the private sector.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have called up this amendment on \nbehalf of Senators Kerry, Levin, Lautenberg, Bumpers, Dorgan, and \nmyself. And I am pleased to say that this is a very germane amendment.\n  I share the very, very serious concerns that have been raised by \nofficials of State and local government about the regulatory compliance \nand other burdens that have been placed on States and local governments \nby the Federal Government, by us. There is a problem here. It is a real \nproblem, and we ought to deal with it.\n  Last year, there was bipartisan legislation, S. 993, reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on which I am privileged to serve, which \nI thought adopted a balanced approach to addressing the justifiable \nconcerns of State and local governments about unfunded mandates. We \nestablished the principle there that Congress must be forced to \nconfront the costs that may be incurred by the State and local \ngovernments when we pass legislation, whether or not we have authorized \nfunding for those costs. There must be an opportunity for the fullest \ndiscussion, if there are not funds provided in the legislation we adopt \nto cover the costs on State and local governments.\n  In other words, that kind of legislation should be subject to a point \nof order if there is not information about the costs. I think that was \na very important principle that was established in S. 993, a very \nimportant response to a very real problem, a very constructive \nresponse.\n  I was pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 993 because it was all about \nknowledge and congressional accountability. But I regret to say that in \nmy opinion S. 1, though it does some very good things, in one \nparticular way--others as well--but in one particular way it goes too \nfar. It simply takes a good idea and takes it so far that it creates a \nnew, and I think very threatening presumption.\n  Under S. 1, if the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \nconference report increases the Federal intergovernmental mandate by \nmore than $50 million in a given year, a point of order will lie unless \nthere is a funding mechanism provided.\n  S. 1 also provides that if the funding mechanism is an authorization \nof appropriation for the full amount of the mandate, then the bill must \ndesignate a responsible Federal agency, and establish procedures for \nthat agency to direct that the mandate will become ineffective or \nreduced in scope if the full amount of the appropriations is not \nprovided in any fiscal year.\n  In short, the presumption in S. 1 is that the Federal Government will \npay 100 percent of the cost of obligations imposed by the Federal \nGovernment on States and localities. If the legislation states that the \nFederal Government will pay the cost, the money must be appropriated or \nthe agency must declare the mandate ineffective or reduced in scope.\n  So S. 1 is a much more extensive reach, a much different approach to \nthe problem of unfunded mandates than that adopted in S. 993, which was \nreported out of the committee last year. That is why I say it takes a \nproblem, unfunded mandates, and in its response reaches too far; and in \ndoing so, creates an unintended--but I am convinced very real and \ninequitable--burden on private-sector entities, businesses that are \naffected by these mandates. And it also puts at risk a whole array of \nFederal law protecting the environment, people's health, people's \nsafety, people's rights, that the public simply does not want to \nendanger, that the public wants us to continue to protect.\n  So under the mantle of dealing with unfunded mandates, this bill will \nhave the consequence, I am convinced, of putting extra burdens on \nbusiness, particularly small business, and in the process will create a \nhurdle that will impede the protection of people's environmental \nhealth, safety, and employee rights.\n  Let me say that in trying to separate out those mandates that \nuniquely place responsibilities on State and local governments, and for \nwhich we should feel a special obligation to pay the costs of those \nmandates, and those mandates which deal with a problem and in doing so \nplace responsibilities--call them mandates--on public as well as \nprivate sources of that problem, we are creating a real inequity.\n  But let me say what this amendment leaves intact. It leaves intact in \nthe underlying bill, S. 1, the requirement that Congress confront the \ncost of our actions. It may be when doing so, no matter how worthy the \naims of the particular legislation, how protective it may be, how \npopular it may be, that Congress, Members of Congress, in our wisdom, \nwill decide that it is not worth the cost. That is left in place in \nthis bill.\n  Also left in place is the second point of order, with all the extra \nburdens, all the extra responsibilities on the Federal bureaucracy to \npay for the cost of mandates, or cut back or terminate those mandates \nif they apply specifically to State and local governments.\n  The amendment is structured on a principle, and that principle is \nthat if Congress requires other levels of government to perform \ngovernmental services, then Congress should pay the State and local \ngovernments to do that. The appropriate area for legislation is where \nStates and localities are providing those governmental services, \nmandated by Congress, that Congress is unwilling to fund; \nresponsibilities that are exclusively governmental, that do not apply \nto private industry or private citizens.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to assure a fairer partnership \nbetween those State and local governments and the Federal Government in \ncarrying out governmental programs. In its report on S. 1, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee stated:\n\n       State and local officials emphasized in the committee's \n     hearings . . . that over the last decade the Federal \n     Government has not treated them as partners in the providing \n     of effective governmental services to the American people, \n     but rather as agents or extensions of the Federal Government.\n\n  But there is an enormously expensive governmental service obligation \nassociated, still, with many of the programs covered by this \nlegislation that our amendment would not affect. In fact, they are the \nbig-ticket mandate items for States and local governments: Medicaid, \nAFDC, child nutrition, food stamps, social service block grants, \nvocational rehabilitation State grants, foster care, adoption \nassistance and independent living, family support welfare services, and \nchild support functions. Those are all examples of \n[[Page S1161]] programs where the Federal Government has put \nresponsibilities on State and local governments, not on private \nentities. We essentially delegated a governmental responsibility from \nthe Federal to the State and local governments. And those are mandates \nwhose treatment would be left untouched by my amendment; whose \ntreatment under S. 1 would be left untouched by my amendment.\n  For Congress to act to pass or reauthorize those mandates beyond the \n$50 million annually exempted, there would have to be the finding that \nCongress had put the money forth to pay for the State and local costs \nof those programs or the point of order would appropriately lie and \nCongress would be tested to express its will. Governor Voinovich of \nOhio has stated:\n\n       Many States cannot spend a greater share of tax dollars on \n     education because new Medicaid mandates consume more and more \n     of our resources. They account for 70 percent of Ohio's \n     mandate costs, nearly $1 billion over 4 years. Medicaid was \n     19 percent of Ohio's budget in 1982. It represents one-third \n     today.\n\n  So to me these are the most consequential, most costly mandates that \nwe at the Federal level have put on the States. And those are the ones \nwhere we ought to have the process be forced to go through the extra \nhurdles in S. 1.\n  Senator Bond, our colleague from Missouri, at the hearing held on S. \n1 this year said:\n\n       Unfortunately, the State [State of Missouri] projects that \n     unfunded mandates will exceed $250 million. These are costs \n     that have been documented with respect to specific measures. \n     The Clean Air Act cost, in 1997, two-thirds of a million \n     dollars; total environmental mandates are estimated only at \n     $3.5 million.\n\n  I stop my quote from our colleague from Missouri here. Let me just \nemphasize that I think what many of us have been thinking about is the \nunfunded mandates, environmental particularly. As our colleague from \nMissouri said in his testimony before the committee, consumers put a \nrelatively small burden--and as I will come back and argue, it is a \nfair burden because it is also one placed on private sources of \npollution.\n  Then the Senator goes on to say the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Act \ncost the State $16 million in unfunded mandates, $16 million as \ncompared to $3.5 million for total environmental mandates on Missouri. \nThe Department of Social Services, as one would expect, Senator Bond \nsays, was the big winner having the privilege of almost $130 million of \na very limited budget to comply with Federal mandates. The Federal \nunfunded mandates survey for the National Association of Counties lists \nthe most costly unfunded mandate as the Immigration Act. That is the \ntype of mandate that applies specifically to State and local \ngovernments and the type of mandate for which we should be tested, \nforced to confront the costs, and go over the higher hurdle set in S. \n1.\n  The city of Chicago survey of mandates listed airport restrictions, \narbitrage rebates, and bond financing restrictions, as the most \nconsequential to the city. I would distinguish these mandates from \nother so-called ``mandates'' which really are about the adoption of a \nlaw at the Federal level to respond to a problem--clean air, clean \nwater, safe drinking water, fairness to employees, as in the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, where the source of the problem or potential problem \nis both public and private. This amendment would eliminate that \ninequity.\n  It exempts from the definition of a Federal intergovernmental \nmandate, as is in the bill, it is a very simple amendment with big \nconsequences. It simply changes the definition of Federal \nintergovernmental mandate in the bill and exempts from that definition, \nfor purposes of the requirement that the legislation must provide a \nfunding mechanism for 100 percent of the cost to avoid the point of \norder, provisions which apply in the same manner to the State, local, \nor tribal governments and the private sector.\n  For example, suppose legislation requires that all incinerators limit \nemissions of dioxin to 12 parts per billion by the year 2000. That \nwould apply obviously to both public and private sector incinerator \noperators. Under the amendment, the authorizing committee in its report \nis still required to state the amount--this is under S. 1 if the \namendment were adopted--the authorizing committee in its report is \nstill required to state the amount of any decrease or increase in \nfunding whether the committee intends the mandate to be funded or \nunfunded and any sources of Federal funding. Under the amendment, the \ndirector of CBO would still be required to provide an estimate of the \ncost to State and local governments of this requirement having to do \nwith emissions of dioxin that I have set up as the hypothetical here, \nand to state if those costs are greater than the $50 million threshold \nin the bill.\n  Under this amendment, if it is agreed to, the point of order would \nstill lie if the committee report does not contain that estimate except \nas modified by the amendment of the Senator from Michigan which we \nadopted earlier today.\n  However, under this amendment, there would be no point of order if \nthe bill did not provide a funding mechanism for 100 percent of the \ncost of compliance with this dioxin reduction proposal for the State \nand local governments.\n  Mr. President, this amendment covers only the situation where duties \nand obligations apply in the same manner to private sector and State \nand local governments. S. 1, in its current form, potentially, under \nits procedures, sets up a two-track process here between private and \npublic entities and would exempt State and local governments from the \nenvironmental safety, employee rights, and environmental standards that \ncompeting private businesses must meet. So S. 1 would potentially \nresult in a competitive disadvantage for private enterprises engaged in \nthe same activities that the State or local governments are engaged in.\n  In the example I gave a moment ago, the burden would fall on the \nprivately operated incinerator to spend whatever was necessary to \nreduce the emissions of dioxin whether or not Congress gave any help in \nmeeting the cost of that upgrading but would not similarly apply to the \npublicly owned incinerator if Congress did not provide full funding.\n  Of course, the other consequence here, Mr. President, is that the \napplication of S. 1 as it exists now would probably result in \ndisproportionate risks to our citizens. I can tell you that the people \nliving around that incinerator would not care whether it was publicly \nor privately owned. They want to be protected from toxins coming from \nthe incinerator.\n  Let me give some other examples. Under S. 1, the bill before us, and \nin future legislation, State and local governments could be exempt from \npaying their employees an increase in the minimum wage or providing \nfamily and medical leave, requirements that all private businesses \nwould have to meet. Publicly owned or operated incinerators could be \nexempt from air pollution standards while privately operated \nincinerators would be required to meet those standards. Publicly run \ndrinking water systems might not have to provide pure water in the same \nway that private water companies would have to provide. Public \nuniversities and hospitals could be exempt from the requirements for \nhandling radioactive wastes while private hospitals, including \nnonprofit hospitals, religiously supported hospitals and labs, would be \nrequired to meet those standards.\n  Cars owned by the State or local government could be exempt from \nrequirements to run on cleaner burning fuels which apply to all other \ncitizens of the State, not just to private businesses, but to everybody \nelse in the State. States or local governments that operate schoolbuses \ncould be exempt from safety requirements that would apply to buses \noperated by private companies. State-owned liquor stores could be \nexempt from standards of conduct that would be applied to privately \nowned and operated stores. States and municipalities could be exempt \nfrom requirements to retrofit or replace air conditioning units to \nremove CFC's while private entities would have to do that.\n  Certainly, Mr. President, we do not mean to say that there should be \na presumption, if Congress determines a law is necessary to regulate \nsafety, for instance, on school buses, safety of our kids, that they \nmust also provide 100 percent of the compliance costs of publicly owned \nbuses or else they do not have to meet that standard. The point here is \nthat in adopting legislation [[Page S1162]] which we have given--I \nthink unfairly in this case--the pejorative term ``mandate'' for \nexpressing a value, for setting a national goal, we are trying to \nprotect people. I do not think that the people who sent us here want us \nto protect them any more from dirty air or dirty drinking water than \nfrom accidents of their kids on school buses. They do not want any \nlower level of protection if the source of those threats to their \nsafety and well-being are from public as opposed to private sources.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the consequences of public health. It \nhas been my honor to serve on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and this is an area in which I have spent some time. And I \nam particularly concerned about the unintended, and I think undesired \nby the American people, consequences of S. 1 on environmental laws. \nWhen we pass a law, we have determined that the national interest \nrequires that law to achieve a goal, that there is a problem out there \nthat requires a national solution to protect public health or the \nenvironment. For example, more than 25 years ago, Congress determined \nthat the basic principle is that the Federal Government should be the \nultimate guarantor of minimum standards for clean water and clean \nair. And there is a rationale for that. It is not just a power grab by \nthe Federal Government for the sake of having power. Environmental \nproblems do not end at State borders. Dirty air and dirty water move. \nOnly the Federal Government can ensure that an up-river or upwind city \nor State does not dump its pollution on downwind or downstream States \nor localities.\n\n  Only the Federal Government can ensure that one area of the country \ndoes not so lower its standards for clean air or clean water for the \npurpose of attracting business, for instance, to the detriment of its \nneighboring States. Federal pollution standards apply to all sources of \npollution. It is obvious that you cannot solve the problem if you just \napply a national solution to one part of the problem, whether or not \nthe source of pollution is run by a public or by a private entity.\n  I can tell you that a family where the grandparents are suffering \nfrom emphysema do not care if the incinerator that is belching dirty \nair is publicly or privately owned or operated. They believe that the \nGovernment has an obligation to ensure that they have clean air. The \nparents whose child gets diarrhea from drinking dirty water does not \ncare whether a public or private entity provided that water. They want \nthe Government to ensure that the water is pure, regardless of who is \nproviding that water.\n  During the last 25 years, the Federal Government, in fact, has chosen \nto provide billions of dollars to assist State and local governments in \ncomplying with some of these pollution control laws. I have fought \nmyself for that funding and will continue to do so. But it seems to me \nthat when we identify a serious national problem such as dirty air and \ndirty water, dirty drinking water, it is wrong to place a mandate on \nourselves to say that if we are not able to pay for 100 percent of the \ncompliance cost, that a State or local government can escape those \npollution controls that apply to all other sources of pollution. If we \ntook it to its extreme, it would take the concept that is generally \naccepted, which is that the polluter pays. We can turn it on its head \nand say we have to pay the polluter.\n  S. 1 could result in vastly different levels of protection for \ncitizens throughout this country, or even within one State. Citizens \nliving near or downwind from a publicly owned facility could be exposed \nto toxins emitted from an incinerator which could be exempted from \npollution control standards, while citizens living near a private \nfacility would be protected from those emissions because that private \nfacility would not be exempt.\n  Let me talk about the competitive consequences I have referred to. \nObviously, results like those I have talked about would put private \nentities at a competitive disadvantage. In a letter to our colleague \nfrom Idaho dated December 16, 1994, Browning-Ferris Industries, a waste \nmanagement company, discussed some of the potential consequences of \nunfunded mandate legislation:\n\n       The results would severely skew the marketplace in favor of \n     Government rather than the private sector services, because \n     the private sector would have to add in prices to its \n     consumers for compliance with these various Federal rules \n     that customers of the public sector would not have to pay.\n\n  The Environmental Industry Association, in a letter dated January 9, \n1995, an association of a lot of companies that produce environmental \ncleanup equipment and are involved in the waste business, states this--\nand they support a lot of this bill:\n\n       Notwithstanding provisions in the bill for parity of \n     treatment between the public and private sectors for the \n     purposes of analysis, there seems to be an inconsistency in \n     actual treatment between the two sectors because the \n     legislation subject to the point of order vote applies only \n     to the Federal intergovernmental mandates and not private \n     sector mandates.\n\n  This is the Environmental Industry Association Business Group:\n\n       We respectfully restate our basic concern that to exclude \n     State and local government--but not the private sector--from \n     the costs of compliance with providing goods and services \n     where both sectors compete would be both unfair and \n     unfaithful to the core principles of the Job and Wage \n     Enhancement Act-- art of the contract for America--of which \n     S. 1 is the first piece.\n\n  Those are strong statements from private sector entities who fear \nexactly the disproportionate burden that this amendment of ours would \neliminate from the bill.\n  Mr. President, the unintended consequences of the legislation, in \nfact, and ironically, may be to encourage an expansion of Government, \nwhich is exactly the opposite of what the people supporting this in its \ncurrent form want. Government could be motivated to contract out fewer \nservices to private industry because the cost charged private industry \nprobably would be higher.\n  This issue was highlighted for me by the National School \nTransportation Association, which represents the portion of the \nfamiliar yellow or orange school bus fleet operated by the private \nsector which is about a third of the Nation's school bus fleet. \nPresumably, those school districts which have contracted out this \nfunction have saved money. But in a letter dated January 10, 1995, the \nprivate operators point out that one of the consequences of S. 1, the \nlegislation before us, may be to remove the incentives for school \ndistricts to contract out for those services, because by keeping the \nservices in-house, the costs of compliance with various Federal \nrequirements can be avoided. The letter states:\n\n       Such an outcome would be sharply at odds with the \n     burgeoning wave of privatization that is realizing, for \n     financially strapped school districts, significant savings \n     and could disrupt the level playing field for our industry \n     that has worked so hard over the past decade to achieve these \n     advances.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of two letters from the \nNational School Transport Association be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   National School\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                Springfield, VA, January 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The National School Transportation \n     Association, representing the nation's owner-operated yellow \n     school bus fleet, applauds your leadership efforts on the \n     unfunded mandates legislation. We are heartened that this \n     session's legislative vehicle contemplates analysis by the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of regulatory and fiscal \n     impacts on private industry as well as state and local \n     governmental entities. This is a critical provision which \n     must be included in any final legislation if the Congress and \n     the American public are to be fully apprised of the \n     consequences of new federal requirements.\n       As the debate moves to the Senate floor and the impacts on \n     private industry competitiveness are assessed, we wanted to \n     bring to your attention concerns of the school transportation \n     industry which reflect those also presented you by Browning-\n     Forris Industries and others. NSTA members operate in all \n     fifty states and in total operate some 110,000 buses \n     constituting about one-third of the nation's yellow school \n     bus fleet. School districts have come to realize significant \n     operational cost savings by contracting out pupil \n     transportation services. We are fearful that one unintended \n     consequence of the legislation may be to remove incentives \n     for school districts to consider contracting for these \n     services if by keeping such services in- [[Page S1163]] house \n     the costs of compliance with various federal requirements can \n     be avoided to some degree.\n       Such an outcome would be sharply at odds with the \n     burgeoning wave of privatization that is realizing for \n     financially-strapped school districts significant savings, \n     and could disrupt the level playing field our industry has \n     worked so hard over the past decade to achieve. We urge that \n     attention be given to this concern as the debate proceeds. At \n     the very least, any CBO analysis should also include some \n     assessment of impacts on present and future competition for \n     provision of services. If local governmental entities, such \n     as school districts, are to be absolved of responsibility to \n     comply with new federal requirements, then certainly equity \n     and competition demand that like treatment be extended to the \n     private sector.\n       We stand ready to work with you and your staff on possible \n     remedies to this problem. Please feel free to contact Peter \n     Slone at NSTA's governmental relations firm, Gold & \n     Liebengood, 202/639-8899 and he would be pleased to provide \n     further assistance. NSTA remains hopeful that this \n     legislation becomes the law of the land and that these \n     unintended consequences can be avoided. Thank you for your \n     careful attention to this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Noel Biery,\n     NSTA President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   National School\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                Springfield, VA.

In particular, NSTA \n     enthusiastically supports an amendment you intend to offer \n     which would ensure that nothing in the procedural and fiscal \n     protections established by the bill have the effect of \n     limiting the ability of private sector service providers to \n     compete for the ability to meet the needs of many state and \n     local governmental entities such as school districts.\n       NSTA is the national trade association for the owner-\n     operated component of the nation's yellow school bus fleet. \n     We have been a leader in advocating safety advances and make \n     a significant contribution to the nation in helping transport \n     some 24 million school children each day. The State of \n     Connecticut has a long tradition of contractor-provided \n     school transportation services with over 90 percent of that \n     state's yellow school bus fleet owned and operated by a host \n     of transportation providers, many of which are small \n     businesses. By contracting out such services, school \n     districts have come to realize more cost-effective and \n     reliable service. Today, NSTA members operate some 110,000 \n     school buses in fifty states.\n       We are fearful that if the effect of the legislation under \n     consideration is to scale back to some degree the need for \n     school districts to comply with important environmental, \n     workplace, safety and other new federal requirements, then \n     our nation's school children may well be imperiled. Further, \n     by subjecting school districts which operate their school bus \n     fleets to a lesser standard than their private sector \n     counterparts, the Congress would in effect establish a \n     dangerous double standard and remove incentive for \n     privatization of those services. At a time when many school \n     districts are financially-strapped and facing further budgets \n     curtailments, we should promote rather than impede their \n     ability to contract for services where savings could be \n     realized and safe and reliable service ensured.\n       Thank you for your leadership role on this important \n     competitiveness issue. We are hopeful that through your \n     thoughtful persistence the nation can avoid unintended \n     consequences from this legislation which raises serious \n     safety and fair market competition issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Noel Biery,\n                                                   NSTA President.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, at the same time, by exempting the \nsmokestacks and discharge pipes operated by State and local governments \nfrom complying with future environmental standards, S. 1 would force a \nwide range of businesses to bear even more of the burden to meet \noverall clean air and clean water goals. For example, if publicly owned \nincinerators or landfills do not reduce emissions contributing to smog, \ncarbon monoxide, and particulates, private sources of pollution would \nhave to do more in order to meet the cleaner environmental goals.\n  Let me illustrate, if I might, in a little greater detail how this \nlegislation could hurt private businesses. States and businesses \nadvocate water pollution laws that establish an overall pollution \nloading limit for individual bodies of water. That has been something \nthat the sources of pollution, potential sources, have asked us to do. \nWe have done it. This is based on the notion that each body of water is \nbest managed for cleanup based on a scientific understanding of what \nthat river or lake or bay can withstand in the way of pollution, \nidentifying the sources, and then assigning the source's limits based \non what they contribute. This is very fair, and it creates a \ncooperative effort to clean up a body of water. All sources of \npollution, whether industry or sewage treatment plants operated by \ncities, get divided up for that pollution limit; so much for this \nsewage treatment plant, so much for that factory, et cetera, et cetera. \nBut if publicly owned wastewater treatment plants are permitted to \ndischarge, for instance, more nitrates into our rivers and bays, well, \nwho are we going to have to turn to to make up the difference to reach \nthe standard, the threshold, the goal that we have for cleaning up that \nwater? Is it going to be the factory along the water, the rancher, or \nthe farmer who is using fertilizer upstream? Not only would S. 1 hurt \nbusiness under this scenario, it would usurp State and local efforts to \nclean up their rivers, bays, and lakes, based on sound science and \nlocal control.\n  Mr. President, those of us who represent States which, in some part \nat least, are victims of pollution from upwind or downstream are \nparticularly vulnerable and feel so under this proposal. Let me be very \nspecific. If municipal sewage plants in New York will be relieved of \nfuture requirements to comply with water pollution standards because \nthe Federal Government has not paid 100 percent of the cost of that \ncleanup, Connecticut industries and residents will bear a much greater \nburden if we are ever going to clean up Long Island Sound.\n  In fact, it would be impossible to ever clean up the Sound if New \nYork City sewage treatment plants were exempt from water pollution \ncontrol requirements. New requirements for more flexible approaches to \ncleaning up our rivers, coast lines, lakes, and estuaries focus on \nwatershed-based planning in which wastewater treatment plants, \nindustrial discharges, and farmers all work together to meet the \nloading tolerance of a particular body of water. These are zero sum \ngains. If the requirements on public sources of water pollution go \ndown, the requirements on the private sources will go up and, believe \nme, they will be costly and burdensome.\n  Connecticut also has one of the most severe air pollution problems in \nthe country, because we are the victims of dirty air transported from \nupwind States. Emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from \npowerplants in upwind States, including Midwestern States, contribute \nsignificantly to our smog problem and are responsible for the acid rain \nthat falls on our State and many States throughout New England. If \npowerplants that may be operated by a public entity are exempt from \nfuture requirements under the Clean Air Act, Connecticut's industries \nwill bear a greater cleanup burden, and the plain fact is--and it is a \nsad fact--that our citizens will breathe dirtier air and they will be \nsicker. I share the concerns raised about the potential negative impact \nof unfunded mandates legislation on Connecticut's severe air pollution \nproblems, particularly dirty air transported into Connecticut from \nother States, by my colleague Congressman Chris Shays during the markup \nof House unfunded mandate legislation in the House Government Reform \nand Oversight Committee. The same points he raised apply to S. 1.\n  Mr. President, let me provide just some general statistics relating \nto the unfair burden that may be inadvertently created by S. 1. In its \n1992 report to Congress, EPA examined the sources of pollution in \nestuary waters. Of the 8,000 square miles of impaired estuarine waters, \nmunicipal sewage treatment plants affect 53 percent of impaired miles, \nand urban runoff/storm sewers affect 43 percent of those impaired \nmiles. Obviously, if we allowed some or all of these sources to be \nexempt from future water pollution requirements, the resulting burden \non industries contributing to the pollution would rise dramatically if \nwe are to succeed in cleaning up our estuaries.\n  Mr. President, I find it particularly ironic that we are considering \nthis legislation right after we passed S. 2, the \n[[Page S1164]] Congressional Accountability Act, because we finally \nhave managed to impose the discipline of our laws on ourselves and now \nwe are talking about a huge potential loophole in applying our laws to \nState and local governments.\n  In a way, I fear that this act, S. 1, might, if it is passed as it \nreads now, come to be known as the State and Local Government \nUnaccountability Act of 1995.\n  There are other consequences of the presumption in S. 1 that could \nresult which are perverse and clearly unintended. A town that operates \nits own hospital and incinerator would, in effect, be receiving tax \ndollars from a town where there was a private incinerator and hospital. \nIn other words, it is unfair to the taxpayers who pay for the \ndisproportionate burden.\n  Mr. President, finally, I am also concerned about the potential legal \nissues raised about this point of order that is created in S. 1. In a \nletter to Senators Roth and Domenici, dated January 8, 1995, seven \nprofessors of law contend that the procedure in this point of order may \ncreate problems under article 1, section 1 of the Constitution. \nAlthough it is settled that Congress may delegate to executive agencies \nthe power to devise policy to meet congressional objectives, Congress \nmust establish an intelligible principle to which the executive must \nconform. These professors state that the procedure in S. 1 might go far \nbeyond such delegations because Congress could expressly authorize \nadministrative agencies to amend or temporarily nullify statutes which \ncould be held to be an unconstitutional attempt to delegate legislative \npowers to executive agencies.\n  I do not know if this analysis is correct, but I am concerned about \nit. I am concerned about whether we have assurances that agencies will \nbe fair and evenhanded when they determine how to reduce the scope of \nthe mandate and whether S. 1 contains adequate safeguards in that \nregard.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would simply narrow the scope of the \nsecond point of order in S. 1. It leaves intact most of S. 1. In fact, \nit leaves intact the 2 points of order that would lie against the \nlargest costs on State and local governments of Federal mandates. They \nare all still left intact. It would still ensure, that is to say, that \na point of order would lie if we do not have full information about the \ncosts of mandates to State and local governments. It would still ensure \nthat the committee report state whether there is funding for those \nmandates. It would still contain the second point of order for mandates \nthat relate specifically to State and local governments, and are not \npart of trying to solve a broader national problem.\n  But for those mandates that apply to State, local, or tribal \ngovernments and the private sector, it would close a loophole that is \nunfair to the private sector and which would potentially exempt State \nand local governments from a whole host of environmental health and \nsafety laws. And it would have, therefore, severe consequences, in my \nopinion, for the health and safety of the American people.\n  So let us pass a good bill here, Mr. President. I want to vote for S. \n1, but I just feel that, in its current state, it goes too far. Let us \npass a bill, not a Pandora's box filled with unintended consequences.\n  Again, I say, if the American people knew about the impact of this \nlegislation, it would have not only unintended consequences but \nundesired consequences, consequences which the American people clearly \ndo not desire.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the sponsor \nof the amendment if it would be possible at this time to enter into a \ntime agreement so that we could have some predictability on when the \nnext vote may occur. Would an hour and a half, equally divided from \nthis point, be in agreement with the Senator?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum so \nSenators on our side can consult.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will just ask my colleagues if it might \nmake sense if one of us kept going while they confer. This Senator has \nno problem with a time agreement. If they want to discuss the time \nagreement, that will be fine, but I think we might use the time \nadvisedly.\n  Mr. President, I first want to all start by congratulating the \nSenator from Connecticut and also the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, for their efforts on this bill. I think the Senator from \nConnecticut has done an outstanding job of laying out in great detail \nthe problem here, and I am not going to repeat all that he has said.\n  I might say, though, I saw that the distinguished majority leader was \non the floor a moment ago. I heard him prior to that say to the Senate, \nchastising us for not proceeding faster on this bill, that the \namendments that have been brought have not been relevant to this bill.\n  I might say to the distinguished majority leader and to the other \nside that the pending amendment before the Senate right now, I believe, \nis the Gorton amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Lieberman \namendment to the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I believe, if I am correct, the Gorton amendment is on \nnational historical standards; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I simply point out to my colleagues that this is an \namendment to a Republican amendment, and the Republican amendment which \nconsumed most of yesterday afternoon has nothing to do with this \nlegislation. I happen to support the Republican amendment.\n  So the Republicans have exercised their right of coming to the floor \nin order to attach to this legislation something they thought was \nimportant and, in fairness, that right ought to also lie, as it always \nhas through the centuries of the Senate, with the other side. So I \nthink it is inappropriate at this point, only several days into this, \nto be complaining about the fact that there are some amendments that \nsome deem to be relevant but not germane, or germane but not relevant, \nwhichever the case may be.\n\n  The Senator also asked somebody to look them in the eye and say they \nwant to pass this legislation and they are not delaying it. I will look \nthem in the eye if they are here and I will tell them I want to pass \nthis legislation and I am not delaying. I will say it again: I want to \npass this legislation and I am not delaying.\n  It seems to me that we ought to be able to work out among Members an \nagreement on a number of amendments that are relevant to this and, \nhopefully, proceed forward in a way that is intelligent. Let me \nemphasize ``intelligent.''\n  I remember the majority leader coming to the floor many times last \nyear saying to America ``We are not delaying. We are just trying to \nsave America from bad legislation.'' Or, ``We are trying to save the \ncountry from something that goes too far.'' Or, ``We are trying to save \nthe country from legislation that we think can be improved.'' That is \nwhat we are doing, not saving it from a bad idea but making a good idea \nbetter.\n  We support the notion that we need to reevaluate unfunded mandates. \nMr. President, we should not in the process of passing a bill on \nunfunded mandates do so in an irresponsible way that does not allow for \nfixing what we all know in the legislative process is the capacity of \none word misconstrued or one word misplaced, to have an unintended \nconsequence.\n  Moreover, I can remember in 1986 when we passed the Tax Act here. I \nwent to Senator Russell Long because we were concerned about a \nparticular component of that bill with respect to real estate. He said, \n``Don't worry about that. We will pass that now and come back and fix \nit.'' Being new to the Senate, I believed him. I would not believe that \nstatement today. The fact is that we did not come back and fix it. Over \nthe years, the results produced, I [[Page S1165]] think, terrible \nunintended consequences of devaluing certain amounts of property in \nAmerica with unintended consequences to banks, to the savings and \nloans, and to a host of economic interests in this country.\n  Now, we ought to do a better job, Mr. President, of evaluating the \ncost of programs. It is irresponsible for the Senate to pass a program \nmandating actions by States or local communities of which we do not \nunderstand the implications.\n  I think the days have long passed by which Americans have come to \nconclude that they want to have a better sense of weighing the value of \na particular environmental concern or a particular health concern \nagainst the totality of cost or the rate at which that cost might be \nimposed on them.\n  I also ask my colleagues to remember back to the 1960's and 1970's \nwhen a river in Ohio used to catch fire regularly: the Cuyahoga River. \nIn response to rivers that caught fire and toxic and hazardous waste \ndumps which we knew were causing cancer and killing people in this \ncountry, we passed a set of standards.\n  A mandate is not just a mandate. It is not just a mandate to spend \nsome money. It is our collective view as a Nation of something to which \nwe want to aspire. It is our view of a goal or a standard by which we \nwant to live. So when President Bush came to the Congress and joined \nthe fight to protect the environment and said we ought to have clean \nair, he was expressing the hope and desire of millions of Americans to \nbe able to breathe air that is clean. The result was Congress passed a \nnotion of how we wanted to live, of a standard.\n  Subsequently, in the 1980's, particularly under President Reagan, \nthere was an enormous shift in the revenue versus expenditure \nrelationship. We all remember the promises made back in the early \n1980's--if we cut taxes and raise defense spending we were going to \nchurn up the engine of this economy and we were going to ultimately \nhave increased revenues.\n  Well, we took the debt of the Nation from $1 trillion to over $4 \ntrillion in the span of a decade. It was that diminution of the Federal \npartnership throughout the 1980's that has begun to create this new \nrush to reevaluate Federal mandates.\n  What happened during the Reagan era was the Federal Government left \nthe mandate in place because it expressed the will of the people, but \nit took the money away. That is what has brought Members here. A \nperpetual process of the reduction of funding to States and local \ncommunities, leaving in place a series of mandates and, indeed, I might \nadd, adding some mandates.\n  Most of the mandates that we are currently operating under were put \nit place in the 1960's and 1970's--not the 1980's--with the primary \nexception being the Clean Air Act. But I do not think most Americans \nhave decided they do not want to breathe clean air. I do not think most \nAmericans have decided that they want their kids living next to toxic \nwaste dumps, and they are ready to have them get cancer and die. I do \nnot think most Americans have decided that they are prepared to have a \nwhole erasing of the standards of safety on our roads, on the standard \nof safety that we know have saved lives. I do not think that is what \nthey are saying.\n  Now, if this bill, unintentionally-- and I insist, unintentionally--\nif this bill not as a matter of purpose but as a matter of unintended \nconsequence, is going to have the impact of diminishing the capacity of \npeople in this country to have those higher standards of health or \nsafety, then I think people would think twice. If this bill \nunintentionally creates a disadvantage to the private sector, I think \npeople would say ``Wait a minute, is that really what we are meaning to \ndo here?''\n  Now, I am 100 percent in support of our requirement that we evaluate \nthe cost of Federal requirements to both the public and private sector. \nWe ought to evaluate how we spend our money. In that evaluation, Mr. \nPresident, we also ought to consider the full measure of the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the States and \nlocalities. For instance, we allow the States and localities to benefit \nby virtue of a $66 billion a year deduction on State and local \ngovernment income taxes and other tax deduction.\n  In effect, part of the Federal-State partnership and relationship is \nour payment of 40 percent of higher income people's State and local \ntaxes. Is that taken into account in this mandate bill? Is that taken \ninto account in the requirement of the commission to evaluate Federal \nmandates? The answer is ``no.'' That is an unfunded mandate, in \nessence, on a whole lot of low-income people that do not deduct, \nbecause that is a benefit that only goes to people who deduct. If you \nitemize your taxes and you deduct you get the benefit.\n  So, in effect, the Federal Government is paying for 40 percent of the \nlocal and State taxes of upper-income people as a consequence of our \nallowing that deduction. There are a whole set of tax expenditures, \nsimilarly, in the Federal-State relationship for which we are assuming \nthe burden.\n  Now, I say this as background to this particular amendment that the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Michigan are joining \ntogether and bringing to the floor, because it underscores the \ncomplexity of this relationship. It underscores the fact that if we \ntake one piece of this broad mosaic of our economy and we suddenly rip \nit off, we may have a whole set of consequences that impact other \npeople. And we are just respectfully suggesting, in an amendment that \nis really very narrow in scope, in a very limited amendment, we are \nsuggesting that there is a way for the Senate to legislate \nintelligently and avoid an unintended consequence.\n  Now, what is that unintended consequence? Just very quickly to go \nback to my colleague from Connecticut and his excellent description.\n  Mr. President, we have a very broad definition in here of a Federal \nmandate. The definition we have in this legislation covers all State \nand local activities including activities where there is a governmental \nrole, such as in administering any appropriate program but also where \nthere are activities that are not of a governmental nature. So we are \nsaying in this bill, any Federal program mandated that covers an \nactivity where the activity or entity acts in a governmental way or in \nnon-governmental functions we are going to apply this bill.\n  If you do that, Mr. President, you are covering activities where the \nGovernment entities are acting as employers and where they compete in \nthe marketplace with the private sector.\n  An example of that would be a landfill or an incinerator. You could \nhave a local government-owned landfill or incinerator operated in \ncompetition with a private landfill or incinerator operator. As it is \ncurrently written, this bill will set up a different relationship \nbetween the public entity and the private sector. It will exempt the \npublic entity from having to live up to a Federal mandate, but it will \nnot exempt the private entity from that same mandate.\n  So we will continue to say, as I think the American people want to, \nthat with respect to the environment or health or public transportation \nsafety or workplace safety, we will continue to say, ``You, the public \nentity, are exempt unless we have decided to pay 100 percent, and, you, \nthe private entity can continue to operate under the burden of the \nFederal mandate,'' which means that the public entity has a lower cost \nof doing business, which means we have advantaged them in the private \nsector.\n  I received a letter from BFI, which is Browning-Ferris Industries. We \nall know them. I know they have written a letter to my colleagues \nsubsequently retracting some of what they said in this letter, but not \nretracting the substance, which is what I want to emphasize here. What \nthey said to me was:\n\n       Dear Senator Kerry: * * * Without legislative language \n     along the lines of the enclosed, unfunded mandates \n     legislation--even if it is prospective only--\n\n  And I underline.\n\n     could have the effect of subjecting the private sector to a \n     regulatory (and cost) burden that the public sector would not \n     face absent Federal funding. The enclosed language would \n     merely have the effect of assuring a level playing field \n     between the public and private sectors in those instances \n     where there is some form of competition between the two \n     (hospitals, transit, higher education, waste management, et \n     cetera).\n\n  This letter was dated December 22. On January 11, they wrote to \nSenator [[Page S1166]] Kempthorne--I think it is probably in response \nto concern about the other--and they said:\n\n       We expressed our views at a time when one of our concerns \n     was that unfunded mandates legislation could have a \n     retroactive effect. It is evident that S. 1 has a prospective \n     effect only, which we understand was your intent all along.\n       After reviewing the legislation that will be considered on \n     the floor and after discussions with your office, we \n     recognize that among your objectives for S. 1 is creation of \n     a favorable climate for the private sector. In fact, S. 1 \n     seeks creatively to address the concern in some quarters that \n     unfunded mandates legislation could disadvantage the private \n     sector where public-private competition takes place. \n     Moreover, after many years of experience in working with \n     you--most of them prior to your tenure in the Senate--BFI is \n     convinced that your dedication to free enterprise is \n     unsurpassed.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       * * * we are pleased to strongly support S. 1.\n\n  I am not holding them out as not supporting it, but they nowhere in \ntheir second letter--nowhere--address the concern they express in their \nfirst letter. They simply say that ``we understand that it is not going \nto be retroactive.'' In their first letter, they said, ``even if it is \nprospective only.''\n  The fact is that by taking it out of retroactive, you are not \ndiminishing the capacity for future unfunded mandate requirements to \ncreate this unlevel playing field, Mr. President.\n  What would happen is, you would have these public entities that \nengage in the hiring of employees and compete with the private sector, \nthey would be exempt from obeying worker protection laws, like the \nParental and Medical Leave Act; they would be exempt from the \nenvironmental health and safety requirements which the rest of the \nprivate sector has to comply with; publicly owned incinerators would be \nexempt from air pollution standards; school buses, as my colleague from \nConnecticut has pointed out, would be exempt from safety standards; \ncars owned by local government could be exempt from emission standards; \nState-owned liquor stores could be exempt from standards of product \nthat apply to privately owned stores; publicly owned hospitals could be \nexempt from requirements for the proper disposal of medical waste.\n  I do not think anybody in the Senate wants to do that. I really do \nnot believe that my colleagues think that is good policy or that that \nis what this bill is supposed to do.\n  I know my colleague is going to stand up and he is going to point to \nlanguage added to S. 1 calling for committee report language. And in \nhis language in the report he says that the evaluation has to include a \ndescription of the activities taken by the competition to avoid any \nadverse impact on the private sector of the competitive balance between \npublic and private sector.\n  However, that is the report. That is not substantive. It is not a \nrequirement nor is it an exemption. What that language does is, in \neffect, acknowledge that this is a problem. It says that you have to go \nout and make this evaluation, which means you are going to have this \nimbalance in the marketplace, you are going to have to go make the \nevaluation, you are going to have a point of order lie with respect to \nit, as my colleague has said, then you have to come back and jump \nthrough hoops of points of order and try to pass something to redress \nwhat any free enterprise capitalist should not want to have happen in \nthe first place.\n  In effect, if you pass this bill as is, it is a kind of socialism \nbecause what you are doing is advantaging the Government against the \nprivate sector. You are, in effect, voting to say we are willing to \ntake an unfunded mandate away from the public entity and we are going \nto leave it on the private entity. That does not make sense to this \nSenator. And for the life of me, I cannot understand why so many folks \non the other side of the fence are so sanguine about this reality of \nthe imbalance.\n  I asked them to look at the language. I asked them to measure it. \nThis is not an exaggeration. I do not think the Senator from \nConnecticut has anything remotely resembling a reputation that is any \nless than diligent. He is one of the strongest advocates in the U.S. \nSenate for the interests of competition and business and the private \nsector. I think if you take a hard look at this, one has to be \nconcerned about this relationship.\n  So we are here, respectfully suggesting to our colleagues that the \ngoal of making the judgment about expense is absolutely worthy, but to \nundo the partnership completely in a way that imbalances this \nrelationship between public and private is not worthy of this \nlegislation and it is not what we ought to be seeking to do in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I assure my colleagues, if this happens, we are going to be back here \nrevisiting the quagmire of competition or of imbalanced competition \nthat we will have created as a consequence of that.\n  Again, I say, I applaud the work the Senator Kempthorne and Senator \nGlenn and others have done in trying to create a responsible climate of \nevaluation of costs before we impose them. But there is a \nresponsibility in the Federal partnership to try to be fair. I think \nthat, regrettably, we will not have met that standard unless we try to \nadopt some change within this legislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time \nprior to a motion to table the pending Lieberman amendment be as \nfollows: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Lieberman; 20 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Kempthorne; and 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Levin; that following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, Senator Kempthorne, or his designee, be recognized to \nmake a motion to table the Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object--and I do not expect to \nobject--Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, while this unanimous-consent request \nis being considered on this side of the aisle, I suggest it would be \nvery appropriate for the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nto go ahead with his remarks concerning this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair now recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I strongly oppose this amendment. Its \neffect would be to exempt from the requirements of this act those \nFederal mandates involving State and local government activities, when \nthe private sector is also engaged in the same activities. Now, this \nexclusion would seem to appeal to notions of fairness but in fact would \neffectively gut the bill.\n  In truth, there is very little that State and local governments do \nthat no one in the private sector is also engaged in doing. This is \nespecially true since proponents of the amendment include those \ninstances where one city franchises a private contractor to render a \nservice for which another city might directly use its own employees.\n  Trash collection and disposal is one example sometimes cited. Waste \ndisposal companies are said to compete with the public sector in that \nthey try to convince governments to contract out such service and \ntherefore have to show that they can do it cheaper than government.\n  It has been argued that Federal subsidies to State and local \ngovernments would in that type of instance upset some competitive \nbalance.\n  But other than enacting laws, everything a city or a State does could \nbe covered by such competitiveness principles, particularly as more and \nmore governments are moving to contract out a broader range of \nfunctions and services.\n  Let me give a few examples. Police departments. Police departments \ncompete with private security guards and private residential patrols.\n[[Page S1167]]\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator for that courtesy.\n  Madam President, I again renew my unanimous-consent request. If \nnecessary, I will restate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, as I was saying----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield again, is the \nSenator from Delaware----\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator speaking under controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is now under control. The question is \nyielding.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, the Senator from Delaware is on my \ntime. I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask if the Senator will just yield for \na question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would like to complete my statement.\n  As I was saying, fire departments compete with private, for-profit \nfire departments such as used by Scottsdale, AZ; public building \ninspectors compete with privately contracted building inspection \nservices such as used by Sunnyvale, CA, during building booms; public \nroad construction crews compete with private construction contractors, \nand even with private toll roads such as is being built in northern \nVirginia; public schools and community colleges compete with \nproprietary trade schools; public hospitals compete with private \nhospitals; city attorneys compete with private, fee-for-service \nattorneys such as are used by many towns too small to have a full-time \nlawyer on staff; public libraries compete with bookstores and video \nrental stores. Many libraries now lend movie videos. Public swimming \npools and golf courses compete with private facilities and country \nclubs; municipal revenue collection departments compete with private \ncollection agencies such as those that will collect on overdue parking \ntickets for a percentage of the revenue; city computer operators and \nIRM departments compete with private-sector computer service companies, \nsuch as EDS, which will contract to do a city's payroll; and municipal \nbuildings and ground maintenance crews compete with private-sector \nmaintenance companies.\n  In other words, Madam President, it is not just a few selected areas \nwhere government and the private sector render the same or similar \nservices. Much more than just pollution control and waste disposal is \ninvolved. This amendment would cover virtually every activity of State \nand local government.\n  This is why the distinction between public-sector and private-sector \nactivities ought to be decided on a case-by-case basis. In fact, the \nlegislation does acknowledge that there may be occasions when such \nissues of competitiveness are of legitimate concern. The bill states \nthat committee reports shall explain how the matter has been addressed \nby the committee. Then Congress can judge how best to deal with that \nindividual instance where a real problem might exist. Through the use \nof the waiver provision of S. 1, we can decide that funding a \nparticular mandate for the public sector is unfair to the private \nsector.\n  Madam President, I think this is a far, far better way to deal with \nthis issue, and that is why I strongly urge my colleagues to reject \nthis amendment. As I stated, its adoption would effectively gut the \nbill. The exception would swallow the whole.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield me 2 minutes off \nhis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield to the \nSenator from Ohio?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield as much time to the Senator \nfrom Ohio as he needs.\n  Mr. GLENN. I just need a couple of minutes. I want to be added as a \ncosponsor on this legislation.\n  I do not see how the Government can possibly come down on the side of \na government entity that is in competition, in effect, with a private \nindustry, whether it is waste management, whether it is water \nprovision, whether it is sewer provision, whether it is--whatever--and \ncome down and say we will partially federally fund or totally federally \nfund whatever the mandate is with regard to the public entity and give \nthat competitive advantage to the public entity in competition with a \nprivate industry, whether it is electricity or sewer or whatever the \nprovision might be.\n  So I think the amendment obviously makes sense to me. I ask to be \nmade a cosponsor of the amendment and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I \nneed.\n  I have just a brief statement to thank my friend and colleague and \nleader from the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senator from Ohio, \nfor his cosponsorship of this amendment. He has been a leader in the \nwhole crusade to force the Federal Government to confront the costs of \nits enactments on State and local governments and on the private \nsector.\n  He is a cosponsor of the underlying bill, S. 1, and so I am \nparticularly heartened and appreciative that he has agreed to cosponsor \nthis amendment, which, in my opinion, does not go to the heart of this \nmeasure. It goes to the margins, which is its application and \napplicability.\n  It is a simple amendment which slightly narrows the definition of the \nterm ``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' so it does not include a \nprovision ``in any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \nconference report that would apply in the same manner to the \nactivities, facilities or services of State, local or tribal \ngovernments and the private sector.''\n  The Senator from Ohio has stated his concern about the unintended \nconsequence here, that this will put disproportionate burdens on the \nprivate sector in excusing the public sector. Again, I thank him for \nhis leadership on this issue and for his support.\n  I hope in the end I can join him in supporting S. 1 by itself. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. How much time do we have remaining on our side, Madam \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho for the opportunity to respond to this amendment by the good \nSenator from Connecticut. When the Senator described this as a simple \namendment it took me back to my days in the State legislature. That was \nthe first signal that you had trouble. In effect, this amendment \nrenders this legislation that we have been discussing for days upon \ndays, and was in preparation for almost 2 years, moot. That is the \neffect of the simple amendment.\n  It is simple in the context that it makes this entire effort a moot \neffort, because by saying, as this amendment does, it is not an \nunfunded mandate if it in any way affects the private sector, it has \nthe effect, it literally would say, there are no unfunded mandates.\n  The curiosity about this for me is that this amendment is being \noffered in the nature of being a defense for the private sector. I have \nalways found it curious, when our membership talks about its support of \nthe private sector, only to find that the private sector itself \nexpresses itself quite differently. [[Page S1168]] \n  I have before me a letter dated January 3, 1994, from the National \nFederation of Independent Business, who support this legislation \nwithout this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                                  January 3, 1994,\n     Hon. Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Paul: On behalf of the over 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to \n     vote in favor of S. 1, the unfunded mandates legislation, \n     when it is considered by the Senate in January.\n       Unfunded federal mandates on the states and local \n     governments end up requiring these entities to raise taxes, \n     establish user fees, or cut back services to balance their \n     budgets. Small business owners are affected by all of these \n     actions.\n       Between 1981 and 1990, Congress enacted 27 major statutes \n     that imposed new regulations on states and localities or \n     significantly expanded existing programs. This compares to 22 \n     such statutes enacted in the 1970s, 12 in the 1960s, 0 in the \n     1950s and 1940s, and only two in the 1930s. The Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates that the cumulative cost of new \n     regulations imposed on state and local governments between \n     1983 and 1990 was between $8.9 billion and $12.7 billion. \n     These include environmental requirements, voters registration \n     requirements, Medicaid, and others.\n       It was not the states and cities who paid roughly $10 \n     billion in unfunded mandates during the 1980s; it was \n     taxpayers--small business owners as well as everyone else. In \n     June 1994, a poll of all NFIB members resulted in a \n     resounding 90% vote against unfunded mandates.\n       I urge you to strongly support S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I also have a letter before me from the National \nAmerican Wholesale Grocers Association, a group with a very large \nmembership across the country, who support the legislation without the \namendment.\n  I am not going to enter all of these into the Record.\n  We have a letter in our hands from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which \nrepresents hundreds of thousands of businesses across the country in \nsupport of the legislation without the amendment. And the list goes on \nand on and on of people who actually are out there meeting a payroll, \nrunning a business, who have supported the legislation managing \nunfunded mandates as offered by the Senator from Idaho.\n  Why the incongruity? Why would we have people here on the Senate \nfloor who are suggesting that we have to have an amendment such as this \nto protect the private sector and yet we have this outcry from the \nprivate sector saying pass the bill as it is?\n  The answer is very simple. The private sector is already paying the \neffects of unfunded mandates. If you own a piece of property in any \ncity, county, or other jurisdiction across this land of ours, about a \nthird--depending on the type of jurisdiction--about a third of that \nproperty tax bill that you are paying every year is directly related to \nFederal orders--mandates--with no check to pay for them.\n  I spoke about the motor-voter bill the other morning, which cost my \nState $6.6 million in the first year and then $2 to $3 million \nthereafter. That is Federal folly. It is totally unnecessary in my \nState. Registration was being handled very adequately.\n  So we have a policy wonk in Washington trying to establish what the \npolicy on a very local question ought to be and ordering that it be the \nway we think it ought to be in Washington and then sending the bill to \nthe local government. That local government bill goes right down, \nultimately, to an impact on property taxes. And that is why we have \nthese letters from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That is why we have \nthe letters from the National Federation of Independent Business, and \nGrocers, et cetera, et cetera. Because they are bearing the burden.\n  Governments do not pay taxes. People and businesses and families and \ncorporations, they pay taxes. They are the direct recipients of the \nburden of the last 10 to 15 years of unfettered orders from the Federal \nGovernment without any payment to cover it.\n  Madam President, I will just say one more thing and I will yield my \ntime back to the Senator from Idaho. In the final analysis, the other \naspect of the legislation that is very important to note is that, if \nthe impact is greater than $200 million on the private sector, CBO is \nrequired to publish that knowledge and we in the Senate would have the \nopportunity to understand the impact and by a majority vote, if the \nconsequences create a massive destabilization of fair competition \nacross our country, we have the prerogative--and for the first time, I \nmight add, the knowledge--to understand what we are doing and can act \naccordingly.\n  This amendment makes the measure moot. The private sector does not \nconcur with the suggestions that they need this type of protection. \nThey are for the measure without the amendment. And the reason is \nbecause they pay for the unfunded mandates in the end.\n  I think it is time we moved on and got to this final measure and gave \nAmerica and all America's mayors and county commissioners and school \nsuperintendents what they have been asking for for nearly 2 years.\n  I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank very much the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I will yield in a moment to my \ncolleague from North Dakota, but I want to say in response, on my own \ntime, to one of the statements made by the Senator from Georgia, that \nthe reference to the Motor-Voter Act is in point. I want to reassure \nhim that under this amendment, the motor-voter law would still have to \npass the two hurdles, be subject to the two points of order, and could \nbe suspended in its impact if the Federal Government did not pay the \ncosts of the State's implementing it because it is a unique \ngovernmental function.\n  The State and local governments, in implementing the Motor-Voter Act \nare not competing with any private sector businesses. This is a \ndelegation of responsibility that we put on the States uniquely unless, \nunder the terms of the bill which are generally part of S. 1, there was \nan estimate that it would not cost $50 million in any given year of its \nimplementation.\n  So the example is a good one to indicate exactly how S. 1, if our \namendment were adopted, would impact mandates, mandates uniquely on \nState and local governments such as motor voter or the large most \ncostly mandates that I indicated earlier, and referenced specifically \nearlier, would still be faced with the two hurdles. That is quite \ndifferent from mandates, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, which are \naimed at solving a national problem, guaranteeing people pure drinking \nwater regardless of whether they get it from public or private sources.\n  Madam President, I yield now 5 minutes to my friend and colleague \nfrom North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, thank you very much. I thank my friend \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The issue of the private sector is one I am well familiar with. \nSenator Domenici and I offered the legislation last year that became \nthe basis for the language in last year's bill and also became the \nbasis for the language in this year's bill on the private sector. We \nare the ones that indicated that we wanted the private sector included. \nIf there is an aggregate cost exceeding $200 million that is going to \nbe imposed on the private sector as a result of a mandate, my own view \nwas God bless the mayors and the Governors. They certainly have \nlegitimate complaints about mandates. But what about the mom and pop \nbusiness on Main Street? What about the private sector folks trying to \nmake a living? What about the mandates we impose on them? Why should \nnot there be a comparable requirement with respect to the private \nsector? [[Page S1169]] \n  I am pleased to say with the cooperation of the Senator from Idaho \nand active work on behalf of a lot of folks here that that was \nincluded. And that makes this bill a better bill. We are not just \nconcerned about State and local governments. We are concerned about \nthem and addressing their interests. But we are also concerned about \nthe businessman and the businesswoman all across this country on Main \nStreet who also have to respond to mandates.\n  There is only a point of order here, not funding with respect to the \nprivate sector, but a point of order that exists. We are debating a law \ntoday or proposed law. One of the interesting laws in Congress is a law \nof unintended consequences. It springs up between every desk and in \nevery crevice and every day in every way, the law of unintended \nconsequences.\n  I will tell you what you will hear about this law if you do not pass \nthis amendment. You will hear about that law immediately if this \namendment does not pass. The first time that you have a State or local \ngovernment engaged in an enterprise in which the private sector is \nengaged in the same enterprise and a mandate is moving through the \nCongress, what you have is a circumstance where the Congress will pay \nfor the cost of complying for the mandate for the local level of \ngovernment and the private sector competitor out there has said you \nhave the same mandate but which we are sorry, partner, you are on your \nown. You have created a competitive unfairness by definition, end of \nargument. You have created unfair competition.\n  I heard the last speaker talk about the surprise about the private \nsector. There is nothing about the intent of this amendment that in any \nway erodes or undermines the provisions in this bill that address the \nprivate sector. I know because I helped write it. Nothing that is \nproposed by my friends with this amendment would undermine those \nprovisions of the law.\n  The only thing they have tried to do is say where you set up \nconditions in which you will have competitors as between levels of \ngovernment and the private sector, we shall not have circumstances in \nwhich a point of order will lie if you do not fund it for the \ngovernment but ignore the private sector. That is all the Senator from \nConnecticut is trying to do, and it is why I am pleased to cosponsor it \nand pleased to support it.\n  It makes eminent good sense. I hope after it is thought through and \ndiscussed some that the other side of the aisle would decide to accept \nit. Those who say the private sector does not want this, I will \nguarantee you this. Anybody in the private sector who is going to be \nset up for an unfair situation is going to want this as soon as they \nunderstand that they cannot compete in that circumstance.\n  So let me just again end where I started. This bill includes the \nprivate sector in a significant and important way. I support that, and \nI helped write it. I helped make sure it was here.\n  This amendment does nothing to undermine or erode what we are trying \nto do for the private sector. In fact, this amendment comes to that \npart of the private sector that will otherwise have in my judgment a \ncircumstance of terrible unfairness imposed upon it and says we do not \nwant that law of unintended consequences to come from this piece of \nlegislation.\n  If we do not include this, I guarantee you we will discuss this again \non the floor of the Senate. I guarantee you that those who discuss it \nwill not be able to stand up and defend the circumstance that brings it \nto our attention the next time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota. His advocacy for small business, for small farmers, and \nfor common sense is well known and respected in this Chamber. He did in \nfact help write the bill, in fact strongly supports the underlying \npurpose of the bill, but also supports the amendment which gives me \ngreat confidence to go forward. I thank him for his very eloquent \nwords.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Kerrey] be added as cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I would at this point yield up to 10 \nminutes of my time to the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the President and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  I want to take this opportunity to talk on behalf of the support for \nthis amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, which will exempt from S. 1 all legislation that \naffects the private and public sectors.\n  Equally knowing that this amendment is recommended and authored by \nthe Senator from Connecticut comes as no surprise. He is thoughtful. He \nrecognizes from his own experience on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and the things that we have attempted to do for some time \nnow, the need to go to the private sector wherever possible to get the \njob done, whatever that may be, most efficiently.\n  So I think this is an appropriate amendment. I am not sure where the \ncontroversy lies between the two parties because this amendment by any \ncount really makes sense and it is consistent with the review over the \nlast couple of years, the last several years, to turn, as I said \nbefore, to the private sector whenever we can do so.\n  Just last week, we passed the congressional coverage bill because we \nsaid that Congress should be subject to the same laws as everyone else. \nIt would be absurd if only a week later we passed legislation which \nexempted State and local governments from the laws which applied to the \nprivate sector. But that is exactly what S. 1 as currently written \ndoes.\n  Under this legislation, the presumption is that States and local \ngovernments will be exempt from requirements that apply to the private \nsector unless the Federal Government foots the bill for compliance.\n  At the same time firms operating in the private sector--and there is \nexample after example--I mean private water treatment facilities versus \npublic water treatment facilities, sewage facilities, privately and \npublicly, but firms operating in the private sector would have to \ncomply with these requirements, with these standards that are set by \nperhaps the Federal or the State government even though no one would be \nhelping them to pay the costs of compliance, setting a competitive \ncondition that is contrary to the mission that all of us have these \ndays--that is, to get the job done in the best way possible for the \nleast cost, in the most efficient manner. This is not just a \ntheoretical inequity, it can have real and serious consequences. For \nexample, in many jurisdictions, waste treatment facilities, as I said, \nare operated by government entities as well as private firms, each with \nthe same obligation.\n\n  Under S. 1, the State-owned facility would not have to comply with \nany new laws designed to reduce pollution, unless the Federal \nGovernment pays the cost.\n  The private-sector competitor, however, would not have any choice. \nThey would have to comply, and they would have to pay.\n  Consider the case of a research facility in a State university and a \nprivate-sector firm conducting similar research. S. 1, as currently \ndrafted, institutionalizes a competitive advantage for the State-run \nfacility and punishes the private-sector enterprise. That is not, I am \nsure, what the authors intended. But it is the result.\n  Madam President, many of those who support this legislation recognize \nthe problem and want to fix it. Indeed, earlier in our consideration of \nthis bill, an amendment was adopted which will require committees to \nconsider the disparate impact of mandates and mandate relief on public \nand private concerns. But while recognizing the problem, that language \ndoes nothing to correct it. It does not provide the kind of assurance \nor consistency which is needed to deal with the problem.\n  The amendment of Senator Lieberman, however, addresses the problem we \nall seem to recognize in a meaningful way. Under the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut, State and local officials would have to \nfollow the same Federal laws as everyone else. Our workers and our \nenvironment [[Page S1170]] would be protected similarly, and private \nbusinesses would have a level playing field.\n  So I believe this amendment is essential to a fair and equitable \nunfunded mandates bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the manager of the bill. I rise as \na very strong supporter of S. 1, the unfunded mandates bill.\n  I came to this body having served 8 years as Governor of Missouri, \nand I found that State government budgets were devastated by the costs \nof Federal mandates. I also know that they have been devastating in \ntheir impact on local governments. Kansas City, MO, finds the one-time \ncost to the city of implementing all the federally mandated \nenvironmental regulations in 1993 was some $56.2 million. Local \ngovernments are seeing their budgets robbed by Federal mandates. State \ngovernments find that they cannot utilize the tax dollars they want to, \nas they believe their voters and constituents want to, because they are \npreempted by the Federal Government.\n  I believe this is a good measure. I took a look at this amendment \nthat has been crafted by my good friend from Connecticut. I read it, \nand it is absolutely stunning in its simplicity. It says that Federal \nor governmental mandates does not include any provision in any bill \nthat would apply in the same manner to activities, facilities, or \nservices of State and local or tribal governments and the private \nsector.\n  Madam President, that wipes out a tremendous sector of where the \nFederal mandates hit the State and local governments. That is not just \na loophole big enough to drive a truck through, that is a loophole big \nenough to push this whole Capitol through.\n  Motor-voter, as mentioned by my colleague from Connecticut, may be \none of the few areas that would not be exempted. But all of the other \nlaws that impose the burdens on State and local governments would be \nwiped out. Is this an automatic requirement that we fund State \ngovernments and local governments in competition with the private \nsector? No. It simply says that you have to consider that; you can \nwaive that. There is no requirement that we cannot change by a majority \nvote--and that will be brought to the attention of this body--if there \nis an impact on governmental and private-sector entities.\n  I have been made almost breathless by the statements of concern for \nthe private sector from some sectors where I have not traditionally \nheard that support. I hope that those same people will support us in \nprivatization efforts.\n  Frankly, what we are talking about here is an exemption that is so \nbroad that it will make the basic provisions of S. 1 not applicable in \nmost of the expensive areas where State and local governments are \nsignificantly oppressed by Federal Government mandates.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. This bill is vitally \nneeded. Governors, mayors, legislators, Republican and Democrat, across \nthis country, particularly in my State, know that we need S. 1. They \ncannot afford to have S. 1 with this kind of loophole put in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri so \nmuch for his perspective as a former Governor and for expressing the \nimportance of this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before I get to the amendment pending \nbefore us, I would like to use part of the time that has been allocated \nto me under this unanimous-consent agreement to pick up kind of where I \nleft off the other day, about the bill itself.\n  I think, like most of us, that we must address the problem of \nunfunded mandates. I was a cosponsor of last year's bill. I am a former \nlocal official. I understand the impact of a mandate when Washington \nimposes it on us at a local level. By the way, private business persons \nunderstand those impacts, too. So we have to understand that it is not \njust local and State governments that are concerned with mandates \nimposed by us. The private sector is concerned with mandates imposed by \nus, as well. This bill treats them differently.\n  Sometimes the private sector and public sector are in direct \ncompetition; yet, they are treated differently in this bill. I am going \nto get to that in a minute when we talk about the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  I want to talk about, first, some of the problems that I see in the \nbill itself. First of all, it has been suggested that because \namendments are being offered--there are many amendments that are going \nto be offered, and there are many that are needed, and some of them \nhave already passed--that, therefore, people are filibustering this \nbill.\n  I have seen some pretty strange things in this Senate, but I have not \nseen many people filibuster their own bills. The Senator from Ohio, who \nis the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, is the \nprime cosponsor of S. 1. He was the principal sponsor last year of the \nbill that came to the floor. He believes vehemently in what is in this \nbill. He also, very strongly, opposed cloture--Senator Glenn did--\nbecause it would have immediately wiped out a whole host of relevant \namendments--I emphasize ``relevant amendments,'' relevant to this bill. \nThey were not technically germane for postcloture purposes, but they \nwere very relevant to the bill, including a substitute which he is \nconsidering offering which is closer to last year's bill.\n  Are we serious that we want to prevent the ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee from offering a substitute bill similar \nto the one he sponsored last year? Is that a fair treatment of minority \nrights, to tell the former chairman, whose bill this was last year, \nthat now as ranking member he will be preempted because of a technical \npostcloture rule from offering a substitute to this bill, should he so \nchoose? I think the answer is no.\n  Therefore, when the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Nebraska, \nwho is also a cosponsor of S. 1, who is the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, vote against cloture so that Members can continue to \noffer relevant amendments, the suggestion that they are, therefore, \nparticipating in a filibuster means they are filibustering their own \nbill--a bill that their name is on. When you look at the sponsors of S. \n1, the third name on that sponsorship list is the Senator from Ohio. \nThe sixth name is the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, and so \nforth. This bill is different from last year's bill in some very \nsignificant ways.\n  Again, I cosponsored last year's bill. I would like to vote for this \nbill. I hope to be able to do it. But I am determined, and others are, \ntoo, that we are going to take the time to analyze some very, very \nsignificant provisions that will change the way we function on the \nfloor here when amendments are offered, when bills are brought up. \nThere is a new point of order in this year's bill, a very significant \npoint of order, which was not in last year's bill which can be raised \non any bill that does not fund that mandate for State and local \ngovernments under certain circumstances.\n  Now what has been the delay? Well, a couple of the days that have \nbeen used here were simply used to extract committee reports. On both \ncommittees, both Budget and Governmental Affairs, we made an effort to \nobtain committee reports. The effort was rejected on a party-line vote.\n  Now why--when you have a bill that is introduced on a Wednesday \nnight, that goes to a hearing the next morning, that is supposed to be \nmarked up the next day, that is very different from last year's bill--\nwe are not given a committee report without being put through the \nprocess that we had to go through here this week to get committee \nreports, I do not know. But we were put through that process in both \ncommittees.\n  There was an amendment offered. Senator Pryor, in Governmental \nAffairs, asked for a committee report so that Members of this body \ncould study these provisions. They are very, very \n[[Page S1171]] significant provisions. Senator Pryor's motion in \nGovernmental Affairs was tabled on a party-line vote. A similar thing \nhappened in the Budget Committee. And so the effort was made then on \nthe floor, finally successfully, to get committee reports. That took 2 \ndays.\n  Now, in committee, I offered an amendment which said that if the \nCongressional Budget Office cannot make an estimate of the cost of an \nintergovernmental mandate, that it should be able to say so, just the \nway the bill allowed a mandate in the private sector to be so regarded \nby CBO. If the Congressional Budget Office is unable to say what the \ncosts of a mandate on the private sector are, under this bill, it was \nallowed to say so. But purposefully, explicitly, the bill did not allow \nthe Congressional Budget Office to say that it could not estimate the \ncost of an intergovernmental mandate.\n  And let us be real clear: It is that estimate that is so critical. It \ntriggers all kinds of activities. It requires appropriations to be in \nthe amount of the estimate. So that estimate is the critical triggering \ndevice in this bill.\n  In last year's bill, if there were not an estimate, it would be \nsubject to a point of order. And that was fine. This year's bill goes \nway beyond that, because it creates a point of order if we do not \neither appropriate directly the money to equal the estimate or unless \nwe do some other things to make sure that downstream there is an \nappropriation for that estimate. So that estimate becomes absolutely \ncritical.\n  But what happens if the CBO cannot make the estimate? I offered an \namendment in the committee saying they ought to be able to say so. If \nit is absolutely impossible to make an estimate--for instance, if the \namount of the mandate is going to depend upon the action of an agency \nwhich has not been taken, if it depends upon the content of a \nregulation that has not been written, then it may be impossible to say \nso. Let them be honest. That amendment was rejected in committee on a \nparty-line vote.\n  Now, why have we used so much time in the last few days? For many \nreasons. One of them is I spent 3 hours here the other day debating \nthat issue as to whether or not the CBO ought to be able to state that. \nAnd finally, today, we adopted the amendment which was rejected in \ncommittee. Was that useful? You ``betcha.'' It is going to make a big \ndifference when this bill becomes law--and I have no doubt that this \nbill will become law--it is going to make a major difference as to how \nthe Congress operates. Because there will be times, we have been told \nby the CBO, when they will not be able to estimate how much an \nintergovernmental mandate costs.\n  There have been other reasons we have used up some time. We had an \namendment by the Senator from Washington on the Republican side, \ntotally nongermane, totally nonrelevant to this bill. It took us hours \nyesterday, hour after hour after hour, on a totally nonrelevant, \nnongermane amendment having to do with education standards.\n  There are a lot of problems with this bill and they need to be \naddressed. This bill says that certain civil rights laws that protect \npeople against discrimination based on race, religion, gender, ethnic \norigin, or disability are not the subject of this bill; that States and \nlocal governments are going to have to comply with those without any \nmandate protection in this bill.\n  Well, they left out a few things, including age. Do we want to \nprotect people from age discrimination the way we do from race \ndiscrimination? I think so. Do we want to correct that? I hope so. And \nI will offer an amendment later on to correct it.\n  Is that dilatory? Is it dilatory to suggest that, since every \namendment that any Member of this body might offer is subject to a \npoint of order unless it contains a certain estimate as to how much it \nmight cost State and local governments, every one of us is going to be \nsubject to this point of order when we offer an amendment? And I think \nmost of us probably say, that is right. Many think it should apply to \namendments. But that is not my argument here.\n  The bill says that the point of order applies to amendments. An \namendment which we offer must have that estimate of the cost to State \nand local governments or it is subject to a point of order. Can we get \nthe estimate as individual Senators? Do I have a right to it? My \namendment is going to be subject to a point of order if I do not have \nit.\n  Well, the bill says only the committee chair and the ranking member \ncan ask for the estimate. That is what the bill says. Is my legislative \nlife then going to be put in the hands of the committee chair and \nranking member? Maybe they disagree with my amendment.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment which says any individual \nMember has a right to ask for the estimate, which is so crucial if that \nperson's amendment is not going to be subject to a point of order. That \njust seems to me to be fundamentally fair and required and protects all \nof us.\n  This has nothing to do with private and public and whether we should \nhave an estimate and all of that. This just goes to a basic right of a \nMember to obtain the estimate, which is absolutely essential under this \nbill to avoid a point of order on his or her amendment.\n  Now, is that germane after cloture?\n  We have been told it is probably not germane. Is that dilatory? Is \nit, in any fair sense of the word, dilatory for Members to clarify that \nissue by an amendment? It is surely relevant. I am confident that the \nParliamentarian would rule it is relevant. But it is not germane, \ntechnically not germane, because postcloture is a very, very tight \ndefinition of germaneness.\n  Do we want to clarify it? Is it worth taking a few days? This bill \nwill not be effective by its own terms until next January. Now, maybe \nsome people will suggest that does not mean we should not use all the \ntime between now and next January debating that bill. I could not agree \nmore.\n  I can see my friend from Mississippi, the wheels in his head moving \naround. I beat him to it. I hate to take away a good response. So be \nit. Is it worth taking a few days, a few weeks, if necessary, to answer \nthese amendments? These are relevant amendments. They affect each one \nof us. I think it is.\n  Now, getting to the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator was kind enough to mention my name and is \nfixing to get to the important discussion of the amendment. The Senator \nis absolutely right, even though we take a little time, it will not go \ninto effect until January.\n  I want to make this point. I am pleased that we are now getting to \nsome substantive amendments. This one clearly needs to be thought about \nand debated as it is being debated. I presume there are a few more. I \nthink that the work that has been done by the distinguished floor \nmanagers on this bill last year and this year, a lot of good work has \nalready been done. Surely there are a few good amendments. We should \nget to them.\n  Nobody here believes that there are 78 on your side or 30 on our \nside. Let Members get this list dwindled down to the amendments that \nreally are relevant. Let Members talk about those. I suspect that some \nof them will be accepted, and we will get the job done and move on.\n  Certainly there is not a railroad involved here. We are taking lots \nof time on this legislation. I do think that the leader is right to \nexpect that after 5 days we get down at least to the relevant or \ngermane amendments. We are about to get there.\n  Here is my question to the Senator, if he would yield for the \nquestion. The Senator was talking about when would this be used. It \nseems to me that there would not be a whole lot of amendments that this \nmight apply to. We are talking about a relatively small number, the \ndollar amount that is involved here. Is it not true that you probably \nwould not have this applying that often? I am asking from genuine \ncuriosity. How much are we talking about that would really kick in, $50 \nmillion?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are 800-some bills, which estimates were able to be \nmade on the bills as I understand it in the last 12 years. That is \nwhere estimates could be made. And a whole bunch that could not be \nmade. I do not think that the current law which requires that an \nestimate be made, some act as though there has not been a law on the \nbooks [[Page S1172]] that requires these estimates of intergovernmental \nmandates to be made. There has been a law on the books.\n  I am not sure many of us have read those estimates they have made, \nbut nonetheless to answer the Senator's question directly, I do not \nbelieve it is applied to amendments. So, we are skating out on a new \npond. The language applies this now to amendments, the point of order \nto amendments relative to intergovernmental mandates. When I say ``the \nlaw'' I am talking about estimating the amount of the intergovernmental \nmandate, the mandate on State and local government.\n  To try to directly address my friend's question, we do not know \nwhether or not that threshold of $50 million per year some year down \nthe road--could be 10 years down the road--is reached until we ask for \nthe estimate. So how many amendments will, in fact, be calculated or \nestimated to include an intergovernmental mandate of more than $50 \nmillion in any one of 5 fiscal years after it becomes effective? There \nare an awful lot of squishy words in there, by the way, but how many of \nthem? What percentage of our amendments? I do not know. I just cannot \nanswer.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me conclude, because I know the Senator \nwants to make some other points. Perhaps the Senator would want to \nrespond to this.\n  I have found the people out across the country, certainly my State, \nare astounded when they find out that in fact we do not know the cost \nestimates of amendments that we are offering on the floor. They are \nshocked. We wander in here and say, hey, here is my amendment. It might \ncost $10 million, or $50 million, or $200 million, and they say, ``you \nmean, you don't know?'' Do you not think the people would want Members \nto know the consequences of our amendments on the floor? I think that \nis what this bill does. Which I believe the Senator supports.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do. I agree with that. The problem is not the \nrequirement that there be an estimate. That is not the problem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Without an estimate, how do we know?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator asked me what percentage, and I am saying how \ndo we know without an estimate. So I could not answer your question as \nto what the percentage is without these estimates being made. They have \nnot been made yet on amendments. So, we will find out.\n  I agree, we should know the consequences of our acts. We should know \nthe impacts on local and State governments. I used to be that local \nofficial 8 years. I came to this town because I did not like what the \nFederal Government was doing to me and my town--not me personally but \nmy town--including mandates, including the way they operated programs. \nBelieve it or not, that was a big part of my first campaign. As a local \nofficial I understood that. And I still believe it. And we should know \nthe consequences of our acts.\n  Now, this amendment that is pending before the Senate is saying there \nare some areas where we sure should equally know the consequences on \nthe private sector, and equally treat the private sector. There are \nareas where the private sector and the public sector are in direct \ncompetition. You have a hospital, one is a publicly owned hospital, \nsay, university hospital, the other one is a private hospital. They are \nin competition. You can take two incinerators or two anything. Now, \nassume that in our wisdom or lack of wisdom--there will be a debate \nover that--there is an increase in the minimum wage. I do not want to \ndebate the wisdom of the increase in the minimum wage, but assume there \nis an increase in the minimum wage. Do we really want to create a \npresumption that the private hospital is not going to have to pay that \nminimum wage increase but--excuse me, let me reverse it. Do we want to \ncreate the presumption that the private hospital is going to have to \npay the increase in the minimum wage but that the public hospital is \ngoing to be off the hook unless we pay their increase in the minimum \nwage? Do we want to create that presumption?\n  Now, I had an amendment in committee which said, no, we will not do \nthat when it comes to those employment laws like minimum wage and \nfamily and medical leave. We should not create that presumption. The \namendment before that is a broader amendment, addressing the same \npoint.\n  Take the two incinerators.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, just in response to that, this concept \nof having a public hospital, the private hospital, are we going to \npresume that we would then proceed and only pay for a minimum wage \nincrease on the private hospital?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill does not presume that we will pay \nfor the increase on the private hospital. It does create a presumption \nthat we will for the public hospital. Of course it can be waived by 50 \nvotes. There is a presumption in the bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is the point, Senator, that is the point. If \nthat scenario were to unfold, No. 1, would it not be very healthy for \nthe Senate to have the information as to what is the cost of that \nmandate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. So far we are together.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In minimum wage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Together so far.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Ask to have a CBO analysis on the cost and on the \nprivate sector.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are together.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. What sort of cost is it to the private sector?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are together.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. What sort of adverse impact might that have on \ncompetition between the public and private sector?\n  Mr. LEVIN. So far so good. Keep going.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Then we are together.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, no, no. Excuse me, I will reclaim my right \nto the floor and then I will be happy to yield.\n  This bill goes one step beyond that and creates the presumption that \nwe are going to either pay for that increase for the public hospital or \nwaive it. It does not do that for the private hospital.\n  So, we go right down the road together, arm in arm as last year's \nbill did, which the Senator from Ohio is the prime sponsor of.\n  This year we go one step further. This year we create the \npresumption, and it is pretty embedded in there, that we will pay. We \nare implying to people, we are sending out the message, we are creating \nan assumption that we will either pay that increase for the public \nhospital or waive it.\n  That is where we have problems.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I certainly will respect your time. But, Mr. \nPresident, that is the point. There is all of this emphasis, all of \nthis discussion on a point of order. At any point--at any point--you \nmay seek a waiver of that point of order. In all likelihood, if you are \ngoing to have an increase in the minimum wage, we all know that will \nrequire a majority vote in the Senate. It may be the same majority that \nwould also vote to waive that. The point of order also is not self-\nexecuting. Somebody has to raise that point of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. One Senator has to raise that point of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Correct. Is there any doubt in your mind one Senator will \nraise any point of order? There is not 1 out of 100 Senators who \nopposes--by the way, the Senator from Idaho is a cosponsor of last \nyear's bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which does not go as far as this year's bill does and \ncreate this presumption that we are going to treat the public sector \ndifferent when it comes to funding this mandate than we will the \nprivate sector. It is not as though last year's bill was a weak bill. I \ndo not think my friend from Idaho would have cosponsored a weak bill. \nLast year's bill was a strong bill, which went right down the road, \nstep by step--and you outlined those steps. I agree with each of those \nsteps.\n  This year's bill adds that additional point of order, and it is there \nthat it creates a competitive disadvantage, in many cases, to firms \nthat are competing with each other. And that is where the amendment of \nthe Senator from [[Page S1173]] Connecticut will allow us to say that \nif it applies to both, to both incinerators, public and private, that \nwe should then deal with them in the same way.\n  I wonder if I could ask of the Chair how much time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining of his \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I just want to read from some letters from the private sector, from \nsome parts of the private sector.\n  This is a letter from the Environmental Industry Associations. There \nare three associations that are part of a larger umbrella group. I \nunderstand this has about 2,000 total members. This includes the \nNational Solid Waste Management Association, the Hazardous Waste \nManagement Association, and the Waste Equipment Technology Association. \nWe all understand that the private sector is divided on this bill, that \nthere are parts of the private sector--for instance, I understand the \nChamber supports the bill--but there are parts of the private sector \nthat are the most likely ones to be directly impacted that have a lot \nof problems with this bill.\n  I want to read from just one portion of the private sector. Again, \nthis is three different subassociations that are represented here, \nabout 2,000 members:\n\n       Notwithstanding provisions in the bill for parity of \n     treatment between the public and private sectors for purpose \n     of analysis--\n\n  And this is what my friend from Idaho was talking about, for purpose \nof analysis.\n\n     there seems to be an inconsistency in actual treatment \n     between the two sectors because the legislation subject to \n     the point of order vote applies only to Federal \n     intergovernment mandates and not private sector mandates. We \n     respectfully restate our basic concern that to exclude State \n     and local government--but not the private sector--from the \n     costs of compliance with unfunded mandates in conjunction \n     with providing goods and services where both sectors compete \n     would be both unfair and unfaithful to the core principles of \n     the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, of which S. 1 is \n     the first piece.\n\n  So there is a significant portion of the private sector that very \nmuch is troubled by this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from those three associations \nthat make up the Environmental Industry Associations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          Environmental Industry Associations,\n\n     Re: S. 1, Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n                                                  January 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: I recently wrote you, December 22, \n     1994, on behalf of the Environmental Industry Associations \n     (EIA) to provide you our viewpoint on the important matter of \n     unfunded federal mandates. Now that we and other stakeholders \n     in this debate have had the benefit of a Joint Committee \n     hearing on this initiative, I want to provide you with \n     additional comments as your bill goes to markup and an early \n     floor vote.\n       We are pleased that the bill requires that the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provide legislative \n     authorizing committees and agencies anticipating rule \n     promulgation detailed economic and competitive impact \n     analysis on both intergovernmental and private sector \n     mandates. Clearly, this is a major improvement to promote \n     more informed and deliberate decisions by Congress on the \n     appropriateness of federal mandates in a given instance. We \n     are especially pleased that the accompanying CBO Report on \n     federal mandates must include a statement of the degree to \n     which the mandate affects both the public and private sectors \n     and the extent to which federal payment of public sector \n     costs would affect the competitive balance between State, \n     local, or private government and privately-owned \n     businesses.'' (Committee Print, page 14, line 3-9). Again, we \n     voice our strong support for this centrist approach.\n       Notwithstanding provisions in the bill for parity of \n     treatment between the public and private sectors for purpose \n     of analysis, there seems to be an inconsistency in actual \n     treatment between the two sectors because the legislation \n     subject to the point of order vote applies only to federal \n     intergovernment mandates and not private sector mandates. We \n     respectfully restate our basic concern that to exclude state \n     and local government--but not the private sector--from the \n     costs of compliance with unfunded mandates in conjunction \n     with providing goods and services where both sectors compete \n     would be both unfair and unfaithful to the core principles of \n     the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, of which S. 1 is \n     the first piece.\n       To ensure that there is a level playing field between the \n     public and private sectors, we suggest that the term `Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate' beginning on Committee Print, page \n     4, line 22, be amended by including a new paragraph ``(C)'' \n     following line 14, pages 6, that would read as follows:\n       (C) The term `Federal intergovernmental mandate' shall not \n     include any mandate to the extent it affects the commercial \n     activities (including the provision of electric energy, gas, \n     water or solid waste management and disposal services) of any \n     state, local or tribal government.\n       We look forward to working with you in the months ahead by \n     providing the views of our members on legislative initiatives \n     in which they have an interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Allen R. Frischkorn, Jr.,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me read a letter from Consumers Power \nCo. This is a major energy supplier in my home State of Michigan. This \nis dated January 11:\n\n       The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 is intended to \n     relieve State and local governments of unfunded Federal \n     mandates. While we support the intent of the bill, Consumers \n     Power Company has some concerns over the impact the bill \n     would have on investor owned electric utilities and its \n     customers. We believe it will have the effect of placing \n     certain private companies at a competitive disadvantage with \n     local governments when they provide identical services.\n       Consider, for example, that the private sector would be \n     required to comply with Federal environmental mandates at \n     costs creating intolerable competitive disadvantages, while \n     the public sector would be excused from compliance because \n     funding is not provided by the Federal Government. Compliance \n     with Clean Air Act Amendments of 2001, should they pass, \n     would be such a case. Should municipal utilities be exempt \n     from NOx reduction requirements because the Federal \n     Government does not pay for implementation?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Consumers Power,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 \n     (S. 1) is intended to relieve state and local governments of \n     unfunded federal mandates. While we support the intent of the \n     bill, Consumers Power Company has some concerns over the \n     impact the bill would have on investor owned electric \n     utilities and its customers. We believe it will have the \n     effect of placing certain private companies at a competitive \n     disadvantage with local governments when they provide \n     identical services.\n       Consider, for example, that the private sector would be \n     required to comply with federal environmental mandates at \n     costs creating intolerable competitive disadvantages, while \n     the public sector would be excused from compliance because \n     funding is not provided by the federal government. Compliance \n     with Clean Air Act Amendments of 2001, should they pass would \n     be such a case. Should municipal utilities be exempt from \n     NOx reduction requirements because the federal \n     government does not pay for implementation?\n       Senator Thad Cochran intends to introduce an amendment, as \n     early as today, which would correct this unintended \n     competitive disadvantage. We urge your support for the \n     Cochran amendment which explicitly assures that where state \n     and local governments engage in commercial activities, they \n     must meet the same requirements as private firms offering the \n     same product or service.\n       Attached for your review and consideration is the draft \n     amendment language. Please call me or Mary Jo Kripowicz of my \n     Washington staff should you wish to discuss this issue \n     further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 H.B.W. Schroeder.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. So, Mr. President, a number of these amendments raise very \nimportant points. I, too, am glad that we finally have gotten to these \nkinds of amendments, and there will be a number of other amendments \nthat are offered. But this is one of the most significant amendments \nfor us to consider and worry about. However we vote on this amendment, \nI think each of us ought to be concerned about the possible competitive \ndisadvantage that this bill is likely to place the private sector \ncompanies in that compete with the public sector.\n  I want to commend my friend from Connecticut for his tremendous work \nin this area and his concern for the private sector. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the \nsenior Senator from Idaho. [[Page S1174]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, \nfor yielding. First of all, let me recognize the effort that he has put \nin now for, I guess, over 3 days on the floor to push an issue that the \nAmerican people have spoken so clearly to, and I congratulate him for \nthis effort and the work that goes on here to fashion this most \nimportant piece of legislation toward final resolution.\n  But I now speak specifically to the Lieberman-Kerry-Levin amendment \nof which, if you want to gut a good bill, here is where you start. This \nis the first substantive effort we have seen on the part of the other \nside to substantially change the course and the direction of this bill. \nBasically, the private sector has an opportunity to compete with any \nsegment of the public sector, and vice versa. And if you start making \nall of these broad exceptions, you create gaping holes in this \nlegislation that you can drive billions of dollars through.\n  This amendment says that wherever there may be competition between \nthe private and public sectors, S. 1 would not apply.\n  If this amendment actually did anything to stop the Federal \nGovernment from imposing mandates on the private sector, I'd be the \nfirst in line to cosponsor it.\n  This amendment would not stop unfunded mandates on the private \nsector. In fact, it would help Government go on imposing them.\n  As I understand it, since the private sector might conceivably \ncompete for virtually any public sector activity, this amendment would \nmake S. 1 meaningless. It would gut the bill.\n  As my colleague from Idaho has pointed out from his experience as a \ncity mayor, the private sector competes with the public sector in a \nhost of activities such as police services and fire services, planning \nservices, prisons, education, recreation, civil engineering--to name \nonly a few.\n  Under this amendment, unfunded mandates relating to activities or \nservices like these would not have to comply with S. 1.\n  We are told that S. 1 would put the private sector at a disadvantage \nin competing with the public sector, because the private sector would \nhave to pay for mandates it operates under, while the Federal \nGovernment would absorb the cost of any mandates on the public sector.\n  This amendment is based on wrong assumptions about S. 1.\n  S. 1 is a process reform that makes it harder to enact unfunded \nmandates on either the public or private sector and opens up the \nprocess to public scrutiny.\n  This amendment does not try to stop the Government from imposing \ncostly mandates on the private sector. Instead, the amendment just \nexempts a huge class of mandates.\n  As a result, this amendment would remove the procedural speed bump \nthat S. 1 puts in the path of those unfunded mandates.\n  In other words, this amendment will hurt the private sector by \nkeeping it easy for the Government to impose unfunded mandates on \neither the public or private sector.\n  Exempting a long list of mandates from this bill just means making it \neasier for Congress and the Federal Government to continue putting the \ncost of mandates on somebody else's bill--and making it harder for \nCongress to find out ahead of time how much the mandate will cost the \nAmerican people.\n  The process today is broken. It is biased toward irresponsibility. It \nfrustrates information gathering. It prevents the American people from \nhaving a clear view of what decisions are being made by Congress and \nthe Federal regulators.\n  S. 1 would end all that.\n  S. 1 gives us a tool to determine the actual cost of Government \nmandates before we are asked to vote on them.\n  For the first time in history, it will be standard operating \nprocedure for CBO to analyze the cost of mandates on the private \nsector, and for Federal agencies to review the costs of mandates on the \nprivate sector.\n  Without a CBO estimate, a bill imposing unfunded mandates on the \nprivate sector would be subject to a point of order.\n  Most important, S. 1 changes the bias of the current system to make \nCongress and the Federal regulators accountable for the real outcome of \ntheir decisions, by giving the American people a clear view of the \ndecisions being made.\n  American business understands all this. We have heard the letters \nfrom business leaders who are in the best position to evaluate the \nbill's impact on competition. Those letters support S. 1.\n  Exempting actions from S. 1 will not help any business in America. It \nwill only keep a broken process in place.\n  If you think unfunded mandates on American business are unfair, you \nshould support S. 1 and oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I just want to thank my colleague from \nIdaho. I am proud to be a partner with him.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes for the Senator from Idaho and 27 \nminutes for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LOTT. So at approximately sometime shortly after 5:30 or 5:35, we \ncan anticipate a vote on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 5:40 to be specific.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will speak on my own time. I say also \nto my friend from Mississippi that we may not consume all the time \navailable on our side. There is one other Senator who has asked to \nspeak in support of the amendment, and if he arrives on the floor, \nobviously, I will yield to him. Otherwise, I will speak for a brief \ntime. I presume that my friend and colleague from Idaho will want to \nspeak for a little bit. And if it is OK with him, I would like to wrap \nit up.\n\n  Mr. President, I do want to make clear here a few points in response \nto some of the opposition to the amendment. This is not some special \nexemption that we are creating. We are in fact trying to create an \nequality of enforcement of S. 1 to make it clear that it applies \nequally to the public and the private sectors, and that it does not, by \nsetting a higher hurdle for so-called mandates on State and local \ngovernments, exempt them and put them at a competitive advantage in \nregard to, or in respect to private entities that are doing the same \nthing that they are doing.\n  I feel very strongly, Mr. President, that this amendment does not go \nto the heart of this bill. This bill, which I fully support, one, wants \nCongress to be forced to face an estimate of the costs of what we are \nabout to do. It sounds as if we should have done it a long time ago, \nand we should have. What is rational or fair about passing a bill which \nrequires other levels of Government or the private sector to take \naction when we do not know how much it will cost them? As much as we \nsupport some of the goals that are the subjects of legislation we \nadopt, we might decide that it is not worth it, that on a cost-benefit \nbasis, it is not worth it.\n  My amendment leaves that intact. We will be forced to face the cost \nof potential legislation. CBO must give an estimate of the cost impact \non both public and private entities of anything we are about to do.\n  The amendment, if passed, leaves the second point of order in place \ncreated by S. 1 so far as it relates to mandates specifically on State \nand local government for governmental functions where there is no \nprivate-sector competition. In my opinion, that affects the most \nsignificant and certainly the most costly mandates that we put on State \nand local governments. They still would be covered by S. 1, if amended \nby the amendment that we have put in. And it is just there in the \ndollars and cents. It was there in the testimony [[Page S1175]] that I \nread from Governor Voinovich of Ohio and, indeed, from Senator Bond. \nWhen you look at the impact, the big-ticket items, the big-ticket \nmandates, the most costly mandates on the State and local governments \nare the ones that are uniquely on them--education and social services \nparticularly.\n  The current occupant of the chair made the point there are other \nmandates we put on the States uniquely, and the motor-voter \nlegislation, which the current occupant of the chair cited, is a good \nexample. There is no private sector impact of that. In a sense that is \nthe classic Federal mandate. We had a ``good idea,'' and we asked the \nStates and localities to do it. We forced them to do it. But we did not \ngive them the money to pay for it. And that would still, if my \namendment passed, be required to pass the second hurdle, be subject to \nthe point of order, and be put on the track which would eventually lead \nto no money, no mandate. And that ought to be.\n  But when we are dealing with something that affects both the public \nand private sector, I just do not think it is right to lower the bar, \nthe hurdle, for the public sector and keep it up here for the private \nsector. That is inevitably going to mean that the private sector will \nbe put at a competitive disadvantage where they are playing a zero sum \ngame as they are in so many clean air, clean water situations where you \nhave a set level of pollution reduction that the public and private \nsector share. If we ask less of the public sector, the private sector \nis going to have to bear more of a burden and pay more of a cost. And \nironically, and unintended, I know, is one of the consequences that I \nforesee, which is that, if this amendment were passed, it would inhibit \nthe move toward privatization which so many of us support here, \nprivatization of public functions, because a private entity performing \na public function will be held to higher responsibilities, have higher \ncosts, and therefore governments will be less likely to privatize \nbecause they will get this bargain.\n  So I think this is an amendment that is equitable. The underlying \nbill is very necessary, and the amendment does not diminish the impact \nof the underlying bill. In fact, it supports it and it supports it in a \nway that is more fair because it does not increase the burdens on the \nprivate sector.\n  Now, people who feel there are too many regulations generally, \nFederal regulations and Federal mandates, may think that if this passes \nin this form, because of the inequity that is being created between the \npublic and private sector, the next step will be to remove mandates \nfrom the private sector.\n  I would respectfully suggest that is a big step which is not likely \nto follow, and therefore the private sector will be left holding the \nbag, paying the extra cost of this proposal. The reason I think that \nbig step would not be taken is that then--and I speak as someone who \nhas worked on market incentives for environmental protection and is \nconcerned about deregulation--but if you started to talk about pulling \noff some of the regulations, then you are going to put in play a lot of \nlaws that the public wants us to keep out there.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just for a little discussion and maybe a question.\n  I certainly respect what the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nis trying to do. He always gives great thought to any amendment he \npursues or any bill he supports, and he really has an impact when he \ndoes that.\n  I presume that the Senator is--I think I know the Senator well enough \nthat he is for the concept of this legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator thinks we ought to take a look at the costs of \nmandates we have been putting on State governments. Having been a State \nattorney general, he knows what is involved here, and I know he would \nlike for us to review that and relieve the States and the local \ngovernments of some of these mandates that cost millions of dollars.\n  So I know the Senator does not want to undermine the basic purpose of \nthis legislation, and the Senator does not want to in any way render it \nmoot, as I believe I heard somebody say earlier here.\n  The thing that bothers me about the amendment, more and more, you are \ngoing to find that there are areas where both private and public are \nalready involved. I believe the distinguished chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has indicated earlier that already you \nhave private activities in the police departments, in fire departments, \nin public building inspectors, public road construction, public \nhospitals, and city attorneys compete with the private, fee-for-service \nattorneys.\n  So I was just rolling over in my mind as the Senator was speaking \nthat there are so many public-sector services now, at both the State \nand the county and the city level, where you would have this private-\nsector competition and that so much of the bill might be in fact wiped \nout if we pass this.\n  How does the Senator respond to that? Because I am concerned about \nwhat the impact would be. We do not want to wipe out major portions of \nthe bill because we know it is good. But with the potential impact that \nmight have on the private sector, we do not want to kill the whole \nthing when you are trying in good faith to address a problem. When you \nanalyze it, it looks to me as if almost everything could be covered \nhere now.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the question from my \nfriend, and it is a good one. Let me first state that not only is there \nnot the intention to wipe out most of bill, I am convinced the impact \nof the amendment is not to do that. And let me assure my friend from \nMississippi that I wish to support this bill. I was a cosponsor of S. \n993 last year.\n  I was the attorney general of Connecticut before I came here. I \nbelieve in federalism. I know that the States have not been treated \nfairly in a whole host of mandates that we have put on them. But it is \njust the point that the Senator is making that is part of my argument. \nWe are in a time now, I do not have to tell my friend, where we are \nquite appropriately reviewing the whole structure and focus and purpose \nof government, and taking a look at whether government is best suited \nto perform certain functions or whether the private sector can pick up \nthose functions.\n  I am afraid that if we pass this bill unamended, without the \namendment that I have put in, all the incentives go toward keeping \ngovernmental functions in the Government and not giving them over to \nthe private sector, because the private sector is held to the higher \nstandard. The public sector can be held to a lower standard if we do \nnot fully pay the cost of any mandate. So, if I understand the \nSenator's question correctly, it is in fact because: First, I do not \nwant to put the private sector at a competitive disadvantage and, \nsecond, I agree the Government has grown too big and we ought to figure \nout ways in which we can have private entities perform some public \nfunctions.\n\n  But this bill as it sits now will discourage that, as the school bus \noperators--I read a letter, before my friend was on the floor, from the \nschool bus operators association, National School Transport Association \nwhere they urge support of this amendment because of their fear that \nthe result of it, unintended, will be for fewer municipalities to \ncontract with them to provide school bus service because the \nmunicipalities will not have to carry out Federal mandates regarding \nsafety equipment on the bus so they will have a lower cost whereas the \nprivate school bus operators will have to carry that out.\n  So I repeat, I feel very strongly that this amendment does not gut \nthe bill. The bill remains strong, very strong. And frankly it is \nrevolutionary in its impact, forcing us to face the cost, setting \nhurdles, and including setting that high hurdle when we mandate that a \nState and local government perform a function uniquely. And that is \nwhere most of the dollars are that we mandate the State and local \ngovernments to pay.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider supporting this bill across party \nlines. I think it is fair. It is good for the private sector. And it is \ngood for the public, too, insofar as they are concerned about us \nprotecting their health and safety. [[Page S1176]] \n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished sponsor of the \nlegislation is perhaps ready to speak. How much time is remaining now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom Idaho, 10 minutes for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does a quorum count against the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Time would count. So at this point we could yield back time \non either side and perhaps have the closing statements?\n  Are we ready? Could I ask the distinguished Senator from Ohio, are we \nready to conclude the debate at this point?\n  Mr. GLENN. In just a moment. I think the distinguished minority \nleader, I believe, had indicated he might want to have a few words on \nthis. We have sent word in to him that we are down to about the last 5 \nminutes so we might delay just a couple of minutes here.\n  Mr. LOTT. If that is the case, I do not believe the sponsor of the \nlegislation would want to use his time.\n  Do you want to just put in a quorum and let it count? Or do you want \nto speak now?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will yield such time to myself as I \nmay need.\n  Mr. President, a few points. No. 1, Senate bill 993, which I was a \ncosponsor of, principal sponsor last year--it was a very good bill. S. \n1, much of the base of that is 993, but it is a new and improved \nversion. I strongly support S. 1.\n  When we talk about this issue of competition between the public \nsector and the private sector--I will put my voting record up. For \nexample, my ranking from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a 92 percent \nvoting record in support of business issues; National Federation of \nIndependent Business, 94 percent. I am not going to be part of any \nlegislation that in any way is going to have an adverse impact on our \nbusiness community. And I have not done that in S. 1.\n  One of the members of the business community I spoke with last week \nmade this very, very good point--Bob Bannister, National Association of \nHomebuilders. He said, ``There is no such thing as an unfunded mandate. \nEveryone of them are funded but they are funded by tax dollars. We in \nthe business community that are paying the taxes--we pay them.'' That \nis why the business community strongly supports S. 1 as written.\n  But now we have the amendment. I respect my colleague from \nConnecticut, but this amendment says that in those areas where there \nmay be competition, then we are not going to allow this process to \nwork. But that is what S. 1 is, it is a process.\n  Why would we not want to know the cost of some potential mandate \nbefore we vote? I think the people of America want us to know how much \nit is going to cost. What is the impact? And included in there is if in \nany way this creates some sort of adverse impact to the private \nsector--which are the ones paying the taxes anyway--we will know it.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made the point, he said, and I am \nparaphrasing: If it creates a disadvantage to the private sector, he \nsays, I think the people would say wait a minute.\n  Guess what? Now we will know, because of this process. And do you \nknow who will say wait a minute on behalf of the people? Congress will. \nBecause then we can come to the floor, and now it is not based on all \nof these scenarios that we have heard. It is based upon empirical data. \nEvery one of these scenarios, as it has been pointed out, if they \ndevelop then this is where we resolve it: Majority rules. But it is the \nprocess that we know this ahead of time.\n  The Lieberman amendment will have the effect of eliminating from S. 1 \nany cost estimate for any conference reports, amendments or motions \nwhich contain mandates. The estimates on these only come from \nsubsection C(1)(b) which the amendment makes inapplicable. So we are \ngoing to say, you know what, there just may be a lot of these problems \nout here. So rather than knowing that, rather than knowing how much it \nis going to cost, we would rather not know. So let us just wipe it out. \nThat does not set well with me. That does not set well with mayors and \nGovernors and county commissioners and schoolteachers throughout the \nUnited States nor our private sector partners throughout the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the following letters. From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--I will \nonly read a line from each of these.\n\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has loudly and wholeheartedly \n     endorsed this legislation.\n\n  That is dated January 18, 1995.\n  A letter from W.M.X. Technologies, which is a large, large company \ndealing with the waste management issue.\n\n       I am writing to express our appreciation and support for \n     your efforts in crafting the text of S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n\n  NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business:\n\n       On behalf of the over 600,000 members of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to vote in \n     favor of S. 1.\n\n  The National Retail Federation:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's retail community and its 20 \n     million employees--1 in 5 U.S. workers--we are writing to \n     commend you for your sponsorship of S. 1. . . . S. 1, which \n     would restore accountability and responsibility at the \n     federal level, is the strongest legislative initiative in \n     which to counter this growing problem.\n\n  I do not think the American public realizes for how many years we \nhave cast votes in this well on mandates to the citizens of this \ncountry and we never knew how much they cost. To this day we do not \nknow because nowhere do we require it.\n  We will now, with S. 1. And at any point that you want to have a \nwaiver of the point of order, just come to the floor and a majority \nrules and we waive the point of order. But we are going to start making \ninformed decisions. We are not abdicating decisionmaking. We are \nenhancing decisionmaking through S. 1--a process.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and ask unanimous \nconsent the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                                  January 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the nation's retail \n     community and its 20 million employees--1 in 5 U.S. workers--\n     we are writing to commend you for your sponsorship of S. 1, \n     The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. This legislation is \n     the most effective way to confront the problem of unfunded \n     federal mandates while simultaneously resuscitating the \n     concept of federalism and giving the states back control of \n     their budget obligations.\n       The problem is well documented and the solution is clear--\n     unfunded federal mandates must end. Over the past decade, an \n     unprecedented increase in unfunded federal mandates in \n     environment, labor and education, to name just a few, has \n     forced state and local governments to undertake actions that \n     drain their resources and are often in conflict with the best \n     interests of their citizens as well as our industry.\n       As representatives of the retail industry in each of the \n     fifty state capitals, we have experienced first hand the \n     profound adverse impact of unfunded federal mandates on our \n     industry and our state's economic well-being.\n       Unfunded federal mandates are simply another Washington \n     practice of circumventing a fundamental responsibility in \n     governing, the obligation to bring desires into line with \n     revenues. Such mandates are Washington's way to dictate to \n     the states, even though it has exhausted its resources. S. 1, \n     which would restore accountability and responsibility at the \n     federal level, is the strongest legislative initiative in \n     which to counter this growing problem.\n       Again, we sincerely appreciate your leadership on this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n       Tracy Mullin, President, National Retail Federation; George \n     Allen, Executive Vice President, Arizona Retailers \n     Association; J.

Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     Federation of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local \n     chambers of commerce, and 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, I sincerely commend your hard work and tenacity \n     on the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995,'' S. 1. The \n     Chamber membership identified unfunded mandates on the \n     private sector and state and local governments as their top \n     priority for the 104th Congress. Accordingly, the Chamber \n     supports this legislation and will commit all necessary time \n     and resources to ensuring its passage early in this session.\n       I particularly want to thank you for responding to our \n     concerns about the role of the private sector in this debate \n     and the potential impact it could have had on the business \n     community, especially small businesses. Your willingness to \n     include the private sector in Title II of S. 1, ``Regulatory \n     Accountability and Reform,'' and your recognition of the \n     potential unfair competition issue between business and state \n     and local governments, make this a much strong bill that can \n     have a significant impact on the current regulatory burden.\n       Again, Dirk, we appreciate your commitment to this issue. I \n     look forward to working with you to secure passage of S. 1 as \n     well as other issues that we can join forces on for the 104th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard L. Lesher.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                                 January 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We wish to express our support for \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, S. 1, and urge you \n     to vote for it. In particular, we strongly support the \n     provision requiring the Congressional Budget Office to \n     conduct an analysis of the direct cost of proposed mandates \n     on the private sector.\n       Several years ago, we arrived at the conclusion that many \n     of our ``regulatory'' problems were actually ``legislative'' \n     problems. Congress had effectively assumed the role of \n     regulator. Therefore, we concluded, the analysis of new \n     ``regulatory'' requirements should begin during the \n     legislative process. In effect, we argued that Congress \n     should impose upon itself, the discipline of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act.\n       For this reason, in addition to our general concerns about \n     unfunded mandates, we support this legislation. It is \n     important that Congress understand fully, the economic \n     consequences of its actions on small business, in a timely \n     manner. Small business is at the regulatory braking point. \n     All too frequently, small business owners tell us, ``I am not \n     sure I can advise my son or daughter to join me in the \n     business. It is not worth it, the hassles outweigh the joys. \n     They just might be better off working for someone else.'' \n     That is not a healthy trend for the country.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sections as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, tourism, \n     transportation, and agriculture. Our policies are developed \n     through a consensus among our membership. Individual \n     associations may express their own views. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John S.

the broad-based coalition listed \n     below, representing millions of hardworking, tax paying \n     voters, we urge your strong support of S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995. Congress must begin to control \n     the ``unfunded mandates'' crisis facing America today.\n       Our members are quite concerned over the burgeoning number \n     of federal mandates imposed on state and local governments \n     which lack adequate financial assistance for development, \n     implementation and compliance. Without adequate funding, \n     states and localities are forced to pass on these costs and \n     the true financial burden is shouldered by private business \n     and citizens through fees and taxes.\n       S. 1, a bi-partisan effort sponsored by Senator Dirk \n     Kempthorne (R-ID) and John Glenn (D-OH) and supported by a \n     majority of the Senate, is the critical first step to \n     controlling the unfunded mandates crisis. This bill requires \n     the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to analyze \n     new legislation and determine the cost of any proposed \n     mandate imposed on state and local governments. The bill also \n     requires CBO cost estimates for impacts on the private \n     sector. If these estimates are not completed, any proposed \n     legislation may be ruled out of order.\n       This bill does not halt government actions. It is an \n     important educational tool for Members of Congress who need \n     to know the financial impact of legislation being considered \n     before voting on it.\n       Now is the time to act. Support S. 1 without weakening \n     amendments and begin to alleviate the burden of unfunded \n     federal mandates.\n           Sincerely,\n       Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. Building Owners \n     and Managers Association.\n       Denver Regional Transit District.\n       International Council of Shopping Centers.\n       National Association of Home Builders.\n       National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc.\n       National Association of Realtors.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       National School Transportation Association.\n       Small Business Legislative Council.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       Washington Metro Area Transit Authority.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC January 10, 1995.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate:\n       The Senate is scheduled tomorrow to consider S. 1, the \n     ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.'' On behalf of the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation of 215,000 businesses, \n     3,000 state and local chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and \n     professional associations, and 72 American chambers of \n     commerce abroad, I strongly urge you to vote ``YES.'' The \n     Chamber will include this vote in its annual ``How They \n     Voted'' vote ratings.\n       The U.S. Chamber conducts a survey of its membership each \n     congressional cycle to determine the most important \n     legislative issues for the coming Congress. This year, the \n     Chamber membership identified unfunded mandates on the \n     private sector and state and local governments as its number \n     one issue for the 104th Congress. We believe that the \n     coverage S. 1 provides for the private sector represents a \n     significant step forward in our ongoing battle to tame \n     federal regulatory burdens. Accordingly, we have endorsed S. \n     1 and are devoting all necessary time and resources to secure \n     its passage.\n       All the private sector seeks in this debate is information \n     and accountability. We do not seek federal funding for any \n     private sector mandate. Our goal is to ensure that before any \n     significant legislation can be passed or any major regulation \n     imposed on the private sector, a cost impact analysis be done \n     and made public. We also seek, at a minimum, a requirement \n     that before any public sector mandate is funded, an analysis \n     of the potential for unfair competition between the public \n     and private sectors in the provision of the same goods or \n     services is provided and aired. Our intent is to secure full \n     and honest debate and to allow the public to communicate to \n     Washington where their limited resources should be spent. \n     Every day, American business and households, as well as state \n     and local governments, have to consider the impact their \n     actions have on their own bottom lines. Congress and federal \n     regulators also should be required to consider the financial \n     impact of the mandates they impose.\n       This issue is about good government, jobs, and \n     competitiveness. The business community recognizes that state \n     and local governments struggle with such basic necessities as \n     funding for additional police officers, ambulances and \n     schools because an increasing portion of their budgets go \n     toward complying with unfunded federal mandates So too do \n     businesses struggle--particularly small buuinesses--with \n     generating jobs, making their businesses grow, and sometimes \n     just staying in business.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Wholesaler-Distributors,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. [Name],\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator [Last Name]: Shortly you will be called upon \n     to consider S. 1, ``The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995.'' As you know, in addition to addressing unfunded \n     mandates imposed on state and local governments, the \n     legislation includes a requirement that the Congressional \n     Budget Office conduct a cost-impact analysis whenever \n     Congress wants to impose an unfunded mandate of more than \n     $200 million on the private sector. On behalf of the 45,000 \n     companies represented by the National Association of \n     Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW), we strongly urge you to fight \n     for passage of S. 1 as drafted, and oppose any efforts to \n     remove or weaken the private-sector coverage language.\n       Clearly, S. 1 will force Congress to confront the real \n     world impact of unfunded mandates on the millions of \n     businesses, and their employees, that drive our economy, and \n     who must implement and pay for the laws, rules and \n     regulations that are imposed on them by Washington. Indeed, \n     your support for S. 1 with its strong private sector coverage \n     provisions, will tell every employer and employee in [State] \n     and across the country that before considering an unfunded \n     mandate you will carefully review the costs to American \n     business associated with that mandate. This, in our \n     estimation, represents sound government policy, sound \n     business policy and sound economic policy.\n       With thanks for your consideration and best regards.\n           Cordially\n     Dirk Van Dogen,\n       President.\n     Alan M. Kranowitz,\n       Senior Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Browning-Ferris Industries,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We appreciate the attention you \n     have given to views we previously expressed in connection \n     with unfunded mandates legislation. We expressed our previous \n     views at a time when one of our concerns was that unfunded \n     mandates legislation could have retroactive effect. It is \n     evident that S. 1 has a prospective effect only, which we \n     understand was your intent all along.\n       After reviewing the legislation that will be considered on \n     the floor and after discussions with your office, we \n     recognize that among your objectives for S. 1 is creation of \n     a favorable climate for the private sector. In fact, S. 1 \n     seeks creatively to address the concern expressed in some \n     quarters that unfunded mandates legislation could \n     disadvantage the private sector where public-private \n     competition takes place. Moreover, after many years of \n     experience in working with you--most of them prior to your \n     tenure in the Senate--BFI is convinced that your dedication \n     to free enterprise is unsurpassed.\n       With your commitment to assure equality for the private \n     sector--no more, but no less--where competition exists \n     between the public and private sectors, we are pleased to \n     strongly support S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard F. Goodstein.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: On behalf of the over 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to \n     vote in favor of S. 1, the unfunded mandates legislation, \n     when it is considered by the Senate in January.\n       Unfunded federal mandates on the states and local \n     governments end up requiring these entities to raise taxes, \n     establish user fees, or cut back services to balance their \n     budgets. Small business owners are affected by all of these \n     actions.\n       Between 1981 and 1990, Congress enacted 27 major statutes \n     that imposed new regulations on states and localities or \n     significantly expanded existing programs. This compares to 22 \n     such statutes enacted in the 1970s, 12 in the 1960s, 0 in the \n     1950s and 1940s, and only two in the 1930s. The Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates that the cumulative cost of new \n     regulations imposed on state and local governments between \n     1983 and 1990 was between $8.9 billion and $12.7 billion. \n     These include environmental requirements, voters registration \n     requirements, Medicaid, and others.\n       It was not the states and cities who paid roughly $10 \n     billion in unfunded mandates during the 1980s; it was \n     taxpayers--small business owners as well as everyone else. In \n     June 1994, a poll of all NFIB members resulted in a \n     resounding 90% vote against unfunded mandates.\n       I urge you to strongly support S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        WMX Technologies, Inc.\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk A. Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: I am writing to express our \n     appreciation and support for [[Page S1179]] your efforts in \n     crafting the text of S.1, The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995.\n       As you know, WMX Technologies, Inc. is the world's largest \n     environmental services company. In the United States, the WMX \n     family of companies provides municipal solid waste management \n     services in 48 states. These services include 132 solid waste \n     landfills and 15,000 waste collection vehicles serving \n     approximately 800,000 commercial and industrial customers as \n     well as 12 million residential customers and contracts with \n     nearly 1,800 municipalities. In addition, our 14 trash-to-\n     energy plants produce energy from waste for the 400 \n     communities they serve. Finally, our recycling programs \n     provide curbside recycling to 5.2 million households in more \n     than 600 communities and to 75,000 commercial customers \n     throughout the United States.\n       We provide these services in a heavily regulated and highly \n     competitive environment. In many cases, State, local and \n     tribal governments are our valued customers, while in others \n     they enter the market and provide services as out \n     competitors. While we do not object to their entry into the \n     market, we have consistently sought to ensure that there is a \n     level playing field upon which we can all compete fairly in \n     the marketplace. For this reason, we have been keenly \n     interested in efforts to ensure that the private sector is \n     not competitively disadvantaged by unfunded mandate \n     legislation that would preferentially relieve public sector \n     participants from the costs of complying with Federal \n     mandates.\n       WMX is deeply grateful to you for your sensitivity to this \n     potential difficultly and your willingness to work with us to \n     resolve it. We are confident that the legislation and \n     amendments you will support on the floor of the Senate will \n     provide the necessary safeguards to avoid unintended adverse \n     impacts upon the private sector.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff on this \n     and other matters of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Frank B. Moore,\n\n                                                    Vice President\n     for Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 1995.\n     Letters to the Editor,\n     New York Times, West 43d Street, New York, NY.\n       To The Editor: Your editorial in today's paper, ``What's \n     the Rush on Mandates?'' categorically misrepresents the \n     position of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the unfunded \n     mandates legislation pending before Congress.\n       Over a year ago, we began working with Senator Kempthorne \n     and Representative Clinger, the respective leaders on this \n     issue in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, to \n     ensure comprehensive coverage for the private sector. We have \n     nothing but praise for their leadership on this issue and for \n     their openness to the concerns of the private sector. Indeed, \n     when we brought the issue of the potential for unfair \n     competition to their attention (caused when only the public \n     sector receives funding for mandate compliance in an area \n     where they compete with businesses), they responded \n     immediately by including language in both the Senate and \n     House bills to specifically require Congress to address this \n     issue.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has loudly and wholeheartedly \n     endorsed this legislation and has committed all necessary \n     time and resources to ensuring its passage and successful \n     implementation. Contrary to your reporting, every \n     communication we have sent to both Congress and our \n     membership federation of 220,000 on this issue since the \n     advent of the 104th Congress emphatically states our support \n     for quick passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do want to respond to my friend from \nIdaho and say it is certainly the intention of the sponsors of the \namendment--I am confident the desired impact of the sponsors of the \namendment--to leave most of the contents of requirements of S. 1 \nintact, including the requirement that there be a Congressional Budget \nOffice analysis of the cost of every Federal law which might result in \na mandate on public and private entities, and that a measure would be \nsubject to a point of order--a point of order would lie if there was \nnot such an estimate.\n  So we want to keep those facts in there, and we want to keep the \nsecond point of order in there with regard to the mandate that would \nimpact State and local governments in the capacity of State and local \ngovernments, unique as it is, when they are not competing with anyone \nfrom the private sector. All we want to do here is to say that it is \nunfair to lower the bar on State and local governments when they are \nperforming a function pursuant to a mandate that the private sector is \nalso performing.\n  Yes, the Senator from Idaho is correct, this is just a point of \norder. But a point of order is more than just a point of order. It sets \nup here a two-track system, and we are saying to State and local \ngovernments, ``You have the opportunity to put yourself on a course \nthat says no money, no mandate, no responsibility,'' while the private \nsector has to pay the cost of fulfilling that mandate regardless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nIllinois, Ms. Carol Moseley-Braun, be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and commend him for the amendment.\n  I have watched the debate and am very moved by his arguments. I hope \nour colleagues will support the amendment. It is a crucial amendment, \nin my view, to improving the quality of this legislation.\n  As the Senator was just indicating, as currently written, this bill \ncould create unfair competition between the public and private sectors \nby creating a presumption that public sector costs to comply with \nmandates should in nearly all cases be subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  In some cases, Federal mandates will affect both the public and \nprivate sectors in similar and, in many cases, nearly identical \nmanners. The costs of compliance with minimum wage laws or \nenvironmental standards are incurred by both the public and private \nsectors.\n  Subsidization of the public sector in these cases could create a \ncompetitive advantage for activities performed by the public sector as \nit competes with the private sector in the same markets.\n  In the past few weeks, there have been a number of efforts made by \nboth majority and minority staff to develop a compromise on this issue. \nI appreciate the work by Senator Kempthorne to deal with this problem. \nHe and others on the Republican side of the aisle recognize the \npotential problem here and have worked in good faith to address it.\n  I felt that we were close to a solution with an agreement that \nlanguage would be included in the committee report that would have \nclearly stated the policy of the Congress that where mandates would \naffect the public and private sectors equally, and where Federal \nsubsidization of the public sector would competitively disadvantage \nprivate businesses, a Federal subsidy should not be provided.\n  At least this would have established a basis for a Senator to go to \nthe floor and argue for a waiver of the point of order in such cases.\n  Unfortunately, when the final committee reports were filed, the \nlanguage that we had proposed to address this situation was \nsubstantially weakened. No strong statement of such policy was included \nto clarify that Congress should not be expected to subsidize the public \nsector to the detriment of the private sector.\n  Such a statement of policy is clearly needed in this bill. The \npending amendment will provide that statement by establishing a well-\nconsidered and reasonable exclusion.\n  The exclusion is not intended to create a massive loophole, as some \nMembers have suggested. It merely ensures that the competitive balance \nbetween the public and private sectors be maintained.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this wise \nand fair amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut and others who \nhave put a great deal of effort into structuring this amendment have \nthought through many of the very difficult obstacles that we face as we \naddress this bill.\n  We want to support this bill. We want to find ways in which to \naddress what we consider some of the shortcomings. Certainly as we \nconsider some of the most significant problems with the implementation \nof this legislation, this is one of the most serious issues of all. \n[[Page S1180]] \n  So, again, I hope our colleagues will see fit on both sides of the \naisle to find a way to support this and to recognize its importance. It \nis important. We ought to pass it. I hope we can pass it this \nafternoon.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 4 minutes, \nand the Senator from Idaho has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate this discussion. This is \nwhat we ought to be doing.\n  Just for clarification of the Lieberman amendment, where competition \nexists, paragraph B does not apply. So in the bill, on page 21, line \n24, all of page 22, all of page 23, page 24 down to line 21, it is \nexempt.\n  So, again, I think that we have stated the case. Why would we not \nwant to go through the process of knowing what the cost is, the impact, \nand if there is some adverse impact with the private sector? I think \nthe American public wants us to know that information so that we can \ndiscuss that and then the majority can rule. At any point you can seek \na waiver and say, ``No; in this case, we don't need to do that.'' But \nrather than inventing all of these scenarios, let us let the will of \nthe Senate work by giving them a process that will enhance that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nnext rollcall vote Senator Biden of Delaware and Senator Kempthorne \nfrom Idaho be allowed to engage in a colloquy not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Idaho for what has been a very good, substantive debate and to \nmake two points.\n  One, he is right that this amendment would have that effect regarding \nsection (1)(B). So we remove from any mandate that equally affected the \nprivate and public sectors the requirement of section (1)(B), but it \nleaves (1)(A) intact. (1)(A) is the requirement to report the cost of \nany bill before the Senate can act on it. It says very simply it shall \nnot be in order in the Senate to consider any bill or joint resolution \nthat is reported by the committee unless the committee has published a \nstatement of the director of CBO on the direct cost of Federal mandates \nin accordance with this proposal. So that remains intact. The evidence \nwill be there.\n  Finally, I want to say this to my friend from Idaho. I think that he \nand Senator Glenn have done extraordinary work here. This measure, S. \n1, really would force us finally to do what we should have done a long \ntime ago. I sincerely believe that the passage of this amendment that I \nhave offered leaves almost all of the intent of the bill intact, and \ncertainly that part that imposes the most serious cost on State and \nlocal governments.\n  I think, with the amendment passed, the bill is a better bill. And \nmay I say with thanks and appreciation to the Senator from Idaho, if we \npass it with the amendment it is a truly historic accomplishment and \nwill begin to dramatically affect the way in which we behave here and \nforce us to behave in a much fairer way to our friends in the State and \nlocal and private sectors who have to live with the laws that we adopt.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Idaho to lay on the table the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nThurmond] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] \nand the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy] would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 29 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Johnston\n     Leahy\n     Thurmond\n  So, the motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware [Mr. Biden] and the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] are to \nbe recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n\n\n           Delegation of Constitutional Authority by Congress\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, or maybe even the day before yesterday, I \nresponded to an assertion that I thought was overbroad--not made by the \nSenator from Idaho but by another Senator--as to what was within the \nconstitutional authority of the Congress to delegate or not delegate in \nterms of legislative power. Mr. President, I got into this discussion \nabout the constitutional issue and separation of powers issue, of how \nmuch we could and could not delegate and whether or not particular \nsections of this legislation, in fact, exceeded the constitutional \nauthority we had to delegate power.\n  Before I begin this colloquy, I want to thank the Senator from Idaho \nand his staff for spending the time with me and going through it. Mr. \nPresident, this bill adds a new section to the Budget Act, section \n408(C). That section, as I understand it, provides that a simple \nmajority point of order shall lie against any authorization bill that \nimposes a mandate unless the authorization bill provides for the \npossibility that the Appropriations Committee may not appropriate the \nestimated cost set forth in the authorization bill to pay for the \nmandate.\n  Section 408(C) provides that the authorization bill must deal with \nthat eventuality by designating a responsible Federal agency and by \nestablishing criteria and procedures for that agency to scale back the \nmandate to match the funds that the Appropriations Committee has \nprovided, or to declare the mandate to be in effect.\n  Now, let me ask my friend from Idaho, what would happen under this \nprovision, and the provision I am referring to is section 408(C), if an \nauthorization bill imposed a mandate, named a responsible Federal \nagency to implement the mandate, but did not provide any criteria at \nall for the agency to use in scaling back the mandate or declaring it \nineffective? Would a point of order in section 408(C) lie in that case?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Delaware, yes, \nthat the point of order would lie.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Now, further, I ask my friend from Idaho, what if the \nauthorization bill did claim to set out criteria [[Page S1181]] and \nprocedures for the responsible Federal agency but those criteria said \nin effect, ``Federal agency, do what you think is right if the \nAppropriations Committee does not fund the full amount set forth in the \nauthorization bill.'' Would a point of order lie in that circumstance?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yes, it would.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nanswers. I do appreciate them.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question to my \nfriend from Delaware. That is, can my colleague and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee tell me if his constitutional concerns \nregarding the delegation of authority to executive branch agencies in \nthis section have been satisfied?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the answer is yes.\n  As this colloquy has helped show, at least from my perspective, \nsection 408(C) provides that authorization bills that impose a mandate \nand delegate authority to a Federal agency shall include criteria and \nprocedures to guide the Federal agency's actions. To the extent that an \nauthorization bill contains such criteria and procedures, it increases \nthe likelihood that the delegation of authority is constitutional. To \nthe extent that such a bill lacks appropriate criteria and procedures, \nit increases the likelihood that the delegation is unconstitutional.\n  The Senate could, of course, vote to overrule any point of order \nraised on this basis. But that does not necessarily mean that the \ndelegation is constitutional because the Senate overruled a point of \norder. The ultimate question of constitutionality is for the courts to \ndecide. Of course, ultimately, all these questions of the \nconstitutionality of a delegation of authority through an executive \nagency are through the courts.\n  I am satisfied that the attempt has been made in the legislation to \nmeet the constitutional requirements. I thank my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Idaho, for making these points clear to me. As far as I am \nconcerned, on this point, I have no further concern.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Delaware how \nmuch I appreciate his looking into this issue and sitting down so that \nwe could go through this point by point.\n  Because of the universal respect for your legal ability, that was \nimportant to me. So I appreciate that the Senator made that effort, and \nI appreciate that the Senator has entered into this colloquy so we can, \nI hope, lay this issue to rest. It allows Members, again, to move \nforward on this bill, which is so important to all Members.\n  I do thank and show my respect to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for his \noverly generous references to my legal abilities.\n  In the event that the next election does not turn out as I wish, I \nhope everyone listened to it. And I wish it were true, although it is \nnot warranted. I appreciate the sentiment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nyield?\n  May I say that I, too, have great respect for the opinion and \nviewpoints of our friend from Delaware, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. He teaches courses in law, and has served as the \nchairman of that Judiciary Committee for many years.\n  And what he says carry great weight with me. But I must say that this \nSenator's concerns are not allayed. I will expound upon those concerns \nin due time, and I also expect to have an amendment prepared, and \nperhaps a couple of amendments, which, if agreed to, will allay my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield briefly on this point \nand my friend from Delaware will also perhaps engage me in a colloquy, \nbecause I also have some continuing concerns on this issue, although I \ndo think there has been some significant clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from \nMichigan?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, Mr. President, I yield but retain my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question would be this: The word ``specific'' is not in \nhere. Would this be clearer, does the Senator from Delaware believe, if \nthe word ``specific'' were added before the words ``criteria and \nprocedure\"?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may respond, the answer is yes. I do \nnot think it is necessary, but it would not do any damage to the \nsection.\n  Again, I do not want to take too much time, but if you look at the \ncase law here, the real issue is not whether or not we can delegate \nauthority, it is how much authority can we delegate and with what \nspecificity do we delegate.\n  So to the extent that we demand specificity, it increases the \nprospect that whatever authority is delegated is constitutionally \npermissible. That is why I said in my colloquy with my friend from \nIdaho that to the extent that an authorization bill contains such \ncriteria and procedure, specific criteria and procedure, to the extent \nit does, it does not make it constitutional, it increases the prospects \nthat it will be constitutional. To the extent that it lacks \nspecificity, it diminishes the prospect that it would be held to be \nconstitutional.\n  So neither the Senator from Idaho nor I, I believe, are asserting \nthat this does not have the potential to raise a constitutional \nquestion, but merely to suggest, and I would refer --maybe what I \nshould do before this bill is finished is refer to some of the case law \nthat I think indicates that it is likely--likely--that the Court would, \nin fact, rule that we have not delegated authority beyond what we are \nconstitutionally permitted to do.\n  And to relate to the degree of specificity, I have no objection. It \nis not my bill, so it is presumptuous of me to suggest what should and \nshould not be added. I have no objection it be added. I think it \nstrengthens it marginally without in any way weakening the intent of \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friends from Idaho and Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 169 to Amendment No. 31\n\n(Purpose: To ensure Federal agencies provide a written estimate of the \n    costs private sector mandates on the private sector during the \n                          regulatory process)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 169.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment, add the following:\n       (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an \n     agency statement prepared pursuant to Section 202(a) shall \n     also be prepared for a Federal Private Sector Mandate that \n     may result in the expenditure by State, local, tribal \n     governments, or the private sector, in the aggregate, of \n     $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation by the \n     Consumer Price Index) in any 1 year.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment the leaders \nof this legislation, Senator Kempthorne and Senator Glenn, for their \npatience and for their diligence in pursuing a piece of legislation \nwhich I think is very much needed and is a very good piece of \nlegislation. They have taken giant steps toward eliminating unfunded \nmandates on public entities.\n  This legislation says if we pass legislation, we should know how much \nit costs on public entities, and if we are going to mandate something \non a public entity that if we do not provide the funding that a point \nof order can be raised to stop that mandate. I think that is a good \nstep. We should know what it costs and, frankly, if we are not going to \nprovide the funding, we should have some capability to stop it, and \nthis legislation has done that and I compliment the authors.\n  The legislation also says that if we have legislation pending that \nhas a [[Page S1182]] negative or has an impact on the economy of over \n$200 million on the private sector, that CBO should score it; CBO \nshould tell us what that impact is before it becomes final. I think \nthat is good. If we are going to pass legislation, if we are going to \nmake laws, we should know what its impact is on the economy before it \nis too late. Maybe the impact is positive, maybe it is negative, but we \nshould know what it is. I think that makes us a lot more accountable. \nHopefully, it will make us better legislators. So I think that is a \nvery good provision.\n  The legislation also says that regulatory agencies, if they are going \nto implement regulations that would have an impact on the public sector \nof over $100 million, they should at least identify what that cost is. \nSo if you have the EPA or OSHA or if you have any other regulatory \nagency make a regulation that has a negative impact or a positive \nimpact on the public sector--State, city governments--we should know \nwhat that cost is if it exceeds $100 million.\n  The amendment that Senator Domenici and myself and Senator Shelby \noffered, and in which others have an interest, would go a step further \nand says if the regulatory agencies make a regulation that has a \nnegative impact on the private sector of over $100 million, we should \nknow what that cost is, too.\n  In other words, the legislation does a great job in identifying costs \nand unfunded mandates from the legislators, from Congress, and it does \na good job from the regulatory side in at least identifying the costs--\nnot prohibiting it but at least identifying the costs from the \nregulatory side--as it impacts the public sector, but it is silent \nright now as far as the regulatory impact on the private sector.\n  That is what our amendment would do. It would say--and it does not \nprohibit the regulatory agency from implementing it, it says they would \nhave to identify the cost.\n  I think it is a good amendment. It is one with which I hope my \ncolleagues can concur.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Domenici, for his leadership \nbecause actually we have been working on this now for a couple of \nyears. This is supported very, very strongly by all the business \nsector, all the private sector. I think it is an amendment that should \nreceive unanimous support.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \n60 minutes of debate on the Nickles amendment No. 169, equally divided \nbetween Senators Nickles and Glenn, and at the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, a vote occur on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object--and I will object--we have \nobjection on our side to proceeding with that time limit at this time. \nWe might be able to agree to it later but not now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I join Senator Nickles in urging the \nSenate adopt this amendment. I do not know how many Senators have \nparticipated with numbers of small business people in their States, but \nI happen to be a fortunate one.\n  I set up a little project in my State. I called it Small Business \nAdvocacy Council, and asked five small business leaders to head it from \nall over the State. Then we proceeded to invite groups of small \nbusinesses to five different parts of New Mexico for 2 to 4 hours to \ntalk about the regulatory processes of this country as it applied to \ntheir well-being, to their businesses, to their ability to have more \njobs and grow, and whether the regulations were reasonable and made \ncommon sense.\n  I was absolutely dumbfounded to hear with almost one voice, \nregardless from what sector--whether they were retailers, realtors, \nmanufacturers, service businesses--with one voice, they were saying \nthree things: One: ``Senator, the Federal Government's bureaucratic \nagencies enforcing regulations treats us as if we are their enemies, \nnot constituents, not customers, not taxpayers, not small business \npeople earning a living and paying people, but as if we are their \nenemies.''\n  I say this loud and clear: I do not have an answer to that. This \namendment will not answer that. But I tell you, it is part of this \ngreat motion out there against big government. It is as much a part of \nbig government ought to get littler as the literal size of government \nis being attacked.\n\n  Second, I regret to tell you that, again, with almost unanimous \nfeeling, the three agencies of this Government that are most \nadversarial, less friendly, and thus for some less American happen to \nbe OSHA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the IRS. Now, \nfrankly, I did not think the IRS was still in there since we reformed \nthe tax laws, but they are, I say to my friend. They are right up there \nas the agency that treats people as if they were aliens, illegal, \nenemies.\n  Then the second thing that was harmoniously spoken about, nobody has \na chance of looking at these regulations to see if they make sense and \nto see how much they cost. They cited innumerable examples of both \nunreasonable regulations and legislation that costs so much money that \nif slightly changed toward common sense could dramatically reduce the \ncost on people, on businesses, on our livelihood and our \nentrepreneurial advantage called opportunity America.\n  The third was, why does not somebody look at these before they adopt \nthem--loud and clear--these regulations?\n  Now, again, we will through the year, under the leadership of Senator \nNickles and others, address these issues in a more specific manner as \nwe talk about overregulations, unpropitious regulations, regulations \nthat make no sense. But we can at least in this bill, which purports to \ntry to help small business in some way, require that we know how much \nthey are going to cost; that is, regulations to be promulgated and \nrendered effective against American business, whether it be in Idaho, \nUtah, Oklahoma, New Mexico, or New York.\n  All this amendment does is say to the regulatory processes of this \ncountry, if a regulation is going to exceed $100 million, you must \nweigh it and tell us about its economic disadvantages.\n  Now, frankly, some may say we are not going to be able to do that in \nevery case. We may not. But just as it is time to reorient our Federal \nGovernment versus our cities and States and counties in something we \nchoose to call, again, refederalism, a new partnership, a return to the \n10th amendment, which said we are not supposed to be doing so many \nthings up here, we ought to do the same thing for small business to the \nextent that we can. We ought to be more understanding and more in \npartnership with them than adversarial. And a very simplistic, but, I \nbelieve, necessary approach to that, is to say these kinds of \nregulations are going to be measured in terms of their dollar impact, \nor cost is another way to say it, cost to American business, be it in \nyour State, Mr. President, or mine, or in California. All total, a $100 \nmillion impact is to be noted as to its effect on competitiveness, its \neffect on other aspects so it is more apt to be vested with something \nvery, very simple, and that is that we understand before we do it \nbecause we have some evaluations, so we act with knowledge.\n  If we acted with knowledge of the impacts, I do not think my group in \nNew Mexico, the small business advocacy group, in its four or five \nhearings with a lot of business people, would be telling us the horror \nstories we hear, nor would they be harboring the animosity, anger, and \nanguish they hold toward their own Government today.\n  Anybody who thinks that does not exist is just not talking to them. \nAnd anybody who thinks that is just because they do not want anybody to \ntell them what to do on anything is just not talking to the responsible \nbusiness people I have been talking to. They just do not want to be \ntreated irresponsibly. They want to be treated responsibly.\n  While I say we are not going to do that with specificity, we are not \ngoing to have a new approach to the whole regulatory process, we are \nnot going to have a new approach which I believe we should have to \nreceive input from those [[Page S1183]] affected, we are not going to \nhave statewide councils that might look at these regulations and report \nbefore they become effective so we might have some common sense, these \nare ideas that came out of these conferences of which I spoke. They are \ngood ideas. We ought to do them. We ought to even consider on the \nregulatory process having them evaluated on an annual basis by an \noutside group for customer satisfaction.\n  Every businessman that serves a lot of people does that, has a \nprivate company come in and in a random way ask: Did we do what we said \nwhen we said we would take your $138 and fix your car? Did we treat you \nright? They get graded so the businessman knows if they are customer \nfriendly.\n  We do not have a chance of doing that with Federal regulations. Maybe \nwe will in the future. Let us take one small step today and put small \nbusiness in this bill. If we are going to affect them nationally over \n$100 million, let us get the impact of that in ways that are \nunderstandable. We may have to develop a few new techniques, but it is \nsure worth it to get started down that path just as much as it is for \nthe public sector.\n  I thank the Senator for letting me join, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the problem of regulatory review is one \nthat goes across the length and breadth of the whole Government, as we \nare all aware. We can pass all sorts of laws in the Senate or the \nCongress, the House of Representatives, whatever; we can pass all sorts \nof laws and then we pass them over to the executive branch to have the \nrules and regulations written, and sometimes the way things come out is \ncompletely different than what we expected when we passed the \nlegislation. So regulatory review is a most important item with which \nwe have to deal.\n  Now, I have been working in this area of regulatory review on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for a long time, for a number of years, \nand I am very concerned about it. I compliment my colleagues from \nOklahoma and from New Mexico for the work they have done and the \ninterest they have taken in this particular area, and I think that is \ngreat.\n  I had originally thought that perhaps I would oppose this on one \nground and that is--not on substantive grounds but on the fact that I \nhave legislation that will be in hearing on February 8 by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. It is S. 100. It is a bill that deals \nwith regulatory review in general all across Government. I hope we will \ntake a broad view of this and make more sense out of regulatory review \nthan the way we run it now.\n  We worked with IRA, Information and Regulatory Affairs, through the \nyears, and OMB, through the last two administrations and this \nadministration, and we hope that the new legislation will make more \nsense out of regulatory review across the whole length and breadth of \nGovernment, and make sure that we do not just let the regulation \nwriters proceed without some bridle on them as far as ignoring the \ncosts to public and private interests out there all across the country.\n  So, having said that, I am very, very sympathetic to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma is trying to do here in making sure \nthat we get regulatory review.\n  Now, staff tells me that what Senators are proposing here is very \nsimilar or nearly identical--very similar anyway to the Presidential \nExecutive order that deals with this same subject. We are checking that \nright now. We are also checking with some of the people on our side who \nwe think might have a particular interest in this particular amendment, \nand I will be able to give my colleague an answer as to whether we can \naccept this shortly. I do not want to delay this. But unless he wanted \nto talk or somebody else wanted to talk, I would just put in a quorum \ncall at the time until we get an answer back. I hope it will be just a \nfew minutes. It was my understanding in discussing this with my friend \nfrom Oklahoma he would be willing to have a voice vote on this and we \ncould get on with other business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my friend \nand colleague from Ohio. To answer a couple of his questions, I am \nhappy to have a voice vote. I am happy to proceed.\n  I have a hard time imagining anybody really opposing this amendment \nbecause, as you mentioned, it may parallel what the administration is \ntrying to do. Certainly if regulatory agencies are going to have \nmandates on the private sector in excess of $100 million, they should \nat least identify it. I think in any of the regular reform bills that \nwill probably be included.\n  Plus the fact we are, in this legislation, telling the regulatory \nagencies to identify the costs if they have an impact on the public \nsector in excess of $100 million. Certainly, if they are going to do \nthat for the public sector, they should also do it for the private \nsector. They can probably do it at one and the same time. A lot of \nbills have impacts on both the public and private sectors. So I do not \neven think it will be a duplicative effort. It will just be done.\n  Again, if a regulatory agency is going to take an action that has an \nimpact of over $100 million, for all practical purposes they should \nhave a cost estimate.\n  So I appreciate my colleague's interest in this. I also want to \ncompliment him and assure him and Senator Roth and others, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Bond, Senator Hutchison, and others--a lot of people \nhave done a lot of work on regulatory reform. It is going to be very \nextensive. I am looking forward to that.\n  And we are not doing that here. I am talking about cost-benefit \nanalysis, risk assessment, using science, as my friend and colleague \nfrom Ohio has alluded to in the past. It is important that we use real \nscience in making some of our determinations.\n  I look forward to that debate and that bill, because I think it will \nbe a giant step, one that should be bipartisan and one that will help \nrein in the excessive costs of regulation.\n  This particular amendment does not do anything to rein it in. It just \nsays it should be identified. That by itself might help rein it in. If \nsomeone in the private sector disagreed with it, we could dispute it. \nWe could have a hearing. And if someone says this regulation from EPA \ncosts $500 million per year to the private sector, maybe the private \nsector would come in and say, we disagree, it costs $3 billion. That \nwould be good interest, good information for people to have. This does \nnot stop the regulations from coming into effect. It just says they \nshould be identified. It is identical with the regulation on the public \nsector. We think we should identify it for the private sector as well.\n  I know there was an interest a moment ago to have a 1-hour time \nagreement. I told the managers of the bill that is not necessary for \nthis Senator. I think this is a commonsense amendment, readily \nunderstood. Hopefully, it will be agreed upon.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, just one further comment. I see another \nSenator seeking the floor here. Just one comment on this.\n  The only other caveat I had on this, this bill originally set out to \ndeal with unfunded Federal mandates. We now have gotten into public \noverlap and so on, and we are into cross-pollination here in so many \nareas.\n  I do not think this particular amendment breaks any new ground in \nthis. So I do not have any objection on that ground. We are going to \ntry to deal with a lot of these things, though, in the regular review \nof S. 100.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President I also rise in support of the amendment. \nAs I think has already been articulated, the small businesses, and the \nprivate sector more generally, of this country are heavily inundated \nwith burdens imposed by government and direct kinds of taxes and costs. \nThey are actually, I think, burdened by regulations that impose \nmandates on them. So I believe the amendment is well in order and \nshould be supported.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1, which, of course, addresses \nthe problem of unfunded Federal mandates. S. 1 would significantly \nlimit the Federal Government's ability to require State \n[[Page S1184]] or local governments to undertake affirmative activities \nor comply with Federal standards unless the Federal Government was also \nprepared to reimburse the costs of such activities or compliance. As \nwith direct Federal expenditures, the financial burdens of such \nmandates fall squarely upon the middle-class taxpayer. I strongly \ncommend Senator Kempthorne for continuing leadership on this issue and \nfor his sponsorship of S. 1.\n  Perhaps nothing better reflects contemporary trends in government \nthan the enormous growth in the level of unfunded Federal mandates over \nthe past two decades. An unfunded mandate arises when the Federal \nGovernment imposes some responsibility or obligation upon a State or \nlocal government to implement a program or carry out an action without, \nat the same time, providing the State or local government with the \nnecessary funding. Several recent illustrations of unfunded mandates \ninclude obligations imposed on States and localities to establish \nminimum voter registration procedures in the Motor Vehicle Voter \nRegistration Act; obligations imposed on States and localities to \nconduct automobile emissions testing programs under the Clean Air Act; \nand obligations imposed on States and localities to monitor water \nsystems for contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act. These \nexamples, however, are only the smallest tip of the iceberg.\n  While there is virtually no area of public activity in which Federal \nmandates are absent, such mandates are most visible in the area of \nenvironmental legislation. Of the 12 most costly mandates identified by \nthe National Association of Counties in a 1993 survey, 7 of them \ninvolve environmental programs such as the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Superfund Act.\n  The negative effects of unfunded Federal mandates are at least \nfivefold: First, such mandates camouflage the full extent of Federal \nGovernment spending by placing an increasingly significant share of \nthat spending off-budget, in the form of costs imposed upon other \nlevels of government. While it is extraordinarily difficult to assess \nthe dollar costs of unfunded mandates, a sense of their magnitude is \nevidenced by a 3-month study done earlier this year by the State of \nMaryland, in which they concluded that approximately 24 percent of \ntheir total budget was committed to meeting legal requirements mandated \nby Congress. Assuming the rough accuracy of this estimation, and \nassuming that Maryland is not subject to extraordinary levels of \nmandates, this would amount to approximately $80 to $85 billion imposed \nnationally upon all State governments. This figure does not include \nmandates imposed upon local governments. To calculate the true burden \nof Federal spending, the costs of these mandates must be added to an \nalready bloated Federal budget. The Federal Government consumes the \nlimited resources of the people every bit as much when it compels State \nor local governments to do something as when it directly does something \nitself.\n  Second, the impact of the unfunded Federal mandate is to distort the \ncost-benefit analysis that Congress undertakes in assessing individual \npieces of legislation. The costs imposed by the Congress upon States \nand localities are rarely considered, much less estimated with any \naccuracy. As a result, the presumed benefits of legislative measures \nare not viewed in the full context of their costs. Legislative benefits \ntend consistently to be overestimated and legislative costs tend \nconsistently to be underestimated.\n\n  Third, unfunded Federal mandates burden State and local governments \nwith spending obligations for programs which they have never chosen to \nincur while requiring them to reduce spending obligations for programs \nwhich they have chosen to incur. For the options are clear when \nmandates are imposed by Washington: Either State and local governments \nmust raise taxes--since they do not have the same access to deficit \nspending as the Federal Government--or they must reorder their budget \nby reducing or terminating programs which had already been determined \nto merit public resources. With State balanced budget requirements and \nwith taxpayers already burdened to the hilt by government demands for a \nshare of their income, State and local governments are forced into a \nzero-sum analysis by unfunded mandates; every new Federal mandate must \nbe compensated for directly by a reduction in another area of State or \nlocal spending. Further, every Federal mandate must effectively be \ntreated as the number one spending priority by State and local \ngovernments, notwithstanding the sense of their community and the \njudgment of their elected officials. Such governments must first budget \nwhatever is necessary to pay for the mandates and only afterwards \nevaluate the level of resources remaining for other spending measures.\n  Which leads to the fourth impact of the unfunded Federal mandate. An \nincreasing proportion of State and local budgets is devoted to spending \nmeasures deemed to be important not by the elected representatives in \nthose jurisdictions, but rather by decisionmakers in Washington. In \n1993, for example, compliance with Federal Medicaid mandates cost the \nState of Michigan $95.3 million, which exceeded by $7 million the \ncombined expenses of the Michigan Departments of State, Civil Rights, \nCivil Services, Attorney General, and Agriculture. Although the Supreme \nCourt in recent years has reduced the 10th amendment to effective \ninsignificance, I believe nevertheless that there are constitutional \nimplications to this trend. It is lamentable enough that the Federal \nbudget has grown at the pace that we have witnessed over the past \ngeneration; for Washington additionally to be determining the budgetary \npriorities of Michigan and Texas and Pennsylvania is for it to trespass \nupon the proper constitutional prerogatives of the States. To the \nextent that the States are straitjacketed in their ability to determine \nthe composition of their own budgets, their sovereignty has been \nundermined.\n  Indeed, the Constitution aside, it is difficult to understand how a \nreasoned assessment of the efficacy of Federal Government programs over \nthe past several decades would encourage anyone in the notion that \nWashington had any business instructing other governments how best to \ncarry out their responsibilities.\n  Finally, unfunded Federal mandates erode the accountability of \ngovernment generally. The average citizen now finds that his State and \nlocal representatives disavow responsibility for spending measures \nresulting from Federal mandates, while his Washington representatives \nalso claim not to be responsible. Lines of accountability are simply \ntoo indirect and too convoluted where Federal mandates are involved. \nThe result is that the citizenry come to feel that no one is clearly \nresponsible for what government is doing, and that they have little \nability to influence its course.\n  I am particularly supportive of S. 1 because I believe that it will \nresult in governments at all levels thinking more seriously about the \nproper scope of government. In truth, unfunded mandates are but one \nsymptom of the more fundamental problem that the Federal Government has \nlost sight of the proper scope of its functions. While there are some \nmandates that are reasonable, Congress should be prepared to reimburse \nthe States for the costs attendant to such mandates. In cases where the \nwisdom of mandates is more dubious, S. 1 would force upon Congress a \nmore balanced and a sober decisionmaking process. Instead of neglecting \nthe hidden pass-the-buck costs entailed in unfunded mandates, Congress \ninstead would be forced to make hard-headed decisions about the costs \nand benefits of new programs. In at least some of these cases, I am \nconfident that the legislative balance will be drawn differently than \nthat we have consistently seen over recent decades. I am confident that \nthe virtues of federalism will be recognized more readily when new \nprograms are no longer free but must be explicitly accounted for in the \nFederal budget. The one-size-fits-all mentality which tends to underlie \nmost Federal mandates may also be reconsidered in the process.\n  At the same time, State and local officials will also have to make \ndifficult decisions. With Congress likely to curtail or terminate \naltogether some mandates when confronted with the requirement that they \nhave to pay for them, State and local governments will \n[[Page S1185]] have to determine whether they are willing to support \nsuch programs on their own. No longer will they be able to enjoy the \nbenefits of such programs while being able to divert responsibility for \ntheir costs to the Federal Government. Rather, they will have to make \nequally hard decisions as those that will have to be made by Washington \nlawmakers about the relative merits of public programs.\n  Perhaps the greatest long-term benefit of the present legislation is \nthat it will force more open and honest decisionmaking and budgeting \nupon all levels of government. When greater governmental accountability \nis achieved, the public will be better positioned to punish and reward \npublic officials for actions. As a result, government will be more \nresponsive to the electorate in its spending decisions. Government, in \nshort, will be made more representative by this legislation.\n  Further, Federal bureaucracies themselves will have to be more \nrespectful of the costs that they impose upon State and local \ngovernments. Currently, these bureaucracies give little or no \nconsideration to such costs because none of those costs are borne by \nthe agencies themselves. When the real costs of Federal regulation are \nattributed to the agency responsible for such regulation, agencies will \ngain an extraordinarily useful perspective on the burdens that they are \nimposing on other levels of government.\n\n  Going beyond the present measure, I would hope that we will be able \nto address several related matters in the near future. First, I do not \nbelieve that the bar on unfunded mandates should be limited to future \ninitiatives. Given the burdens currently being borne by State and local \ngovernments, I favor in certain instances the retroactive application \nof the commonsense principle incorporated in this legislation. Second, \nI favor legislation that addresses the problem of conditional mandates. \nConditional mandates arise when the Federal Government provides grants-\nin-aid to the States with strings or conditions attached. While these \nconditions may be reasonable and designed to ensure that money \ndispensed is being utilized effectively, other conditions may be far \nmore tangentially related to the grants. I do not believe that Federal \ngrant programs should be used to circumvent the present legislation's \nbar on direct Federal mandates. Therefore, I would support legislation \nsuch as that offered by Senator Hatch, which would prohibit conditional \nmandates unless they were directly and substantially related to the \nspecific subject matter of the Federal grants-in-aid.\n  Mr. President, by changing the rules of the legislative process and \nforcing upon Congress more accountable decisionmaking, the present \nlegislation will, in my judgment, contribute greatly to a more \nresponsible and balanced legislative product. This measure is not \nantienvironment, anti consumer safety, or antiregulation, as its \nopponents have suggested. Rather, it is pro open and honest government \ndecisionmaking. If a majority of the Congress continues to support a \nparticular mandate, that majority has the unfettered discretion to \npromulgate the mandate; they are constrained only in their ability to \nhide the costs of the mandate and to obscure where governmental \nresponsibility lies for the mandate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \nresolutions and letters I have received from governmental bodies in \nMichigan in support of this legislation. In view of the strong support \nfor this measure from the National Conference of State Legislators, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities, as \nwell as on the basis of my own conversations over the past year, I am \nconvinced that these writings reflect the overwhelming sentiment of \nMichigan communities, as well as communities across the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              City of Inkster,\n\n                                     Inkster, MI, January 5, 1995.\n     Re unfunded mandates.\n\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Unfunded Mandates have very \n     debilitating effects upon cities similar to Inkster. Perhaps \n     I should not repeat the litany of complaints that you have \n     already heard, but I am compelled to advise you of the \n     limiting factors which automatically places the City of \n     Inkster in a position of default under the existing rules and \n     regulations related to these unfunded mandates.\n       Inkster is mandated to erect three (3) retention basins in \n     regard to the Combined Sewer Operation program imposed by the \n     Federal Government.\n       Listed below you will find some very important factors \n     about the City of Inkster and how unfunded mandates affect \n     our community:\n       We have an annual General Fund Budget of only \n     $10,908,350.00;\n       By Michigan law we can levy no more than 20 mills Real \n     Property tax;\n       Our current levy is 19.52 mills;\n       Our water and sewer rates are controlled by the amount \n     charged by the City of Detroit and they are outrageous;\n       Our bonding capacity is such that our share ($23 million) \n     for the first basin has to be guaranteed by Wayne County to \n     the Michigan State Bond Authority and the State Revolving \n     Fund;\n       Additionally, Inkster must lease the land upon which the \n     basin will be sited for $1,500.00 per year;\n       I need not go on. You can see the untenable position that \n     we are in. I very strongly urge you to vote relief for all \n     cities caught in this impossible web by supporting and \n     seeking support to HB 5128 and SB 993 which will soon be \n     considered.\n           Very sincerely,\n                                               Edward Bivens, Jr.,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               City of Taylor,\n\n                                     Taylor, MI, January 12, 1995.\n     U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: As Mayor of the City of Taylor, I \n     have watched with growing dismay the increase in unfunded \n     federally mandated programs. Congress should implement the \n     following provisions for any future legislation:\n       1. Require that state and local officials be afforded the \n     opportunity to provide meaningful input (given a real voice \n     in the planning.)\n       2. Require an assessment of costs and benefits associated \n     with the planning and/or implementation of any federally \n     mandated programs.\n       3. Federal funds should be budgeted/appropriated prior to \n     enactment of any such legislation.\n       Senator Abraham, if implemented these suggestions will go a \n     long way toward building a meaningful partnership between the \n     federal, state, and local governments, to better serve the \n     American people. I wish to commend you for your pro active \n     position on this vital issue and urge the support of your \n     colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cameron G. Priebe,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                             City of Muskegon,\n\n                                   Muskegon, MI, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     State Senator,\n     Warren, MI.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I appreciated the opportunity to talk \n     to you yesterday regarding my concerns about Unfunded Federal \n     Mandates and the burden they place on cities such as \n     Muskegon. These mandates create an undue burden that \n     compounds the problems and difficulties already encountered \n     by local municipalities. Therefore, I encourage you continued \n     efforts in eliminating unfunded mandates.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this very important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James W. Pruim,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            City of Wyandotte,\n\n                                  Wyandotte, MI, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I am writing this letter as a result \n     of the discussion I heard while watching C-SPAN this morning, \n     January 12, 1995, at approximately 10:00 a.m. This \n     discussion, which took place before a committee chaired by \n     Senator Nancy Kassabaum from Kansas, has prompted me to send \n     this FAX.\n       I thought Governor Thompson did an excellent job, however, \n     I was disturbed by the comments made by Democratic Senator \n     John Breaux from Louisiana and by Senator Ted Kennedy from \n     Massachusetts, whose statements indicated their apparent \n     distrust of the individual states. What I feel was really \n     said by these senators was that we at the local level of \n     government would not be sensitive to the needs of the poor \n     unless the programs developed to assist the poor were \n     designed in Washington. Where have they been?\n       Why do people in Washington feel that they are more honest \n     and do a better job than those of us on the firing line day \n     in and day out? As Governor Thompson suggested, let us design \n     our own projects and hold us accountable for the results \n     rather than having to abide by mandates written by \n     bureaucrats in Washington who are, in my opinion, \n     [[Page S1186]] out of touch with what goes on in our cities \n     on a daily basis.\n       Evaluate us based on our results rather than trying to pass \n     laws and make rules that reduce the flexibility we all need. \n     (Local) Government must have the authority to react more \n     quickly in order to serve the people that Senate Kennedy and \n     Senator Breaux, as well as the other senator from Minnesota, \n     thought we would ignore.\n       This letter is meant to be straightforward and direst so \n     there is no misunderstanding concerning my feelings about the \n     issue of unfunded mandates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James R. DeSana,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                             City of Dearborn,\n\n                                   Dearborn, MI, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: In response to your initial request \n     for my opinion regarding national issues requiring immediate \n     attention, the issue of unfunded mandates stands out in my \n     mind as one with extremely direct consequences for local \n     governments.\n       According to studies conducted by Price Waterhouse, \n     unfunded federal mandates will cost local governments nearly \n     $90 billion over the next five years. Cities will pay about \n     $6.5 billion this year and $54 billion over the next five \n     years, while counties will incur costs totaling $4.8 billion \n     this year and $33.7 billion over the next five years.\n       I have attached a copy of a resolution that was adopted by \n     our City Council. The resolution attempts to focus local and \n     national attention on the threat unfunded federal mandates \n     pose to local budgets and local citizens. It urges our \n     representatives to force change in the way the federal \n     government considers future mandates.\n       I believe that any action on this issue that views local \n     governments as partners in the governance of this great \n     country will benefit all of us who call ourselves public \n     servants.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                 Michael A.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Michigan Townships Association \n     urges your yes vote on S. 1, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act. On behalf of all Michigan township officials, I also \n     encourage you to resist any and all amendments that would \n     weaken the intent of this proposed legislation.\n       Michigan has had a state law since 1978 designed to prevent \n     the imposition of mandated costs on local governments. During \n     its passage, however, 15 or more ``loopholes'' were written \n     into the language that weakened the intent of the Bill. \n     Please hold the line against these attempts to water down the \n     intent of S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John M. La Rose,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nMichigan for an outstanding speech, a relatively new Member to our \nbody, but as evidenced by his speech and by his work in the Senate this \nmonth he in my opinion will prove to be an outstanding asset to the \nState of Michigan without any doubt and certainly to this body and to \nour country.\n  So I compliment him on his remarks. I thank him very much for his \nsupport of our amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to ask a question of my friend from Oklahoma \nabout the meaning of his amendment. [[Page S1187]] As I understand it, \nthe statement that would be required to be prepared, pursuant to \nsection 202(a), if this amendment is adopted, would have to be prepared \nfor either the private sector or the public sector providing they reach \nin either case $100 million annually adjusted for inflation. Is that \ncorrect? In other words, if the public sector mandates the cost of $100 \nmillion in any one year, that will trigger the reform.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the private sector mandate is $100 million more, that \nwould trigger the reform.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But if they were both $60 million, there would not be a \nreport triggered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n  I have one other question. Perhaps my friend from Ohio will want to \nhelp on this. There could be an easy answer to it. In any 1 year, is \nthat any one of the 5 fiscal years that are estimated, or is that any 1 \nyear? When? Anytime, ever? What does that 1 year reference? I am sorry \nI did not have a chance to ask it of either Senator before. I am asking \nthis on the floor. Perhaps we could get an answer to that later. I am \njust not sure what that means, ``1 year.''\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just looking at the language on page 35 \nof the bill, that is really where we are amending the section, that \nsection 202, that is the one which defines the call for reports. \nBasically it says the report shall be issued if you have regulatory \nimpact of in excess of $100 million or the public sector in any one \nyear. I would think that would be any one calendar year. Regulatory \nagencies would be analyzing the cost of their changes, and they would \nhave an annual cost. They may do an annual cost over several years. My \nguess would be that would be in any one particular calendar year. That \nis just my reading. We did not amend that language. We just included \nprivate sector in our amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for that. Maybe I should \naddress this then to the managers. What does the reference ``any one'' \nyear mean, on line 15, page 35? Is that any one year, ever? Is that any \none year of the 5 years of the 5 fiscal years? What is that reference?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I apologize. Will the Senator repeat the question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question is this: On line 15, page 35, there is a \nreference to the $100 million which the Senator from Oklahoma is now \namending to apply to either public or private. And my question that \nproperly should have been addressed to the Senator from Idaho is: Is \nthat 1 year, 1 year of the 5 fiscal years for which the estimate is \nbeing made? Or is that some other reference? I assume that means a \nfiscal year, too. I am trying to clarify what the reference is.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will let me respond, again, I think you \nare right. The reference is to the legislation. My guess is that the \nregulatory agencies would determine the fiscal impact. I would think \nthey would do it not on fiscal year but on calendar year--I may be \nincorrect--and that if the regulatory impact exceeded $100 million, as \nadjusted for inflation in subsequent years, then they would have to \nidentify the costs.\n  Again, I do not see that as a big burden. If you are going to have a \nregulatory impact on the public sector in excess of $100 million, they \nshould know it and identify it. If they are going to have a regulatory \nimpact on the private sector in excess of $100 million, for subsequent \nyears--my colleague mentioned 5 years, and I do not know what \nregulatory agencies--we do 5-year budgeting, although not very well. \nBut I do not know that when they issue those regulatory statements, \nthey automatically cover 5 years. I am not sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While we are on this line--I am wondering, while we are \nfocused on this one line of the bill, I have not had a chance to ask my \nfriend from Idaho this question either. Is the reference to ``adjusted \nannually for inflation,'' adjusted from the effective date of the law, \nso that if the law is effective January 1, 1996, that that is the \nbaseline for the $100 million, and then if it is 3 percent inflation, \non January 1, 1997, this then will reread $103 million? Is that the \nintent of the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In response to the Senator, Mr. President, that is my \nunderstanding of the intent, yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have finished checking on our side, and \nwe would be glad to accept the amendment of the distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma. As I said earlier, we will be addressing this same \nregulatory review problem in the Governmental Affairs Committee with \nthe hearing on S. 100, which is legislation I put in on a broader gauge \nof regulatory review consideration. We welcome the Senator's input on \nthat, so we can work this out together. We would be happy to accept his \namendment on this side.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we also would be very supportive of \naccepting this amendment. We thank the Democratic side for the \nagreement. We commend Senator Nickles and Senator Domenici for their \nwork on this. It is an important addition to the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Idaho and Ohio, \nas well as Senators Domenici and Shelby. I appreciate their \ncooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The amendment (No. 169) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 170\n\n    (Purpose: To include gender in the statutory rights prohibiting \n            discrimination to which the Act shall not apply)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Glenn, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 170.\n\n       The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 18, insert ``age'' after ``gender,''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill has certain exclusions in certain \nareas where sponsors of the bill have determined that it should not \napply. Section 4 on page 12 reads that ``The provisions of this act and \nthe amendments made by this act shall not apply to any provision in a \nbill, or joint resolution before Congress, and any provision in a \nproposed or final regulation that''--and then there is a list of six \nexclusions. These are important exclusions, because what the bill would \ndo is to say where any of these six things exist, no point of order \nwould lie, and there is not going to be any presumption that a mandate \nhas to be funded in order to apply to State and local governments. For \ninstance, if a mandate enforces the constitutional rights of \nindividuals, that mandate is going to apply to State and local \ngovernments and there is not going to be any presumption of \nnonapplicability in the absence of a mandate.\n  The next exclusion under section 4 is, ``If the bill or the joint \nresolution establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, \nor handicap or disability status.'' [[Page S1188]] \n  It is that exclusion that I believe is deficient, and it is that \nexclusion to which my amendment is addressed. We have laws that protect \npeople against age discrimination, which are very vital laws in this \ncountry.\n  Those laws have been fought over, fought for, and they are vital to \nAmericans. We have mechanisms to enforce that antidiscrimination law. \nAnd it is important that age discrimination be placed in the same \nparagraph and also excluded from this bill's applicability and that we \nalso require State and local governments to carry out the national \npurpose of no discrimination based on age.\n  Just as we have said that where there is a statutory right that \nprohibits discrimination based on race or religion or gender or \nnational origin or handicap or disability status, this law is going to \nnot be applicable. A mandate, even if it is unfunded, is going to apply \nto State and local governments where it establishes or enforces rights \nthat prohibit discrimination based on any of those factors.\n  So this amendment would add the word ``age'' to that subsection 2 so \nwe would protect age discrimination laws the way we do other \ndiscrimination laws and we would apply age discrimination laws to State \nand local governments without any presumption that they would have to \nbe given the funds in order to implement this mandate.\n  That is the heart of this amendment.\n  I know that the managers have accepted the amendment, since both of \nthem are cosponsors of it. I understand that the Senator from Ohio, \nhowever, may have a modification to it and that he may want to address \nthat.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  The Chair would advise the Senator from Michigan that the amendment \nis out of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I am wondering if we could note the absence of a quorum so we could \ndiscuss this.\n  Mr. GLENN. Perhaps we could go ahead and I could discuss this without \nit being out of order while we get an input from a couple other \nSenators that have an interest in it. If we could discuss it until we \nget that information, we might just save a little time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, the Senator \nfrom Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me congratulate my friend from Michigan. He has not been pointed \nout much on this whole bill, but there is no one who has looked into \nthis in any more detail and with real detail on specific wording and \ntaking an active part and making sure that this legislation, if passed, \nis going to be workable--workable. And that is the important thing of \nhaving someone like the Senator from Michigan, who does look into \ndetails. We, too, often pass things out of here that do not have that \nkind of scrutiny and we wind up regretting later that we really did not \ntake time to go into details.\n  In committee, in considering this legislation the other day when we \nwere brushed aside pretty much in the committee by party-line votes, he \nwas trying to lead the charge there on making sure that the language \nwas workable, that we corrected errors in the bill, and that we made it \nas workable as possible.\n  Now, that was not possible in committee, but he is continuing that \neffort here on the floor. He certainly deserves every credit for what \nhe has been doing on this, and I am the first to acknowledge that. He \nhas really been a tiger in seeing that this thing was done properly, \nand I want to commend him for that.\n  I think, once again, he has come up with the suggestion here where \nage was left out. In almost all the legislation we pass now, we make \nsure that these areas of minority discrimination, of age and \ndisabilities and so on are left in the bill.\n  I had originally planned to put in an amendment on this myself. My \namendment would have been a little more broad than the one that the \nSenator from Michigan has proposed. My amendment would have said, \n``that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, age, handicap, or disability.'' So in one line it \nwas taking a little broader sweep than just correcting age.\n  I believe, in the original planning of the bill, that color was also \nleft out. And that is normally considered as part of our standard \nlitany in new legislation with regard to those people we wish to \nprotect within our society.\n  Mr. President, with the parliamentary situation being what it is, I \ncannot offer a second-degree amendment to the amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan has proposed. I submit to him, I \nwonder if he might prefer to swing the little broader loop that I was \ngoing to propose with my amendment and perhaps, if he wished to modify \nhis amendment with some of this language, that would take care of not \nonly the age but the color that was also left out and in one line then \ninclude the things we normally include in it. And it would read, then, \n``that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, age, handicap, or disability.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from \nOhio for his very fine comments. His leadership on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee has been extraordinary over the years. He is now \nranking member. He has continued to not only insist on legislation \nwhich is workable, as he phrases it, which is so important, but he has \nalso fought hard to protect the rights of all the members of that \ncommittee so that we would have an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  I would remind this body that the Senator from Ohio is a chief \ncosponsor of this legislation and was the principal sponsor of last \nyear's legislation, which was somewhat different but not greatly \ndifferent and aimed at exactly the same purpose. So he is an expert on \nthis subject of unfunded mandates and has been a leader in the fight to \ntry to reduce the number of unfunded mandates.\n  Whatever is easier, I would be happy either to modify the amendment \nor that it be second degreed as soon as we can get clearance that I can \nmake my amendment in order by asking that the committee amendment be \nset aside so that it be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senator making that request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be laid aside so that the amendment which I sent to the desk \nbe in order. I understand it is not in order and I understand why. So I \ndo ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be laid aside for \nthat purpose and then apparently it would again become the pending \nbusiness as soon as this amendment and its modification were disposed \nof.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object; of course, I \nwill not object.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I have no objection and will not object, but \nI want to compliment the Senator for a trait that I discovered many \nyears ago about this Senator from Michigan. He goes over matters with a \nfine-tooth comb. He is meticulous. He is a meticulous, careful \ncraftsman. And I have said this to him privately on several occasions. \nI congratulate him. I want to do it publicly.\n  And also I think this points out the beneficial effects of proceeding \nwith a little more care, taking a little more time and not acting in \nquite so much haste. It underlines what I said a number of times, that \nwe need to slow down and take a look and carefully examine what we are \ndoing. And it seems to me that in this instance we can feel assured \nthat we did the right thing. I congratulate the Senator.\n\n  Is the Senator going to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe they will accept this amendment. \nIf they do, in this case I will not ask for the yeas and nays unless \nthere are others that would request the yeas and nays. I believe the \nmanagers have accepted this and, indeed, have cosponsored it. In this \ninstance I will not ask for the yeas and nays. But there may be others \nwho would want the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator yield?\nMr. LEVIN. I yield.\n[[Page S1189]]\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is correct, Mr. President. We are certainly \nsupportive of accepting this amendment and would state that I agree \nwith the Senator, that there was no intention to leave out these \nclasses. In fact, we had discussed that they would be included in the \nmanagers' amendment. I think this is very appropriate to proceed with \nthis amendment as proposed by Senator Levin.\n  I would point out also when we think about the pace, that the \nlanguage that we have in S. 1 dealing with this is the identical \nlanguage that was in Senate bill 993 last year that went through \ncommittees in both the Senate and the House. This was not addressed.\n  Again, it was not done intentionally. This is appropriate to correct \nit. We appreciate the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not know if I have the floor or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from West Virginia \nthat he is the legislative craftsman par excellence, as far as I am \nconcerned. And he has been a role model in this regard, reminding all \nMembers of the importance of taking the time to craft laws which will \nwork in the real world.\n  There are times we have the best of intents and we have the worst of \nunintended consequences. We have to take the time to work through bills \nsuch as this. That is a different bill from last year in very \nsignificant ways. He has been a role model, indeed, in this area for me \nand to the extent that I got involved with nuts and bolts, as he has \npointed out.\n  I am grateful for his comment. It is in large measure because there \nhave been a lot of people who have set a standard in this area, that I \nthink is very important for me to follow. I am thankful for the \ncomments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to the extent that it ought it \nto be given public recognition. The kind of public recognition that is \ngiven to a rollcall vote. We have had rollcall votes on matters of \nlesser importance, at least in my view. I am just looking at it from \none man's vantage point. I think we ought to have a rollcall vote on \nit. This is an important amendment. At some point in time we ought to \ndo that.\n  I have not made the request, but I will make the request at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request made by the Senator from Michigan \nis pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the majority leader would just withhold, \nI have a pending unanimous-consent request that they have not yet ruled \non, that the committee amendment be set aside in order that my \namendment, as modified by the Senator from Ohio, be in order. That was \na pending unanimous-consent request, and I am wondering if the majority \nleader might withhold to see if there is any objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor. I want to \nmake an inquiry.\n  If the yeas and nays are ordered, I wonder if we might have that vote \noccur at about 8:30. I think a lot of people left with the \nunderstanding there might be debate but no vote. I will check with the \nDemocratic leader. I do not have any quarrel with the rollcall. Maybe \nwe can have a couple more amendments by that time, too.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with that.\n  May I say to the distinguished leader I felt that this is a very \nimportant amendment. We will have this bill, it is very important to a \nlot of people in this country. The word ``age'' and other words, that I \nunderstand the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Ohio are \ninterested in. It gives the public recognition to an amendment just \nthat important. A rollcall vote is more noticed in conference with the \nHouse, as well, than a voice vote. It also shows that this bill is \nbeing improved by our taking a little time. By our taking a little \ntime, studying the bill, debating, probing. So we are making some \nimprovements.\n  Would the distinguished majority leader like to lock in the vote at \nthis point?\n  Mr. President, while we are on this amendment, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, although it is not \nnecessary, that we turn to a period of morning business for about 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, thank you.\n  The Senator yields to the Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 170, as modified\n\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator would yield for a moment. When we sent the \nLevin amendment to the desk, it did not have the changed language that \nI suggested. He was changing his own amendment. The copy that was sent \nto the desk was not the proper copy. We would like to modify that \namendment, and since the yeas and nays have been ordered that would \nnormally not be in order.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be permitted to \nmodify his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 170), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, strike lines 17 through 19 and insert ``that \n     prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, \n     religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap or \n     disability;''.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1160-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1189-S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, there is a serious debate going on over \nwhether the Federal Government should continue to play a role, the \nsmall part it currently plays, in supporting the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting.\n  On Tuesday, in a speech before the National Press Club, Ervin Duggan, \npresident of the PBS, outlined reasons why support from the Government \nis important, and I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Duggan's speech \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I would like to reiterate my support \nfor public broadcasting because of the important educational role it \nplays in our society. We invest very little and we get a lot in return.\n  Public broadcasting does not rely solely, or even mostly, on \nGovernment support. Only 14 percent of its budget comes from Congress, \napproximately $1.09 per person. The rest of its funding comes from 5 \nmillion Americans and hundreds of corporations who understand the \nimportance of quality commercial-free educational broadcasting.\n  Public broadcasting is no longer just MacNeil/Lehrer, ``All Things \nConsidered,'' ``Sesame Street,'' and the Civil War series. I have been \nparticularly impressed with the way public broadcasting is using new \ntechnology for education. Hundreds of thousands of Americans, who \notherwise would not have the opportunity, can earn their high school or \ncollege degree through courses shown on public television. At 60 \ncolleges--and that number is growing--students can earn a 2-year degree \nthrough PBS telecourses.\n  Millions of teachers use television's best programs, like Ken Burns' \nremarkable Civil War series, in the classroom. Many of these programs \nare now available to educators on laser disk for interactive learning.\n  Many public broadcasting stations are currently on the Internet, \nalong [[Page S1190]] with PBS, NPR, and the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting.\n  In times of budget deficits, we all understand that we have to make \nthe most of our limited resources, but we must also understand that one \nof the targets of our resources is education and that education, as we \nknow it today, encompasses more than just a classroom. It is libraries, \nmovies, television, radio, computers, museums, and the many other \noutlets of information available.\n  In today's society, where quality educational programming is so rare, \npublic broadcasting fills a unique and important niche, and it asks us \nto invest so little--one-fiftieth of 1 percent of our budget.\n  Most of us in Washington have the opportunity to enjoy local public \ntelevision programming through WETA, one of the top five public \nbroadcasting stations in the country. But public television also \nreaches out to the far corners of our country--and in my own State, to \nRichmond, Charlottesville, Roanoke, Norfolk, and Marion. Public \nbroadcasting brings its viewers and listeners programs they might not \notherwise have the chance to experience. For example, the majority of \nviewers who watch opera on public television do not have a college \ndegree and make less than $40,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, I believe our very small contribution to public \nbroadcasting is one of the best investments this Government makes. As \nMr. Duggan so aptly points out, public television could operate for 10 \nyears on what Fox paid for one program of NFL football. I hope the \nCongress will continue its commitment to public broadcasting.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the majority leader and the \nfloor managers for allowing me to use these few minutes while they are \nconcluding their effort to resolve this particular question.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 The Living Tree of Public Broadcasting\n\n                      (Remarks of Ervin S. Duggan)\n\n\n                             investing well\n\n       The little town where I grew up--Manning, South Carolina--\n     was small enough that we could walk to church on Sunday. My \n     Sunday School teacher was a Southern matriarch named Virginia \n     Richards Sauls, one of nine daughters of a South Carolina \n     governor. Miss Virginia, as we called her, never tired of \n     telling us the great stories of the Bible. Her favorite was \n     the Parable of the Talents.\n       In that parable, a rich man leaving on a journey entrusts \n     his property--measured in what were called talents--to his \n     three servants for safekeeping. He returns to find that two \n     servants have invested their talents well--so well, in fact, \n     that their worth has doubled. The other, foolishly, has \n     buried his talent in the ground. The master scolds and \n     punishes the foolish, hoarding servant, but says to the wise \n     and fruitful ones: ``Well done, thou good and faithful \n     servants; you have been faithful over a little; I will set \n     over you much.''\n       That story, of course, is about the generous, productive \n     use of gifts; about sharing, building and creating. I mention \n     it because I am convinced that the people of public \n     broadcasting--the local volunteers, trustees, producers, \n     professionals and supporters who make up this enterprise--are \n     good and faithful servants who are living out a modern \n     reenactment of the Parable of the Talents. They do not eat \n     tax dollars; they plant them and grow others. They are \n     faithful over a little; they turn it into much.\n       I'm concerned, however, that everything those good and \n     faithful servants have built over two generations is \n     suddenly, seriously at risk.\n       For the next few minutes I'd like to talk about four \n     things:\n       I want to talk first about a genuine crisis that faces the \n     nation we love. I call it the triple crisis.\n       Second, I want to describe the remarkable local and \n     national partnership that constitutes public broadcasting--a \n     treasure not unlike our national parks, or The Smithsonian \n     Institution. I want to sketch its true nature, because too \n     many people seem not to understand it.\n       Third, I'd like to say a few words about the dangers of \n     loose talk, of careless rhetoric, about ``privatizing'' \n     public broadcasting. If privatizing turns out to be only a \n     euphemism for defunding public broadcasting in a way that \n     would commercialize it; if privatizing, in the end, leads to \n     breaking it into pieces to be sold for salvage, much could be \n     lost, never to be regained.\n       Fourth and finally, I want to suggest that there are \n     better, more creative possibilities for this great national \n     asset, this living tree called public broadcasting: \n     possibilities for more hopeful and constructive than merely \n     zeroing it out, or hacking the tree down to a stump.\n\n\n                           the triple crisis\n\n       Consider, first, the triple crisis that we face.\n       First there is the crisis of education: Can we send all our \n     children to school ready to learn? Once they're there, can we \n     give them an education good enough to help them become \n     productive, responsible citizens and workers in a competitive \n     global economy?\n       We face, second, a crisis in our popular culture--a \n     steadily coarsening, ever-more-tawdry, popular culture, \n     driven by marketplace imperatives to be increasingly violent \n     and exploitative. Today's electronic culture of gangsta rap \n     and kick-boxing superheroes not only makes it harder to be a \n     parent; except for a few honorable exceptions, our media \n     coldly abandon parents who yearn to give their children \n     decent values to live by. Telling those parents simply to \n     turn off the set if they don't like the violence and \n     tawdriness that they see is like telling people to wear gas \n     masks if they don't like pollution.\n       We face, third, a crisis of citizenship. Can we still speak \n     with civility to one another? Can we approach our mutual \n     problems in an atmosphere of shared purpose? We citizens in \n     the center wonder--and we wince as our elected leaders vilify \n     one another in an atmosphere of gridlock. We wince to hear \n     commercial talk shows disintegrate into shouting matches and \n     peep shows for the lurid and bizarre. Can we create what \n     Father Richard Neuhaus calls a civil public square?\n\n\n                   the populist broadcasting service?\n\n       That triple crisis points me to my second topic: I know of \n     one institution that can constructively address every aspect \n     of that triple crisis. It is an imperfect institution, yet \n     one with many virtues. Its entire mission is education, \n     culture and citizenship. It is called public broadcasting.\n       We could substitute, for that word ``public'' in public \n     broadcasting, the more elaborate words of Abraham Lincoln: \n     ``of the people, for the people, by the people.'' For public \n     broadcasting stations are not owned or controlled by \n     monolithic bureaucracies a thousand miles away. They're owned \n     by local boards, by universities, by school systems, by \n     nonprofit civic organizations.\n       What could be more populist, more Jeffersonian? I can \n     almost see Thomas Jefferson in his study, watching Bill \n     Buckley's ``Firing Line'' debates. Jefferson, a child of the \n     Enlightenment, would have loved the enlightening mission of \n     public broadcasting. Jefferson the small-d democrat would \n     have loved its universal reach. Jefferson the inventor would \n     have wanted to meet the pioneers who brought the world closed \n     captioning for the deaf and an audio channel for the blind. \n     It is not far-fetched to say that public broadcasting is Mr. \n     Jefferson's other memorial: a temple of minds and voices; a \n     temple not built of stone.\n       That word ``public'' means something else: free and \n     universally available to all. To enjoy its riches, no one has \n     to pay thousands of dollars for a computer and software and a \n     modem. If you do have a modem, however, we have a great new \n     service called PBS ONLINE. And you'll find many public \n     stations on the Internet, along with PBS, NPR, and the \n     Corporation for Public Broadcasting. To enjoy the riches of \n     public broadcasting, moreover, you don't have to plug in a \n     cable, or rent a converter, or pay hundreds of dollars a year \n     in subscriber fees or pay-per-view charges.\n       That word ``public'' in public broadcasting refers to \n     something else, as well: a mission that cannot be replaced by \n     commercial operators any more than your public library can be \n     duplicated by Crown Books, a public school replaced by a New \n     England prep school, or a national seashore duplicated by a \n     commercial theme park.\n       Our unique mission is service to teachers, students and \n     schools. This year, hundreds of thousands of Americans will \n     earn their high school or college degrees through courses \n     screened by local public television stations. Millions of \n     teachers will use classroom versions of our most famous \n     programs; my ninth-grade son, right now, is learning about \n     the Civil War from his teacher--and from a laserdisc version \n     of Ken Burns's masterpiece. As I speak to you, teachers \n     across the nation are learning the new Goals 2000 math \n     standards through a service called PBS MATHLINE. At 60 \n     colleges--60 and growing--students can earn a two-year degree \n     totally through PBS telecourses, without going to campus.\n       That is a side of public television many viewers, and many \n     members of Congress, don't know enough about. That mission, \n     however, sets us apart from every other broadcast and cable \n     service in America. For us, you see, education isn't an \n     afterthought, or window dressing or a sideline. It is in our \n     institutional genes. It is central to our purpose.\n       Then there's our funding, public in the broadest sense of \n     that word. Public television, for example, has between five \n     and six million contributing members--five million \n     householders who give generously to something they could get \n     for free.\n       Locally and nationally, hundreds of public-spirited \n     corporations underwrite programs--Mobil, General Motors, \n     Archer Daniels Midland and AT They can buy commercials \n     elsewhere. Here, they care about another mission.\n       Generous and visionary foundations like Olin, MacArthur, \n     the Pew Charitable Trusts, and Bradley also give.\n       And then, joining all these stakeholders in our enterprise, \n     there's Congress. How much does Congress contribute each year \n     to public broadcasting? Roughly 14 percent of the budget for \n     this public-private enterprise. [[Page S1191]] Fourteen \n     percent. To put the question another way, how much of the \n     Federal budget does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \n     account for? One fiftieth of one percent; two hundredths of \n     the Federal budget. In decimal form, point zero two.\n       That's $1.09 per person, 80 cents of it for television. If \n     you bought just about any newspaper in the country last \n     Sunday, you paid more for that paper than you pay for public \n     broadcasting for an entire year. Think of it: Sesame Street, \n     MacNeil/Lehrer, NOVA, All Things Considered, Morning \n     Edition--all this, all year, for less than the cost of a cup \n     of coffee in Chicago. All of public television's buildings, \n     facilities, stations, programs, all year--everything--for a \n     dollar a year. We could operate PBS for ten years for what \n     Fox paid for just one program: NFL Football.\n       Suppose we paid for interstate highways through such a \n     public-private partnership, with Congress appropriating only \n     14 percent of the total. Suppose we used this model to pay \n     for battleships or Capitol Hill offices and staffs? \n     Government leaders of both parties, who rightly care about \n     frugality and efficiency, about stretching every dollar, \n     would, I'm sure, hold parades in the streets to celebrate \n     such feats.\n       Well, public broadcasting IS funded through such a frugal, \n     efficient partnership. Those who are taking aim at it, in my \n     judgment, should instead be saying, like the master in that \n     biblical parable, ``Well, done, thou good and faithful \n     servants. Enter into the reward laid up for thee.''\n\n\n                 Cut Down the Living Tree, or Save It?\n\n       Some of our leaders, however, are speaking in a different \n     way. They have targeted public broadcasting for a quick, \n     sidelong choke that could mean its eventual extinction. They \n     intend, they say, to ``privatize'' public broadcasting by \n     stripping it of federal funding. The professional political \n     term, inside the Beltway, is ``zeroing-out.''\n       So let me turn now to my third topic--privatizing, which at \n     this point in the debate cannot be distinguished from another \n     word: commercializing.\n       The opponents of public television deny that their \n     opposition is ideological; they deny they want to censor or \n     silence voices they don't like. After much complaint about \n     that issue, they now say they have other, more innocuous \n     reasons. Let us take them at their word.\n       They argue that the federal government has ``no mandate'' \n     to keep funding public broadcasting; that noncommercial \n     educational broadcasting is ``not essential'' to the nation. \n     Surely, then, they plan to zero out, as well, The Smithsonian \n     Institution? The National Gallery? The Kennedy Center? \n     Federal support for the Internet? For these, too, are public \n     institutions of education and culture, like public \n     broadcasting. And these too, are not essential; not necessary \n     to life. They are simply among the things that make life \n     worth living, for rich and poor alike. Why single out public \n     broadcasting? I wonder why.\n       Another complaint is that public broadcasting is elitist, a \n     ``sandbox for the rich.'' All the factual evidence, all the \n     research, all the data suggest the opposite: that the people \n     who love public broadcasting are the very same people who \n     make up America. The majority of viewers who watch opera on \n     public television, for example, don't have a college degree, \n     and their household incomes are less than forty thousand \n     dollars a year.\n       What about the contention that public broadcasting is too \n     expensive? the numbers you have heard poke big holes in that \n     argument--especially when you add, to the numbers, the \n     matching efforts that expand and multiply the federal \n     contribution. To defund this enterprise for that reason--\n     suddenly, unilaterally, and without consulting the millions \n     of other stakeholders who produce far more of its support--\n     would be pound-foolish, not economical. To people outside the \n     Beltway, to thousands of local board members and volunteers, \n     such talk doesn't sound like reform. It sounds like assisted \n     suicide--a mask pressed down upon a patient who wants no such \n     assistance, and whose family isn't allowed into the room.\n       Told how frugal we are, some of these detractors about-\n     face, awkwardly, to yet another explanation: It's such a tiny \n     amount, they say, it could easily be made up from ``other \n     sources''--from toy sales, for example, tied to our \n     programming. The numbers don't add up, but who's counting?\n       We need to be clear on one important point: In our economy, \n     there is no such thing as nonprofit venture capital. That \n     relatively small amount of federal funding--that 14 percent \n     of public broadcasting's budget--is our seed money, our risk \n     capital. If ``privatize'' means to ``zero out'' (and we're \n     told it does); and if no clear plan exist for replacing that \n     seed capital (and none has emerged), then to ``privatize,'' \n     means, perforce, to commercialize. Take away public \n     broadcasting's seed funding, starve it financially of its \n     only venture capital, however small--and you force it \n     headlong into the alien world of ad agencies and costs-per-\n     thousand and merchandising, rather than the world of teachers \n     and historians and community volunteers.\n       Surely those who speak of a quick, unilateral \n     ``privatizing'' don't intend that to be the final \n     destination. Or do they?\n       Finally, we hear that cable can do everything public \n     television can do. Why not let a cable network, or several \n     cable networks, program PBS--as a sort of re-run channel? \n     Leave aside for the moment the implication here; the whiff of \n     trickle-down TV. Ask some other questions: Is this in the \n     public interest, or a commercial parody of the public \n     interest? Would America like to lose what would be lost? \n     Would America's existing commercial networks like such an \n     outcome? What would such a scheme do public television's \n     historic role as found and wellspring of innovative \n     program ideas?\n       What, exactly, is the vision of those who would \n     ``privatize'' public broadcasting? Is it a vision that \n     preserves the original dream, or does it torch and destroy \n     that dream? They don't say. Is it a vision worthy of those \n     public-spirited Republicans and Democrats of the Carnegie \n     Commission, who created a new model called public \n     broadcasting 25 years ago? They don't say. Is it a vision for \n     a new and better future? Or is it, in fact, a death warrant \n     disguised as a new charter?\n\n\n                          what the people say\n\n       Perhaps our leaders on Capitol Hill need to listen to what \n     the people say. A national poll conducted by opinion Research \n     Corporation was released today. It suggests that most \n     Americans--84 percent--want that small but vital federal \n     stake in the partnership maintained or increased. Support for \n     federal funding totals 80 percent among Republicans; 86 \n     percent among independents; 90 percent among Democrats.\n       What do these numbers tell us? They suggest that the \n     parents and teachers and grandparents of this nation--the \n     people who live in homes with cable, and in the 32 million \n     homes that don't subscribe--may want a better plan. They seem \n     to want something more than vengeful zeroes, or \n     ``privatization'' schemes that threaten to commercialize or \n     kill.\n       Fortunately, the people of public broadcasting, and the \n     people who cherish public broadcasting all over the nation, \n     have lots of good ideas. All over the country, local stations \n     are becoming educational teleplexes. They're planting the \n     flag of education on new technologies. They're turning the \n     existing infrastructure of public broadcasting into a free \n     educational launching pad into cyberspace.\n       People within the world of public television have good \n     ideas, as well, about renewing and refreshing public \n     television: ideas, for example, about insulating its \n     governance and financing from the political vagaries of each \n     appropriations season. The original Carnegie Commission, made \n     up largely of Republican business leaders, called for a \n     national endowment, raised from a few pennies on the sale of \n     each TV set and radio. That's one idea. A reserve of spectrum \n     auction money is another. Tax credits and ``education \n     technology grants'' are another.\n       The local leaders of public broadcasting are forward-\n     looking. They are highly capable of planning the future of \n     their enterprise. Before changes are hatched that might be \n     ill-considered, we need some decent ground rules. Let me \n     suggest three:\n       First, all of the stakeholders who support this local \n     enterprise ought to be invited to the table. Otherwise, any \n     outcome is likely to be imposed, not democratic.\n       Second, the process should be orderly, not precipitous; \n     careful, not headlong. Public broadcasting has taken 40 years \n     to achieve its present excellence. Why all this haste to \n     dispatch it in 100 days, by a quick, sidelong fiscal \n     choking?\n       Third, we need to be candid about the real motives \n     underlying proposals for change. What are we to think about \n     would-be surgeons who seem to despise their patient?\n\n\n                            do they hear us?\n\n       It was Edmund Burke who pointed out that the true \n     conservatism lops off dead branches, in order to preserve the \n     living tree. Public broadcasting, however imperfect it may \n     be, is part of the living tree: the tree of education, \n     culture and citizenship. To chop up that tree and sell it off \n     as cordwood would be violent and extreme, not conservative.\n       The volunteers, professionals and board members of \n     America's public broadcasting stations are eager to tell \n     their leaders about the worth and potential of that living \n     tree. They see a historian and educator as the House Speaker \n     and they say, ``History: that's what we're about.'' They hear \n     Speaker Gingrich discuss our need to nurture and care for our \n     young and say, ``Education: that's what we're about.'' They \n     hear Speaker Gingrich's speeches about futurism and \n     technology and the Third Wave--about laptops for the poor--\n     and they say, in so many words, ``Technology for humane ends: \n     that's what we're about. Is he listening? Does he know we're \n     here?''\n       Those same leaders look at the biography of Senator \n     Pressler and see a son of Harvard; a Rhodes Scholar, a \n     Senator whose constituents, many of them, live in rural \n     places or are too poor to afford a monthly bill for cable, \n     great as cable is. They say, ``We have a great deal to say to \n     him. Will he listen?''\n       The people of public broadcasting--thousands of them, who \n     have created jobs and educational services and community \n     outreach projects out of their local stations, are ready to \n     join in a discussion about its renewal and its future. But \n     they will also fight the reflex to destroy what they have \n     built. Today they know that millions of Americans agree with \n     them.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\nThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n[[Page S1192]]\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for a \nfew minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            the cloture vote\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I refer to my position on the vote we took \nearlier today on the cloture motion to curtail debate on the unfunded \nmandates bill. On that vote I declared a live pair but indicated I \nwould have voted for cloture.\n  I was not comfortable with that vote, particularly because it placed \nme at cross purposes with the leadership on this side of the aisle in \ntheir campaign to assure fair treatment of the minority.\n  But I took the position I did in the context of the long-standing \npractice I have followed since I first came to the Senate in 1961. And \nthat practice is simply to support termination of debate except in \nextraordinary circumstances and to allow a majority of the Senate to \nwork its will.\n  Over the 34 years that I have served in the Senate, I have cast 327 \nvotes in favor of cloture, and some 55 of those were cast when our \nparty was in the minority.\n  But in the same period I have always reserved the right to support \ncontinued debate--or at least not voting for cloture--when there were \nclear and extraordinary circumstances which called for extended \ndeliberations.\n  Indeed, there have been some 32 occasions in which I either paired \nor, as in two cases, voted against cloture, or was absent. In the \nfuture, I expect to continue my longstanding practice of voting for \ncloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may print in the Record \na listing of issues on which I have voted for cloture from the 87th \nCongress through the 103d Congress.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Pell Cloture Votes\n\n\n                             87th congress\n\n       Amend rule 22.\n       Literacy tests (2).\n       Communication satellite.\n\n\n                             88th congress\n\n       Amend rule 22.\n       Civil rights.\n\n\n                             89th congress\n\n       Voting rights.\n       Right-to-work (3).\n       Civil rights (2).\n       D.C. home rule.\n\n\n                             90th congress\n\n       Amend rule 22.\n       Open housing (4).\n       Fortas nomination.\n\n\n                             91st congress\n\n       Amend Rule 22 (2).\n       Electoral college (2).\n       Supersonic transport funds (2).\n\n\n                              92d congress\n\n       Amend rule 22 (4)\n       Military draft.\n       Lockheed loan.\n       Rehnquist nomination.\n       EEOC (3).\n       U.S. Soviet Arms Pact.\n       Consumer Agency (2).\n\n\n                              93d congress\n\n       Voter registration (3).\n       Campaign financing reform (4).\n       Rhodesian chrome (3).\n       Legal services (3).\n       Genocide treaty (2).\n       Government pay raise.\n       Public debt ceiling (3).\n       Consumer Protection Act (4).\n       Export-Import Bank (4).\n       Trade reform.\n       Supplemental appropriations (school desegregation).\n       Social Services.\n       Upholstery import regulations/Taxes and tariff.\n\n\n                             94TH CONGRESS\n\n       Regional railroad reorganization.\n       Cloture reform (2).\n       Tax reduction (2).\n       Consumer Protection Agency.\n       Personal Senate committee staff.\n       New Hampshire Senate contest (6).\n       Voting Rights Act (2).\n       Oil price ceiling.\n       Labor-HEW/busing (2).\n       Common-site parking (2).\n       Railroad reorganization.\n       New York aid.\n       Rice production.\n       Antitrust bill (2).\n       Civil rights attorney's fees.\n\n\n                             95TH CONGRESS\n\n       Vietnam draft evader pardon.\n       Campaign financing (3).\n       Natural gas deregulations.\n       Labor law reforms (6).\n       Tax reduction.\n       Energy tax conference report.\n\n\n                             96TH CONGRESS\n\n       Windfall profits tax (4).\n       Nomination of William A.

Mr. President, over the last 3 weeks a steep decline in the \nvalue of the Mexican peso has precipitated a financial crisis with \nworldwide implications. The peso's loss has not only shaken investor \nconfidence on the Mexican stock market, but triggered a short-term debt \ncrisis that is affecting currencies and markets throughout the \nhemisphere. Without a swift and sure response to this crisis, Mexico \ncould face serious economic decline and political instability.\n  President Clinton was quick to recognize the long-term danger this \nposes for all of us. A Mexican crisis would hit the United States \neconomy hard by reducing Mexico's ability to import United States goods \nand services. It could increase illegal immigration and destabilize the \nMexican Government. Finally, it could spread to other emerging market \neconomies and further reduce U.S. exports.\n  In light of these potential consequences, the administration moved \nexpeditiously to propose a package of loan guarantees to address the \nproblem. The Departments of Treasury and State have been working \nclosely with the bipartisan leadership of the House and the Senate to \ncraft a loan guarantee package that will bring an end to the crisis \nwithout costing money to the American taxpayer. I hope that soon we \nwill be able to move forward on legislation to help resolve the Mexican \ncrisis while addressing the legitimate concerns that many have raised.\n  I am concerned that the loan guarantee program be structured so it \nwill not become a cost to our taxpayers.\n  In addition it is important there be full disclosure to Americans of \nthose investors, United States, Mexican, and others, who will benefit \nby our United States action to guarantee up to $40 billion of Mexican \nGovernment bonds used to satisfy Mexican Government obligations to \nthose investors.\n  Mr. President, yesterday at the Department of Treasury, President \nClinton spoke about the broader implications of the Mexican situation \nand about the package being put together to respond to it. I believe \nhis remarks were very helpful and instructive, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Remarks by the President, January 18, 1995\n\n       The President. Thank you very much, Secretary Rubin and \n     Ambassador Kantor.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, we wanted to be here today to make \n     the clearest public case we can for the proposal, which has \n     been developed by the administration and the bipartisan \n     leadership in Congress, for dealing with the present \n     situation.\n       We have worked hard with an extraordinary group of people \n     who have joined forces because all of us realize how \n     important this proposal is--not only to the people of Mexico \n     but also to the United States and to our workers. We are \n     acting to support the Mexican economy and to protect and \n     promote the interests of the American people.\n       As Ambassador Kantor said, and as all of you know very \n     well, we live in an increasingly global economy in which \n     people, products, ideas and money travel across national \n     borders with lightning speed. We've worked hard to help our \n     workers take advantage of that economy by getting our own \n     economic house in order, by expanding opportunities for \n     education and training, and by expanding the frontiers of \n     trade, by doing what we could to make sure there was more \n     free and fair trade for Americans. And we know, and all of \n     you know, that those efforts are creating high wage jobs for \n     our people that would otherwise not be there.\n       Our goal, our vision must be to create a global economy of \n     democracies with free market not government-run economies; \n     democracies that practice free and fair trade, that give \n     themselves a chance to develop and become more prosperous, \n     while giving our own people the opportunity they deserve to \n     reap the benefits of high-quality, high-productivity American \n     labor, in terms of more jobs and higher incomes.\n       We have pursued this goal with vision and with discipline, \n     through NAFTA, through the Summit of the Americas, through a \n     number of other international endeavors, like GATT and the \n     Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Group. But we have pursued \n     it especially here in our own hemisphere, where we are \n     blessed to see every nation but one governed in a democratic \n     fashion, and a genuine commitment to free market economics \n     and to more open trade.\n       We have to know that the future on this path is plainly the \n     right one, but as with any path, it cannot be free of \n     difficulties. We have to make decisions based on a determined \n     devotion to the idea of what we are pursuing over the long \n     run. We know that given the volatility of the economic \n     situation in the globe now, there can be developments that \n     for the moment are beyond the control of any of our trading \n     partners, themselves developing nations, which could threaten \n     this vision and threaten the interests of the American \n     people.\n       Mexico's present financial difficulty is a very good case \n     in point. Of course, it's a danger to Mexico, but as has \n     already been said, it is plainly also a danger to the \n     economic future of the United States.\n       NAFTA helped us to dramatically increase our exports of \n     goods and services. It helped us to create more than 100,000 \n     jobs here at home through increased exports to Mexico. But \n     over the long run, it means even more. It means even more \n     opportunities with Mexico, it means the integration of the \n     rest of Latin America and the Caribbean into an enormous \n     basket of opportunities for us in the future. And we cannot--\n     we cannot let this momentary difficulty cause us to go \n     backward now.\n       That's why, together with the congressional leadership, I \n     am working so hard to urge Congress to pass an important and \n     necessary package to back private sector loans to Mexico with \n     a United States government guarantee. Let me say, I am very \n     gratified by the leadership shown in the Congress on both \n     sides of the aisle.\n       By helping to put Mexico back on track, this package will \n     support American exports, secure our jobs, help us to better \n     protect our borders, and to safeguard democracy and economic \n     stability in our hemisphere--because America and American \n     workers are more secure when we support a strong and growing \n     market for our exports; because America and American workers \n     are more secure when we help the Mexican people to see the \n     prospect of decent jobs and a secure future at home through a \n     commitment to free-market economics, political democracy and \n     growing over the long term; and because we're more secure \n     when more and more other countries also enjoy the benefits of \n     democracy and economic opportunity; and, perhaps most \n     important, over the long run, because we are more secure if \n     we help Mexico to remain a strong and stable model for \n     economic development around our hemisphere and throughout the \n     world.\n       If we fail to act, the crisis of confidence in Mexico's \n     economy could spread to other emerging countries in Latin \n     America and in asia--the kinds of markets that buy our goods \n     and services today and that will buy far more of them in the \n     future.\n       Developing these markets is plainly in the interests of the \n     American people. We must act to make sure that we maintain \n     the kind of opportunities now being seized by the Secretary \n     of Commerce and the delegation of American business leaders \n     who have had such a successful trip to India.\n       If you take Mexico, just consider the extraordinary \n     progress made in recent years. Mexico erased a budget deficit \n     that once equalled 15 percent of its Gross Domestic Product. \n     It slashed inflation from 145 percent a year to single \n     digits. It sold off inefficient state enterprises, \n     dramatically reduced its foreign debt, opened virtually every \n     market to global competition. This is proof that the Mexican \n     government and the Mexican people are willing to make \n     decisions that are good for the long run, even if it entails \n     some short-term sacrifice for them, they know where their \n     future, prosperity and opportunity lie. [[Page S1194]] \n       Now Mexico, of course, will have to demonstrate even \n     greater discipline to work itself out of the current crisis. \n     Let me say, through, it's important that we understand what's \n     happened. And the Secretary of Treasury and I and a lot of \n     others spent a lot of time trying to make sure we understood \n     exactly what had happened before we recommended a course of \n     action.\n       It is clear that this crisis came about because Mexico \n     relied too heavily upon short-term foreign loans to pay for \n     the huge upsurge in its imports from the United States and \n     from other countries. A large amount of those debts come due \n     at a time when because of the nature of the debts, it caused \n     a serious cash flow problem from Mexico, much like a family \n     that expects to pay for a new home with the proceeds from the \n     sale of its old house only to have the sale fall through.\n       Now, together with the leadership of both houses, our \n     administration has forged a plan that makes available United \n     States government guarantees to secure private sector loans \n     to Mexico. The leadership in Congress from both sides of the \n     aisle and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board developed \n     this plan with us. It is something we did together because we \n     knew it was important, important enough to the strategic \n     interest of the United States to do it in lockstep and to \n     urge everyone without regard to party or region of the \n     country or short-term interests to take the long view what is \n     good for America and our working people.\n       We all agree that something had to be done. Now, these \n     guarantees, it's important to note, are not foreign aid. They \n     are not a gift. They are not a bailout. They are not United \n     States government loans. They will not affect our current \n     budget situation. Rather they are the equivalent of cosigning \n     a note, a note that Mexico can use to borrow money on its own \n     account. And because the guarantees are clearly not entirely \n     risk-free to the United States, Mexico will make an advanced \n     payment to us, like an insurance premium. No guarantees will \n     be issued until we are satisfied that Mexico can provide the \n     assured means of repayment. As soon as the situation in \n     Mexico is fully stabilized, we expect Mexico to start \n     borrowing once again from the private markets without United \n     States government guarantees.\n       The U.S. has extended loans and loan guarantees many, many \n     times before to many different countries. In fact, we've had \n     a loan mechanism in place with Mexico since 1941. And Mexico \n     has always made good on its obligations.\n       Now, there will be tough conditions here to make sure that \n     any private money loaned to Mexico on the basis of our \n     guarantees is well and wisely used. Our aim in imposing the \n     conditions, I want to make clear, is not to micromanage \n     Mexico's economy or to infringe in any way on Mexico's \n     sovereignty, but simply to act responsibly and effectively so \n     that we can help to get Mexico's economic house back in \n     order.\n       I know some say we should not get involved. They say \n     America has enough trouble at home to worry about what's \n     going on somewhere else. There are others who may want to get \n     involved in too much detail to go beyond what the present \n     situation demands or what is appropriate. But we must see \n     this for what it is. This is not simply a financial problem \n     for Mexico; this is an American challenge.\n       Mexico is our third largest trading partner already. The \n     livelihoods of thousands and thousands of our workers depend \n     upon continued strong export growth to Mexico. That's why we \n     must reach out and not retreat.\n       With the bipartisan leadership of Congress, I am asking the \n     new Congress to cast a vote, therefore, for the loan \n     guarantee program as a vote for America's workers and \n     America's future. It is vital to our interests; it is vital \n     to our ability to shape the kind of world that I think we all \n     know we have to have.\n       No path to the future--let me say again--in a time when \n     many decisions are beyond the immediate control of any \n     national government, much less that of a developing nation, \n     no path to the future can be free of difficulty. Not every \n     stone in a long road can be seen from the first step. But if \n     we are on the right path, then we must do this. Our interests \n     demand it, our values support it, and it is good for our \n     future.\n       Let me say again that the coalition of forces supporting \n     this measure is significant--it may be historic. The new \n     Republican leaders in Congress, the leadership of the \n     Democratic Party in Congress, the Chairman of the Federal \n     Reserve Board--why are they doing this? And I might say, I \n     was immediately impressed by how quickly every person I \n     called about this said, clearly, we have to act. They \n     instinctively knew the stakes.\n       Now, in the public debate, questions should be properly \n     asked and properly answered. But let us not forget what the \n     issue is, let us not read to little into this moment, or try \n     to load it up with too many conditions, unrelated to the \n     moment. The time is now to act. It is in our interest. It is \n     imperative to our future. I hope all of you will do what you \n     can to take that message to the Congress and to the American \n     people.\n       Thank you very much. (Applause).\n\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 171 to Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDodd be listed as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just to clarify a couple of points that we discussed, if \nthe leadership should come in and need some time for discussion, I am \ncertain the Senator's intention is to yield for that. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi, the \nmajority whip, is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is the Senator going to seek a time agreement on this \namendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to seek a time \nagreement. If we are going to plan for it around 8:30, 30 minutes would \nbe fine, equally divided. I ask, if the other side does not need 15 \nminutes, I might need a little bit more than 15 minutes. Is that all \nright?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it would be appropriate to ask unanimous consent \nthat the time limit on this amendment be limited to 30 minutes equally \ndivided, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield for one more moment, I will ask \nunanimous consent, if it meets with the approval of the Democratic \nside. I ask unanimous consent that a rollcall vote occur at 8:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 171 to amendment No. \n     31.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the language proposed to be inserted, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . CHILDRENS' IMPACT STATEMENT.\n\n       Consideration of any bill or joint resolution of a public \n     character reported by any committee of the Senate or of the \n     House of Representatives that is accompanied by a committee \n     report that does not contain a detailed analysis of the \n     probable impact of the bill or resolution on children, \n     including whether such bill or joint resolution will increase \n     the number of children who are hungry or homeless, shall not \n     be in order.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a children's impact statement that \nSenator Dodd and I proposed. This amendment says, and I quote for my \ncolleagues:\n\n       Consideration of any bill or joint resolution of a public \n     character reported by any committee of the Senate or of the \n     House of Representatives that is accompanied by a committee \n     report that does not contain a detailed analysis of the \n     probable impact of the bill or resolution on children, \n     including whether such bill or joint resolution will increase \n     the number of children who are hungry or homeless, shall not \n     be in order.\n\n  Mr. President, this essentially says--and it is very consistent with \nthis overall piece of legislation--that if a committee with legislation \nreports out a separate report, as we often do, then that report should \ninclude an impact [[Page S1195]] statement of the impact of that piece \nof legislation will have on children, and if it does not, then that \npiece of legislation will not be in order on the floor.\n  Mr. President, that is the same point of order that is the \nmethodology of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear with my colleagues that this is \nvery different from the amendment that I proposed last week. The \namendment I proposed last week said that if we were going to be moving \nforward on an agenda that I believe is going to be very mean spirited, \nit is important that we go on record with an assurance to people that \nwe will not be passing any piece of legislation, any cut, any \namendment, which could lead to an increase in homelessness or an \nincrease in hunger among children. That amendment was voted down. I \nwill bring that amendment back to the floor for a separate vote. I will \ncontinue to do so because I think this is something on which all of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, should go on record.\n  Mr. President, this particular amendment, this children's impact \nstatement, is a little bit different. What I am essentially saying is \nthat if we are going to be talking about the impact of legislation on \nState governments, the impact of legislation on local governments, the \nimpact of legislation on large corporations, or for that matter small \nbusinesses, then we ought to be willing to look carefully at the impact \nof legislation on our children.\n  By the way, I say to my colleagues, this is a very moderate proposal. \nI am just simply trying to require that when committees have a report, \nthat included in that report there be a children's impact statement. We \nwill all look carefully at the impact of what we are doing with our \nlegislation on children.\n  In context, Mr. President, The Children's Defense Fund just came out \nwith a study. Unfortunately, this closely parallels some fairly \nrigorous analysis that is being done right now about where we are \nheading by the year 2002, if in fact we move forward with a balanced \nbudget amendment. But part of the balanced budget amendment equation is \nthat we increase Pentagon spending, we engage in this continuing war \nfor more and more tax cuts, and in addition we leave other major \nspending categories out or we put them in parentheses. The question \nbecomes, then, what do you need to do to cut $1.2 trillion or $1.3 \ntrillion? The assumption is, we may very well, with what is left in the \nbudget, be talking about a 30-percent cut in programs that help \nchildren and families.\n  If that is the case the Children's Defense Fund estimates that in the \nUnited States, just looking at fiscal year 2002, we would be talking \nabout overall 1,992,550 babies, preschoolers, and pregnant women losing \ninfant formula and other WIC nutrition supplements.\n  Mr. President, this is an estimate of how many children would be \naffected in fiscal year 2002. This is very well the direction we could \nbe going in. By the way, Mr. President, I think one of the reasons some \nof leadership that has been pushing so hard on a balanced budget \namendment is unwilling to talk about where the cuts will be before they \nget a vote on this amendment is because the arithmetic is so \ncompelling. And in many, many ways, by the way, we are going very much \nagainst the mandates from people in this country. I thought we were \ntrying to act on that mandate, because one of the things people have \nsaid to us is to be truthful, be straightforward, and be honest with \nus, do not try and finesse us.\n\n  I think one of the reasons--and I am only taking one part of this \nagenda--a good part of the leadership--Mr. Armey is just one--that is \nunwilling to talk specifically about where the cuts are going to take \nplace before people vote up or down on this proposal is because of \nwhere the cuts will take place. While I cannot be certain, given what \nhas been taken off the table, given what Senators do not seem to be \nwilling to look at by way of cuts, then we can only look at that part \nof the budget which is on the table. And when we look at that part of \nthe budget which is on the table, unfortunately, we are talking about \ncuts in programs that are extremely important for the most vulnerable \ncitizens in this country, and I am talking specifically about children, \nMr. President.\n  So, Mr. President, within that context, let me simply move forward \nand talk a little bit about some of these projections, because they are \nfrightening. I want people in the country to know about them, and I \nwant my colleagues to understand the context of this amendment.\n  The context of this amendment, again, is that by 2002, on present \ncourse, we could very well see 1,992,550 babies, preschoolers, and \npregnant women who would lose infant formula and other WIC nutrition \nsupplements. Women, Infants, and Children is what WIC stands for. By \nthe way, as a former teacher, I argue that the most important education \nprogram in the United States of America is to make sure that every \nwoman expecting child has a diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and \nprotein. Otherwise, that child, at birth, will not have the same \nchance. These are the kind of cuts: 4,258,450 children would lose food \nstamps; 7,564,550 children would lose free or subsidized school lunch \nprogram lunches. Mr. President, it is not very easy for children to do \nwell in school if they are hungry. It is a stark reality that all too \nmany children go to school hungry. Mr. President, 6,604,450 children \nwould lose Medicaid health coverage; 231,100 blind and disabled \nchildren would lose supplemental security income, SSI; 209,050 or more \nchildren would lose the Federal child care subsidies that enable \nparents to work or get education and training; 222,150 children would \nlose Head Start early childhood services.\n  Mr. President, how interesting it is--I am not going to go through \nall the figures--that all of us in public service want to have our \nphotos taken next to children, and the only thing I am trying to do \nwith this amendment is to simply say that before we go too far, why do \nwe not at least--consistent with the overall framework of this \nlegislation--as long as we are talking about impact statements, why do \nwe not at least say that committees, when they have their accompanying \nreport--and quite often that is the case--have as a part of that report \na child impact statement so that we at least know what we are doing. \nThis is, from my point of view, a very moderate proposal.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President. In order \nthat other Members of the Senate can have some sense as to what may \ntake place tonight, we do have one vote that has been ordered, which \nwill occur at 8:30.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we designate that that will be the Levin \namendment, at 8:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Further, Mr. President, it will be my intention to \nmove to table the current amendment that is being debated, and at that \npoint I will be asking for the yeas and nays so that all Senators will \nknow that after the first vote occurring at 8:30, in all likelihood \nthere will be a second vote to immediately follow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object. I understand the Wellstone \namendment is a second-degree amendment to my amendment. So it would \nhave to be--\n  If the Senator from Idaho would withhold.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was about to ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe considered as a second-degree amendment to the Gorton amendment. I \ndo make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot. As I understand the unanimous-consent request--or the statement of \nthe manager, it is that there would be a rollcall vote on the Levin \namendment at 8:30, and immediately following that, a rollcall vote on \nthe Wellstone amendment--excuse me, to vote on a motion to table that \nthe Senator from Idaho intends to make on the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is correct. I will be requesting the yeas and \nnays.\nMr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Minnesota.\n[[Page S1196]]\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for the courtesy of letting me interrupt.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Idaho, and I appreciate the \nwork he is doing on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have to say to my colleague, whom I really respect, \nthat I am disappointed and a little bit dismayed at what would be, I \ngather, a motion to table this amendment. Mr. President, I have a \nState-by-State projection of what could very well be the impact of the \nbalanced budget amendment on children in the United States. This report \nwas written by the Children's Defense Fund. I intend to distribute a \ncopy to all of my colleagues, so they can see these projections for \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, one more time, first let me start with some pretty \namazing figures. I just do not quite think we are grasping this here in \nthe Chamber, right here in this legislative body.\n  ``One Day in the Life of American Children,'' was the Children's \nDefense Fund yearbook of 1994. I never heard anybody refute these \nstatistics, by the way. I would like to persuade the Senator from Idaho \nto have a different motion. ``One Day in the Life of American \nChildren'': 3 children die from child abuse in the United States of \nAmerica; 9 children are murdered; 13 children die from guns; 27 \nchildren in the classroom die from poverty; 30 children are wounded by \nguns; 63 babies die before they are 1 month old; 101 babies die before \ntheir first birthday; 145 babies are born at very low birthweight; 102 \nchildren are arrested for drug offenses; 207 children are arrested for \ncrimes of violence; 340 children are arrested for drinking or drunken \ndriving. I could go on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, again, here are some figures that I have used: Every 5 \nseconds a child drops out of school in the country; every 30 seconds a \nchild is born into poverty; 1 out of 5 children in the country today is \npoor, going on 1 out of 4; 1 out of every 2 children of color are poor; \nevery 30 seconds a child is born into poverty; every 2 minutes a baby \nis born severely underweight. I combine these with these figures.\n  Now we are talking about a Contract With America, where, by the way, \nthere is not one word or one sentence in this Contract With America \nthat calls on any large financial institution, any large corporation, \nto make any sacrifice whatsoever. My fear--and I have to tell you by \nthis motion to table that I fear my fear is being confirmed--is that \nwhat we are going to do is have deficit reduction. We can have deficit \nreduction without riding roughshod over children. All that I am asking \nmy colleagues to do, on both sides of the aisle, is given these \nprojections, 1,992,550 babies, preschoolers, and pregnant women would \nlose infant formula and other WIC nutrition supplements, in the year \n2002, given where we are heading--I could be wrong--I hope I am wrong--\nbut I could be right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I may have 5 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I have no objection. In fact, Mr. President, I yield \n5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, all I am asking of my colleagues is, \ngiven the direction we could very well be going, before we pass \nlegislation, pass amendments, make cuts that are going to hurt children \nin America, those citizens that are most vulnerable, that could very \nwell take the poorest of citizens in our country and put them in a \nworse position, if we are considering legislation that says we should \nconsider the impact of what we do on businesses, on State governments, \non county governments, is it too much for me to ask my colleagues that \nwe pass an amendment that committees with their accompanying report \nhave in that report a children's impact statement; that is to say, what \nis the impact of this legislation on children in this country? And, if \nnot, then there could be a point of order lodged.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues right now are watching C-\nSPAN, but let me just be blunt. Sometimes we do not know--I say this to \nmy good friend from Idaho--sometimes we do not know what we do not want \nto know. Let me repeat that. Sometimes we do not know what we do not \nwant to know.\n  And I think this may be an example. The only thing this amendment \nasks us to do is to make sure that in our legislative work we have a \nchildren's impact statement. It could very well be that, as a result of \nwhere we are heading with this contract, where we are heading with this \nbalanced budget amendment, we are not going to make any cuts in oil or \ncoal subsidies or military contracts but we are going to make cuts in \nprograms that provide basic nutritional assistance to children in this \ncountry. Is it too much for me to ask of my colleagues that they agree \nthat we do impact statements in reports that accompany committee \nlegislation?\n  What is anyone afraid of? Why would anyone vote against this? What is \nunreasonable about this?\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I think we should have 100 \nvotes for this. This is a moderate proposal.\n  The only reason that I can see why Senators would vote against this \nis because, in fact, the Children's Defense Fund's projections about \nwhat we are going to do in 2002 are correct.\n  Mr. President, I would like to finish on this note. I am a U.S. \nSenator from Minnesota. The floor is where we bring amendments. The \nfloor is where we do our work. I am not trying to put people in a \npolitically embarrassing position on votes. Senators can vote any way \nthey want to.\n  But I want to say to my colleagues, I am going to fight hard on these \nissues and I am going to come back with this amendment, I am going to \ncome back with another amendment on this bill--I am hoping I can get \nsupport for this amendment--because I want people in the United States \nof America to know the direction we are going in.\n  There is too much goodness in this country to support these kinds of \ncuts. There is too much goodness in this country to end up hurting \nchildren.\n  And now I have an amendment to just ask my colleagues to go on record \nto do an impact statement on legislation that comes out of committee \nwith an accompanying report. I heard there is going to be a motion to \ntable. I want people in the country to see that. I want people in the \ncountry to understand that I am going to come back over and over again. \nAnd I do not care whether any of this is ever used in any 10-second, \n15-second or 30-second ads. As a matter of fact, I am told that \nconventional wisdom these days is that it is ``not a winner'' to be so \nactive on children's issues.\n  But I do not believe that. I think people care about goodness. I \nthink people care about fairness. I think people care about \nopportunity. And I do not think the citizens in this country, the \ncitizens in Minnesota, think it is unreasonable that we do a children's \nimpact statement on the legislation that we are dealing with and on the \nbudget cuts that we are dealing with.\n  Again, sometimes we do not know what we do not want to know. At least \nshould we not be willing to include the children's impact statement? I \nhope my colleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  Again, I do want to make sure that Senator Dodd is listed as an \noriginal cosponsor. I would be pleased to speak a little more, but the \nSenator from Idaho may want to respond.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, first, let me commend my friend from \nMinnesota, who is a strong and a great advocate for children, as I feel \nthat I am, also.\n  When he made the comment there at the end that you may not be a \nwinner currently if you are a real advocate for children, I think he \nand I will agree that we will reject that notion. We need to do all \nthat we can for children.\n  Now I appreciate the Senator's concern and I appreciate what he said \ntonight. But I think we are taking different tacks in order to \naccomplish really what he is talking about. [[Page S1197]] \n  The committees that have jurisdiction over programs with \njurisdictions affecting children would include this information on \ntheir report on relevant legislation. S. 1 is a bill about unfunded \nmandates on States and cities, unfunded mandates for cities and States \nto use scarce dollars that would otherwise be spent on discretionary \nprograms, including programs to help children.\n  Now, Boyd Boehlje, who is the president of the National School Boards \nAssociation, said:\n\n       * * * the more than 95,000 locally elected school board \n     members nationwide * * * strongly support S. 1. This \n     legislation would establish the general rule that Congress \n     shall not impose Federal mandates without adequate funding. \n     This legislation would stop the flow of requirements on \n     school districts which must spend billions of local tax \n     dollars every year.\n       Today school children throughout the country are facing the \n     prospect of reduced classroom instruction because the Federal \n     Government requires, but does not fund, services or programs \n     that school boards (must) implement * * *. Our nation's \n     public school children must not pay the price of unfunded \n     federal mandates.\n\n  And he said on another occasion, Mr. President, that the very \nchildren that Congress is most concerned about protecting are hurt most \noften by these unfunded Federal mandates.\n  This amendment would require all committees to prepare such a report \non all legislation, including legislation dealing with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, which would have to file a report even when \nthe legislation does not affect children. This amendment was part of \nanother amendment the Senate considered earlier this year and was \ntabled by a vote of 56 to 43.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In just a moment.\n  Mr. President, again, this bill is a process bill. Those committees \nthat have jurisdiction must include in their report the very aspects \nthat the Senator from Minnesota has been pointing out.\n  So again, it is with all due respect that I will be making the motion \nto table, but with a great deal of respect for the Senator raising this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  If I may inquire, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, first of all, just so my colleagues have a full \nunderstanding of what is at issue here, this amendment is not in \nopposition to this unfunded mandates legislation at all. And the fact \nthat, Mr. President, that local school board official or others say \nthat they think the unfunded mandates bill would benefit children does \nnot in any way, shape, or form detract from this amendment. This \namendment is actually meant to just support this piece of legislation. \nThis amendment speaks not to the unfunded mandates bill, but this \namendment speaks to where we are heading with our budget cuts.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Idaho will hear from many \nlocally elected officials, including school officials, who are very \nworried that if, in fact, we cut into all of these kinds of programs, \nstarting with child nutrition programs, that States and/or local \ngovernments are going to have to pick them up--maybe school districts--\nout of a property tax.\n  Actually, what the Senator was talking about was kind of an apples \nand oranges proposition. This amendment is not in opposition to the \nunfunded mandates legislation. This amendment just says that if we are \ngoing to look at the impact of what we are doing on State governments \nor if we look at the impact on what we are doing on companies, we ought \nto look at the impact of what we are doing on children. That is all \nthis amendment says. This amendment says that if a committee is going \nto file a report, and if the committee is working on legislation or \nbudget cuts that affect children, then there ought to be a children's \nimpact statement. That is all this amendment says.\n  One more time, it strengthens this piece of legislation. It just \ngives the Senate the same concern about children, that we are at least \nwilling to look at the impact of what we are doing on children. And Mr. \nPresident, these numbers by Children's Defense Fund, that are backed up \nby numbers by a lot of organizations, suggest we could very well be \ngoing in the direction with this Contract With America of cutting \nprograms that provide essential support for the most vulnerable \ncitizens in this country--children.\n  I am saying before we rush headlong down that path, at least let \nSenators be intellectually honest and policy honest and have the child \nimpact statement.\n  Again, I do not really understand the opposition from my colleagues. \nWe want to look at the impact of what we do on State governments. We \nwant to look at the impact of what we do on businesses. But for some \nreason, we do not want to look at the impact of what we do on children \nin America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Idaho has 3 minutes and 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I inquire of my friend from Minnesota, \nI have nothing else to add, but if the Senator would like the remaining \ntime, I would like to yield the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy. I \nyield the rest of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. \nI move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 170, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs now on agreeing to \namendment No. 170, as modified, offered by the Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Levin. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerks will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n[[Page S1198]]\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if we can have order, I wanted to make a \nbrief statement here before the next vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I submitted to the distinguished Democratic \nleader a unanimous-consent request and have not yet had an opportunity \nto talk with the Democratic leader. So, because I am not certain this \nwill be the last vote, I suggest the absence of a quorum while we have \nthat conversation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say that we have been working in good \nfaith on both sides today and part of yesterday to put an agreement \nwhere we would be in session tomorrow but not have any votes, and on \nMonday, consider amendments but no votes before 4 o'clock. The proposal \nwas that all the amendments that we had agreed to be put in this little \nbasket to be offered by 3 o'clock on Tuesday. We thought that was fair. \nWe whittled our numbers from 30-some down to 11, and I think on the \nDemocratic side, it was 78 down to 42 or 43. Some of those may or may \nnot be offered. We are unable to get that agreement, unfortunately.\n  I will first ask unanimous consent that all remaining committee \namendments be considered, en bloc, and agreed to and, failing that, we \nwill have a vote on a motion to table the pending amendment, and there \nwill be 5 additional votes on the committee amendments.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that all remaining committee amendments be \nconsidered, en bloc, agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that they be considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I hope that \nthe majority leader will present the entire agreement that was \nproposed.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to read it. I tried to summarize it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am looking at it here and I am sorry to say the summary \ndoes not reflect all that the agreement entails. I hope the majority \nleader will read the agreement, let us listen to it, and see if we want \nto agree to it.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is fair enough. Let me do that. This is the agreement \nI proposed and that we discussed, as I say, on both sides in good \nfaith:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \n     the only amendments in order to S. 1; that they be offered as \n     first or second-degree amendments, if Committee amendments \n     are available to offer them to, and that they be subject to \n     relevant second-degree amendments.\n\n  Then I would either read or submit the list. You had about 40, and we \nhad about 11.\n\n       I further ask consent that all first-degree amendments must \n     be offered on 3 p.m. on Tuesday, January 24, and that at 2:30 \n     p.m. on Tuesday, the minority manager be recognized to offer \n     any amendment on the list from the minority side of the \n     aisle; that no later than 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, the majority \n     manager be recognized to offer any amendment on the list from \n     the majority side of the aisle.\n       I further ask unanimous consent that following the \n     disposition of the above-listed amendment and any remaining \n     committee amendments, that the bill be advanced to third \n     reading, and the Senate proceed to final passage of S. 1, as \n     amended, all without any intervening action or debate.\n       I further ask unanimous consent that once the Senate has \n     read S. 1 for a third time, and the Senate has received the \n     House companion bill, it then be in order for the majority \n     manager to call up the House companion bill and move to \n     strike all after the enacting clause and insert the text of \n     S. 1 as amended.\n       I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \n     vote on the Senate amendment, to be followed by third reading \n     and final passage of the House companion bill, and that all \n     of the action occur without any intervening debate.\n       I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for \n     tomorrow be vitiated, and that no votes occur throughout \n     Friday's session of the Senate.\n       I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its \n     business on Friday, it stand in recess until 9:30 a.m., \n     Monday, January 23, 1995, and that the Senate resume \n     consideration of S. 1 at 10 a.m., on Monday, January 23.\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered \n     throughout the day on Friday and Monday be postponed to occur \n     on Monday, January 23, beginning at 4 p.m.\n\n  That would have been the request. And then I had some explanatory \nmaterial at the bottom.\n  I would say that the reason for 3 o'clock on Tuesday was to make \ncertain that both policy luncheons would have an opportunity to discuss \nthe bill and both the majority and minority side would have time to \ncome back after the luncheons and say, ``Well, we want to offer the \nfollowing amendments,'' and they could be offered by the manager or by \nany Senator who had an amendment.\n  It seemed to me that this would have accommodated our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle as far as tomorrow is concerned, and all of \nour colleagues as far as Monday is concerned until 4 p.m.\n  I might further state that it seems to me--I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia would agree that only the following amendments be in \norder, but they would not have to be offered at any time. In my view, \nthat would mean if we would debate those amendments, 40 or 50 \namendments, we could debate those the next 30 days. So we wanted some \ncutoff time. After that time, no amendments could be offered.\n  It is an agreement we have entered into many, many times in the past. \nIn fact, we have entered into agreements in the past where we said all \namendments must be disposed of by a certain hour.\n  But that is the essence of the agreement. I hope that it might be \nacceptable to our colleagues on the other side. But if not, then I will \nproceed, as I have indicated, with the vote on the pending amendment, a \nmotion to table that, plus a motion to table each of the committee \namendments. And I believe there are four remaining. So there would be \nfour votes on the motion to table committee amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from West Virginia \nreserves his right to object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for reading \nthe request that has been presented to me.\n  First of all, let me say I think we are shortcutting the legislative \nprocess too much. Let me be specific in two or three instances here.\n\n       All first-degree amendments must be offered by 3 p.m. on \n     Tuesday, January 24, and that at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the \n     minority manager be recognized to offer any amendment on the \n     list from the minority side of the aisle, and that no later \n     than 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, the majority manager be recognized \n     to offer any amendment on the list from the majority side.\n\n  Now what does that mean, ``offer any amendment on the list''? I do \nnot have any amendment that I consider just to be a minor, \ninconsequential amendment. If I have an amendment, I consider it \nimportant enough that I be here to offer my own amendment. This is not \nthe legislative process in accordance with the rules.\n  I do not know what that means--``must be offered.'' If I offer an \namendment, I may want to take 2 or 3 hours on it. If somebody else \noffers an amendment, I may want to offer an amendment in the second \ndegree to it. We have had too much of this business of accommodations. \nWe have streamlined this process to the point that Senators are going \nto lose the knowledge of their responsibilities here. We do not have \nthe responsibility to shortcut this process. We do not have the \nresponsibility to put it on automatic pilot. We have a responsibility, \nas Senators, to be here, to call up our amendments and not be under the \ngun to have to call up 30 or 40 amendments by 3 o'clock next Tuesday or \nWednesday or whatever it is.\n  We have fallen into that habit. Our business as Senators is to be \nhere and [[Page S1199]] be here at work. We are very early in the \nsession. I do not think we have to operate under the gun like this.\n  I am very willing to have a listing of amendments. We have done that \nmany times. I think that would be an accommodation, if one wants to \ncall it an accommodation, to every Senator, that we have a list of \namendments and know what is going to be called up.\n  But this idea of having the minority manager offer any amendments on \nthe list from the minority side, and the majority manager--and I trust \nthem both; this is not anything against the managers at all. They are \nboth here and they are doing a good job. They are carrying out their \nresponsibilities. If they can be here to offer amendments, why cannot \nSenators who are the authors of the amendments be here to offer them?\n  Mr. DOLE. We would be happy to change that. We put that in just to \naccommodate, to make it more efficient. But we would be happy to change \nthat.\n  Mr. BYRD. We have too much efficiency now. The constitutional framers \ndid not create the United States Senate to be an efficient \norganization. The Senate was intended to be a second House in which the \nMembers would have longer terms and thus be more independent in their \nvotes; where legislation passed by the House in a hurry could cool off; \nwhere it could be meticulously studied, thoughtfully amended, \nreasonably agreed to or rejected.\n  I know the impulse here is to ram things through. Thank God for the \nU.S. Senate. One Senator can stand as long as he is able to stand on \nhis feet and object. I do not mind doing that.\n  If you insist on our being here tomorrow and our colleagues want to \ngo to a retreat, you will not be interrupted by any rollcall. I will \nget you away and I will talk all day. So do not let that be a \ncompelling gun to your temple.\n  Let us do our business here as we are expected to do it by the people \nwho sent us here. Let us carry out our responsibilities to offer the \namendment.\n  What does it mean to offer an amendment? How is my manager going to \ncall up 20 amendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. We hope they would not call up all the amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, all the amendments may not be called up.\n  We made excellent progress today. The Senate has worked its will \ntoday in an orderly fashion. Amendments have been ably debated, \ncarefully studied. That is the process we ought to continue on.\n  Senators ought to know the rules. Too many Senators do not know the \nrules. They do not know what offering an amendment means.\n  I may want to offer an amendment. I may want to talk on it a while. \nWhy should I be bound by this? I should not be hemmed in and fenced out \nwith respect to an orderly process by which I can debate my amendment \nat length. That is what we signed up for when we came to this Senate.\n  I would not have given my unanimous consent to taking up this bill if \nI had not been misled by promises which were made in good faith; no \nintention to mislead anyone. But I gave consent to take up this bill on \nthe promise that there be a committee report the next morning. The \ncommittee report did not appear, but I had already given my consent to \ntake it up. Had I known the committee reports were not going to be \navailable, I would not have given my unanimous consent. So let Members \ntake our time. We want to have a cloture vote; well, that is in \naccordance with the rules. Let Members go by the rules here. Let \nMembers slow down here a little bit. Let Members know what we are \ndoing.\n\n  Then, after all these amendments have been disposed of, the bill will \nbe advanced to third reading and the Senate will proceed to final \npassage, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  Suppose I, in my view, once we have gotten through this amendment \nprocess, feel that there ought to be some more talk on this bill? Any \nSenator may be displeased with the action that is taken on amendments \nin the intervening time. Why should he be gagged? I say to my own \nleader over here, I apologize. He is doing his level best to press this \nlegislation forward in an orderly way. He was kind enough to come to me \nwith this agreement.\n  I do not understand this business of letting the majority manager or \nthe minority manager call up all first-degree amendments, must be \noffered by 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday. What is meant by ``offered''? All \nfirst degree amendments must be offered by 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday. \nWe are supposed to be out tomorrow. That only leaves Monday, and up to \n3 o'clock on Tuesday. Then on Monday, by a certain time.\n  Mr. DOLE. By 4 o'clock on Monday. Votes will occur after 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, any votes ordered throughout the day on Friday.\n  Mr. DOLE. Or Monday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Or Monday. Friday and Monday, be postponed to occur.\n  So we will set up votes. Sometimes in the legislative process, the \nnecessity for offering a second-degree amendment does not arise in \nadvance. I just think that we are getting in too much of a hurry on \nthis important issue. The number is S. 1. Obviously, it is an important \nbill.\n  I know some Senators may be unhappy with me, but I am sorry. I think \nwe need to slow down. If we want to enter into a list of amendments, \nthat is fine. We have done that before. But I have seen this Senate \ndeteriorate, one reason being this very thing, entering into agreements \nlike this that relieve Members of our responsibilities to be here on \nthis floor and do our own work, doing it painstakingly and carefully.\n  I am not going to agree to this. This is too important a bill. We \nhave the Contract With America. Here is my ``Contract With America'' \nright here, the Constitution of the United States. I am not going to \nroll over and play dead. If my friends feel that standing up for the \nrights of the minority and an orderly legislative process calls for my \nexpulsion from the Senate, then let the Senate proceed.\n  I say what I have said with respect to the majority leader. I told \nour friends over here earlier while we were on the debate, cutting down \non the filibuster, that that leader over there is tough. Wait and see. \nHe will use the rules on me. And I respect that and I admire that. And \nI also respect the fact that I can stand up, and I have a right to \noppose those efforts to the limit of whatever rights and powers that I \nhave.\n  This is just jamming and ramming legislation through. The American \npeople out there do not want that done. We have time. It is only the \n19th of January. What is all the rush? The Senate will be in session, \nit says, on Friday, in order for Members to offer amendments contained \nin a list.\n  List? Who is going to know? If I offer an amendment on the list, who \nwill be here to listen to me? They may not listen here on the floor, \nbut they may be over in their house and know what is going on. They \nfollow the debate, and their staff hears, as well. What kind of \nlegislation is this when the Senate allows itself to come in on Friday, \nand no one will be listening to Senators, just come in and offer your \namendments, and all the amendments have to be offered by a certain time \non Monday or Tuesday?\n  What does offering the amendment mean? Does it just mean leaving \namendments at the desk? What parliamentary statute does offering an \namendment give them, except when it is done in accordance with the \nrule? When I get recognized, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk. That is offering an amendment. But I am not going to have any \nSenator stand up here and offer 15, 20, 30, or 50 amendments just to \noffer them, no action taken on them. What happens to them when Senators \njust offer amendments? What happens to them if no action is taken? How \ndo we get rid of one amendment and go to the next?\n  Senators who have been around here a while who know how the process \nworks, answer that question for me. Somebody tell me. I stand up here \nas the manager of the bill. I am going to offer 20 amendments. What \ndoes that mean? Does that mean sending 20 amendments up there en bloc? \nI do not know what that means in that context. I know what it means to \noffer an amendment under the rules.\n  Now, Mr. President, I apologize to the majority leader and my \ncolleagues for detaining them. I object to the request.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n[[Page S1200]]\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection to listing the \namendments, and there may be some other agreement that could be worked \nout. I cannot agree to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say first of all, the Senator is \ncertainly within his rights. I have no quarrel with that, and never \nhave. Certainly, the Senator from West Virginia or any other Senator on \neither side has that right.\n  I did want to indicate we have had 15 votes on this bill. We started \nThursday, January 12, at 10:30 a.m. Up until about 6 o'clock, we had \nhad approximately 25 hours of debate; the Democrats used 15 hours, the \nRepublicans 10. But in the 15 votes taken on this bill, 5 were \nunanimous, and 3 were sense-of-the-Senate. I think we have only really \nvoted on two or three amendments to the bill.\n  We were getting a list today of 78 or 80, and not many were even \nrelevant. But few were germane. And then our list was some 30 \namendments. We whittled our list down to 11. There are still 40-some on \nthe other side.\n  It seems to me that the Senator from West Virginia has exercised his \nrights and will continue to exercise his rights. And I have no quarrel \nwith that.\n  We must do what we must do as the majority, to try to move the bill \nalong. It is not going to be easy. So I have asked unanimous consent \nthat we just agree to that, and that has been objected to. So I would \npropose another unanimous-consent request and see if we might be able \nto save some time; that it be in order for me to table the Gorton \namendment and the four remaining committee amendments en bloc, and one \nvote count as five rollcall votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have tried by consent to have them agreed \nto. We have tried by consent to have one vote count as five. And, \nfailing that, have the yeas and nays been ordered on the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nmotion to table.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 171 to Amendment No. 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto lay on the table the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nWellstone]. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I had intended to wait until the \nconclusion of all of the Senate's business before speaking very briefly \non the new generation of the Specter family, celebrating her first \nbirthday today. But as the hour is 11:25 p.m., I fear that if I do not \ntake advantage of this break in the action, it is unlikely that I will \nhave a chance to speak before January 20, which will be after her first \nbirthday.\n  So I just consulted with our distinguished majority leader, who \nthought that I might take a moment or two now.\n  As I say, 1 year ago today was the first arrival of the new \ngeneration of our family, Silvi Morton Specter. And it is an occasion, \non her first birthday, to comment about children, a child, the future \nof our country, the future of her generation and the generations \nbeyond.\n  I think that we are making some progress in the United States Senate \non protecting her generation and the generations that follow with the \nprogress which we are making on the balanced budget amendment. I \ncertainly would not think of charging any of my expenses to her credit \ncard, and I think as a nation, as we move to the balanced budget \namendment, we really are looking after her generation and the future \ngeneration.\n  Similarly, I think we have a great deal to do on national security. \nAs I have taken on a role on the Senate Intelligence Committee on the \nissue of nuclear nonproliferation, I think recently of her and her \ngeneration, just as I do on the issue of personal security, on the \ncrime on the street, thinking about the fundamental duty of Government \nto protect its citizens.\n  Silvi Morton Specter, my son's daughter, has a unique opportunity. \nShe has extraordinary parents, Tracey Pearl Specter, a devoted and \nloving mother. I characterize them when I see them playing together as \nher mother being her daughter's favorite playmate, and her father, \nShanin, is extraordinarily attentive, as are her maternal grandparents, \nCarol and Alvin Pearl, and her grandmother, my wife, Joan, and I are.\n  As I reflect on the child, I just wish that all of America's children \nand all of the world's children had her great advantages.\n  So I thank my colleagues for indulging me for a few moments. I think \nwe still have ample time before midnight to perhaps take up another \nsubject or two.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say for the benefit of all Senators, \nwe are going to go through this unanimous consent agreement. I think \nthere will be a couple of questions asked. In fact, I wish to make a \nstatement after the questions have been asked and each side is \nsatisfied with the response, because it has to be in good faith. \nOtherwise, it is not going to work; there is not going to be another \nagreement. You would not give us one, and we would not give you one. If \nit is not in good faith, this may be the last agreement of its kind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order to S. 1, and that they be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments.\n  I will not read that list, but there are 47 Democratic amendments, \nand 15 Republican amendments, a total of 62 amendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments must \nbe offered by 3 p.m. on Tuesday, January 24.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for tomorrow \nand Saturday be vitiated, and that no votes occur throughout Friday's \nsession of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business \ntoday, it stand in recess until 10 a.m. on Friday, January 20, and that \nthere be a period for the transaction of routine morning business with \nSenators permitted to speak therein.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business \non Friday, it stand in recess until 9:30 a.m. on Monday, January 23, \n1995, and that the Senate resume consideration of S. 1 at 10 a.m. on \nMonday, January 23.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if a Senator with an amendment on the \nlist sends the amendment to the desk to be printed on Friday, that be \nconsidered as having satisfied the 3 p.m. requirement for having \namendments offered.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that no votes occur on Monday, \nJanuary 23, prior to 4 p.m.\n  That is the request. But before I put the request, I think there are \nsome questions some might want to address.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority \nleader for the good faith in which we have attempted over the last \nseveral hours to work through this agreement.\n  There are a couple of questions on our side I would like to reference \nas they related to the agreement. The first has to do with the \nreference to all amendments being ``offered.'' Could the majority \nleader define for us what you mean by the word ``offer?'' What will be \nrequired of a Senator to meet the obligations under this unanimous-\nconsent requirement?\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, I assume if there is a pending amendment, they would \nhave to get consent to set it aside and send their amendment to the \ndesk, and that would be offered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So it is the intent of the unanimous-consent agreement \nto allow any Senator who has an amendment to take it to the desk and be \nprotected for consideration of that amendment during this debate?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct. We have made an exception for tomorrow \nmorning. If somebody wanted to send an amendment and have it printed in \nthe Record, that would satisfy the requirements of that section. But it \nis sending the amendment to the desk and first getting consent. That is \nwhy I think, as we have been in the past--it depends on the good faith \nof side. Somebody can say ``I object to setting the amendment aside,'' \nand he puts in a quorum call and waits until 3 o'clock and there is one \namendment pending. I think that is one thing we cannot let happen.\n  Second, I would hope that all these amendments are not offered. There \nare 60-some amendments. Any Senator could take as much time as he \nwanted after the amendment is offered. He can spend half a day on an \namendment. We can be here 30 days.\n  So this does not preclude--if it is in the judgment of the majority \nleader and since we are not acting in good faith--filing cloture. Nor \ndoes it preclude cloture if we agree to the request by the Senator from \nWest Virginia that we go to third reading and have a period of debate, \nand if that period of debate goes on and on and on, then I assume no \none objects to someone filing a cloture motion.\n  I do not assume all these amendments will be offered. I think many \nmay be worked out. Many may be there for some reason but will not be \noffered. But I am prepared to proceed in good faith. I am certain the \nDemocratic leader is, also.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is certainly my intention. I think I \nspeak for all colleagues on this side of the aisle. We want to work \nthrough the amendments. There are a number on [[Page S1204]] our side, \nand we are prepared to offer them.\n  The distinguished majority leader anticipated a second question, and \nfor clarification let me again emphasize that it is my understanding \nthat the motion to go to third reading is debatable under this \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, we would go to third reading, and there \nwould be a period for debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my understanding, after the motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. After we have gone to third reading. Any further amendments \nwould not be offered, but we would still have a period of debate. There \nis no limitation. We do not say 1, 2, 3, 4 hours. There may not be any. \nAs I understand it, the Senator from West Virginia wants to protect his \ninterests, in the event some amendment may have been adopted, or not \noffered, or not disposed of properly, to at least raise that point. \nMaybe other Senators on either side have the same position.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This unanimous-consent agreement is the product of a \ngreat deal of effort on both sides of the aisle by a number of \nparticipants. I thank all of those Senators involved on our side, \nespecially the Senator from West Virginia for his guidance and his \nindulgence in trying to accommodate all Senators as we come to this \nagreement. I do hope that we can move through the amendments in good \nfaith, that we can offer them tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday. Certainly, \nif this agreement is accepted, Senators are protected. That was our \ndesire all along.\n  So I have no objection to this agreement.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I enter into this colloquy and ask one \nquestion? When you say the amendments are to be offered by a certain \ntime, are those amendments that have already been filed considered ones \nthat you just--you could repropose them now?\n  Mr. DOLE. Those were filed because of the cloture rule.\n  Mr. FORD. Under this unanimous-consent agreement, if you have, as I \ndo--and we have worked them out, I think, with the majority floor \nleader, my amendments, which then the rest of them would go away. But I \nhave to refile those on the basis of setting aside the pending \namendment, and we go to my amendment, or put them at the desk tomorrow; \nis that the way?\n  Mr. DOLE. Correct.\n  Mr. FORD. All I have to do is Xerox it and put it in tomorrow \nafternoon or tomorrow sometime?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think all anybody has to do--parliamentary inquiry. Is \nthere an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n  Mr. DOLE. So there would not be any amendment pending. After the \nfirst one is offered, you would have to set that aside and simply send \nthe amendment to the desk. I do not know how we decide which amendments \nwe take up first. I think that is another question, whether the first \namendment offered should be taken up first. I assume that would be the \nnormal way to do it. Whoever offers their amendment first--many \nDemocrats will not be here tomorrow. We will be here. That would \nadvantage us. There has to be a way to work that out.\n  Mr. FORD. May I continue just a moment? I do not want to belabor it, \nbut I want to be sure that my colleagues understand that if they want \nto propose an amendment, they have to be here to do that, under this \nunanimous-consent agreement. And any amendment that has been filed at \nthe desk that was filed based on cloture, those amendments are, for all \npractical purposes, under this unanimous-consent agreement, null and \nvoid?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question on that one \nstatement of my friend from Kentucky about having to be here to offer \nthe amendment. I understand that tomorrow, for those of us who might \nnot be able to be here, that somebody could offer the amendment on our \nbehalf, get it to the desk, and that would then constitute the filing \nof that amendment in time?\n  Mr. DOLE. It says here if a Senator with an amendment sends it to the \ndesk to be printed. It would take consent to send an amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of someone else. That gets back to the very thing that \nthe Senator from West Virginia objected to--somebody else, in effect, \nproxy management, or whatever, sending amendments to the desk. In fact, \nif you want to offer amendments tonight, send them to the desk, I do \nnot see any reason that could not be done, as long as we are on the \nbill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not believe the leader has made the \nrequest yet.\n  Mr. DOLE. I said I would withhold until the questions have been \npresented. I do now make the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and I do not \nintend to object. I think this is a good agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I understand it from the distinguished majority leader's \nresponses to the minority leader's questions, and to those of Mr. Ford, \nand others, the second paragraph which uses the word ``offer,'' offered \nby 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, that means that any Senator who has a \nbona fide amendment he intends to call up must offer that amendment by \n3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday. If he stands up and offers the amendment and \nSenators indicate a desire to debate that amendment and take action on \nit, that is OK, we can do that Monday. We can do that up until 3 \no'clock. We can get action on some amendments or we can agree to stack \nthe rollcall votes, as I understand it.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Until 4 o'clock on Monday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Where is that?\n  Mr. DOLE. On page 2, second paragraph.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Now when we reach the hour of 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, if Senators \nhave not had an opportunity to offer their amendments by that time but \nin the meantime they have filed the amendments at the desk, they may \noffer them, have them temporarily set aside, and then they qualify \nunder this agreement as having offered the amendment.\n  The Senator who has the amendment offers it. If for some reason, by \nthe time we reach 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, that Senator has not had \nan opportunity to offer his amendment, he can offer it and, if there \nare other amendments pending at that point, he can offer it but no \naction will be taken on it. It will be temporarily set aside. But it \nhas to be on the list-- I am just trying to get an understanding--it \nhas to be on the list of amendments that have been read and submitted.\n  I do not contemplate any great problem with this. Most of these \nthings have a way of working themselves out. And Senators act in good \nfaith. I take that as a given. I hope all Senators take that as a given \nwith me, that I am acting in good faith. That is the only way I know to \nproceed here, is to be fair with each other.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would say, if I might respond to the Senator, if there \nwas some unforeseen reason a Senator on either side was unable to send \nthe amendment to the desk by 3 o'clock, I think we can probably work \nthat out. But, it seems to me we have all had notice and if somebody \ngot up at 3 o'clock and started sending five or six amendments to the \ndesk, there could be an objection to setting aside any amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to say this, Mr. Leader. The leader and I have \nworked together many years in various capacities. No leader has ever \noffered as many cloture motions as I have and seen them all fail to be \nadopted.\n  It is conceivable that a Senator might have a death in his family.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think we, being reasonable people, would understand even \nat that point that another Senator could get unanimous consent that \nanother Senator could offer the amendment on his behalf.\n  Looking at this, if I understand correctly, I think it is a good \nagreement. I want to compliment both leaders and all others who have \nparticipated in [[Page S1205]] working out this agreement. This \npreserves, this fulfills, this meets the majority's desire to know who \nreally has amendments, who intends to call up those amendments and what \nthose amendments are. It assures all parties on both sides that all \nfirst-degree amendments must have been offered, not by the managers but \nby Senators themselves.\n  If I want to come over here and offer my amendment, I have no reason \nto complain when the hour of 3 o'clock on Tuesday evening next arrives.\n  If I am saying anything that the majority leader thinks is not \naccurate, I hope he will say so.\n  That each Senator offers his or her own amendment, all amendments \nwill have been offered by 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, and those \namendments, of course, may be disposed of and they are expected to be \ndisposed of as we go along. We made progress today and we hope to make \nfurther progress a day later.\n  And then, once those amendments have been disposed of, we are not \nsaying that the disposition has to occur by 3 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday. \nWe are saying they have to be offered. The disposition may be 3 o'clock \nTuesday or it may be 3 o'clock next Tuesday. Once the amendments have \nbeen disposed of, we advance to third reading and then no further \namendments can be offered.\n  That is the case now. Once we are on third reading, except by \nunanimous consent, no further amendments are in order.\n  And then we are not closed out of debate at that point. And, of \ncourse, the leader, as he always has a right to do, has a right to \noffer a cloture motion. That is his right.\n  So, I hope that, as a reasonable man, if we reach that point and it \nis clear that somebody wanted to debate in a reasonable time, the \nleader would be willing to let that go forward. If it is obvious that \nsomeone just wants to tarry and delay, nobody can quarrel with the fact \nthat the leader has that right to offer a cloture motion.\n  I would ask this question. Is there any time limit? You say that \nSenators will be permitted to speak tomorrow during a period for \nroutine morning business. They may speak for how many minutes? Is there \na time limit?\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to the Senator, we did not put a time limit because \nsome might like to speak on their amendment. Even though they cannot \noffer amendments, they might like to suggest, ``I intend to offer this \namendment,'' and they could get rid of some of the debate tomorrow, at \nleast on this side. You would have a chance to rebut that, or whatever.\n  But we did not put any time limit. We had hoped they would be \nconstrained if they wanted to talk about their amendment, discuss it \nfor a reasonable time, and then move on.\n  I want to say one other thing about the 3 o'clock deadline. \nObviously, if there is some unusual circumstance, somebody's plane was \ndelayed, we have a bad storm or something, I think the two leaders \nwould agree, after consultation with each other, whoever it was on \neither side would be permitted to offer his or her amendment or \namendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. So it is not the intention of the majority leader to put a \nlimitation on the time for speeches on tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOLE. We could put a limitation of 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. If they want additional time, they could ask for unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, again, I think this is a good agreement. I \nthink it is a reasonable agreement. It seems to me it protects all \nSenators' rights. It is a reasonable approach.\n  I again compliment both leaders and all Senators. Many Senators have \nparticipated in developing this agreement. I not only compliment them, \nI thank them for their further indulgence.\n  I reserve the right to object, but I have already indicated so.\n  I want to say this: I hope we close this session in a good spirit. I \nwas sitting here a while ago while a rollcall vote was going on and I \nthought of Paul's epistle to the Colossians and I wrote it down. ``Let \nyour speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye know how \nye ought to answer every man.''\n  Sometimes I have to stop and write that down and read it and try to \napply it to myself. I find that often fails.\n  I hope we will all feel good about having reached an agreement, and \ngo home tonight. I think the leaders have done a good job. I think we \nhave accomplished something. I am happy. I think it preserves \neverybody's rights. It is a reasonable agreement. It does not \nprostitute the legislative process.\n  That is what I have been complaining about. I thank the distinguished \nleader.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the distinguished majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me say that we will have people speak for not to exceed \n15 minutes to amend requests.\n  Mr. GLENN. I have been asked during the business tomorrow, it says \nmorning business, and speakers can speak on whatever they wish \nincluding their possible amendments for next week or whatever; but \nthere will not be any business conducted on S. 1 directly tomorrow, is \nthat correct? So there can be no misunderstanding.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the distinguished majority leader renew \nhis unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend, Hyman Bookbinder. On October 2, 1994, Bookie was honored by the \nNational Jewish Democratic Council as the recipient of the First Annual \nHubert H. Humphrey Humanitarian Award.\n  It was very fitting that this honor was bestowed on Bookie. Over the \nyears, Hyman Bookbinder has been indefatigable in his efforts to spread \nthe message on labor, civil rights, and economic justice with a \ncommitment to American ideals.\n  Admired, loved by family, friends, and colleagues, Bookie has served \nour country and the Jewish community with honor and distinction. His \ncommitment to his faith and humanity is truly an inspiration. His \ndistinguished career and many contributions was a cause for celebration \nby NJDC.\n  All of us owe him a debt of gratitude for his many years of dedicated \nand exemplary service to others. The celebration of Hyman Bookbinder as \nthe first recipient of the Hubert H. Humphrey Humanitarian Award was a \nsignificant milestone in the life of this extraordinary man.\n  I am pleased to submit to my colleagues, Bookie's remarks upon \nreceiving the Hubert H. Humphrey Award.\n\n                NJDC Hubert Humphrey Humanitarian Award\n\n                     (Response by Hyman Bookbinder)\n\n       This is the nicest ``This Is Your Life'' episode I've ever \n     seen! As I look at the names of the Honorary chairs, the list \n     of speakers, the names on the Tribute Committee--and, above \n     all, as I look around this room, I know how lucky I have been \n     all my life to have had such friends and associates. Some of \n     us go back more than sixty years. To have been part of your \n     lives, and you part of mine, to have at times shared with you \n     great pain over society's delinquencies, but at other times \n     to celebrate together over some victories--labor's right to \n     organize, breakthroughs in civil rights, commitment to end \n     poverty, our nation's embrace of Holocaust remembrance and \n     security for Israel--to have been associated with you in \n     pursuit of these and other causes, I express my profound \n     appreciation.\n       Oh, how I would like to go around the room and identify and \n     thank each of you and say what you individually have meant to \n     me. But limited time, and fear of leaving out some, compels \n     me merely to note how gratified I am to see associates from \n     the earliest days of my trade union work, the Amalgamated and \n     the CIO and the AFL-CIO, from six decades of civil rights \n     alliances and battles, from the halls of Congress since \n     1950--including its current senior member and chair of a non-\n     existent Jewish caucus--from the war on poverty, including \n     its founding general (although his name is Sargent), from \n     three decades with the American Jewish Committee, including \n     its outgoing President getting ready now to become Ambassador \n     to Romania--and from every campaign since Harry Truman. . . .\n       I've had a special spot in my heart for our Honorary \n     Chairman for fifteen years now. When another black leader \n     declared that black anger at Jews at the time was just a \n     declaration of independence, Vernon Jordan publicly rebuked \n     him, saying that what was needed was a declaration of inter-\n     dependence.\n       And there is one name above all, of course, that I wish I \n     could point to. Oh, how I wish he were still with us. Oh, \n     what a different country this might have been if in 1968 a \n     few hundred thousand more Americans had voted for him. I \n     cannot begin to tell you what an honor you have bestowed on \n     me by linking my name with that of Hubert Humphrey. And what \n     an honor to have his son and his sister with us tonight.\n       Others have already commented on the meaning and the goals \n     of NJDC. Let me add a few words. I'm proud to get its award \n     because its very name--National Jewish Democratic--combines \n     three great commitments and loyalties of my life. National \n     means to me, despite its failures and defaults, a nation we \n     can and do love for its underlying compassion and respect for \n     individual freedom. Jewish in our NJDC stands for a Judaism \n     we love because it seeks to live by Hillel's admonition to \n     be not only for ourselves. Democratic, because it is the \n     party that best lives up to our American and our Jewish \n     ideals. Small wonder that such large majorities of Jewish \n     voters have consistently supported Democratic candidates.\n       I am proud of all three of these identifications and \n     loyalties--and am reminded of that story about Henry \n     Kissinger and Golda Meir. After a long argument with Henry, \n     Golda looked sternly at him and said, ``I'm really quite \n     upset with you--you, a Jew!'' At which point, Kissinger \n     started to pontificate. ``Madam Prime Minister,'' he said, \n     ``I want you to know that first I am a human being, a citizen \n     of the world. Then I am an American. And then I am a Jew.'' \n     ``That may be OK for you in America,'' Golda responded, ``but \n     here we read from right to left.''\n       I hope that nothing I have said smacks of chauvinism. I am \n     a proud American. But I have known many great people who are \n     not American. I am a proud Jew, but--if you will pardon the \n     expression--some of my best friends are not Jewish. I am a \n     proud Democrat, but have had high regard for some--not many, \n     but some--Republicans.\n       Three years ago, I tried to capture some of the exciting, \n     poignant moments in my life in a book with the sub-title \n     ``Memoirs of a Public Affairs Junkie.'' Permit me to cite \n     briefly two of those precious memoirs that sort of sum up the \n     public passions of my life--one fifty years ago, the second \n     fifteen years ago.\n       In the late Forties, I was active in the campaign to raise \n     the Federal minimum wage to 75 cents an hour--yes, 75 cents. \n     I helped locate a garment worker in Tennessee who would \n     testify on what 75 cents an hour might mean for her. All we \n     did was urge her to talk frankly to the members of the Senate \n     Labor committee. I sat next to her, not to prompt her, but to \n     put her at ease. Ora Green was her name, and from the \n     official transcript, here are some of her words:\n       ``My youngest girl, she's nine now, goes straight to the \n     piano when we go to a house where they have one. She wants to \n     play so bad. I've thought that maybe I could save fifty cents \n     or a dollar a week to buy a second hand piano for her, no \n     matter how old or battered. But try as hard as I can, and \n     save and squeeze, I haven't found a way to do it. By this \n     time, the Senators had stopped shuffling their papers before \n     them. They had leaned forward and were looking directly at \n     this woman from Tennessee. She went on:\n       ``Maybe I've been foolish to talk to you about music for \n     one of my children when the main problem is getting enough to \n     eat or wear, or blankets to put on the bed, or even a chair \n     to sit on. But down in Tennessee we love music, and factory \n     workers don't live by bread alone any more than anyone else \n     does.''\n       I cherish that moment because it tells us so much. It tells \n     us that in every human being there is indeed a spark of the \n     divine, that with all its imperfections, our American \n     democracy makes possible such magical moments to occur, and \n     it reminds us how great it is to have a labor movement that \n     cares about the Ora Greens of the world.\n       Oh, yes. One of the freshman Senators at that hearing was \n     Hubert Humphrey.\n       My second story. . . The year was 1979. I was one of \n     fifteen Americans appointed by Jimmy Carter to the \n     President's Commission on the Holocaust. Miles Lerman, the \n     present Chairman of the Holocaust Council and the Museum, was \n     another. And so was Ben Meed, the chief co-ordinator of the \n     world's survivors. Both are here tonight. And then there was \n     Bayard Rustin, the late, great black trade unionist and civil \n     rights leader. To help us develop recommendations for a \n     suitable American memorial, we visited a number of \n     concentration camps and existing memorials in Europe and \n     Israel. On this particular day, after a painful tour through \n     Auschwitz and Birkenau, we stopped for a short outdoor \n     service at a row of memorial tablets. In front of the one \n     inscribed in Hebrew, Elie Wiesel spoke as only he can speak. \n     We joined in reciting the Kaddish. As we were about to leave, \n     Bayard whispered to me, ``Should I?'' I knew exactly what he \n     meant; I said ``Sure'' and asked the group to remain. \n     Accompanied only by the soft winds of the vast open expanse, \n     Bayard started to sing one of his favorite Negro spirituals:\n\n     ``Freedom, oh Freedom, oh Freedom over me,'' he sang.\n     ``And before I'd be a slave,\n     I'd be buried in my grave,\n     And go home to my Lord and be free.''\n\n       When he finished, there wasn't a dry eye. Tears were being \n     shed, tears not only in reverent memory of six million Jews, \n     but also for untold millions of American slaves who had been \n     deprived of lives of dignity and freedom. Tears, we were \n     reminded, have no color.\n       On the last page of my book, I quoted some words I had \n     spoken on an earlier occasion. I'd like to conclude tonight \n     with those words.\n       ``If it should be true that in my lifetime I have helped \n     even one Jew or one Haitian or one Pole escape persecution; \n     if I have helped even one ghetto youngster escape poverty; if \n     I have helped one daughter of a Tennessee shirtmaker get to \n     play on her own piano . . . If these things are indeed true, \n     then all that is left to say is that I thank God that I was \n     [[Page S1207]] given some opportunities to help make life a \n     little easier, a little sweeter, a little more secure, for \n     some fellow human beings.''\n       And I thank every one of you for being here tonight to \n     share this proud moment.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1206-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SGT. MANUEL BOJORQUEZ-PICO\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate \nU.S. Sgt. Manuel Bojorquez-Pico of Alabama's Redstone Arsenal, on the \nday of his swearing-in ceremony as a U.S. citizen. A dedicated patriot \nand loyal protector of this country and its people, Sergeant Bojorquez \nis not only an inspiration and role model but a symbol of American \ndemocracy and freedom.\n  Born in Mexico, Sergeant Bojorquez obtained permanent residency \nstatus while living in the United States as a child. For a short period \nof time he moved back to Mexico due to a family illness, but returned \nto the United States as an adult and applied to reactivate his \npermanent residency. It was granted and he enlisted in the Army. A few \nyears later, the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed its decision and \nordered Sergeant Bojorquez deported.\n  For several years he filed motions and appeals, and in a final \nattempt to become a citizen of this country, Manuel contacted the \nPresident on July 12, 1994, and requested that he designate the Persian \nGulf war a period of military hostility which would allow active duty \naliens, such as himself, to apply for naturalization.\n  Despite the concern, support, and assistance of Representative Cramer \nand myself, 2 weeks before Thanksgiving the District Director of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service informed Manuel he would be \ndeported on February 1, 1995. With little hope left, Manuel contacted \nthe President again and finally his prayers were answered.\n  Impressed by Manuel's commitment to serving his adopted country, the \nPresident passed an Executive order which not only allows Manuel to \nbecome a citizen, but also includes other active duty aliens who fought \nin the Persian Gulf war. This young, vibrant family man proved to us \nall that the American dream still lives.\n  Manuel's selfless dedication to defending our country, which he could \nnot call his own until today, is a superior example to all American \ncitizens. I applaud him for his tireless efforts and I thank him for \nthe reminder of how lucky we are to live in this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1207-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ESTONIA RELATIVE \n             TO FISHERIES--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM-1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1823(b), to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States\n  In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith the Agreement \nbetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Estonia Extending the Agreement of June \n1, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States.

A bill to provide greater access to civil justice by reducing \ncosts and delay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  the civil justice reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreform America's Federal Civil Justice System. The purpose of this \nbill, the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1995, is to \n[[Page S1208]] improve deserving parties' access to the Federal courts \nby reducing the volume of frivolous cases, to reduce the costs of \nFederal civil litigation, and to encourage the settlement of disputes. \nIt is similar to the bill introduced by Senator DeConcini and myself in \nMarch 1993.\n  This bill introduces some modest reforms that will reduce the \neconomic and social costs our society has borne due to the litigation \nexplosion. Our society spends billions of dollars every year on civil \nlawsuits. More than $1 billion goes just to pay for the Federal \ndistrict courts, which handle hundreds of thousands of civil cases \nannually. It has become clear to most Americans that our system of \ndispute resolution through adversarial lawsuits has gotten out of hand, \nand reason needs to be restored to it. More litigation does not \nnecessarily translate into more justice.\n  Many of the elements of this bill are based on the 1992 Access to \nJustice Act. For example, my bill reintroduces a modified English rule \non attorney's fees that will award prevailing parties in Federal \ndiversity cases reasonable attorney's fees, with adequate safeguards to \nprotect against possible injustice. This provision is hardly the \nradical proposition some will paint it as being. In fact, for those of \nmy colleagues who are always fond of pointing out that the United \nStates is the only industrialized country that fails to provide some \nbenefit or another, I would point out that this so-called English rule \nis followed by most industrialized countries, with the United States \nbeing the most notable exception. So I think it is worth trying in the \nUnited States in a limited class of cases--diversity suits--in order to \nsee if it is effective in discouraging frivolous lawsuits.\n  By limiting the rule to diversity cases, the bill ensures that no one \nwill be denied a forum for their dispute, since all such cases can be \nfiled in State court. If the defendant removes the case to Federal \ncourt, then the loser pays rule will not apply. This limited English \nrule will expire in 5 years unless Congress chooses to continue it, \nafter a fourth-year report by the administrative office of the courts \non the effectiveness of the rule.\n  The bill also includes a number of safeguards to avoid any unintended \nconsequences. The amount the loser must pay is limited to the amount of \nhis or her own fees. Moreover, the court is given broad discretion to \nlimit the amount the loser must pay if it finds such payment to be \nunjust under the circumstances of the case before it.\n  The bill also requires 30 days advance notice of intent to sue--\nsomething most responsible lawyers already do. It also requires \nprisoners with civil rights cases--which currently constitute of around \n10 percent of the Federal civil docket--to first exhaust their \nadministrative remedies before filing suit in Federal court.\n  To promote early settlement of cases and reduce litigation costs, the \nbill contains a statutory offer of judgment rule. It is similar to a \nproposal by Judge William Schwartzer, former director of the Federal \nJudicial Center. This rule will allow either party to a lawsuit to \noffer a settlement to the other party at any point in the litigation. \nIf the settlement is declining and the party rejecting the offer \nultimately gets a judgment less favorable than the settlement offer, he \nor she is then responsible for the offeror's attorneys fees from the \ntime the offer was made. This will give parties a strong incentive to \noffer and accept reasonable settlements.\n  Another provision of my bill will begin to curtail some of the \nexcesses of the expert witness battles that dominate too many Federal \ntrials. Following the example of several States, particularly Arizona, \nmy bill will limit parties to one expert witness on a given issue.\n  The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 has had a positive effect on the \nFederal courts in reforming pretrial, processes to reduce costs and \ndelay. This bill takes the next step by making some limited fee \nshifting proposals and a few other modest reforms for reducing \nlitigation costs. I look forward to the hearings I intend to hold in \nthe Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and Courts, and to \ndiscussing these proposals with my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, as well as the full Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to further the goals of the Paperwork Reduction Act to \nhave Federal agencies become more responsible and publicly accountable \nfor reducing the burden of Federal paperwork on the public, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  the paperwork reduction act of 1995\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise this morning on behalf of myself, Mr. \nRoth, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Bumpers, to introduce the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995. This bill is substantially identical to S. 560, \nwhich was unanimously approved by the Senate in the closing days of the \n103d Congress.\n  I am pleased that the bill enjoys even broader bipartisan support \nthis Congress. It is being cosponsored by the chairman and ranking \nDemocratic member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Bill Roth \nand John Glenn, both have worked long and hard on legislation to \nstrengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and to reauthorize \nappropriations for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n[OIRA], which has been without authorizing legislation since October of \n1989. Leading cosponsors also include the chairman, Mr. Bond, and \nranking Democratic member, Mr. Bumpers, of the Committee on Small \nBusiness. The Committee on Small Business, of which I am the senior \nmember, has played a crucial supporting role on behalf of the small \nbusiness community in maintaining the effort to enact legislation to \nstrengthen the 1980 act. We are being joined by 22 of our colleagues \n[[Page S1210]] from both sides of the aisle, many of whom are present \nor former members of the Committee on Small Business of the \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. President, as previously mentioned, the Paperwork Reduction Act \nof 1995 is substantively identical to S. 560 introduced in the 103d \nCongress. That bill represented the culmination of years of work which \nbegan in the 100th Congress. It represents a skillful blending of S. \n560, as introduced by me and S. 681, a bill introduced by my friend \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Glenn, then chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. His skill and leadership, and the tenacity of all of the \nthose involved in both bills made possible the crafting of this text of \nS. 560. It garnered unanimous support within the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. S. 560, as reported last year, had the support of the \nClinton administration and I am hopeful that the administration will \nalso support this bill I introduce today.\n  Senator Roth, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nindicated to me that we will have a markup on this bill next week. It \nis my hope that it will be an early legislative initiative in this \nCongress. I have also talked to Speaker Gingrich about the bill, and it \nis my hope that they will make it an important part of their \nlegislative agenda on the House side. So I am hoping, Mr. President, we \nwill be able to get this bill to the President's desk in the next \nseveral weeks, certainly in the next several months, for actual \nimplementation as law.\n  It also had the support of the broad-based Paperwork Reduction Act \nCoalition as well as elected officials, and many in the educational and \nnonprofit communities. S. 560, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1994, \npassed the Senate by unanimous voice vote on October 6, 1994. The \nfollowing day, the text of S. 560 was attached to a House-passed \nmeasure, H.R. 2561, and returned to the House. Unfortunately, the House \nGovernmental Operations Committee declined to clear either measure \nbefore the adjournment of the 103d Congress, so we start anew with our \nlegislative effort this year.\n  In this congress, I am hopeful that the House of Representatives will \nbe more receptive to this legislation and that we can see it enacted \ninto law. A modified version of S. 560 has been included in H.R. 9, the \nJob Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995, which includes many of \nthe regulatory and paperwork relief provisions of the Republican \nContract With America. Representative Bill Clinger, the new chairman of \nthe House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the new name \nfor the Committee on Government Operations, was the principal \nRepublican cosponsor of H.R. 2995, the House companion to S. 560.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 provides a 5-year reauthorization \nof appropriations for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n[OIRA]. Created by the 1980 Act, OIRA serves as the focal point at the \nOffice of Management and Budget for the act's implementation.\n  The principal purpose of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is to \nreaffirm and provide additional tools by which to attain the \nfundamental objective of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980--to \nminimize the Federal paperwork burdens imposed by individuals, \nbusinesses, especially small businesses, educational and nonprofit \ninstitutions, and State and local governments.\n  Mr. President, let me highlight some of the provisions of the bill. \nThis legislation reemphasizes the fundamental responsibilities of each \nFederal agency minimize new paperwork burden by thoroughly reviewing \neach proposed collection of information for need and practical utility, \nthe act's fundamental standards. The bill make explicit the \nresponsibility of each Federal agency to conduct this review itself, \nbefore submitting the propose collection of information for public \ncomment and clearance by OIRA.\n  The bill before us reflects the provisions of S. 560 that further \nenhance public participation in the review of paperwork burdens, when \nsuch burdens are first being proposed or when an agency is seeking to \nobtain approval to continue to use an existing paperwork requirement. \nStrengthening public participation is at the core of the 1980 act.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 maintains the 1980 act's \nGovernment-wide 5-percent goal for the reduction of paperwork burdens \non the public. Given past experience, some question the effectiveness \nof such goals in producing net reductions in Government-wide paperwork \nburdens. I believe that the bill should reflect individual agency goals \nas well, and although this provision is not in the bill introduced \ntoday, I am hopeful it will be strengthened in the future. If seriously \nimplemented, such agency goals can become an effective restraint on the \ncumulative growth of Government-sponsored paperwork burdens.\n  Mr. President, the bill includes amendments to the 1980 act which \nfurther empower members of the public to help police Federal agency \ncompliance with the act. I would like to describe two of these \nprovisions.\n  One provision would enable a member of the public to obtain a written \ndetermination from the OIRA Administrator regarding whether a federally \nsponsored paperwork requirement is in compliance with the act. If the \nagency requirement is found to be noncompliant, the Administrator is \ncharged with taking appropriate remedial action. This provision is \nbased upon a similar process added to the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy Act in 1988.\n  The second provision encourages members of the public to identify \npaperwork requirements that have not been submitted for review and \napproval pursuant to the act's requirements. Although the act's public \nprotection provisions explicitly shield the public from the imposition \nof any formal agency penalty for failing to comply with such an \nunapproved, or bootleg, paperwork requirement, individuals often feel \ncompelled to comply. This is especially true when the individual has an \non-going relationship with the agency and that relationship accords the \nagency substantial discretion that could be used to redefine their \nfuture dealings. Under this bill, which we are introducing today, a \nmember of the public can blow the whistle on such a bootleg paperwork \nrequirement and be accorded the protection of anonymity.\n  Next, Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995 clarifies the 1980 Act to make explicit that it \napplies to Government-sponsored third-party paperwork burdens.\n  These are recordkeeping, disclosure, or other paperwork burdens that \none private party imposes on another private party at the direction of \na Federal agency. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that such \nGovernment-sponsored third-party paperwork burdens were not subject to \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act. The Court's decision in Dole versus United \nSteelworkers of America created a potentially vast loophole. The public \ncould be denied the Act's protections on the basis of the manner in \nwhich a Federal agency chose to impose a paperwork burden, indirectly \nrather than directly. It is worthy of note that Senator Chiles, now \nGovernor Chiles, the father of the Paperwork Reduction Act went to the \ntrouble and expense of filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court \narguing that no such exemption for third-party paperwork burdens was \nintended. The Court decided otherwise. I know that Governor Chiles will \nbe gratified that this bill makes explicit the Act's coverage of all \nGovernment-sponsored paperwork burdens. Once this bill is enacted, we \ncan feel confident that this major loophole will be closed. But given \nmore than a decade of experience under the Act, it is prudent to remain \nvigilant to additional efforts to restrict the Act's reach and public \nprotections.\n  The smart use of information by the Government, and its potential to \nminimize the burdens placed on the public, is a core concept of the \n1980 Act. The information resources management [IRM] provisions of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 build upon the foundation laid more \nthan a decade ago by our former colleague from Florida, Lawton Chiles, \nthe father of the Paperwork Reduction Act. These provisions of the bill \nare the major contribution of my friend from Ohio, Senator Glenn, who \nhas emphasized the potential of improved IRM policies to make \ngovernment more effective in serving the public.\n  Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's time today to \ndiscuss the individual provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995.\n[[Page S1211]]\n  Mr. President, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 enjoys strong \nsupport from the business community, especially the small business \ncommunity. It has the support of a broad Paperwork Reduction Act \nCoalition, representing virtually every segment of the business \ncommunity. They have worked long and hard on this legislation for many \nyears. Without them, we would not be able to have the consensus bill \nthat we have today.\n  Participating in the coalition are the major national small business \nassociations--the National Federation of Independent Business [NFIB], \nthe Small Business Legislative Council [SBLC], and National Small \nBusiness United [NSBU] as well as the many specialized national small \nbusiness associations, like the American Subcontractors Association, \nthat comprise the membership of the SBLC or NSBU. Other participants \nrepresent manufacturers, aerospace and electronics firms, construction \nfirms, providers of professional and technical services, retailers of \nvarious products and services, and the wholesalers and distributors who \nsupport them. I would like to identify a few other organizations that \ncomprise the Coalition's membership: the Aerospace Industries \nAssociation [AIA], the American Consulting Engineers Council [ACEC], \nthe Associated Builders and Contractors [ABC], the Associated General \nContractors of America [AGC], the Chemical Manufacturers Association \n[CMA], the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association \n[CBEMA], the Contract Services Association [CSA], the Electronic \nIndustries Association [EIA], the Independent Bankers Association of \nAmerica [IBAA], the International Communications Industries Association \n[ICIA], the National Association of Manufacturers, the National \nAssociation of Wholesalers and Distributors, the National Security \nIndustrial Association [NSIA], the National Tooling and Machining \nAssociation [NTMA], the Printing Industries Association [PIA], and the \nProfessional Service Council [PSC]. Leadership for the coalition is \nbeing provided by the Council on Regulatory and Information Management \n[C-RIM] and by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. C-RIM is the new name for \nthe Business Council on the Reduction of Paperwork, which has dedicated \nitself to paperwork reduction and regulatory reform issues for more \nthan a half century.\n\n  The coalition also includes a number of professional associations and \npublic interest groups that support strengthening the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980. These include the Association of Records \nManagers and Administrators [ARMA] and Citizens for a Sound Economy \n[CSE], to name but two very active coalition members.\n  Mr. President, given the regulatory and paperwork burdens faced by \nState and local governments, legislation to strengthen the Paperwork \nReduction Act is high on the agenda of the associations representing \nelected officials. The Governor of Florida, my friend Lawton Chiles, \nhas worked hard on this issue within the National Governors \nAssociation. During its 1994 annual meeting, the National Governors \nAssociation adopted a resolution in support of legislation to \nstrengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  As I mentioned, Chairman Roth and Senator Glenn are both cosponsors \nof this legislation, as is Senator Bond, the new chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, and the previous chairman and now ranking member, \nSenator Bumpers.\n  It is my understanding that we will have a markup on this bill next \nweek. It is my hope it can be on an accelerated schedule here on the \nSenate floor. It is my hope that the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \nwill get similar expedited treatment on the House side, so that \nPresident Clinton will have this bill on his desk in the next few \nweeks. So that with a strengthened Paperwork Reduction Act we can \ncontinue the difficult but very important process of cracking down on \nFederal agency paperwork burdens that do not meet the Act's standards.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with the \ndistinguished gentleman from Georgia [Senator Nunn] in introducing the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Last year, this legislation, after \nthorough consideration by the Committee on Governmental Affairs, was \nreported unanimously and then passed the Senate on two different \noccasions, also unanimously.\n  This legislation is part of the Contract With America. While the \ncontract contains the original version which Senator Nunn and I \nintroduced in the last Congress, we believe that the new House \nleadership would be receptive to the improved version we are today \nintroducing. I am hopeful that the Senate will take the lead once again \nin passing this legislation. As chairman of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, I intend to process this legislation quickly, and \nask my colleagues on the committee to join with Senator Nunn, Senator \nGlenn, and myself in this effort.\n  I would hope that this legislation could be acted on this month to \nbecome the third Governmental Affairs bill in this young session to be \nconsidered on the floor.\n  This legislation enjoys widespread support among the business \ncommunity, both big and small, as well as among State, local, and \ntribal governments and the people--all who bear the burden of Federal \nGovernment paperwork collections. This legislation strengthens the \npaperwork reduction [[Page S1219]] aspects of the 1980 act and directs \nOIRA to reduce paperwork burdens on the public by 5 percent annually. \nBy overturning the 1990 Supreme Court decision in Dole versus United \nSteel Workers of America, it extends the jurisdiction of the act by 50 \npercent. One could thus expect the burden-saving results of this \nlegislation to be substantial.\n  The Committee on Governmental Affairs has broad jurisdiction over \nsubjects of paperwork burdens, information technology, and regulations. \nNo one piece of legislation can adequately deal with all facets of \nthose subjects. This legislation is not the last that will be addressed \non those subjects by the committee.\n  On February 1, 1995, the committee will hold a hearing on the \nGovernment's use of information technology as part of the Committee's \nReinventing Government effort.\n  On February 8, 1995, the committee will begin a set of hearings on \nthe broad subject of regulatory reform.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join with my \ncolleagues from the Government Affairs Committee, Senator Nunn and \nSenator Roth, to cosponsor our bipartisan legislation to reauthorize \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act. The legislation we introduce today \nreflects the compromise we achieved in the last Congress, which the \nSenate passed by a unanimous vote on October 6, 1994. I am confident \nthat this bill will once again be passed by the Senate and then move \nquickly in the House.\n  This legislation has two very important and closely related purposes. \nFirst, the Paperwork Reduction Act is vital to reducing Government \npaperwork burdens on the American public. Too often, individuals and \nbusinesses are burdened by having to fill out questionnaires and forms \nthat simply are not needed to implement the laws of the land. Too much \ntime and money is wasted in an effort to satisfy bureaucratic excess. \nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 created a clearance process to \ncontrol this Government appetite for information. The Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995 strengthens this process and will reduce the \nburdens of Government redtape on the public.\n  Second, the act is key to improving the efficiency and effectiveness \nof government information activities. The Federal Government is now \nspending over $25 billion a year on information technology. The new age \nof computers and telecommunications provides many opportunities for \nimprovements in Government operations. Unfortunately, as oversight by \nour committee and others has shown, the Government is wasting millions \nof dollars on poorly designed and often incompatible systems. This must \nstop. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 took a first step on the road \nto reform when it created information resources management [IRM] \npolicies to be overseen by OMB. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \nstrengthens that mandate and establishes new requirements for agency \nIRM improvements.\n  In these and other ways, this legislation strengthens the Paperwork \nReduction Act and reflects the concerns of a broad array of Senators. \nAs my colleagues know, I have been working for several years to \nreauthorize this important law. I am very pleased with the result. With \nthis legislation, we:\n  Reauthorize the act for 5 years;\n  Overturn the Dole versus United Steelworkers Supreme Court decision, \nso that information disclosure requirements are covered by the OMB \npaperwork clearance process;\n  Require agencies to evaluate paperwork proposals and solicit public \ncomment on them before the proposals go to OMB for review;\n  Create additional opportunities for the public to participate in \npaperwork clearance and other information management decisions;\n  Strengthen agency and OMB information resources management [IRM] \nrequirements;\n  Establish information dissemination standards and require the \ndevelopment of a government information locator service [GILS] to \nensure improved public access to government information, especially \nthat maintained in electronic format; and\n  Make other improvements in the areas of government statistics, \nrecords management, computer security, and the management of \ninformation technology.\n  These are important reforms. They are the result of over a year long \nprocess of consultation among members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the administration, and the General Accounting Office. Of \ncourse, reaching agreement on this legislation has involved compromises \nthat displease some. It may also not completely resolve conflicting \nviews on many of the OMB paperwork and regulatory review controversies \nthat have dogged congressional oversight of the Paperwork Reduction \nAct. But again, this legislation is a compromise that addresses many \nimportant issues and will help the Government reduce paperwork burdens \non the public and improve the management of Federal information \nresources. I believe this is a very good compromise that can and should \npass both the Senate and the House. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Graham, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bond, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Ford, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 245. A bill to provide for enhanced penalties for health care \nfraud, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the health care fraud prevention act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Dole, Simpson, Stevens, D'Amato, Graham of Florida, \nCoats, Gregg, Warner, Nickles, Pryor, Chafee, Bond, and Ford, the \nHealth Care Fraud Prevention Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, health care reform has now taken a back seat to some \nother measures that are now before the Congress, as our colleagues in \nthe House debate their Contract With America provisions and this body \ndebates unfunded mandates, a balanced budget amendment, and entitlement \nreform. Apparently health care reform is going to have to wait. But I \nmust say that it is just as important as these other issues as far as \nthe American people are concerned. But as we await the debate on health \ncare reform, which I believe must come this session, we also have to \ntake steps immediately to toughen our defenses against fraudulent \npractices that are driving up the cost of health care for families, \nbusinesses and taxpayers alike.\n  You may recall that last year I introduced a measure which contained \nsome additions to the criminal law provisions of our title 18 statutes. \nThose provisions were adopted unanimously by the Senate. They were sent \nover to the House where they were stripped out of the anticrime bill at \nconference because the majority rationalized that these provisions \nshould not go on the crime bill but on a health care reform bill. As we \nknow, there was no health care reform bill passed last year.\n  On a number of occasions, I sought to attach the provisions to \npending legislation, for example, the D.C. appropriations bill and the \nLabor, HHS appropriations bill. I was prevailed upon to withdraw the \nlegislation at that time so as to allow the appropriations bills to go \nforward. And I pointed out at that time, which was at the conclusion of \nlast year's session of Congress, that we would lose as much as $100 \nbillion a year due to health care fraud and abuse. That amounts to $275 \nmillion a day or $11.5 million every single hour.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we can afford to delay this any longer. \nOver the past 5 years, we have lost as much as $418 billion from health \ncare fraud and abuse, which is approximately four times the total \nlosses associated with the savings and loan crisis.\n  Just imagine the furor that enveloped this country over the bailout \nnecessary because of the savings and loan problems that afflicted this \ncountry. It is four times that as far as health care fraud is \nconcerned, and yet there does not seem to be much of a sense of urgency \non the part of our colleagues to do much about it.\n\n  Mr. President, I have worked with the Justice Department, the FBI, \nMedicaid fraud units, inspectors general, and others in developing this \nlegislation. As I pointed out last year there is a song, I think it was \nby Paul Simon-- [[Page S1220]] not our Paul Simon but the song writer \nPaul Simon--who had a song called ``Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover.'' \nWe showed through an Aging Committee's year-long investigation at least \n50 ways in which to pick the pockets of Uncle Sam and of private \ninsurers.\n  I will not, because of the length of the report, introduce it now \ninto the Record. I will simply ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks the executive summary of this year-long \ninvestigation be introduced in the Record and included as part of it.\n  Let me simply add a few more examples of the kinds of activities that \nare taking place now while we are debating other amendments, germane \nand nongermane, to the pending unfunded mandates bill. First, let me \npoint out that there are roughly a half billion Medicare claims \nprocessed each year and the overwhelming majority of those are \nsubmitted for legitimate services by conscientious health care \nproviders and beneficiaries--the overwhelming majority. It is the \nminority who are taking as much as $100 billion out of the system.\n  Let me give you examples of what is going on. A doctor promoted his \nclinic in television, radio, newspaper, and telephone book ads as a \n``one-stop, walk-in diagnostic center.'' You can walk in, and they can \ntake care of any problem you have got. So a person might go in for an \nexamination for a shoulder injury and be subjected to a huge battery of \ntests which have nothing to do with the shoulder, resulting in bills of \n$4,000 and more per patient.\n  Using the names of dozens of dead patients, a phantom laboratory in \nMiami allegedly cheated the Government out of $300,000 in Medicare \npayments in a matter of just a few weeks for lab tests never performed. \nThe lab that was submitting the bills for the tests was basically a \nrented mailbox and a Medicare billing number. That was it.\n  Employees of an airline were indicted for filing false and fraudulent \nclaims for reimbursement to a private insurance company for medical \ncare and services they claimed to have received in another country. The \nallegations are that the employees attempted to mail false and \nfictitious forms totaling close to $600,000 for treatments and services \nnever performed.\n  A durable medical equipment company, its owner and sales manager pled \nguilty to supplying unnecessary medical equipment such as hospital beds \nand oxygen concentrators to residents of adult congregate living \nfacilities and then billing Medicare for more than $600,000. These \nconspirators induced the facilities' managers to allow them to provide \nthe equipment by promising to leave the equipment when the patients \ndied or were transferred.\n  Physician-owners of a clinic in New York stole over $1.3 million from \nthe State Medicaid program by fraudulently billing for over 50,000 \nphantom psychotherapy sessions never given to Medicaid patients.\n  Finally, a medical equipment supplier stole $1.45 million from \nMedicaid by repeatedly billing for expensive back supports that were \nnever authorized by the patients' physicians.\n  These cases are but a small sample of the fraudulent and abusive \nschemes that are plaguing our health care system daily, freezing \nmillions of Americans out of affordable health care coverage, and \ndriving up costs for taxpayers.\n  The bill I am introducing today will go far in strengthening our \ndefenses against health care fraud.\n  Specifically, it will:\n  Give prosecutors stronger tools and tougher statutes to combat \ncriminal health care fraud. It would, for example, provide a specific \nhealth care offense in title 18 so that prosecutors are not forced to \nspend excessive time and resources to develop a nexus to the mail or \nwire fraud statutes to pursue clear cases of fraud, or to track the \ncash-flow from health care schemes in order to prosecute under money \nlaundering statutes.\n  It will allow injunctive relief and forfeiture for criminal health \ncare fraud; provide greater authority to exclude violators from \nMedicare and Medicaid programs; create tough administrative civil \npenalties and remedies for fraud and abuse so that a range of sanctions \nwill be available; and coordinate enforcement programs and beef up \ninvestigative resources, which are now woefully inadequate. For \nexample, the HHS' inspector general states that it produces $80 in \nsavings for each Federal dollar invested in their office yet their \nfull-time equivalent position level has actually decreased over the \nlast few years.\n  The FBI recently testified that they have over 1,300 cases pending \nbut that regardless of this prioritization, the amount of health care \nfraud not being addressed due to a lack of available resources is \ngrowing and that health care fraud appears to be a problem of immense \nproportion which is presently not being fully addressed.\n  I might point out we have been reading about the extent of global \ninternational crime, even all the way from Russia, now moving into this \ncountry and ripping off the Medicare-Medicaid Programs and other health \ncare systems by the millions. This is a growing problem of great \nconcern to me,  so the FBI needs help. This bill helps agencies like \nthe FBI and HHS and DOD inspectors general by financing additional \nhealth care fraud enforcement resources with proceeds derived from \nforfeiture, fines, and other health care fraud enforcement efforts.\n\n  It will also provide guidance to health care providers and industries \non how to comply with fraud rules, so they will know what is and what \nis not prohibited activity.\n  I have worked closely with law enforcement and health care fraud \nexperts in developing these proposals, and am continuing to work with \nindustry representatives to ensure that fraud and abuse statutes and \nrequirements are fair, clearly understood by health care providers, and \nreflect the changing health care market. Our goal should not be to \nburden health care providers with complicated, murky rules on fraud and \nabuse, but rather to lay down clear rules and guidance, followed by \ntough enforcement for violations.\n  Mr. President, when we are losing as much as $275 million per day to \nhealth care fraud and abuse, we cannot afford to delay any longer. The \nonly ones who benefit from delay on this important issue are those who \nare bilking billions from our system. The very big losers will be the \nAmerican taxpayers, patients, and families who cannot afford health \ncare coverage because premiums and health care costs are escalating to \ncover the exorbitant costs of fraud and abuse.\n  I want to thank Senator Dole for his steadfast support and leadership \non this issue and I urge my colleagues to support and act expeditiously \non this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed.\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n gaming the health care system: billions of dollars lost each year to \n                            fraud and abuse\n\n       For the past year, the Minority Staff of the Senate Special \n     Committee on Aging under my direction has investigated the \n     explosion of fraud and abuse in the U.S. health care system. \n     This report examines emerging trends, patterns of abuse, and \n     types of tactics used by fraudulent providers, unscrupulous \n     suppliers, and ``professional'' patients who game the system \n     in order to reap billions of dollars in reimbursements by \n     Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers.\n       The consequences of fraud and abuse to the health care \n     system are staggering: as much as 10 percent of U.S. health \n     care spending, or $100 billion, is lost each year to health \n     care fraud and abuse. Over the last five years, estimated \n     losses from these fraudulent activities totaled about $418 \n     billion--or almost four times as much as the cost of the \n     entire savings and loan crisis to date.\n       Our investigation revealed that vulnerabilities to fraud \n     exist throughout the entire health care system and that \n     patterns of fraud within some provider groups have become \n     particularly problematic. Major patterns of abuse that plague \n     the system are overbilling, billing for services not \n     rendered, ``unbundling'' (whereby one item, for example a \n     wheelchair, is billed as many separate component parts), \n     ``upcoding'' services to receive higher reimbursements, \n     providing inferior products to patients, paying kickbacks and \n     inducements for referrals of patients, falsifying claims and \n     medical records to fraudulently certify an individual for \n     government benefits, and billing for ``ghost'' patients, or \n     ``phantom'' sessions or services.\n       This report provides 50 case examples of scams that have \n     recently infiltrated our health care system. While these are \n     but a [[Page S1221]] small sampling of schemes that were \n     reviewed during the investigation, they serve to illustrate \n     how our health care system is rife with abuse, and how \n     Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers have left their doors \n     wide open to fraud.\n       Patients--and, in the case of Medicare and Medicaid, \n     taxpayers--pay a high price for health care fraud and abuse \n     in the form of higher health care costs, higher premiums, and \n     at times, serious risks to patients' health and safety. For \n     example;\n       Physician-owners of a clinic in New York stole over $1.3 \n     million from the State Medicaid program by fraudulently \n     billing for over 50,000 ``phantom'' psychotherapy sessions \n     never given to Medicaid recipients;\n       A speech therapist submitted false claims to Medicare for \n     services ``rendered to patients'' several days after they had \n     died;\n       A home health care company stole more than $4.6 million \n     from Medicaid by billing for home care provided by \n     unqualified home care aides. In addition to cheating \n     Medicaid, elderly and disabled individuals were at risk from \n     untrained and unsupervised aides;\n\n       Nursing home operators charged personal items such as \n     swimming pools, jewelry, and the family nanny to Medicaid \n     cost reports;\n       Fifteen hundred workers lost their prescription drug \n     coverage because a scam drove up the cost of the insurance \n     plan for their employer. The scam involved a pharmacist who \n     stole over $370,000 from Medicaid and private health \n     insurance plans by billing over one thousand times for \n     prescription drugs that he did not actually dispense;\n       Large quantities of sample and expired drugs were dispensed \n     to nursing home patients and pharmacy customers without their \n     knowledge. When complaints were received from nursing home \n     staff and patient relatives regarding the ineffectiveness of \n     the medications, one of the scam artists stated ``those \n     people are old, they'll never know the difference and they'll \n     be dead soon anyway'';\n       Durable medical equipment suppliers stole $1.45 million \n     from the New York State Medicaid program by repeatedly \n     billing for expensive orthotic back supports that were never \n     prescribed by physicians;\n       A scheme involved the distribution of $6 million worth of \n     reused pacemakers and mislabeled pacemakers intended for \n     ``animal use only.'' The scheme involved kickbacks to \n     cardiologists and surgeons to induce them to use pacemakers \n     that had already expired; and\n       A clinical psychologist was indicted for having sexual \n     intercourse with some of his patients and then seeking \n     reimbursement from a federal health plan for these encounters \n     as ``therapy'' sessions.\n       Our investigation found that scams such as these are \n     perpetrated against both public and private health plans, and \n     that health care fraud schemes have become more complex and \n     sophisticated, often involving regional or national \n     corporations and other organized entities. No part of the \n     health care system is exempt from these fraudulent practices, \n     however, we found that major patterns of fraud and abuse have \n     infiltrated the following health care sectors: ambulance and \n     taxi services, clinical laboratories, durable medical \n     equipment suppliers, home health care, nursing homes, \n     physicians, psychiatric services, and rehabilitative services \n     in nursing homes. Our investigation further concludes that \n     fraud and abuse is particularly rampant in Medicaid, and \n     that many of the fraudulent schemes that have preyed on \n     the Medicare program in recent years are now targeting the \n     Medicaid program for further abuse.\n\n\n  Greater Opportunities For Fraud Will Exist Under Health Care Reform\n\n       As our health care system moves toward a managed care \n     model, opportunities for fraud and abuse will increase unless \n     enforcement efforts and tools are strengthened. The structure \n     and incentives of a managed care system will result in a \n     concentration of particular types of schemes, such as the \n     failure to provide services and quality of care deficiencies \n     in order to cut costs. In addition, while efforts toward \n     simplification and electronic filing of health care claims \n     offer tremendous savings, they also pose particular \n     opportunities for abuse. Thus, it is crucial that any such \n     system be designed with safeguards built in to detect and \n     deter fraud and abuse.\n\n\n                       Findings of Investigation\n\n     Deficiencies in the current system expose billions of health \n         care dollars to fraud and abuse\n       A. Current Criminal and Civil Statutes Are Inadequate to \n     Effectively Sanction and Deter Hearth Care Fraud:\n       Federal prosecutors now use traditional fraud statutes, \n     such as the mail and wire fraud statutes, the False Claims \n     Act, false statement statutes, and money laundering statute \n     to persecute health care fraud. Our investigation found that \n     the lack of a specific federal health care fraud criminal \n     statute, inadequate tools available to prosecutors, and weak \n     sanctions have significantly hampered law enforcement's \n     efforts to combat health care fraud. Inordinate time and \n     resources are lost in pursuing these cases under indirect \n     federal statutes. Often, even when law enforcement shuts down \n     a fraudulent scheme, the same players resurface and continue \n     their fraud in another part of the health care system.\n       This cumbersome federal response to health care fraud has \n     resulted in a system whereby the mouse has outsmarted the \n     mousetrap. Those defrauding the system are ingenious and \n     motivated, while the government and private sector responses \n     to these perpetrators have not kept pace with the \n     sophistication and extent of those they must pursue.\n       B. The Fragmentation of Health Care Fraud Enforcement \n     Allows Fraud to Flourish:\n       Despite the multiplicity of Federal, State and local law \n     enforcement agencies, and private health insurers and health \n     plans involved in the investigation and prosecution of health \n     care fraud, these enforcement efforts are inadequately \n     coordinated, allowing health care fraud to permeate the \n     system. While some strides have been made in coordinating law \n     enforcement efforts, immediate steps must be taken to \n     streamline and toughen our response to health care fraud.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       Based on our investigation and findings, we recommend the \n     following to reduce fraud and abuse throughout the health \n     care system:\n       1. Establish an all-payer fraud and abuse program to \n     coordinate the functions of the Attorney General, Department \n     of Health and Human Services, and other organizations, to \n     prevent, detect, and control fraud and abuse; to coordinate \n     investigations; and to share data and resources with Federal, \n     State, and local law enforcement and health plans.\n       2. Establish an all-payer fraud and abuse trust fund to \n     finance enforcement efforts. Fines, penalties, assessments, \n     and forfeitures collected from health care fraud offenders \n     would be deposited in this fund, which would in turn be used \n     to fund additional investigations, audits, and prosecutions.\n       3. Toughen federal criminal laws and enforcement tools for \n     intentional health care fraud.\n       4. Improve the anti-kickback statute and extend \n     prohibitions of Medicare and Medicaid to private payers.\n       5. Provide a greater range of enforcement remedies to \n     private sector health plans, such as civil penalties.\n       6. Establish a national health care fraud data base which \n     includes information on final adverse actions taken against \n     health care providers. Such a data base should contain strong \n     safeguards in order to ensure the confidentiality and \n     accuracy of the information data contained in the data base.\n       7. Design a simplified, uniform claims form for \n     reimbursement and an electronic billing system, with tough \n     anti-fraud controls incorporated into these designs.\n       8. Take several steps to better protect Medicare from \n     fraudulent and abusive provider billing practices and \n     excessive payments by Medicare. Specifically:\n       Revise and strengthen national standards that suppliers and \n     other providers must meet in order to obtain or renew a \n     Medicare provider number;\n       Prohibit Medicare from issuing more than one provider \n     billing number to an individual or entity (except in \n     specified circumstances), in order to prevent providers from \n     ``jumping'' from one billing number to another in order to \n     double-bill or avoid detection by auditors;\n       Require Medicare to establish more uniform national \n     coverage and utilization policies for what is reimbursed \n     under Medicare, so that providers cannot ``forum shop'' in \n     order to seek out the Medicare carrier who will pay a higher \n     reimbursement rate;\n       Require the Health Care Financing Administration to review \n     and revise its billing codes for supplies, equipment and \n     services in order to guard against egregious overpayments for \n     inferior quality items or services; and\n       As we revise the health care system, give guidance to \n     health care providers on how to do business properly and how \n     to avoid fraud.\n       Adoption of these recommendations will go far in shoring up \n     our defenses against unscrupulous providers, patients, and \n     suppliers who are bleeding billions of dollars from our \n     health care system through fraud and abuse. Since Medicare \n     and Medicaid lose as much as $31 billion annually to fraud \n     and abuse, the savings from reducing fraud in these programs \n     would go far toward paying for much needed reforms in our \n     health care system, such as providing access to health care \n     coverage for the uninsured, prescription drug benefits for \n     the elderly, or long-term care for the elderly and \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       We must not wait to fix these serious problems in the \n     health care system until we see what form health care reform \n     takes. We are losing as much as $275 million each day to \n     health care fraud, and effective steps can be taken within \n     the current system to curb this abuse. With billions of \n     dollars and millions of lives at stake, we can no longer \n     afford to wait.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-section Analysis\n\n       The Cohen legislation establishes an improved coordinated \n     federal effort to combat fraud and abuse in our health care \n     system. It expands certain existing criminal and civil \n     penalties for health care fraud to provide a stronger \n     deterrent to the billing of fraudulent claims and to \n     eliminate waste in our health care system resulting from such \n     practices.\n       Section 101. a. All-Payer Fraud and Abuse Control Program: \n     The Secretary of Health [[Page S1222]] and Human Services and \n     the Attorney General are required to jointly establish and \n     coordinate an all-payer national health care fraud control \n     program to restrict fraud and abuse in private and public \n     health programs. The Secretary and Attorney General (through \n     its Inspectors General and the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation) would be authorized to conduct investigations, \n     audits, evaluations and inspections relating to the delivery \n     and payment for health care and would be required to arrange \n     for the sharing of data with representatives of health plans.\n       b. Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account: To \n     supplement regularly appropriated funds, a special account \n     would be established to fund the all-payer program, managed \n     by the Secretary and Attorney General. All criminal fines, \n     penalties, and civil monetary penalties imposed for \n     violations of fraud and abuse provisions of this legislation \n     would be deposited into the account and used for carrying out \n     the proposed requirements.\n       Section 102. Application of Certain Federal Health Anti-\n     Fraud and Abuse Sanctions to All Fraud and Abuse Against Any \n     Health Plan: The provisions under the Medicare and Medicaid \n     program, which provide for criminal penalties for specified \n     fraud and abuse violations, would apply and be extended in \n     certain circumstances to similar violations for all payers in \n     the health care system. The violations would include willful \n     submission of false information or claims. Penalties would \n     include fines and possible imprisonment. The Secretary could \n     also consider community service opportunities.\n       Section 103. Health Care Fraud and Abuse Guidance: Provides \n     mechanisms for further guidance to health care providers on \n     the scope and applicability of the anti-fraud statutes in \n     order to better comply with these statutes. The further \n     guidance would be provided by the modifications of existing \n     safe harbors and the promulgation of new safe harbors; \n     interpretive rulings providing the HHS' Inspector General's \n     interpretation of anti-fraud statutes; and special fraud \n     alerts setting activities that the Inspector General \n     considers suspect under the anti-fraud statutes.\n       Section 104. Reporting of Fraudulent Actions Under \n     Medicare: The Secretary is required to establish a program \n     through which Medicare beneficiaries may report instances of \n     suspected fraudulent actions on a confidential basis.\n       Section 201. Mandatory Exclusion from Participation in \n     Medicare and State Health Care Programs: The Secretary \n     currently has authority to exclude individuals and entities \n     from Medicare and Medicaid based on convictions or program-\n     related crimes relating to patient abuse or neglect. This \n     section would extend the Secretary's authority to felony \n     convictions relating to fraud and felony convictions relating \n     to controlled substances. Currently, the Secretary is \n     permitted, but not required, to exclude those convicted of \n     such an offense. Adoption of this proposal would better \n     recognize the seriousness of such offenses and ensure that \n     beneficiaries are well protected from dealing with such \n     individuals.\n       Section 202. Establishment of Minimum Period of Exclusion \n     for Certain Individuals and Entities Subject to Permissive \n     Exclusion from Medicare and State Health Care Programs: \n     Mandatory exclusions contain a minimum period of exclusion \n     for five years. This section establishes a minimum period of \n     exclusion expressly determined in statute for certain \n     permissive exclusions, such as three years for specific \n     convictions.\n       Section 203. Permissive Exclusion of Individuals with \n     Ownership or Control Interest in Sanctioned Entities: Some of \n     the current permissive exclusions are ``derivative'' \n     exclusions--that is they are based on an action previously \n     taken by a court, licensure board, or other agency. Current \n     law allows permissive exclusion authority for entities when a \n     convicted individual has ownership, control or agency \n     relationship with such entity. However, if an entity rather \n     than an individual is convicted under Medicare fraud, the IG \n     has no authority to exclude the individuals who own or \n     control the entity and who may really have been behind the \n     fraud.\n       This creates a loophole whereby an individual who is \n     indicated for fraud along with a corporation owned by his can \n     avoid being excluded from the programs by persuading the \n     prosecutor to dismiss his indictment in exchange for agreeing \n     to have the corporation plead guilty or pay fines. The bill \n     would extend the current permissive exclusion authority for \n     entities controlled by a sanctioned individual to individuals \n     with control interest in sanctioned entities.\n       Section 205. Intermediate Sanctions for Medicare Health \n     Maintenance Organizations: The Secretary would be able to \n     impose civil monetary penalties on Medicare-qualified HMOs \n     for violations of Medicare contracting requirements.\n       Section 301. Establishment of the Health Care Fraud and \n     Abuse Data Collection Program: The Secretary would create a \n     comprehensive national data collection program for the \n     reporting of information about final adverse actions against \n     health care providers, suppliers, or licensed practitioners \n     including criminal convictions, exclusions from participation \n     in Federal and State programs, civil monetary penalties and \n     license revocations and suspensions.\n       Section 401. Civil Monetary Penalties: The provisions under \n     Medicare and Medicaid which provide for civil monetary \n     penalties for specified violations apply to similar \n     violations in certain circumstances for all payers in the \n     health care system. The violations would include billing for \n     services not provided or submitting fraudulent claims for \n     payment.\n       The provisions would also clarify that repeatedly claiming \n     a higher code, or repeatedly billing for medically \n     unnecessary services, for purposes of reimbursement is \n     prohibited and subject to civil monetary penalties. The \n     intent of this provision is to impose sanctions for patterns \n     of prohibited conduct.\n       An intermediate civil monetary penalty would also be \n     established for criminal anti-kickback violations.\n       One abusive technique now used by some Medicare providers \n     is to waive the patient's copayment for services covered by \n     Medicare. The concern is that routine waivers of copayments \n     result in unnecessary procedures and overutilization (because \n     the beneficiary has no financial stake in the decision to \n     order a medical item or service). The provision would clarify \n     that the routine waiver of Medicare Part B copayments and \n     deductibles would be prohibited and subject to civil monetary \n     penalties although exceptions are provided.\n       In addition, retention by an excluded individual of an \n     ownership or control interest of an entity who is \n     participating in Medicare or Medicaid would be prohibited and \n     subject to civil monetary penalties.\n       Finally, the amount of civil monetary penalty that can be \n     assessed is increased from $2,000 to $10,000.\n       Section 501. Health Care Fraud: Establishes a new health \n     care fraud statute in the criminal code. Provides a penalty \n     of up to 10 years in prison, or fines, or both for knowingly \n     executing a scheme to defraud a health plan in connection \n     with the delivery of health care benefits, as well as for \n     obtaining money or property under false pretenses from a \n     health plan. This section is patterned after existing mail \n     and wire fraud statutes.\n       Section 502. Forfeitures for Federal Health Care Offenses: \n     Requires the court, in imposing sentence on a person \n     convicted of a Federal health care offense, to order the \n     forfeiture to the United States of property used in \n     commission of an offense if it results in a loss or gain of \n     $50,000 or more and constitutes or is derived from proceeds \n     traceable to the commission of the offense.\n       Section 503. Injunctive Relief Relating to Federal Health \n     Care Offenses: This provision expands the scope of the \n     current injunctive relief section by adding the commission of \n     a health care offense. This provision allows the Attorney \n     General to commence a civil action to enjoin such violation \n     as well as to freeze assets.\n       Section 504. Grand Jury Disclosure: This provision allows \n     the disclosure of grand jury information to federal \n     prosecutors to use in a civil proceeding relating to health \n     care fraud.\n       Section 505. False Statements: Provides penalties for \n     making false statements relating to health care matters.\n       Section 506. Voluntary Disclosure Program: Creates a \n     program of voluntary disclosure to the Attorney General and \n     Secretary to provide an incentive for disclosure of \n     violations and wrongdoing.\n       Section 507. Obstruction of Criminal Investigations: \n     Provides a penalty for the obstruction of criminal \n     investigations of federal health care offenses.\n       Section 508. Theft or Embezzlement: Establishes a statute \n     that provides penalties for the willful embezzlement or theft \n     from a health care benefit program.\n       Section 509. Laundering of Monetary Instruments: Provides \n     that a federal health care offense is a predicate to current \n     money laundering statutes.\n       Sections 601-604: Payments for State Health Care Fraud \n     Control Units: Provides language to establish state health \n     care provider fraud control units modeled on the current \n     state Medicaid Fraud Control Units. The jurisdiction of these \n     units would be expanded to include investigation and \n     prosecution of provider fraud in other federally-funded or \n     mandated programs. The proposal also allows the states to \n     choose whether to conduct investigations and prosecutions for \n     patient abuse related crimes occurring in board and care \n     facilities and other alternative residential settings.\n       The HHS' Inspector General would continue oversight and the \n     state units would detail its activities in its yearly grant \n     applications. This section also contains a recitation of the \n     units' original authorization language as currently contained \n     in the Social Security Act, and also allows the units to \n     participate in the all-payer fraud abuse control program.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to express my \nsupport for the Health Care Fraud Prevention Act of 1995, which was \nintroduced earlier today by my distinguished colleague from Maine, \nSenator Cohen.\n  As Senator Cohen has pointed out, health care fraud and abuse costs \nthe American taxpayers literally billions and billions of hard-earned \ndollars each year. Unscrupulous doctors who overbill patients, medical \nsuppliers who sell unnecessary or defective equipment to unsuspecting \ncustomers, clinic operators who submit false Medicaid reimbursement \nclaims--all these scams have the effect of driving up the \n[[Page S1223]] cost of health care for families and businesses alike.\n  To combat these activities, the act establishes a new health care \nfraud statute in title 18 of the United States Code. This statute \nprovides for an array of penalties, including imprisonment and fines, \nfor those who knowingly scheme to defraud a health care plan. This \nstatute is patterned after the existing mail and wire fraud statutes.\n  The act also gives the Secretary of HHS greater authority to exclude \nhealth care scam artists from the Medicaid and Medicare programs, while \nestablishing tough civil penalties for fraud so that a range of \nsanctions will be available.\n  In addition, the act directs the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to establish an all-payer national health \ncare fraud control program. Under this program, both the Secretary and \nthe Attorney General would be authorized to conduct investigations and \naudits of health care delivery systems. To pay for these \ninvestigations, the act establishes a ``Health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol account.'' Criminal and civil fines imposed on violators would \nbe deposited into the account and then used to finance future law \nenforcement efforts.\n  Of course, the vast majority of health care providers are good people \ncommitted to the well-being of their patients. Their hard work and \ncommitment should not be tarnished in any way by those few bad apples \nwho attempt to game the health care system for their own personal \nbenefit. This legislation won't put an end to the health care fraud \nracket, but it will help to ensure that our law enforcement authorities \nhave the tools to get the job done.\n  Not surprisingly, the Health Care Fraud Prevention Act was crafted \nwith the help of law enforcement officials, including officials at both \nthe FBI and the Department of Justice.\n  Finally, I want to commend my distinguished colleague from Maine for \nbringing this important issue to the attention of the Senate. Today's \nlegislation is the product of a 2-year ongoing investigation conducted \nby the staff of the Special Committee on Aging. And last year, Senator \nCohen successfully offered many of the provisions contained in this \nbill as an amendment to the 1994 Crime-Control Act. Unfortunately, the \namendment was dropped in conference.\n  To his credit, Senator Cohen has continued to speak out on this \nissue, and I fully expect that his persistence will pay off later this \nyear when the Senate has an opportunity to consider this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say as I begin, to my friend from \nMaine, the work he has done on this issue in Medicare fraud is \nextraordinary work. During the period between the end of the last \nsession and the beginning of this session, I saw some newspaper reports \nabout Medicare fraud. I bothered to once again review the work he did \nin the last session, the bill he introduced in the last session on this \nissue. I hope we make progress on this issue that he is leading on, in \nthis session of the Senate, because I think what he is doing is very \nimportant. There is too much fraud. The fact is, we are not detecting \nenough of it and not prosecuting enough of it vigorously, so I support \nhis efforts and thank him for making those efforts.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 245, the Health Care \nFraud Prevention Act of 1995. Health care fraud and abuse in our health \ncare system is draining billions of dollars a year from American \nfamilies, businesses, and government. The Department of Justice and \nother experts have estimated that as much as 10 percent of our national \nhealth care bill is lost to fraud and abuse. Every dollar stolen from \nthe health care system--be it from Medicare, Medicaid, or a private \nhealth care plan--means one less dollar for patient care or for lower \ninsurance premiums. With health care costs still escalating, the last \nthing we need to be doing is allowing criminals to steal from the \nsystem.\n  Fraud also tarnishes the good names of honest health care \nprofessionals and companies. While the vast majority of providers are \nhonest and hard working, the crooks cast a cloud over the entire health \ncare system.\n  Mr. President, there are too many examples of fraud in our health \ncare system. For example, seven New York physicians were recently \nexcluded from the New York Medicaid program for their part in a scheme \nthat stole over $8 million from the program. As part of this Medicaid \nfraud scheme, indigent individuals with no legitimate medical need for \nprescription drugs would enter the doctors' clinics and obtain \nprescriptions for expensive drugs. They, in turn, would resell the \nprescriptions to people on the street. In exchange for the \nprescriptions, the ``patients'' would subject themselves to unnecessary \nmedical tests and procedures for which Medicaid could then be \nfraudulently billed.\n  In other cases, it is not so clear that there has been fraud, but \nrather that a health care plan has been taken advantage of. As an \nexample, I received a letter from a constituent of mine, Jennie H., not \ntoo long ago. Jennie wrote that Medicare had paid a medical supplier \n$2,136 for 300 adult incontinence pads that were delivered to her \nmother. That works out to almost $7.12 for each pad, far more than what \nthey would cost at the drug store.\n  Much studying has been on the health care fraud problem in recent \nyears. In addition to the report issued last year by my friend from \nMaine, Senator Cohen, the incoming chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging, reports by the General Accounting Office, the HHS \ninspector general, and congressional committees have also documented \nthe extent and range of the problem. They have detailed abuses ranging \nfrom the billing of services never provided to the illegal sale of \ncontrolled substances.\n  This is a subject about which I too have long been concerned. When I \nwas chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I held several \nhearings on fraud and abuse in the health care system. In addition, the \nhealth care bill reported out of the Finance Committee last year \nincluded an antifraud provision that I helped develop.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to take action against health care \nfraud. While I would have preferred to see the health care fraud \nproblem addressed as part of health care reform, it is clear that we \ncannot wait for that to happen. Each day we wait to give crime fighters \nthe authority and tools they need to combat fraud in a coordinated and \neffective manner means millions of wasted health care dollars.\n  The bill which I have joined Senator Cohen in sponsoring today \nrepresents a balanced, bipartisan approach to combating health care \nfraud and takes the best provisions common to the bills debated last \nyear, such as the President's proposal. It establishes an improved, \ncoordinated effort to combat fraud and abuse. It expands certain \nexisting criminal and civil penalties for health care fraud to provide \na stronger deterrent to the billing of fraudulent claims and to \neliminate waste in our health care system. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 246. A bill to establish demonstration projects to expand \ninnovations in State administration of the aid to families with \ndependent children under title IV of the Social Security Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the welfare reforms that work act\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Welfare \nReforms That Work Act of 1995. The welfare system is in crisis. The \nUnited States has one of the most expensive welfare systems in the \nworld. But 20 percent of America's children are poor, a higher \npercentage than any other industrialized country. The welfare system is \na disaster for those who are on it and those who pay for it.\n  This Congress has a historic opportunity to begin to fix this \ndisaster. The primary welfare program--Aid to Families With Dependent \nChildren [AFDC]--is viewed by those participating in it and those \npaying for it as a failure. It is failing at its primary task, moving \npeople into the work force. Worse yet, it is contributing to the cycle \nof poverty. By rewarding single parents who don't work, don't marry, \nand have additional children out of wedlock, the current system demeans \nour most cherished values and deepens society's most serious problems. \nDemocrats, Republicans, and the American [[Page S1224]] public agree \nthat the system must be changed.\n  But little consensus exists on how best to reform the system so that \nit promotes work and family. Last year both President Clinton and \nRepublicans in Congress proposed legislation that would impose time \nlimits and work requirements on welfare recipients and would begin to \nturn welfare incentives around. But in this Congress some have gone \nfurther. The Republican Contract With America proposes, among other \nthings, ending benefits abruptly for teenage mothers who have children \nout of wedlock. More recently some Members have advocated giving the \nStates total control of AFDC and other Federal welfare programs, ending \nthe entitlement status of these programs, and capping Federal outlays.\n  While I believe that each of these ideas should be tested to see if \nthey will produce better results than the current failed welfare \nsystem, I cannot support mandating any of them nationally because no \none knows whether they will work. If Congress imposes them nationally \nand they do not work, millions of children's lives will be put at risk.\n  While I am pleased to see that my colleagues are advocating State \nflexibility, I am concerned about their blank-check approach. I agree \nthat States should be the testing ground for bold programmatic changes. \nBut handing the AFDC Program over to the States with no strings \nattached does not guarantee reform and may produce national division \nand welfare shopping. And, placing caps on block grants works against \nState flexibility by limiting State experiments to those that save \nmoney in the short term but may do nothing to promote work and \nreconstruct families in the long term. The American people are asking \nus to reform, not eliminate, the way we are carrying out our \nresponsibility to help poor children.\n  Mr. President, today I am proposing an alternative welfare reform \napproach that I hope will meet our welfare reform goals in a way that \nis acceptable to both sides of the aisle--the Welfare Reforms That Work \nAct. The bill would allow States to test--with appropriate Federal \noversight--bold welfare reform initiatives that are promising but \nunproven, and that involve some human or financial risk. It would also \nestablish a process for identifying successful reform approaches--\nwelfare reforms that work--that can be applied nationally. The bill \ndoes not preclude our mandating immediately those reforms about which \nthere is growing agreement--such as requiring unwed teenage mothers to \nlive at home as a condition of receiving welfare payments--and which \ninvolve limited human risk or Federal expense.\n  States should be at the forefront of reform for three reasons. First, \na State-based approach is financially prudent. Some reforms that merit \ntesting--including imposing time limits and work requirements or \nexpanding residential child care options, including orphanages--will \ncost money in the short term. In an article in the New Republic, Paul \nOffner of the Senate Finance Committee staff advises us to learn an \nimportant lesson from the 1988 Family Support Act: overly ambitious and \nunderfunded reform efforts are doomed to failure. They do little to \nchange the expectations of those working in the system or those using \nit. My bill would allow States to fund ambitious changes at the more \naffordable city, county, or State level.\n  Second, a State-driven approach allows us to test bold changes \nresponsibly. We have few proposed reforms that we know will work, and \nthose that have been tested, such as the model education and training \nprograms launched in California and Florida, have delivered only \nmarginal results to date. In a recent Wall Street Journal James Q. \nWilson bluntly confessed that he simply does not know what reforms will \nwork.\n  Absent better information, we would be wise to heed the advice of \nproverbs and avoid zealous acts without knowledge. Changes to welfare \nare consequential. They affect people's lives, children's lives. Under \nmy bill States could test bold welfare rules changes--such as totally \ndenying benefits to teenage mothers or establish orphanages--but only \nif the States can ensure that children are not unintended victims of \nthese tests. As we try to change the behavior of parents, we must not \ncause more pain to the children.\n  Third, States are eager and able to lead our reform efforts. In \ntestimony last year before the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee \non Social Security and Family Policy, the American Public Welfare \nAssociation [APWA] and other State organizations indicated their strong \ndesire to pursue innovative strategies. When I introduced S. 1932, a \nsimilar State-based welfare reform bill last year, all 11 States that \ncommented on the bill praised the bill's general approach.\n  States are already leading the way. Over half the States have \nproposed reforms and received waivers from Federal rules under section \n1115 of the Social Security Act to implement their proposed changes. My \nown State of Connecticut recently received a waiver to implement a \ncomprehensive reform initiative.\n  But the waiver process does not go far enough. In testimony before \nthe House Committee on Government Operations last September, the APWA, \nState welfare administrators, and other witnesses testified that the \nbudget neutrality requirement of the current process creates a \nsubstantial barrier to reform. As States seek to promote work and \nfamily through changing eligibility rules, it give States an incentive \nto test sticks but not carrots. Witnesses at the hearing urged that the \nFederal Government share in the cost of demonstrations programs, make \nthe results of demonstrations readily available, and tallow States to \nadopt, without a waiver, those demonstrations that prove effective. In \nother words, we must be honest and acknowledge that we may have to \nspend a little more money in the short run to save a lot more money and \na lot more lives in the long run.\n  My bill addresses these and other concerns voiced by States about the \ncurrent waiver process. To ensure that States will be able to test the \nbroadest array of reforms, my bill authorizes $675 million over 5 years \nto support demonstration projects and independent program evaluations. \nHalf of these funds would support innovative pilot programs specified \nin the bill, and the remaining half would fund other State-proposed \ndemonstrations. Demonstration projects would last up to 5 years. States \nwould report on progress annually. As results of interim and final \nreports on State tests become available, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services [HHS] will submit legislation \nto Congress to provide for the national implementation of successful \nprograms. As a result of this process, those innovations that proved \nsuccessful could be rapidly adopted by other States or imposed \nnationwide.\n  The bill promotes State-initiated welfare reforms that meet what I \nbelieve should be our four main reform goals: moving welfare recipients \ninto the work force; strengthening families, stopping illegitimate \nbirths and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency; increasing child \nsupport collection and paternal responsibility, and improving the \ndelivery of welfare services.\n\n\ntitle i authorizes initiatives to move welfare recipients into the work \n                                 force\n\n  We must make returning to work the primary focus of the welfare \nsystem. The current system demands little of people on welfare. It \noften impedes, rather than empowers, those who seek to return to the \nwork force. If an AFDC mother goes back to work, her income increases \nonly minimally--often not enough to cover child care--and she loses her \nMedicaid benefits. She is likely to be economically worse off if she \nreturns to the work force, so she stays on welfare.\n  Title I includes initiatives to move people on welfare into the work \nforce. Two pilot programs focus on teenage parents--those at greatest \nrisk for long-term welfare dependency. The first allows States to \ncondition AFDC benefits for single parents under 20 years of age on: \nfirst, attending school, participating in job training or holding a \njob; and second, living at home. The second allows States to include \nyoung AFDC clients in the Job Corps--a successful, residential \nantipoverty program for youths 16 to 22 years of age.\n  Title I also allows States to require 30 days of State-assisted job \nsearch or, where appropriate, substance abuse treatment, during the \nusual lag time between application for and receipt of \n[[Page S1225]] benefits. Welfare clients should be engaged in job \nsearch from the day they first seek a welfare grant. Other provisions \nin this title assist people on welfare in accumulating assets to invest \nin education or to start a small business.\n\n\n title II authorizes initiatives to strengthen families and break the \n                      cycle of welfare dependency\n\n  Current Federal welfare rules discourage family unification and \nencourage out-of-wedlock childbearing. This title seeks to turn these \nincentives around. It recognizes that while welfare is a privilege \ngranted by Government, not a right for parents, the States and the \nFederal Government have a moral responsibility to ensure the well-being \nof American children.\n  The title seeks to address what is perhaps the most compelling and \ndifficult challenge of welfare reform, to discourage out-of-wedlock \nbirths without harming children. An increasing percentage of those \nentering the welfare system are never-married mothers at greatest risk \nof long-term welfare dependency. Between 1983 and 1992, families headed \nby unwed mothers accounted for about four-fifths of the growth in \npeople on welfare, and at least 40 percent of never-married mothers \nreceiving AFDC remain in the system for 10 years or more.\n  Never-married teen parents are particularly likely to fall into long-\nterm welfare dependency. More than one half of welfare spending goes to \nwomen who first gave birth as teens. As William Raspberry noted last \nwinter in a Washington Post column aptly entitle ``Out of Wedlock, Out \nof Luck,'' children born to parents who had their first child out-of-\nwedlock before they finished high school and reached the age of 20 are \n``almost guaranteed a life of poverty.'' In other words, they and their \nparents are almost guaranteed a life on welfare. Citing William A. \nGalston's analyses, Raspberry notes that a startling 79 percent of \nchildren in this category lived in poverty in 1992. In contrast, only 8 \npercent of children whose parents had achieved all three milestones--\nmarriage, graduation, and the 20th birthday--before having their first \nchild were living in poverty.\n  The potential effect of welfare on illegitimacy has taken center \nstage in the welfare reform debate but there is considerable \ndisagreement about its effects. David Ellwood, economist and Department \nof Heath and Human Services official, has found little evidence that \nwelfare contributes to the increase in illegitimacy. In his book, \n``Poor Support,'' he points to several other concurrent social changes \nthat are likely contributors to the increase--the growing percentage of \nwomen in the work force, the drop in earnings and rise in unemployment \namong young men, and changes in attitudes toward marriage.\n  Others interpret the data differently. Most notably, Charles Murray \nbelieves that welfare is the primary cause of the increase in \nillegitimate births. In a catalytic Wall Street Journal article \npublished October 29, 1993, Murray argues that welfare has reduced the \neconomic penalty associated with out-of-wedlock childbearing and, in \nturn, has reduced the social stigma associated with it. He concludes \nthat the removal of both of these disincentives has led to more out-of-\nwedlock births. Based on this conclusion, Murray recommends the \ndramatic step of ending welfare altogether. Murray acknowledges that \nhis approach may put this generation of children at risk and advocates, \namong other things, Government investment in new facilities to care for \nthese children--thus the ensuing brouhaha about orphanages--just the \nkinds of facilities this act would enable states to create.\n  The stigma of illegitimacy was not just an accident of social \nhistory; it was a societal attempt to protect children. Today, the \nstigma is largely gone and so the children have suffered terribly. \nRaspberry's previously mentioned article cites polling results \nindicating that 70 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 believe that \npeople having children out of wedlock do not deserve any moral \nreproach. That is an outrageous result, one that we must turn around \nbecause the decision to bear a child has profound moral and human \ncontent. We must infuse our children with a clear understanding of the \nconsequences of teenage childbearing. We must teach them that it is \nwrong to have children unless you are married, always morally wrong for \nthe mother and father, and usually horrible for the child and the \nmother.\n  Few would argue that a national campaign to discourage unmarried \nteenagers from having children is not a good thing to do. Indeed, \nSenate Minority leader Daschle introduced a bill, S. 8, on the first \nday of this session to combat teen pregnancy. His bill, among other \nthings, would require unwed mothers under age 18 to live at home or in \nan alternative adult-supervised living arrangement as a condition of \nreceiving AFDC. This measure seems appropriate; it would eliminate the \nincentive teenagers now have to bear a child so they can move out of \nthe house, and it imposes little risk to the children of teenagers who \nhave a child anyway.\n  The more difficult question for those of us working on welfare reform \nis this: Should we pursue changes in welfare policy--such as cutting \noff benefits to teenage mothers--that may discourage out-of-wedlock \nbirths but would put children at risk? Some might say no, believing \nthat there is little correlation between welfare and out-of-wedlock \nbirths. The empirical evidence is generally viewed as inconclusive. But \nsome controlled studies have demonstrated a positive association \nbetween welfare payments and out-of-wedlock births, and my own \nconversations with teenage mothers bears this out.\n  If we choose to reduce or eliminate AFDC grants to deter \nchildbearing, however, we should acknowledge that a portion of the \ncurrent and potential welfare population--perhaps a small but \nsignificant portion--is unlikely to respond to stronger inducements and \npenalties and will continue to have children society must provide for. \nIn a Los Angeles Times article published last January, Adela de la \nTorre, an economist at California State University at Long Beach, \nwrites that the children of such parents ``become victims of trickle \ndown welfare programs * * * if we deem the parent unfit for welfare \nsupport, the child, too, loses.'' De la Torre rejects the notion that \nbuilding stronger parental inducements into the welfare system will \nchange the behavior of all parents and calls instead for a more child-\ncentered social service agenda that recognizes and serves the needs of \nchildren in a more direct, comprehensive, and integrated fashion. She \nmakes an important point.\n\n  Similarly, Thomas Corbett of the University of Wisconsin asks in a \nspring, 1993 Focus article whether it is ``compassionate to throw a \nlittle bit of welfare into troubled families and do little else to aid \nthe children?'' The answer is, of course, relative. AFDC reflects our \nbest intentions toward these children, but it has more often failed \nthem. Whether cash payments to unresponsive parents is the most \ncompassionate approach, Corbett concludes, ``depends partly on how many \nchildren are involved and whether we can design and finance the \ntechnologies required to assist them.''\n  It is incumbent on us, as part of welfare reform, to explore the \nalternatives to a largely parent-based system, and find the answers to \nhis question. Title II of the bill supports State efforts to do just \nthat. Section 201 allows States to shift part or all of AFDC payments \nto block grants and combine the grants with other funds available under \nthis bill to care for children, strengthen families, and implement \nother reforms. In contrast to the Republican block grant proposals, \nhowever, the provision requires the Secretary of HHS to ensure that \nStates pursuing the Block Grant Program protect the well-being of \naffected children. Title II supports other demonstrations as well, \nincluding pilots that discourage welfare recipients from having \nadditional children while on welfare by denying benefit increases for \nadditional children and pilots to test innovative teen pregnancy \nprevention programs.\n\n\n title iii of the bill authorizes state initiatives to increase child \n             support collection and paternal responsibility\n\n  Too often absent parents, typically fathers, are not held accountable \nfor their children's care. The Federal Government must also take the \nlead in improving child support enforcement. As a starting point, we \nshould fully implement the recommendations of the U.S. \n[[Page S1226]] Commission on Interstate Child Support. In the last \nCongress Senator Bill Bradley, a member of the Commission, introduced \nS. 689, the Interstate Child Support Enforcement Act, to implement the \nCommission's recommendations. My Connecticut colleague, Congresswoman \nKennelly, also a Commission member, introduced a similar bill, H.R. \n1961, in the House. This year I will again support Senator Bradley's \nlegislation which will, among other things: Mandate hospital-based \npaternity acknowledgement programs; require employers to submit \nW-4 forms for all new employees to State child support \nenforcement agencies; and provide States the authority they need to \nassert jurisdiction over nonresident parents. The era of deadbeat dads \nshould end.\n  While improving interstate coordination is critical to strengthening \nchild support enforcement, State innovation should play a role as well. \nTitle III of my bill authorizes State efforts to improve child support \ncollection and paternity establishment. To strengthen welfare \nrecipients incentives to work with authorities to collect child \nsupport, it would allow States to increase the child support disregard \nfrom $50 to a higher level decided by the State. States could also hold \nparents accountable for the child support obligations of their minor \nchildren. Additionally, States could propose their own demonstrations \nprojects to increase paternity establishment and improve child support \ncollection.\n\n\n     title IV authorizes initiatives to diversify and improve the \n                    performance of welfare services\n\n  Changing the welfare system to move people back into the work force \nand to better serve the needs of children will require changing the way \nthe welfare bureaucracy does business. Too many welfare workers focus \non whether and how to get a welfare check to the recipient rather than \nhow to get the recipient off of welfare and back to work. Many welfare \noffices don't know how many children they have in foster care. Many \nstill operate out of cardboard files and lose people in the shuffle of \npaper. Offices often suffer from interagency rivalry and bureaucratic \nbickering. It is tragic when a child suffers needlessly because the \nsystem fails under the weight of its own inefficiency.\n  This need not happen. Some innovative States and municipalities have \ntried to make their welfare systems more efficient and service \noriented. At a hearing I held in the last Congress, Carmen Nazario, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in Delaware, testified that her \nState has brought public and private social services together in a \nsingle location and is now developing a computer network to link \nprograms.\n  David Truax from the Maryland Department of Human Resources described \na second approach to improving services. Maryland now provides each \nparticipant with a debit card that has AFDC, food stamps, and general \nassistance benefits on it. Electronic benefit transfer [EBT] cards have \nseveral advantages: They preclude the trading of food stamps for drugs; \nthey introduce people to the banking system; they make it easier for \nthem to budget their money since they don't have to cash one single \ncheck, and they reduce recipients vulnerability to crime.\n  Further, offices should encourage and empower, not discourage and \ndemean, those they serve. It can be done. America Works, a private \norganization that trains people on welfare for work and places them in \njobs, provides proof. During my visit to their Hartford, CT, office I \nfound that clients felt they were getting the help they needed to \nsucceed, and were motivated and optimistic. I asked one young woman who \nhad just completed her training if she expected to be placed \nsuccessfully in a job. She responded with enthusiasm, ``absolutely.'' \nThis spirit does not typically pervade traditional welfare offices.\n  Most important, welfare offices should be held accountable for \nresults. They need to make the shift from writing checks to moving \npeople on welfare into jobs. To promote this change, we should seek to \nestablish competition among agencies and greater choice for people on \nwelfare. We should encourage public agencies to contract with effective \nprivate sector companies and to better reward those public employees \nwho successfully help people become self-sufficient.\n  Title IV supports initiatives to diversify and improve the \nperformance of welfare services. It supports State pilots to provide \nincentives to private sector, for-profit and nonprofit groups to place \npeople on welfare in private sector jobs. Companies would keep a \nportion of welfare savings as payment for successful job placements. \nTitle IV also supports State pilots to improve the performance of \nwelfare office employees through, for example, providing direct bonuses \nto employees and judging their performance based on their clients' \nprogress toward self-sufficiency.\n  In addition, title IV incorporates legislation I introduced earlier \nthis month with Senators Domenici, Feinstein, Pressler, and Hatfield to \nremove a Federal barrier to improving services. That bill, S. 131, the \nElectronic Benefits Regulatory Relief Act of 1995, exempts EBT cards \nfrom the Federal Reserve Board's regulation E. Regulation E limits \ncardholder liability to $50 for lost or stolen cards--a policy that \npromotes fraud and makes EBT Programs costly for States. Earlier this \nmonth the Vice President issued the first report from the EBT task \nforce and called for nationwide implementation. Without passage of this \nprovision, that goal will not be reached.\n\n\nfinally, title v authorizes offsetting expenditure reductions to ensure \n                       the bill is budget neutral\n\n  In other words, the bills pay for itself. Specifically, it eliminates \nthe three-entity rule. Currently, an individual farmer can qualify for \nup to $125,000 per year in certain Government subsidies. If he forms \ntwo other business entities with two other individuals (say, a friend \nand a sister), each of these entities can qualify for another $125,000 \nper year. So the individual farmer can receive up to $250,000 in \nsubsidies per year--$125,000 for his first business entity, and half of \n$125,000 for each of his second and third entities. My bill says, \n``enough is enough,'' and caps the amount of agricultural subsidies any \none person gets from the Federal Government at $125,000. A preliminary \nCongressional Budget Office estimate indicates this change will save \n$675 million over 5 years, money that is better spent on the truly \nneedy.\n  Americans continue to show concern for the poor, and particularly \npoor children. A 1994 poll commissioned by the Children's Defense Fund \nand others found that 64 percent of Americans believe we should spend \nmore on poor children. But the same poll found that 55 percent think we \nspend too much on welfare, and 68 percent think we should not increase \npayments to parents for any additional children they have while on \nwelfare.\n  Our current approach to helping the poor is clearly not working. The \ngoal of welfare reform is to shake up the status quo which promotes \ndependency, illegitimacy, and social disfunctions like crime into a \nsystem that promotes work, family, and responsibility and protects \nchildren from a life of poverty. The Federal Government does not have a \nready formula for how to achieve this goal. I concur with my colleagues \nwho say that we should look to the States for answers. But we must \nproceed in a way that meets our obligation to ensure the well-being of \nall of America's children. Our aim should be to make sure that this \ngeneration of welfare children do not become the next generation of \nwelfare parents. This bill offers an approach to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

States that the purpose of the bill is to promote \n     bold State-initiated welfare reforms to move welfare \n     recipients into the work force; strengthen families; break \n     the cycle of welfare dependency; increase child support \n     collection and paternal responsibility; and improve the \n     delivery of welfare services. The bill is designed to make \n     immediate State-by-State changes to the existing system while \n     establishing a process for identifying successful reform \n     approaches that can be applied nationally. The bill reflects \n     the findings that: the current welfare system is failing \n     children and contributing to the cycle of poverty and other \n     societal ills; mandatory job training and many other \n     incremental reforms tested to date have had minimal effects \n     on welfare dependency; and the States are best positioned to \n     test far-reaching reform proposals that involve some human or \n     financial risk. While this bill in no way precludes national \n     reforms such as time-limits, work requirements or requiring \n     teenage parents to live at home, it gives States the central \n     reform role and provides the authority and resources they \n     need to pursue bold and untested reforms.\n       Sec. 4. Sets forth general provisions relating to \n     demonstration projects. Authorizes $150 million/yr for the \n     first two years and $125 million/yr in the following three \n     year to support pilots and evaluations of pilots, and \n     requires States to have evaluation plans approved by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) before \n     receiving funds. A portion of these funds would support \n     innovative pilot programs not specified in the bill but \n     proposed by States. Demonstration projects could last up to 5 \n     years. States would report on progress annually. As results \n     of interim and final reports become available, the Secretary \n     of HHS will submit legislation to Congress to implement \n     promising reforms nationally.\n\n\n  title I.--initiatives to move welfare recipients into the work force\n\n       From the first day that an individual applies for welfare, \n     the primary focus of welfare offices should be to help that \n     person move into the work force. A welfare grant should be \n     conditioned on responsible behavior. This Title supports \n     state reforms to move welfare recipients into the work force.\n       Sec. 101. Supports State pilots to condition AFDC benefits \n     for single parents under 20 years of age with at least one \n     dependent child and no children under 6 months of age on \n     attending school or participating in a job or job training \n     program for a minimum of 35 hours per week and on living at \n     home. States would also impose a time limit (not specified) \n     on benefits, and make child care available during training \n     and work activities. Since the program would be expensive, it \n     targets those at greatest risk of long-term welfare \n     dependency--teenage mothers.\n       Sec. 102. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to establish a \n     pilot program with the Jobs Corps (a successful, residential \n     anti-poverty program for youths 16-22 years of age) targeting \n     teenage mothers on AFDC with below school-age children. The \n     pilot would include a Parents-as-Teachers type program \n     designed to teach parents how to help prepare their children \n     for school and learning.\n       Sec. 103. Supports State pilots to require 30 days of \n     assisted job search or, where appropriate, substance abuse \n     treatment immediately following application for AFDC, \n     coinciding with the usual lag time between application for \n     and receipt of benefits. Applicants would have to complete \n     the assigned activities before receiving AFDC payments.\n       Sec. 104. A national change to permit States to allow AFDC \n     families to save money (up to $10,000) for education and \n     training or starting a small business.\n       Sec. 105. Expands on legislation introduced in 1993 with \n     Senator Dodd.\n       A national change to permit States to help recipients start \n     a small business by allowing participants a one-time election \n     to fully deduct capital equipment purchases in one year;\n       Supports State pilots to establish public-private \n     partnerships to provide technical assistance to self-employed \n     AFDC recipients;\n       Supports State pilots to train AFDC recipients as self-\n     employed providers of child care services; and\n       Supports State pilot projects to promote ownership of \n     extended family-owned businesses by AFDC recipients. Would \n     provide incentives and assistance for families receiving aid \n     to families with dependent children to work together as \n     managers and employees in extended family-owned businesses.\n       Sec. 106. Amends JOBS provisions to emphasize efforts to \n     move people into the work force over training and education.\n       Sec. 107. Supports additional demonstration projects \n     proposed by States to move AFDC recipients into the work \n     force.\n\n\n Title II.--Initiatives to Strengthen Families and Break the Cycle of \n                           Welfare Dependency\n\n       The current Federal welfare rules discourage family \n     unification and encourage out-of-wedlock childbearing. The \n     most serious victims of these policies are children born into \n     poor, unstable families. This Title supports State reforms \n     that promote parental responsibility and family unity. It \n     recognizes that while welfare is a privilege for parents, \n     States and the Federal government have a moral responsibility \n     to ensure the well-being of all American children.\n       Sec. 201. Supports State pilots to establish child centered \n     programs through conversion of AFDC and JOBS payments into \n     block grants, plus funds available under other sections of \n     this bill. States could apply portions of funds to: (1) \n     establish residential homes for teenage mothers with \n     children, including [[Page S1232]] supporting the pilot \n     project described in section 102; (2) expand programs to \n     expedite and improve adoption of children; (3) expand child \n     care assistance for needy children of working families; (4) \n     establish supportive residential schools for children \n     enrolled at the request of their parents; (5) provide other \n     services directly to needy children; and (6) fund other \n     programs that are consistent with the purposes of the Act. \n     The Secretary of HHS, in reviewing the application, must \n     ensure that the State's program will protect the well-being \n     of affected children.\n       Sec. 202. Supports State pilots to discourage welfare \n     recipients from having additional children while on welfare \n     and increase the financial reward for work.

Supports demonstration projects to increase \n     paternity establishment.\n       Sec. 302. Supports demonstration projects to increase child \n     support collection, including: increasing the child support \n     disregard, from $50 to a higher level decided by the state; \n     and, holding parents accountable for child support \n     obligations of their minor children.\n\n\ntitle iv.--initiatives to diversify and improve performance of welfare \n                                services\n\n       Welfare offices are notoriously bureaucratic and \n     unresponsive. Under current Federal laws, they have few \n     incentives and some disincentives to improve performance. \n     This Title supports state efforts to promote competition \n     among welfare service providers and to implement performance-\n     based management programs in welfare offices. It also removes \n     a current Federal impediment to the use of electronic benefit \n     transfer ``smart cards.''\n       Sec. 401. Supports State pilots to provide incentives to \n     private sector, for profit and non-profit groups to place \n     welfare recipients in private sector jobs.

Supports State pilots to implement performance-\n     based management systems for public welfare providers.\n       Sec. 403. To promote the use of electronic benefit transfer \n     (EBT) ``smart cards'' that reduce fraud and improve services, \n     this section exempts state EBT programs from the Federal \n     Reserve Board's ``Regulation E.'' Reg. E currently limits \n     cardholder liability to $50 for lost or stolen cards--a \n     policy that promotes fraud and makes EBT programs costly for \n     States.\n\n\n              title v.--offsetting expenditure reductions\n\n       Sec. 501. Eliminates the ``three-entity'' rule, reducing \n     the amount of certain Federal subsidies individual farmers \n     can receive from $250,000 to $125,000 per year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 247. A bill to improve senior citizen housing safety; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 the senior citizens housing safety act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last year, I introduced the Senior \nCitizens Housing Safety Act, a bill that will end the terror that \nunfortunately runs rampant throughout many housing projects \nspecifically designated for elderly and disabled residents. I \nreintroduce this important legislation.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, most people are still afforded the \nluxury of not having to lock their front door before turning in for the \nevening. However, many elderly residents of public housing facilities \nin my State and across America have been forced to not only lock their \nfront doors, but are literally being held prisoner in their own homes. \nI believe this is outrageous. I have received numerous complaints from \nresidents of elderly housing facilities throughout New Hampshire who \nare worried about their personal safety in housing specifically \nreserved for them.\n  Under current housing laws nonelderly persons considered disabled, \nbecause of past drug and alcohol abuse problems, are eligible to live \nin section 8 housing designated for the elderly. This mixing of \npopulations may have filled up the housing projects across the country, \nbut it has opened a Pandora's box of trouble. Simply put, young, \nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts are not compatible with elderly \npersons. Many of these young people hold all-night, loud parties, shake \ndown many of the elderly residents for money, sell drugs within the \nhousing facility, and generally disturb the right to the peaceful \nenjoyment of the premises by other tenants.\n  This problem has occurred because the definition of handicapped under \nthe Fair Housing Act was amended in 1988 to include recovering \nalcoholics and drug addicts. Under the mixed population rules of 1992, \nCongress determined that the elderly and disabled should be housed \ntogether. Historically, disabled individuals have lived in complexes \nfor the elderly because the apartments there--one-bedroom units \nequipped with such features as hand rails--best fit their needs. \nHowever, drug addicts and alcoholics who are considered disabled do not \nhave the same needs. Many elderly persons hope to retire in a community \nsurrounded by persons their own age, elderly people who choose to live \na peaceful existence in the company of their peers. I want to restore \nthat hope and this legislation will attack this problem with a two-tier \napproach.\n\n  First, my legislation will institute a front-end screening process. \nThis will prevent nonelderly individuals, classified as disabled \nbecause they are recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction, from \nbecoming eligible for housing that is designated for the elderly. It \nsimply says they cannot live in housing designated for the elderly \nadditionally, it will prevent the further mixing of two groups that are \nobviously incompatible. This will not, however, exclude these \nnonelderly, disabled individuals from the housing I believe they need \nand deserve.\n  Second, my legislation will force local public housing agencies to \nevict nonelderly individuals occupying the facility who engage on three \nseparate documented occasions in activities that threaten the health, \nsafety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants \nand involves the use of drugs or alcohol.\n  This process, by no means, circumvents the current housing eviction \nprocedure. Under current law the public housing agency could evict \nthese persons after one infraction if deemed necessary. It simply \nmandates that these nonelderly individuals be evicted after three \nincidents which threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful \nenjoyment of the premises by other tenants.\n  This is a simple bill that prevents the mixing of two populations who \nhave proved incompatible.\n  This bill will restore order in housing projects designated for \nelderly and disabled tenants by screening out nonelderly alcoholics and \ndrug addicts, as well as evicting those nonelderly persons who \ncontinuously raise havoc within the housing project. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bill. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to delay the required implementation date for enhanced \nvehicle inspection and maintenance programs under the Clean Air Act and \nto require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \nreissue the regulations relating to the programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 the auto inspection reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Auto Inspection \nReform [AIR] Act of 1995. I am pleased that Senators Hutchison, Lott, \nGramm, Nickles, and Warner have joined as cosponsors. This legislation \nwill postpone the implementation of the enhanced vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance programs under the Clean Air Act until March 1, 1996. The \nbill requires EPA to reissue the regulations relating to these \nprograms, and to reassess its initial position that effectively \nmandated centralized tests.\n  Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, Congress imposed enhanced auto emission \ninspection and maintenance requirements on States in nonattainment \nareas and on States in the statutory-mandated Northeast ozone transport \nregion. Under the act, Congress provided a clear option to centralized \nsystems for States that proved that decentralized testing could be as \neffective.\n  Despite the clear statutory language that indicates Congress wanted \ndecentralized testing to be a viable option, EPA has acted to \nfundamentally undermine this congressional intent. Through two \ndecisions, EPA has effectively forced States to adopt centralized \nsystems. First, EPA determined that an extremely high cost test known \nas the IM-240 was mandated under the act. Second, EPA determined that \nthe pollution reduction that States say can be achieved by a \ndecentralized system must be discounted by roughly 50 percent.\n  As a result, States have either yielded to EPA's mandate, or are \ntrying to get EPA to change its views. States that chose the first \ncourse are facing a citizen rebellion and States choosing the second \nare facing a brick wall. If a State does not meet the enhanced \nemissions testing requirements to EPA's satisfaction, the Agency can \nhave the State's Federal highway funding cut off.\n  EPA has just recently indicated a willingness to reconsider and \nnegotiate increased flexibility with some of the affected States' \nGovernors and not implement fines for States moving forward in ``good \nfaith.'' This is a good first step. However, it has only been \nimplemented on a State-by-State basis and EPA has yet to issue any \ncodified guidance to define this apparent change in policy. States \nremain at the mercy of EPA's discretion. I believe that any new policy \nshould be formalized to provide States certainty and predictability. \nThis bill will help ensure that the Clean Air Act will be complied with \nby giving States the necessary flexibility to implement the most \nsuitable inspection program for their States. I urge my colleagues to \ngive this bill careful consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Auto Inspection Reform (AIR) \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, in carrying out title I \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Administrator'') has failed \n     to--\n       (1) adequately consider alternative programs to centralized \n     vehicle emission testing programs, as required by section \n     182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); and\n       (2) provide adequate credit to States for the alternative \n     programs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the \n     Administrator to--\n       (1) reassess the determinations of the Administrator with \n     respect to the equivalency of centralized and decentralized \n     programs under section 182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of the Clean Air Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi)); and\n       (2) issue new regulations governing the programs that--\n       (A) result in minimum disruption to the ability of States \n     to comply with other requirements of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 \n     et seq.); and\n       (B) provide States a reasonable opportunity to comply with \n     the new regulations and implement any decentralized testing \n     programs that the States demonstrate are equally effective as \n     centralized programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State shall not be required to implement an enhanced \n     vehicle inspection and maintenance program under section \n     182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)) prior \n     to March 1, 1996.\n       (b) Reassessment of Regulations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) immediately rescind the regulations issued on November \n     5, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 52950), relating to operation of the \n     program described in subsection (a) on a centralized basis; \n     and\n       (B) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending on March 1, 1996--\n       (i) reassess the determinations made by the Administrator \n     with respect to operation of the program described in \n     subsection (a) on a centralized basis, taking into \n     consideration comments submitted by States; and\n       (ii) issue new regulations relating to operation of the \n     program described in subsection (a) on a centralized basis, \n     or, at the option of each State, on any decentralized basis \n     if the State demonstrates that such a decentralized program \n     is equally effective as a centralized program.\n       (2) Requirements.--The regulations issued under paragraph \n     (1)(B)(ii) shall--\n       (A) in accordance with the intent of section \n     182(c)(3)(C)(vi) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511a(c)(3)(C)(vi))--\n       (i) make reasonably available to States the option of \n     operation of the program described [[Page S1234]] in \n     subsection (a) on any decentralized basis if the State \n     demonstrates that such a decentralized program is equally \n     effective as a centralized program; and\n       (ii) establish criteria that a State must meet in order to \n     demonstrate that a decentralized program of the State is \n     equally effective as a centralized program; and\n       (B)(i) provide each State a reasonable opportunity to \n     submit (at the option of the State) a new revision to a plan \n     under section 182(c)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a(c)(3)) \n     based on the new regulations, which revision shall replace \n     any revision to a plan previously submitted by the State \n     under section 182(c)(3) of the Act; and\n       (ii) include a schedule that provides States a reasonable \n     opportunity to implement any new revisions to plans that the \n     States submit.\n       (3) Judicial review.--Notwithstanding section 706 of title \n     5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, if the \n     regulations issued pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(ii) are \n     reviewed by a court, the court shall hold unlawful and set \n     aside the regulations if the regulations are found to be \n     unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n       (c) Prohibition on Imposition of Sanctions.--Until such \n     time as the Administrator has carried out subsection (b)(1)--\n       (1) the Administrator may not issue a finding, disapproval, \n     or determination under section 179(a) of the Clean Air Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7509(a)), or apply a sanction specified in section \n     179(b) of the Act, to a State with respect to a failure to \n     implement a program described in subsection (a), or any \n     portion of such a program; and\n       (2) the Administrator and the Administrator of the Federal \n     Highway Administration of the Department of Transportation \n     may not take any adverse action, against a State with respect \n     to a failure described in paragraph (1), under--\n       (A) section 176 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506);\n       (B) chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code;\n       (C) subpart T of part 51, or subpart A of part 93, of title \n     40, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly known as the \n     ``transportation conformity rule''); or\n       (D) part 6, 51, or 93 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (commonly known as the ``general conformity \n     rule'').\n       (d) Full Credit for Decentralized Programs.--Until such \n     time as the Administrator has carried out subsection (b)(1), \n     for the purpose of the attainment demonstration and the \n     reasonable further progress demonstration required under \n     section 182(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511a(c)(2)), the Administrator shall--\n       (1) deem that the emission reductions calculated by States \n     for inspection and maintenance under their State \n     implementation plans would be achieved as if the planned \n     program had been implemented; or\n       (2) if appropriate, consider the operation of the program \n     described in subsection (a) on a decentralized basis as \n     equivalent to the operation of the program on a centralized \n     basis in any case in which a State demonstrates that a \n     determination of such an equivalency is reasonable.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 250. A bill to amend chapter 41 of title 28, United States Code, \nto provide for an analysis of certain bills and resolutions pending \nbefore the Congress by the Director of the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              the litigation impact statements act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill \nthat joins the effort to improve our legal system with the goal of \neliminating unfunded Federal mandates.\n  Too often, Mr. President, Congress passes a bill without regard as to \nits impact on the court system. How many new cases will the law \ngenerate? Will they be Federal court cases or State court cases? How \nmuch will it cost government to enforce the new law through the legal \nsystem? How much liability will government, as well as the private \nsector, incur as a result of the new law?\n  These questions are rarely asked by Congress before a bill becomes \nlaw. The bill I am introducing will change all of that. It requires the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts to provide a litigation impact \nstatement for all bills reported from committees--except private relief \nbills and appropriation bills.\n  The A.O. is equipped to perform this task; in fact, the staff already \ndoes provide a judicial impact statement for certain bills. They did it \nfor the Violence Against Women's Act, and they did for a bill I \nintroduced in the 102d Congress, the Pornography Victims' Compensation \nAct.\n  In 1994, more than 281,000 new cases were filed in the Federal \ncourts, with an increase in the civil filings of 3 percent over last \nyear--Interestingly, the criminal filings have gone down.\n  In 4 of the last 5 years, filings in the Federal courts have \nincreased. This increase in court filings occurs at the State level, \nwhere hundreds of thousands of cases are also filed. Too many of these \ncases are a direct result of Federal legislation enacted without a \nthought as to the effect on the courts. My bill will give Congress the \nopportunity to consider, for every bill, what burdens it will create \nfor the courts, as well as the financial impact for potential liability \nthe new law will have on governmental and private entities. Cities and \ntowns are spending more and more of their budgets on liability \ninsurance, and part of the blame for that rests with Congress for the \nnew laws creating runaway liability.\n\n  Will a litigation impact statement slow Congress down? I certainly \nhope so. It would be just fine with the American people, if Congress \nimposed fewer burdens on them. After all, they delivered a loud message \nlast November. They said our government does not work properly; it's \ntoo big, too expensive and inefficient. So, before Congress goes off \npassing laws which will create more lawsuits, let's get Congress \neducated about the impact any new laws will have on our court system.\n  Congress already gets an assessment of the budget impact for any new \nlegislation. Let's also have a litigation impact statement. It is a \nvery good beginning on the road to reforming the legal system.\n  And on reforming the legal system, I will have more to say in the \ncoming days. The time is right to undertake comprehensive reform of our \nlegal system. I know it will be a top priority of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and I look forward to working with that committee on this \nissue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 251. A bill to make provisions of title IV of the Trade Act of \n1974 applicable to Cambodia; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          most-favored-nation status for cambodia legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced legislation \nto clear up an anomaly in United States law that prohibits the \nPresident from granting Cambodia most-favored-nation status [MFN]. \nDespite my efforts, Cambodia is without MFN and the President is still \nwithout the statutory power to grant it. There were many more important \nissues for Congress to address in 1994. But MFN is very important to \nCambodia. And it should be important to all of us interested in a \nstable and prosperous Southeast Asia. Accordingly, today, I am \nreintroducing legislation to grant MFN to Cambodia.\n  Areas of Indochina under Communist control, including significant \nportions of Cambodia, were denied MFN under the Trade Agreements \nExtension Act of 1951 and the 1974 Trade Act. Cambodia as a whole was \ndenied MFN in 1975 by Executive action and its new trading status was \nconfirmed by Congress in the 1988 Trade Act.\n  The 1974 Trade Act provided a process for restoring MFN to those \nnations then denied it. However, only a portion of Cambodia was denied \nMFN at the time the 1974 act was signed into law. There is no clear \nlegal authority for restoring MFN to the entire nation under the \nprocesses established by the 1974 Trade Act. It cannot be restored by \nreversing the action taken in 1975 through an Executive order because \nCambodia's non-MFN trading status was made law in the 1988 Trade Act. \nIn short, the President wants to grant MFN to Cambodia, but lacks the \nauthority to do so.\n  The legislation I am introducing would give the President the \nauthority to grant Cambodia MFN status by bringing the entire country \nunder the restoration procedure of the 1974 Trade Act. Under these \nprocedures, Cambodia will have to demonstrate compliance with the \nrequirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, reach a bilateral \nagreement with the United States, and have its status approved by the \nCongress. The President may also waive the requirements of Jackson-\nVanik, which has for political reasons come to mean a policy decision \nfar beyond the original concern for emigration, and immediately upon \nthis legislation becoming law, extend MFN to Cambodia. Cambodia would \nbe eligible to receive MFN by virtually the same process \n[[Page S1235]] that all other non-MFN countries, except the Baltics, \nhave received it since the signing of the 1974 Trade Act.\n  I want to emphasize that if this bill becomes law, the President will \nretain his prerogatives to respond to developments in Cambodia.\n  Despite some disturbing developments in Cambodia since I introduced \nthis legislation for the first time last May, I remain hopeful for the \nfuture of Cambodia. Cambodia's democracy is a very fragile and \nincomplete one, but it is a democracy. It needs careful attention to \nfully develop and sustain the rights of the Cambodian people. Promoting \neconomic development through open markets would offer considerable \nsupport for Cambodian democracy and demonstrate American concern for \nits future. I encourage my colleagues to act on legislation to grant \nMFN to Cambodia at the earliest possible opportunity.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Bond, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burns, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Frist, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        Packwood, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S.J. Res. 21. A joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment \nto limit congressional terms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  TERM LIMITS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator Ashcroft, \nwill introduce a joint resolution to impose term limits on Members of \nCongress. This legislation will limit Members of the Senate to two \nterms and it will limit Members of the House to three terms. The time \nhas come to pass this legislation. It is needed and it has the \noverwhelming support of the American people. In fact, never has there \nbeen an idea so popular that has received so little attention by the \nU.S. Congress. It is because term limits does not have to do with \nspending other people's tax money or regulating other people's lives as \nis the case with most legislation coming out of Congress. This \nprovision, term limits, hits much closer to home. It calls for \nsacrifice or at least adjustment in the lives of ourselves. At least, \nwith regard to those in Congress who see the Congress as a permanent \ncareer. It is time that the Congress put aside the personal interest \nthat individual Members might have and respond to the will of the \npeople, the good of the country, as well as the good of Congress as an \ninstitution.\n  Because term limits is not about punishing Congress or denigrating \nthe institution of Congress, although it has come to the point where \nmany in our society would love to do so. On the contrary. Term limits \nwould strengthen and elevate Congress in the eyes of the American \npeople at a time when it is most needed. Today people feel alienated \nfrom their Government and have concluded that Congress does not have \nthe will to deal with the tough challenges that face this country in \nthe future. And who can disagree with that notion. Yesterday we passed \nout of the Judiciary Committee a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I have concluded, as I think most others have, that \npassage of a balanced budget amendment is absolutely necessary if we \nare going to avoid bankrupting the next generation. The reason is that \nCongress doesn't have the political will to do what we all know is \nnecessary. Therefore, we must resort to the straitjacket of a balanced \nbudget amendment. It is a reflection upon us and upon our current \nsystem that such a straitjacket is needed. But constitutional \namendments with regard to specific matters cannot indefinitely save us \nfrom ourselves. We must start developing the will that is necessary to \nface tough issues. To me that means that we must have more people \ncoming into the system who view service in the U.S. Congress not as a \npermanent career but as an interruption to a career. I believe that \nterm limits would more likely produce individuals who would take on the \ntough challenges, since their careers would not be at stake every time \nthey did so. It would also draw them into the system and encourage more \ncitizens to run for office since they would not automatically face the \ndifficult uphill struggle of running against a well-entrenched, well-\nfinanced incumbent.\n  There have been many Members who have served much longer than the \nlimitations of this legislation would allow. A case can be made for the \nproposition that up until recently our current system has served us \npretty well. There is no need to argue that point. However, different \ntimes and different circumstances require different measures. As the \nFederal Government has grown there has been a proliferation of special \ninterest groups each with their demand on the Treasury and each holding \na carrot and a stick for every Member of Congress. The carrot is \npolitical and financial support. And the stick is mobilizing of their \nforces in order to try to end a Member's career. So every time a Member \ntakes a tough stand for the benefit of those yet unborn, who do not \nhave votes, his career is on the line. For a Member whose entire future \nis based upon indefinite continued service, these forces are too often \noverwhelming. So we now have a $5 trillion debt and a deficit that will \nstart to skyrocket again in 1998. Apparently, we have decided to let \nour children and grandchildren make the tough choices. That's not being \nresponsible. Surely, we are better than that. We owe it to them to take \nthe measures necessary to give us the best chance of putting ourselves \nin the position to deal with such problems. That is why we need term \nlimits and I urge my colleagues support.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, 1994 was a watershed year in America. \nOur people spoke with a clarity and intensity seldom heard in the halls \nof politics. Their voices reverberated across the continent like the \nrevolutionary shot heard round the world at Lexington and Concord two \ncenturies ago.\n  The voters' voice was a clarion cry for revolution in Washington, \nDC--a revolution that returns the right of self-governance to the \npeople.\n  We, the American people, are self governing. We are free people. We \nhave the right to govern ourselves. We have spilt American blood not \nonly across this continent, but around the globe, to preserve our right \nto self-government.\n  Fifty years ago, to win the Battle of the Bulge, commanders compelled \nthe cooks, the clerks, and the corpsmen to join the front lines and to \ndefend our freedom of self-governance. For victory, all had to fight, \nall were necessary, none were excluded. Well, we again must invite \neveryone to join the battle and participate in victory for self-\ngovernance.\n  Those of us who were in the trenches of politics this year heard the \nbattle cry for reentry by the public into the public policy arena. The \ncitizens of this Nation are determined to regain the right to \nparticipate in their government. They want to reopen the door to self-\ngovernance--a door that too often has been slammed in their face. We \nmust not slam it in their face again.\n  The people want the right to self-governance. They want the \nopportunity to decide on term limits.\n  Some say that the States can decide on term limits, but the courts \nhave struck those statutes down almost uniformly. In one remaining \ncase, the Arkansas case, the Attorney General, the executive branch, \nhas slammed the door in the face of the people, saying they have no \nright to make such a determination; States and the people have no right \nto establish term limits, the executive branch says.\n  The judicial branch considering the case is likely to slam the door, \nas well, saying the people have no right to chart the course of their \nown future, to establish limits on the terms of those of us who have \nthe privilege of representing the people in making public policy \ndecisions here in Washington.\n  Congress, then, the last remaining branch of Government, holds the \nkey to opening the door of self-governance to the people.\n  Back in 1951, the Congress sent to the American people the \nopportunity to enact term limits for the President. Congress could not \nenact them, but it called upon the people to make a judgment to \nparticipate in the process of public policy development.\n  Presidential term limits were not imposed by the Congress. The door \nof decisionmaking was swung wide for the people of this great country \nto decide whether or not they wanted term limits for the President. \nIndeed, they did decide; they participated. It was good public policy. \nThey ratified the 22nd amendment. [[Page S1236]] \n  The question is not whether we will provide term limits to America. \nThe question is whether or not we will allow the American people the \nprivilege of participating in public policy determinations, whether we \nwill let the American people decide for themselves whether or not they \nwant term limits for Members of the U.S. Congress.\n  I have a hint about what the American people believe and how they \nthink. Twenty-two States have already overwhelmingly endorsed this \nconcept. And of the States given the opportunity to make such a \ndecision, the people voting in those States almost uniformly and \nwithout exception have endorsed the understanding that people should \nnot go to Washington for an entire lifetime, but should go expecting to \nreturn from public service.\n  The question then is, will we let the people decide or will we slam \nthe door of self-governance in the face of the American people again? \nWe must let the people decide.\n  It is time for us to acknowledge again the principle of self-\ngovernance. Let the people decide.\n  It is time that we trust our people, the people of America, as our \nforefathers did. Let the people decide.\n  Let us demolish the misleading myth that Congress exists to protect \npeople from themselves. We must instead respect the reality that there \nis wisdom in the people. We must acknowledge the reality that self-\ngovernance is not simply a politically expedient idea, it is, in fact, \ngovernmentally beneficial.\n  The people are eager to participate in shaping the tomorrows in which \nthey live and in which all of us work. They are demanding the \nopportunity to decide whether or not to limit the terms of Members of \nthis body and of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  As servants of the people, we must pass a resolution on term limits \nthat recognizes that term limits cannot be in the exclusive province of \nthe House or Senate, but this is a decision to be reached by the \nAmerican people. This is an opportunity for self-governance.\n  They have spoken with clarity and intensity this year, saying they \nwant us to reopen the door of opportunity to decisionmaking and let \nthem decide. I submit that we must respond to their call; that we must \npass a resolution on term limits and thereby let the people decide to \nenact or reject term limits as they would apply to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri comes to the \nfloor for his first floor statement on an issue that will not surprise \nany of his fellow Missourians, and that is a message of change.\n  Change is what John Ashcroft talked about so clearly during his \ncampaign, and now he is doing exactly what he told the people of \nMissouri he would do if they sent him here--to be a leader for change.\n  I take great pleasure in cosponsoring this legislation for term \nlimits, because I think this is a very important first step toward \ndoing actually what the people so clearly indicated they wanted done \nlast November 8. It is no surprise to me that John Ashcroft is leading \nthe way.\n  John is an old and very dear friend. I have come to know him as an \nAmerican patriot. He believes in this country and its people. He is \nable to cut through the fog of confusion that so often surrounds public \npolicy issues. Missourians know him as a plain speaker in the finest \nMissouri tradition. He knows what he believes and how to say it so \neveryone knows just exactly what he believes. We once had a President \nwith the same reputation from Missouri. What John Ashcroft believes is \nshaped by an upbringing that reflects the essence of middle-American \nvalues, its traditions and beliefs.\n  John is one of three boys raised in Springfield, MO. His family was \nmodest of means, but rich in respect for their community, for each \nother, and for their God.\n  Earlier this month, John's father, Dr. J. Robert Ashcroft a highly \nrespected educational and religious leader, passed away after returning \nhome to Missouri from witnessing John's swearing-in as a U.S. Senator \nin this Chamber. Dr. Ashcroft's passing was a great loss to Missouri, \nbut his contribution, his memory, and his commitment will live on. We \nhave suffered the loss along with John and his family, but we know that \nhe knew his son would continue his efforts to serve, and to serve his \nfellow man. We all give thanks for Dr. Ashcroft's life and the many \nlives which he touched while he was with us.\n  John Ashcroft has served as Missouri's State auditor--he followed me \nin that job--and then he served as attorney general, following John \nDanforth. He followed me as Governor. He understands State government \nand its relationship with the Federal Government. He also knows \nsomething about cleaning up the problems that have been left behind.\n  At a time when Congress will reexamine the relationship and hopefully \nreturn much of the decisionmaking back to the States, Americans will \nhave no better leader than John Ashcroft.\n  So we hear today from a plain-spoken Missourian what will undoubtedly \nbe the first of many clearly reasoned, morally grounded floor speeches \nfrom our good friend, John Ashcroft.\n  I would say that our fellow Senators will understand very well his \ncontributions. We value John Ashcroft's friendship. We welcome him and \nhis wife, Janet, to Washington. I am confident that all my colleagues \nwill come to know and respect him as I have. It will be a great and \nvery meaningful friendship for all Members.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Grams, and Mr. Mack): Senate Joint Resolution 22. A joint \n        resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \n        United States to require a balanced budget; to the Committee on \n        the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation \ncalling for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I am \npleased to be joined by the distingshed majority whip, Senator Lott, \nand my colleagues, Senate Inhofe, and Thomas.\n  This legislation is what the American people are calling for. It \nbalances the budget, but ensures that it is not balanced on the backs \nof the American taxpayers.\n  There is no question that Congress must pass a balanced budget \namendment and send it to the States for ratification. For years, \nWashington has been racking up deficits. In the process, we've racked \nup $4\\1/2\\ trillion national debt. And sadly, we've got very little to \nshow for it.\n  Without the balanced budget amendment, Congress will continue it \ndeficit-digging, debt-building ways. That's bad news for the taxpayers \nand worse news for our children.\n  If you look at every so-called deficit reduction package Congress has \npassed in the last decade, you'll find that each one follows a \nconsistent formula. Raise taxes now. Cut spending later.\n  Tragically, however, once Congress raised in taxes, it always forgot \nabout the spending cuts. So, year after year, taxes would go up, \nspending would go up, and the deficit would go up, too. It's time to \nput an end to this madness.\n  That's why I am today introducing a taxpayer protection balanced \nbudget amendment in the Senate. My amendment would require a three-\nfifths super majority vote in both houses of Congress to raise taxes.\n  A supermajority requirement is the best way to show the American \ntaxpayers that Congress is serious about balancing the budget through \nspending cuts, and not through higher taxes.\n  That's what I promised the taxpayers of Minnesota during my campaign \nfor the U.S. Senate. That's what they elected me to do. That's what my \nbill delivers.\n  Is there enough support in Congress to pass it? If we listen to the \nfolks back home there sure ought to be.\n  A poll released today by the American Conservative Union that shows \nthat the American people overwhelmingly support the supermajority \nrequirement.\n  In fact, two thirds of those who already support a balanced budget \namendment say that without a supermajority provision, the bill would be \na sham.\n  The people have spoken. A balanced budget must be achieved through \ncuts in Government spending. Americans are willing to do that, but they \naren't willing to be patsies for a big-spending \n[[Page S1237]] government that just hasn't learned when to say ``no.''\n  The supermajority requirement is simply good government, and \nAmericans support it just as they support the $500 per-child tax \ncredit. They're tired of watching their paychecks grow smaller while \nWashington grows bigger.\n  They voted for change last November, and it's our job to see that \nthey get it.\n  That's what's best for the taxpayers, that's what's best for our \nchildren, that's what's best for Minnesota, that's what's best for \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1207-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 4, a bill to grant the \npower to the President to reduce budget authority.\n\n\n                                 S. 11\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the names of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 11, a bill to award grants to States to promote the \ndevelopment of alternative dispute resolution systems for medical \nmalpractice claims, to generate knowledge about such systems through \nexpert data gathering and assessment activities, to promote uniformity \nand to curb excesses in State liability systems through federally-\nmandated liability reforms, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Lott] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 22, a bill to require Federal agencies to prepare \nprivate property taking impact analyses.\n\n\n                                 S. 45\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Reid] was added as a cosponsor of S. 45, a bill to amend the \nHelium Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to sell Federal \nreal and personal property held in connection with activities carried \nout under the Helium Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. Kyl] and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 194, a bill to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid \nCoverage Data Bank, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 218\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole] and the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 218, a bill to repeal the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bryan, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Pressler] was added as a cosponsor of S. 228, a bill to \namend certain provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to \nthe treatment of Members of Congress and Congressional employees for \nretirement purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 230\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] and the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 230, a bill to prohibit United States \nassistance to countries that prohibit or restrict the transport or \ndelivery of United States humanitarian assistance.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 18\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hollings, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Daschle] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 18, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution relative to contributions and expenditures intended to \naffect elections for Federal, State, and local office.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bumpers, the names of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Graham], the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], the Senator \nfrom North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], and the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] \nwere added as cosponsors of Amendment No. 144 proposed to S. 1, a bill \nto curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States \nand local governments;

Mr. President, there are more than 180 countries in the \nUnited Nations. They range from the world's largest countries in area, \nin population, in economic output, down to some very small countries \nindeed, countries that are smaller than some counties in my own State \nof Illinois. I have nothing against those small countries being members \nof the United Nations. On the contrary, I feel that any country capable \nof making a real contribution to the activities of the United Nations \nshould have the opportunity to do so as a full member of that \norganization.\n  For that reason, it is all the more unfortunate that a country of 21 \nmillion people, a country that has made great strides in consolidating \ndemocratic institutions and practices, a country that has become a \nsignificant economic power and a major contributor to international \nassistance efforts--that such a country should find itself closed out \nof the United Nations.\n  I am speaking, of course, of Taiwan.\n  Together with my cosponsor, Senator Brown, I am pleased to submit \ntoday a Senate Concurrent Resolution that reaffirms, as the sense of \nthe Senate, what many of us in this Chamber have already concluded: \nThat Taiwan deserves to participate fully in the United Nations as a \nfull member, and that the U.S. Government should encourage the United \nNations to begin studying means to bring this about. Congressman \nSolomon introduced an identical resolution, House Concurrent Resolution \n8, earlier this month.\n  I would especially like to call my colleagues' attention to a \nparticular element of this resolution: namely, that in seeking \nmembership in the United Nations and other international institutions, \nTaipei does not intend to challenge the current international status of \nBeijing. Rather, Taiwan would seek admission as part of a divided \nnation. There are precedents for this; this has worked before. East and \nWest Germany were admitted to the United Nations as separate parts of a \ndivided nation; North and South Korea were admitted to the United \nNations as separate parts of a divided nation.\n  I am pleased that, last June, the Senate agreed to by voice vote a \nsimilar resolution expressing the sense that Taiwan should be brought \ninto the United Nations. There have been some changes in the political \nmakeup of the Congress since then. I think that is all the more reason, \nthen, that the Senate should go on record and affirm something that has \nnot changed: Our support for Taiwan's integration into international \ninstitutions. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1237-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1238-S1241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         UNFUNDED MANDATES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     GRAMM AMENDMENTS NOS. 149-150\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRAMM submitted two amendments, intended to be proposed by him, \nto the bill S. 1 to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal \nmandates on States and local governments;

Mr. President, I am sure that, like me, my \ncolleagues in this Chamber have been appalled by the pictures coming \nout of Chechnya. There is a grim familiarity to the events taking place \nthere. Massive military force sent by Moscow to take on lightly armed, \nor unarmed, civilians: this is something we saw in Hungary in 1956, in \nCzechoslovakia in 1968, in Afghanistan in 1979. We hoped we wouldn't \nsee it again.\n  With Chechnya, though, we are also seeing something new, and very \nsignificant. With the exception of the ultranationalists on the one \nhand, and the diehard pro-Yeltsin camp on the other, Russian public \nopinion has risen up in outspoken opposition to a war they feel is not \nworth the cost. Not worth the cost in lives; not worth the cost in \nmoney; not worth the cost to Russia's name in the world community.\n  Freedom of speech is one of the foundations of a democratic system, \nand there's no guarantees that that freedom, or that democracy itself, \nhave taken permanent root in Russia. But the reaction of the Russian \npublic to the war in Chechnya is a heartening indication that the first \nshoots of a civil society are beginning to appear in Russia.\n  In a recent column William Safire makes this point very well, \ncontrasting the tumultuous energy of Russia's political environment \nwith the deceptive stability of one-party rule in China. I ask that Mr. \nSafire's column ``Yeltsin's Tiananmen,'' be printed in the Record in \nfull.\nThe column follows:\n[[Page S1242]]\n                          Yeltsin's Tiananmen\n\n       Washington.--Which great power is more unstable today--\n     China or Russia?\n       The quick answer, of course, is Russia. The elected leader, \n     Boris Yeltsin, is besieged in Moscow after his bloody siege \n     of Grozny, capital of the Connecticut-sized breakaway \n     republic of Chechnya.\n       Russian television showed vivid pictures of the bombing of \n     that city even as it showed Yeltsin saying it wasn't so; then \n     the cameras showed Yeltsin upbraiding his Defense Minister \n     for making him look like a liar.\n       As Helmut Kohl telephoned to tell him that world opinion \n     frowns on the savage method his Russia Federation is using to \n     preserve its borders, Bill Clinton wrote a ``Dear Boris'' \n     letter reaffirming support of Federation unity but stressing \n     how ``distressed'' he is at civilian deaths and suggesting \n     mediation by an organization of 53 nations.\n       What's Yeltsin to do? The Chechens are dead serious about \n     secession. If Russia lets Chechnya go, other Causasian \n     dominoes will fall and Moscow will be denied the Caspian oil \n     it needs to rule a hundred nationalities across 11 time \n     zones.\n       He tried negotiation, which was met by a declaration of \n     independence; he tried an internal coup, which flopped; now \n     he's trying force, which is bringing world obloquy on his \n     head because the Chechens are fiercely fighting for their \n     homeland and the Russian Army has no heart for a lengthy \n     guerrilla battle, especially after its loss in Afghanistan.\n       All that--added to Yeltsin's personal punchiness and \n     isolation--is why Russia appears unstable. We tend to equate \n     the future of democracy with the future of Yeltsin, who is on \n     his last leg.\n       But consider the political miracle taking place in Moscow \n     today. An unpopular and unjust war is being denounced in the \n     Parliament, with reformer Grigory Yavlinsky, openly calling \n     for Yeltsin's resignation. The military is publicly divided \n     between conscience-stricken warriors and hard-line \n     incompetents. Free speech is spilling out all over.\n       The newspapers, after centuries of czarist and Communist \n     docility, are crusading: a picture of Defense Minister Pavel \n     Grachev is captioned ``the most talentless commander in \n     Russia.'' And the television crews are bringing home the \n     horror of the war just as American cameramen did in Vietnam, \n     with similar impact on Russian public opinion.\n       This is wonderful. The world should be proud of the Russian \n     people, who should be prouder of themselves for exercising \n     their new-found freedom to debate a great issue.\n       Contrast that democratic turmoil to the facade of \n     ``stability'' in China. With the death of Deng Xiaoping \n     imminent, the leadership is cracking down on dissidents.\n       By jailing its leading independent thinkers, the regime in \n     Bejing reveals its inherent weakness. The new imprisonment of \n     the courageous Wei Jingsheng, China's Sakharov, was the tip-\n     off that the leadership fears a popular uprising, this time \n     led by angry workers rather than idealistic students. As Deng \n     sinks, the number of panicky arrests rises.\n       This demonstrates again that succession in a Communist \n     state is a ruthless wrestle for power within an impenetrable \n     clique. It mocks the assurances of China's Western apologists \n     that a market economy leads to political freedom.\n       In a litchi nutshell, here's the play:\n       Yang Shangkun, an old army leader whose powerful family was \n     neutralized by Deng, is close to Adm. Liu Huaqing, the \n     nation's top military leader. They may challenge Deng's \n     proteges, party boss Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng, \n     by backing economic chief, Zhu Rongji, or promoting a next-\n     generation politician, Hu Jintao, or by backing Qiao Shi, the \n     former national security adviser and now chairman of the \n     rubber-stamp People's Congress, hereinafter known as \n     ``China's Newt Gingrich.''\n       What do 1.2 billion Chinese have to say about all this? \n     Zilch. (Analysts in Bejing, aware of the exclusive accuracy \n     of my prediction of Mao's successor in the 70's, will have to \n     puzzle out ``zilch.'') And therein lies real instability.\n       A monolithic, totalitarian state, repressing the spirit of \n     freedom, only seems secure; we have seen how it can suddenly \n     collapse. A noisy, unruly democratic state, drawing on the \n     legitimacy of free elections, is more secure--no matter how \n     shaky the leadership. That's why Russia is in better \n     political shape than China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1241-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1242-S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1990\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join as a \ncosponsor of legislation to require that the Environmental Protection \nAgency allow States to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act as \nintended by Congress by pursuing options that best meet their own \ncircumstances.\n  As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works during \nthe development of the Clean Air Act in 1990, I can confirm that it was \nrecognized that the requirements for an enhanced inspection and \nmaintenance program would require some States to modify their current \nemission test and repair programs. It was our full intention, however, \nto allow States to operate a decentralized automobile emissions \ninspection and maintenance program to meet the requirements of the act.\n  In developing regulations to implement the enhanced I program, EPA \ndid not follow the direction of the Congress and provisions of the \nstatute. Instead, EPA mandated that States operate a centralized \ntesting program by giving States only 50 percent credit toward \nachieving the 15-percent reduction in emissions if they elected to \nsponsor a decentralized program.\n  As States have attempted to work with EPA to develop emission \nreduction plans that would comply with the act, it has become clear \nthat the Agency is mandating that States implement only one approach. \nThis inflexible approach limits the ability of our States to pursue \nprograms unique to their circumstances. Mr. President, I believe that \nencouraging States to devise their own programs with assistance from \nthe Federal Government is the crucial element in whether any Federal \nprogram is successful or not. As EPA has consistently demanded a \ncentralized testing program which uses the very costly IM-240 \nequipment, the program is on the brink of failure. States are \noverwhelmingly rejecting EPA's version of an enhanced I program, \nconsumers are losing confidence in the benefits of an automobile \nemissions program and valuable resources are being wasted.\n  Mr. President, there is more than one way to ensure that we achieve \nthe maximum amount of automobile emissions reductions in our fight to \nimprove air quality, but EPA is threatening States with the loss of \ncritical highway funds unless States do it only their way.\n  Mr. President, that is not what the law says and that is not what our \nStates should be required to do.\n  The Clean Air Act specifically allows for States to demonstrate to \nthe satisfaction of the Administrator that a decentralized program will \nbe equally effective to a centralized testing program. In the case of \nmy State, Virginia has been repeatedly denied the opportunity by EPA to \nshow that their revised decentralized test and repair program would be \nas effective as a centralized program in meeting air quality standards.\n\n  Since early last year, Virginia has attempted to work with EPA to \ndevelop a program that would bring the northern Virginia area into \ncompliance with air quality standards. Unfortunately, EPA has been less \nconcerned with the results of my State's emissions reduction plan, than \nwith the process Virginia chooses to achieve these results.\n  In an effort to comply with the Clean Air Act, Virginia has presented \ntwo plans. The first plan was rejected by EPA because it included a \ndecentralized test and repair program with operator certification and \nmore enforcement, as opposed to a fully centralized program operated by \nState employees or State-hired contractors. The second plan which \nVirginia has offered has been the subject of extensive discussions, but \nno final resolution. The last meeting occurred on October 20, 1994, \nbetween EPA and Virginia with EPA pledging to respond to the State's \nproposal. To date, EPA has not responded.\n  During this time, Virginia has operated under a regulatory \ndetermination known as a protective finding for transportation \nconformity. This designation allows transportation projects to go \nforward on the assumption that Virginia will soon have an approved \nemissions reduction plan.\n  Time is short, Mr. President, and our protective finding expires this \nmonth. The EPA has repeatedly stated that, without an approved plan, \nVirginia would be subject to the loss of over $378 million in annual \nhighway funds which Virginia drivers have paid into the highway trust \nfund. Also, any new transportation projects proposed for addition to \nour Transportation Improvement Program until Virginia's 15 percent \nemissions reduction plan is approved.\n  These are significant penalties because it means that new major \nhighway plans or modifications to existing plans cannot go forward. Not \nonly would approval for Federal projects be denied, State and local \napprovals for [[Page S1243]] projects on larger roads would be \nprohibited.\n  Mr. President, northern Virginia, an area already choking on traffic \ngridlock that paralyzes our lives daily and results in a tremendous \nloss of economic productivity, must not suffer from EPA's bureaucratic \ninflexibility. Should EPA repeal Virginia's protective finding, 138 \nmillion dollar's worth of northern Virginia projects in 1995 alone \nwould be impacted.\n  Mr. President, these are extremely harsh penalties that bear no \nrelationship to the issues at hand. Virginia has committed to improving \nair quality to meet the Federal standards. We only ask that we be \npermitted as provided in the law to select the most cost effective \noptions that will achieve these important goals.\n  As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues so that we can take prompt action \non this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1242-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COL. SETH WARNER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nConnecticut's great Revolutionary War heroes, Col. Seth Warner. \nTragically, the accomplishments of this extraordinary American have not \nbeen properly heralded by history, and I believe the time is past due \nfor us to honor him. I salute the dedication of Edward S. Caco, Jr., of \nRoxbury, CT, in researching and recognizing the Colonel's great work \nand life. I have set forth below a discussion of Colonel Warner's life \nprepared by Mr. Caco. I can only hope this entry, by Mr. Caco, \ndescribing the importance of the Colonel's contribution to American \nindependence, helps to bring the recognition he deserves. I sincerely \nthank Mr. Caco for his fine work on Colonel Warner's life.\n\n       * * * Colonel Seth Warner was born in Roxbury on the 17th \n     day of May, 1743. As a man, he was over six feet tall, and \n     was courageous and commanding. Engaged in the controversy \n     with New York, he was fully prepared to engage in our \n     Revolutionary struggle. He was personally present in many \n     engagements in the northern colonies. It has been reported \n     that General Washington relied especially upon Colonel Ethan \n     Allen and Colonel Seth Warner [who were cousins], considering \n     them as among the most active, daring, and trustworthy of \n     this officers.\n       Not long after the victories of Ticonderoga and Crown \n     Point, Seth Warner was appointed as a Delegate to the \n     Continental Congress. Shortly thereafter, he was enrolled as \n     part of the regular Continental Army. Seth Warner was \n     appointed the Commander of the regiment by the officers and \n     men, who felt that his calm and wise judgment would serve \n     them best in the serious business of war that lie ahead.\n       It was at Longueil Canada in 1775 that Colonel Warner \n     fought a rear guard action against the advancing enemy, \n     covering the retreat of General Sullivan. The retreat became \n     a route and it was Colonel Warner that protected the rear and \n     brought up the sick and wounded. The stricken and defeated \n     army made its way to the safety of Crown Point, and later on \n     to Ticonderoga. Though the Colonel was successful in carrying \n     out his orders, it was this flight from the enemy forces \n     which broke his iron constitution and began the malady that \n     would eventually take this life.\n       Several months later in July of 1776, Seth was again called \n     upon to fight a rear guard action to cover the retreat of \n     General St. Clair's forces from Ticonderoga. At Hubbardton, \n     along with units from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, the \n     Colonel made a stand against a combined unit of British and \n     Hessian forces. During this engagement the Massachusetts unit \n     scattered, and the New Hampshire unit surrendered, leaving \n     Colonel Warner and his men to stand alone. Though his unit \n     was forced off the field, Colonel Warner was entirely \n     successful in the duties to which he was assigned. * * * In \n     spite of his failing health, the Colonel carried out his \n     orders, led his men into battle, and was to have no rest as \n     Burhoyne was on the march.\n       In August of 1777, General Stark was engaging the Hessians \n     of Burgoyne's command at Bennington. The first action had \n     been fought and the Hessians were already winning the day. A \n     powerful enemy reinforcement was taking to the field when \n     Seth arrived with his regiment. General Stark ordered Seth to \n     ride on the line and order a retreat into the middle of \n     Bennington. Seth refused that order, much to General Stark's \n     surprise, stating instead that he was certain that he could \n     get his men into action on the ground. General Stark agreed \n     and the day was won. Once again it was Colonel Seth Warner's \n     fiery courage and steady judgment that had turned the tide of \n     the battle. General Stark stated in his report to General \n     Washington, ``Colonel Warner's strategy and judgment was of \n     extraordinary service to me.'' In recognition of his valor \n     and service, Seth was promoted to the full rank of Colonel.\n       It has been said that if Seth had retired from the service \n     at this time, he may have to a certain extent retained his \n     health. However, with Seth the needs of his burgeoning \n     country always took precedence over his own welfare, as well \n     as the needs of his own family. With failing health, Seth \n     continued to fight the ravages of the Indians and the ever \n     present Tories. Not one to remain idle for any length of \n     time, Seth led a scouting party in 1780. It was on this \n     mission that Seth was ambushed by the Indians. In the melee \n     of battle the two officers by his side were killed and Seth \n     received two bullets through his arm. This was the end of \n     Colonel Seth Warner's active military career.\n       He retired to his Vermont residence for two years to \n     recuperate. In 1783 Seth returned to his native Roxbury and \n     established a homestead. Still in a great deal of pain from \n     his wounds and malady, Seth spent time by the seashore hoping \n     that this would give him some respite. This was to prove \n     fruitless, and he returned to his home where he lingered in \n     suffering and delirium for several months. At times neighbors \n     were needed to assist in his care. Finally, on December 26, \n     1784, Colonel Seth Warner was relieved of his pain and \n     suffering through his merciful death. * * *\n\n  The entry on Colonel Warner's tombstone well summarizes his life.\n\nIn Memory of Colonel Seth Warner, Esq., Who Departed This Life December \n          26th, A.D. 1784.

Mr. President, all of us watched with agony while a \n19-year-old, Nahshon Wachsman, was captured, made a public plea for his \nlife, and then was slain.\n  People on the Palestinian side, the Israeli side and people of every \nreligious persuasion were hoping and praying that his life would be \nspared. But it was not.\n  How do parents face such a tragedy?\n  The Jerusalem Report has a story about Nahshon's parents. Because it \nhas both the international dimension, and lessons about how to face \ngrief and pain, I ask to insert it into the Record at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From The Jerusalem Report, Dec. 1, 1994]\n\n                            Ordinary Heroes\n\n   (A month after his son was executed by Hamas kidnappers, only the \n  unshakeable faith of Nahshon Wachsman's parents is enabling them to \n                         cope with their grief)\n\n                        (By Yossi Klein Halevi)\n\n       Yehudah and Esther Wachsman's phone doesn't stop ringing. \n     The Jewish National Fund wants to plant a forest in memory of \n     their 19-year-old son, Nahshon, kidnapped and killed by Hamas \n     terrorists in October. A Jerusalem religious school wants \n     Esther and Yehudah to address its students about the dangers \n     of religious extremism. The Kfar Saba municipality wants them \n     as guests of honor at a rally for national unity.\n       Families afflicted by terror attacks are usually considered \n     victims, not heroes. Yet the Wachsmans, whose quiet dignity \n     during the kidnapping ordeal riveted the country, have become \n     symbols of strength--at a time when Israelis fear that their \n     ethos of courage is slowly being sapped by exhaustion and \n     prosperity. Rabbis who came to the Wachsmans to impart \n     religious inspiration were instead inspired by their faith; \n     Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss and the commander of the Golani \n     infantry brigade in which Nahshon served emerged from the \n     Wachsman home repeating virtually the same words: We came to \n     strengthen the Wachsmans, but were instead strengthened by \n     them.\n       Yehudah, in a knitted yarmulke and sandals, and Esther, in \n     a beret and denim skirt, shattered the stereotype of the \n     Israeli Orthodox Jew as extremist and intolerant. Esther \n     appealed to her son's kidnappers to remember that they all \n     worshiped the same God; and the army's failed attempt to \n     rescue Nahshon, Yehudah thanked the Muslims and Christians \n     who had prayed for his son, and offered to meet with the \n     parents of Nahshon's killers. And despite anonymous right-\n     wing callers demanding that he stay away, Yehudah accepted an \n     Israeli government invitation and attended the signing \n     ceremony for the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, just days \n     after he completed the shivah mourning period for Nahshon.\n       The Wachsmans managed to emotionally unite the country, \n     however briefly, in a way it hadn't know in years. Tens \n     of thousands of Israelis, from secularists to ultra-\n     Orthodox, joined prayer services for Nahshon's safety and \n     lit an extra Sabbath candle on the Friday night that he \n     died. Weeks after Nahshon's death, thousands of letters \n     are still coming to the Wachsman home in Jerusalem's Ramot \n     neighborhood--not only from [[Page S1244]] Israelis but \n     from people around the world, many sending poems and taped \n     messages of support.\n       The Wachsmans insist they are ordinary people; and indeed, \n     the middle-aged, modern Orthodox couple are unlikely heroes. \n     Yehudah and Esther, both 47, are short, sturdy, wide-faced. \n     Yehudah, with a long graying beard, paunch and piercing eyes, \n     speaks with an intensity softened by ironic humor. Esther's \n     little-girl voice--callers for Yehudah often ask her if her \n     father is home--is deliberately calm: The mother of seven \n     sons, she learned to keep steady through the chaos of daily \n     life.\n       Yehudah and Esther are both children of Holocaust \n     survivors; and that experience affected them in very \n     different ways. Yehudah grew up in Romania and moved to \n     Israel at age 11. The war destroyed his father, who became \n     closed and bitter. ``I saw what anger could do to a person,'' \n     says Yehudah. ``And I decided that if I ever experienced \n     tragedy, I would react in the opposite way from my father.''\n       Life provided him with opportunities to fulfill that \n     challenge. One of their sons, 8-year-old Rafael, has Down's \n     syndrome. Yehudah himself lived for years on dialysis, \n     finally undergoing a kidney transplant four years ago which \n     forced him to quit his job as a math teacher and work from \n     his home, selling real estate. Yehudah thought of his father, \n     a broken, silent man shuffling between work and home; and \n     refused to be bitter.\n       Esther grew up in Flatbush, cherished daughter of Polish \n     survivors. ``I was the national treasure, the consolation,'' \n     she says, with a wry smile. ``I was never allowed to be \n     unhappy. The rule of the house was: Never tell me upsetting \n     news. And of course I wouldn't say anything that would upset \n     my parents.''\n       Indeed, just after Nahshon's death, Esther had one \n     overriding thought: that her 83-year-old father, silenced by \n     a stroke and living in Queens, mustn't be told. ``The same \n     business: Don't upset them.''\n       Esther says that, as a teenager, she was a ``typical JAP. \n     If I wore the pink dress on Tuesday that meant I couldn't \n     wear it for another week.'' But then her life changed when \n     she visited Israel in 1967, and fell in love with the \n     country. Back in New York, where she was studying to be a \n     teacher, she felt like a hypocrite, praying for a return to \n     Zion when Zion was so easily accessible. In 1970, she \n     returned to Jerusalem, and got a job helping run a Jewish \n     Agency summer camp for American teenagers. One of the camp \n     counselors was Yehudah Wachsman. Four months later, they \n     married.\n       Becoming the mother of soldiers--Nachshon and his two older \n     brothers all served in Lebanon--forced Esther to confront \n     mortality, and reconsider the values on which she was raised. \n     ``I spent years glued to the radio, waiting for news,'' she \n     says. ``Living in Israel made it impossible for me to remain \n     what I was.''\n       Less than a month after the tragedy, the atmosphere in the \n     Wachsman home is deliberately normal. Friends drop by, \n     everyone speaks in conversational tones, the Wachsman boys \n     exchange small jokes. Immediately after the shivah, each of \n     the boys individually approached Esther and Yehudah and said: \n     Let's not allow this home to turn gloomy. ``I realized I had \n     no choice but to go on,'' says Esther. The boys were sent \n     back to school, and Esther resumed her job teaching English \n     at the elite Hebrew University High School. Most of all, the \n     family has tried to maintain the home's relaxed atmosphere--a \n     place where friends of the Wachsman boys feel so comfortable \n     that over the years some have virtually moved in.\n       Even now, grief doesn't suppress the good-natured teasing \n     that marks Esther and Yehudah's relationship. When they \n     discuss their political positions with me--he supports the \n     peace process with reservations, she opposes it with \n     reservations--they pretend to be exasperated with each other. \n     Esther: ``My husband is unique, there is no one else with \n     quite his point of view.'' Yehudah: ``If she says so, it must \n     be true.'' Then they smile: They are amused, not annoyed, by \n     their differences.\n       Inevitably, though, the home bears traces of the ordeal. A \n     table in a corner is piled with prayer books and yarmulkes: \n     During the week of the kidnapping, there was non-stop \n     communal praying here. On a makeshift charity box are written \n     words urging those who place money into it to say a prayer \n     for Nahshon's safe return. And mounted on the breakfront is a \n     picture of Nahshon, smiling and wearing a T-shirt with the \n     words: ``I've been drafted.''\n       Esther manages a smile when speaking of Nahshon. ``He was \n     in an elite unit, the shortest, thinnest kid among big, \n     brawny fellows. They called him the baby of the unit. But he \n     was the one who encouraged them in Lebanon. They used to say \n     to him, `Nahshon, this is hell, wipe that smile off your \n     face.' And he'd say, `Everything will be okay, let's just do \n     our job.'\n       ``Nahshon epitomized non-conflict. He couldn't stand it \n     when his brothers fought. If his parents argued about \n     something, he'd say, `Is it really so important?'''\n       Esther and Yehudah see that quality of peacemaking as a \n     hint of Nahshon's destiny. Everyone has a mission in life, \n     they believe; and since the kidnapping created such a \n     powerful sense of unity among Israelis, perhaps that was \n     related to Nahshon's mission.\n       Esther says that, during the entire week of the kidnapping, \n     she was certain that Nahshon would return alive, that the \n     out-pouring of prayer around the country would somehow \n     protect him. She doesn't believe those prayers were wasted. \n     ``Prayers don't get lost. Jews prayed for 2,000 years to \n     return to Israel. Our generation made it back. Eventually the \n     time comes for the fulfillment of prayers. The soldiers who \n     tried to save Nahshon could have all been killed--maybe the \n     prayers protected them.''\n       She rejects self-pity as firmly as religious doubt. ``I \n     don't ask: `Why me? Why anyone?' Look how many people lost \n     entire families in the Holocaust. You pick yourself up and go \n     on. That's part of Jewish history.''\n       In fact, both Esther's and Yehudah's fathers lost their \n     first wives and some of their children in the Holocaust. And \n     though neither says so, it is clear that their parents' \n     ability to create new families after the war has strengthened \n     their own life-force.\n       But for all their optimism and faith, the Wachsmans have an \n     account to settle with God. Esther: ``When Yehuah was on \n     dialysis, I said to God, `This is as bad as it can get.' Then \n     my son Rafael was born with Down's syndrome and I said, `OK, \n     God, You can't do anything worse to me than this.' When \n     Nahshon died, I thought, `You really did do something worse.'\n       ``I work with non-believing people. They think I'm \n     protected from pain by my faith. But the grief is just as \n     severe; the only thing faith does is keep me sane. I`d break \n     down if I didn't believe there was some master plan, that \n     every person was put on Earth for a purpose. But''--her voice \n     turns to an emphatic, almost angry whisper--``it does not \n     lessen the pain.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/19/senate-section/article/S1243-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1244-S1246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO JUDGE GILBERT CALVIN STEINDORFF, JR., RETIRED PROBATE JUDGE \n                          IN BUTLER COUNTY, AL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Judge Gilbert \nCalvin Steindorff, Jr., retired probate judge in Butler County, AL. \nJudge Steindorff dedicated his life to the service of the citizens of \nButler County and for that we are eternally grateful.\n  Judge Steindorff's first service to his country was a tour of duty in \nthe Army during World War II. In February 1946, he returned to Butler \nCounty to help his father run the family business. Not long after his \nreturn from France he married Maxine Darby, his wife of nearly 50 \nyears. The couple has one son, Gilbert Calvin Steindorff III, who lives \nin Montgomery with his wife Debbie and Calvin's grandson, Gilbert \nCalvin Steindorff IV.\n  In February 1947, after selling the family business, his service to \nthe citizens of Butler County began. With the support of many \ninfluential people in the county, he was chosen from a field of eight \napplicant to replace Butler County Tax Assessor Frank Herlong at the \nyoung age of 21. He served at this post for the next 28 years.\n  In 1975, then Probate Judge James T. Beeland became ill and would not \nresign until he was sure Calvin Steindorff would take his place. Calvin \nhas been there ever since. He was well known throughout Greenville and \nButler County as one who is ready to listen and eager to help with \neverything including road work and garbage pickup. His desk was always \nneat and his demeanor cheerful. The people of the county warmly refer \nto him as ``Judge.''\n  Judge Steindorff called his office his second home and is not sure \nhow he will spend his time now that he does not head for the Butler \nCounty Courthouse at the crack of dawn every morning. He may spend more \ntime fishing, woodworking, and working on his antique clock collection, \nbut it is certain that many will miss seeing the ``Judge'' regularly on \nthe streets on downtown Greenville.\n  Judge Gilbert Calvin Steindorff, Jr. has spent his life serving the \npeople of Butler County with devotion, commitment, and selflessness. He \nis an example to us all.\nH\n[[Page S1245]]\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, FOR TRAVEL FROM JULY 1 TO SEPT. 30, 1994                                                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n                     Name and country                             Name of currency          Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator J.
