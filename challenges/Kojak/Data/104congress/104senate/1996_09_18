The answers \nlead us to an authentic attitude for profound prayer:\n  ``Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, measured \nheaven with a span and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure? \nWeighed the mountains and the hills in a balance? Who has directed the \nSpirit of the Lord, or as His counselor has taught Him? With whom did \nHe take counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him the path of \njustice? Who taught Him knowledge, and showed him the way of \nunderstanding?''--Isaiah 40:12-14.\n  Almighty God, these questions expose the shallowness of our \nunderstanding of prayer. So often we come to You in prayer as if it \nwere our responsibility to brief You on world affairs or current \nnational problems. Or we come to prayer with our shopping list of needs \nas if You did not know all about us. And then there are times we try to \nget You to bless our plans about which we never consulted You.\n  Father, You created prayer for us to be with You, to know You, to \nhave our characters emulate Your character, and, most of all, to be \nfilled with Your spirit. So we humble ourselves. Instead of telling You \nwhat to do, we open ourselves completely to receive Your marching \norders and to follow You. In the name of the One who taught us to pray, \n``Not my will but Yours be done.'' Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10729-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning, there will be a period of \nmorning business until the hour of 11 a.m., and the first 45 minutes of \nmorning business will be under the control of Senator Hutchison, and \nthe second 45 minutes will be under the control of Senator Daschle, or \nhis designee.\n  Following morning business at 11 a.m., the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 1994, the FAA reauthorization bill. A unanimous-\nconsent agreement limiting amendments to that bill was reached last \nnight. Also under the order, all amendments listed must be filed at the \ndesk by 11 a.m. this morning. It is hoped that most of those amendments \ncan be agreed to or not be offered at all.\n  Upon disposition of the FAA bill, the Senate will be asked to turn to \nthe consideration of the conference report to accompany the \nTransportation appropriations bill, if available, or the Magnuson \nfisheries bill under a previous consent agreement. In any case, there \nwill probably be rollcall votes throughout the day, and Senators should \nexpect those votes.\n  I am pleased with the progress that has been made on the FAA \nreauthorization bill. The Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and the \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, have been working very hard on \nthis. We need to get this done. In fact, we need to get it completed \nand we need to do it quickly so we can move on to other bills we need \nto get done. If we don't get this FAA reauthorization bill completed, \nthere will be a prohibition at the end of the year on use of the \nairport trust fund. So we absolutely have to get it done.\n  Also, I would like to make sure Senators are aware that we are \nconsidering moving to other conference reports when they are available. \nWe are also considering taking up, perhaps on tomorrow and Thursday, \nthe maritime legislation from the Commerce Committee that will be \nmanaged by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and we are now \nbeginning to see if we can clear the way on both sides of the aisle to \ntake up the pipeline safety legislation, something, once again, we \nreally need to do. Certainly, in America, we should make sure we have a \nprogram and plan for our pipelines being safe.\n  Until we see if we can work out some understanding that we can do our \nappropriations bills without a lot of delay or extraneous amendments, \nwe will move forward on making progress on these other bills, these \nother issues. I had hoped we could get all of the appropriations bills \ndone in regular order, but that has not been the case on the last two \nbills. Rather than just a squabble back and forth, I thought we could \ngo on and do the people's business in other areas. I think we can do a \nlot of good work in that area over the next 3 or 4 days.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10729-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10729-S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the reason that I asked for the time \nthis morning is I think we have a very crucial decision that is being \nmade right now in our Nation's Capital, and that is how much we are \ngoing to fund the defense of our country. In fact, Congress is in a \ndispute with the President, as we speak, about how much we should spend \nto defend our Nation.\n  I find it ironic, if not sad, that as 3,500 of our American troops \nare on their way to Kuwait right this minute that the President would \nbe threatening to veto the Defense appropriations bill if $2 to $3 \nbillion is not cut from that bill.\n  Our troops are on their way, possibly for a conflict. We hope not. \nBut, as you know, as the distinguished Presiding Officer is the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the President pro tempore \nof the Senate, this is not the time to let down our defenses. This is \nnot the time to say that we should be shifting valuable weapons systems \nfor the protection of our troops and for their ability to protect the \ninterests of the United States into unnamed other programs--social \nprograms, perhaps education programs.\n  I don't know what the President has in mind. But I do know that the \nPresident of the United States is today saying he will veto an \nappropriations bill for the Defense Department at the same time that he \nis ratcheting up a conflict in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, several people would like to speak on this issue. I \nhave more to say, but at this time, I am going to yield to my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, Larry Craig.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have comments that will take probably up \nto about 8 minutes. The Senator from Arizona is with us, and I \nunderstand he has a scheduling conflict, so I will be more than happy \nto yield to him.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, who has provided so much leadership in our Nation's \ndefenses, and ask how long, approximately, he would like.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inform the Senator from Texas, probably \nabout 5 minutes, if that is acceptable.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is acceptable. Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, let me say the Senator from \nTexas is to be complimented for beginning this very important \ndiscussion which I think, frankly, is going to have to go on for some \ntime here until we can get this matter resolved.\n  It boils down to something very, very simple. On the one hand, you \nhave the administration making substantial international commitments \nfor the deployment and use of American military forces which will cost \nbillions of dollars of money, and, at the same time, you have the \nadministration suggesting that unless the Congress is willing to take \nmoney from the defense budget and spend it on other things that the \nPresident wants, there is the possibility of a Presidential veto of the \ndefense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, we have been, I think, appropriately discreet here in \nthis body in sharing our views on international policy, especially as \nit relates to the Middle East and the President's action in Iraq. We \npassed a resolution here overwhelmingly supporting the action that the \nadministration took and supporting our troops in Iraq. We have not gone \nout of our way to criticize the President's policy there, even though \nmany of us have grave concerns and questions about where that policy is \nleading us.\n  But when it comes to passing the defense authorization and defense \nappropriations bill, this body has a responsibility to ensure that our \nmilitary forces have what they need to carry out these commitments. And \nnobody, Mr. President, more than you, as the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, has fought harder over the years to ensure \nthat our troops have what they need.\n  I remember that after the Persian Gulf war was over and everyone was \npassing out compliments to Secretary Cheney and to President Bush and \nto the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, they all \npointed out that what won that war was the character and skill of our \nmen and women who were fighting there and the decisions that were made \n10 or 12 years before by the Senate, by the House, and by the \nadministrations at that time to begin the research and development of \nthe smart weapons and other weapons that we used in the Persian Gulf \nwar. That is what enabled us to win that war quickly and with a minimum \nof casualties.\n  Now we are again engaged in conflict in Iraq, and we are again using \nthose same weapons, and at the same time the President is suggesting \nthat we have to cut the defense budget because he wants to spend more \nmoney in other areas. I remind my colleagues that last year we added \nmoney back into the defense bill to buy Tomahawk missiles, more than \nthe President requested. He did not request that money. We said, you \nare going to have to buy more Tomahawk missiles because that is what we \nare going to need if we have another conflict in the Middle East. And \nwhat happened? We had another challenge from Saddam Hussein, and the \nPresident ordered the firing of Tomahawk missiles. I am glad that the \nSenate disagreed with the President on that last year, added that money \nin, and we had those Tomahawk missiles ready to go to fight this \nconflict.\n  Now we have the same issue again. Are we going to be permitted to \nproperly fund the military forces? What we are suggesting is still far \nless than the military was provided last year. So this is not an \nincrease over last year's spending. It is less money. It is more money \nthan the President requested, and that is because we have identified \nsome areas in which we think the administration's request was \ndeficient, just as it was with the Tomahawk missiles last year.\n  Mr. President, it boils down to this. I have a lot of statistics here \nand might ask for unanimous consent to submit some matters in writing \nthat gets into the specifics, but I know that my other colleagues here \nwish to add their voices to this concern. So I am just going to make \nthis statement very generally.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis statistical information and related material.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [Press release from the House Appropriations Committee]\n\n   Livingston to Clinton: Now Is Not the Time To Further Cut Defense\n\n       Washington, DC.--Charging that President Clinton is putting \n     the nation's servicemen and women at risk overseas, House \n     Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-LA) urged \n     the President to reconsider reports that his Administration \n     is now seeking $3 billion in additional cuts to the defense \n     bill.\n       ``Further cuts to the defense bill will mean less medical \n     care funding for military personnel, a weakening of the drug \n     war, and an inability to relocate troops in Saudi Arabia. If \n     the President wants $3 billion more cut from the defense \n     budget, he should present our committee with a list of cuts \n     and we'll be happy to consider them.\n       The defense conference report added nearly a half billion \n     dollars to the President's request for medical care, which \n     was cut in the Clinton Budget; added $600 million to the \n     President's request for barracks and base repair; and added \n     $165 million to the President's request for drug interdiction \n     and counter-drug activities.\n       ``President Clinton claims Congress wants to spend $10 \n     billion more than he wants, but he won't admit that he asked \n     for $10 billion less than last year's funding level for \n     defense. This cut comes at a time when our nation's military \n     is preparing for a new round of bombing in Iraq; facing more \n     than $100 million in costs for troop relocation in Saudi \n     Arabia; and underfunding Bosnia by more than $200 million to \n     date. It is a bad time to cut defense, yet that's all the \n     Commander-In-Chief offers in relation to negotiations on \n     unfinished appropriations bills,'' said Livingston.\n       Even more disconcerting is the fact that the President \n     holds the Defense Appropriations bill hostage to more \n     spending cuts,\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n     while he vows to sign to the $265.6 billion Defense \n     Authorization bill (which actually authorizes more funding \n     that the appropriation bills spends). When adjusted for \n     inflation, defense spending actually declines between FY96 \n     and FY97 marking the twelfth consecutive year defense \n     spending has come down.\n       ``I am simply amazed that the President thinks he can dupe \n     the American public into thinking that he is pro-defense by \n     signing the authorization bill, while threatening to veto the \n     legislation that actually pays the defense bills. The \n     President's veto would deny a 3% pay raise for military \n     personnel, deny funding for a half billion dollar shortfall \n     created in the President's request for medical programs, and \n     deny essential upgrades to our nation's aging weapons \n     systems, which the President's own Joint Chief of Staff say \n     falls more than $100 billion short over the next five \n     years,'' said Livingston.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Another Clinton Foreign Policy Failure--Crisis in Iraq Worsens\n\n       On August 31, 1996, Saddam Hussein sent 40,000 troops to \n     seize the northern Kurdish city of Irbil.\n       The U.S. responded to this with cruise missiles in the \n     South and by extending the ``no fly.''\n       Clinton declares this a success.\n       Rhetoric (declared victory) is inconsistent with the \n     reality in the region.\n       Hussein has expanded his power over the whole Kurdish \n     region.\n       A major CIA-funded effort to destabilize Saddam is \n     virtually defunct.\n       The Gulf War international coalition is fractured. Kuwait \n     balks at accepting U.S. troops and few voice opposition to \n     Saddam's moves.\n       The 1991 humanitarian relief program is in shambles.\n       If the President is serious about achieving what he \n     believes are U.S. goals, he must act now to set his case \n     before the American people and to include their elected \n     representatives in the Congress in his deliberations. \n     Anything less would be a major failure of leadership.\n       3500 (not 5000) Fort Hood troops are enroute to Kuwait \n     beginning this morning.\n       23 F-16s will go to Bahrain to help enforce the ``no-fly'' \n     zone.\n       8 F-117 Sealth Bombers are in Kuwait with 4 B-52s at Diego \n     Garcia.\n       Within days, the force will include 2 aircraft carriers \n     with more than 150 Navy aircraft and more than 20 other \n     warships and submarines.\n       Actions thus far are a replay of Administration actions in \n     previous events, e.g., Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, all of which \n     are unraveling or failing to meet original administration \n     promises.\n       No notification by the Administration.\n       No consultation with Congress.\n       No strategic goals/objectives presented to the American \n     people.\n       Failure to state what actions Hussein must take to satisfy \n     the U.S.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Just to summarize it this way, nothing is more important than the \ndefense of our country and ensuring that when the Commander in Chief \ngives the order for our young men and women to go into combat, to risk \ntheir lives, that ensuring that they have the means of achieving their \nmissions in the safest way possible.\n  As I read a couple days ago about the first F-111 pilot at the \nbeginning of the gulf war, on the very first night, who had to fly \nthrough the flak over Baghdad, he drew the lucky straw, or the unlucky \nstraw, as it may be. He and his wing man told the story about how the \nnight was black, it was eerie, but he could see the lights of Baghdad \nin the distance. And he said, as he got closer, it looked like a big \nfireworks display, there was so much flak over that city. He knew he \nhad to fly through that. But he had the training and he had the \nequipment because we provided it, and he got through in good shape and \nperformed his mission.\n  We can never shortchange the men and women that we send into combat \nwithout adequate equipment. That is why it is so important that the \nPresident get on board here and agree with us to fund the military to \nthe degree that is necessary, to the degree that your committee has \nrecommended.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 10 minutes of our time to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Texas for \nrequesting this morning business and special order to talk about not \nonly the situation of Defense appropriations, but the impending foreign \npolicy crisis in this country. And as we begin to look seriously, Mr. \nPresident, at ending this legislative session and completing our work, \nthere are some remaining appropriations bills that simply must be dealt \nwith in a fair and honest way to effectively close down the Congress. \nOne of those is the 1996 Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  In short, Mr. President, saber rattling by this administration has \noccurred in places other than Iraq. Recent indications that President \nClinton will veto the bill that the Senators from Arizona and Texas and \nI are talking about this morning, which provides funding to our \nNation's armed services--including the current deployment in the gulf \nand those now preparing to respond to the President's call of another \n3,500 troops to be deployed, and who may well be in the air at this \nmoment headed for Kuwait--is, to me, a position that our President \nshould find unconscionable, but yet at this very moment the message \ncoming out of the White House is, veto Defense authorization.\n  The brave men and women serving this Nation and protecting our \nsecurity and the Nation's interests should not be turned into pawns for \nPresidential election politics. I cannot begin to express my \nfrustration over this situation because the timing for this President \nand his political agenda appears to be extraordinary. Therefore, I hope \nthe President will respond by indicating his support for our Armed \nForces and his willingness to sign this critical piece of legislation.\n  The deployment of our troops does not occur without cost. The Senator \nfrom Arizona has already referenced that very effectively. The \nPresident has deployed U.S. forces widely in peacekeeping efforts, and \nit is time to respond in kind by paying for it. That is what the \nAmerican public would expect of a Commander in Chief.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like also to take a moment to again address \nsome of the concerns that I mentioned last Friday in the press about \nthe ongoing situation in Iraq, because it is fair to talk about that \nsituation in the context of Defense appropriations, all in one \nstatement, because they fit so well together. As I have said, they \nclash at this moment in what appears to be a Presidential political \nagenda that just does not fit.\n  What is our policy? What is our mission? What is our goal in Iraq? It \nis a straightforward question that deserves to be answered. The \nPresident, as I mentioned, is now deploying troops to Kuwait. More \nAmerican lives could well be on the line. And it is past time--it is \nclearly past time--for this President to tell the American people what \nhis answer to those three questions are.\n  Reports yesterday from CNN stated that 3,500 troops are headed to \nKuwait. Claims were made that calling off the deployment now would send \nthe wrong message of weakness to Iraq. I would argue that the message \nhas already been sent in the form of a lack of foreign policy to \naddress this situation. The deployment of troops to Kuwait is clearly a \ncase in point. This announcement of sending 3,500 troops comes on the \nheels of comments by the President that he was reconsidering a decision \nto send several thousand troops to Kuwait.\n  The Washington Post quotes President Clinton as saying this:\n\n       We have sought no confrontation with Saddam Hussein. We \n     never did, and we don't now. My concern is that we limit \n     Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten his neighbors, that we \n     do it with the ``no-fly'' zone, and in so doing, we keep our \n     pilots safe.\n\n  I am not here to criticize the worthy goal of keeping our pilots \nsafe. However, this administration's policy is changing daily. The \nWhite House has not had its press conference this morning, so we do not \nknow what the foreign policy of today is. We were told the actions of \nexpanding the southern no-fly zone was a reaction and a lesson to \nSaddam Hussein that his use of force would be met with force. However, \nthe message did not register. We did not address the area of violation, \nwhich was the introduction of 30,000 Republican Guard troops into the \nKurdish safe haven at the request for help from one of the Kurdish \nfactions. In addition, our reaction did little to dissuade Iraqi \nactivities.\n\n  The administration claimed that our actions were justified because of \nthe inhumane actions of the Iraqis against the Kurds. However, we have \nalready lost that battle.\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\n  Hussein's troops moved into the safe haven under the vigilant watch \nof our intelligence sources and they have remained. We have done \nnothing to respond to Saddam Hussein's actions. In a recent article \nprinted by the Canadian news magazine Maclean's, an unidentified State \nDepartment official was quoted as saying:\n\n       By attacking in southern Iraq rather than striking at the \n     forces that Saddam used against the Kurds in the north, the \n     United States sent him a clear signal that it is concerned \n     only about the security of the oil supplies from Kuwait and \n     other Persian Gulf states, and does not care much about what \n     he does inside his own borders. . . . We've not demonstrated \n     [in all fairness, Mr. President] a lot of courage. . . . Our \n     actions have not left the region any more secure. [Bluntly \n     put] Saddam has gotten away with it.\n\n  Mr. President, this concern is not isolated but has been quite widely \nreported in news from Government officials and independent analysts.\n  These criticisms do not question the need to respond to Hussein. \nRather, they question the nature of the response chosen by our \nPresident. An action was necessary, but it should have reflected \nHussein's aggressive behavior. Brent Scowcroft, former national \nsecurity adviser under Presidents Ford and Bush, put it very succinctly \nin an article printed in the September 23 edition of Newsweek.\n  We were right to strike back, but we did so in a way that did no \nlasting military damage to him and inflicted significant collateral \ndamage on us. The cruise-missile attack was quick, clean, and easy. \nBut, it may have sent Saddam the wrong message--that he would only pay \nthe price of a pinprick. When the smoke cleared, it looked to most \npolitical leaders around the world as though Saddam was better off and \nthe United States was worse off than before the current crisis began.\n  Mr. President, the article covers a number of other cogent issues on \nthis situation. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. In addition to the loss of this high-stake game, I argue \nthat Saddam Hussein won the divide-and-conquer battle. It is disturbing \nto note how many nations who were supportive of active participation in \nthe coalition developed by President George Bush in the gulf war, have \neither failed to offer support or have condemned the American strikes \nand the American actions.\n  The Russians not only opposed United States actions, but they went so \nfar as to criticize the administration for playing electoral politics. \nFrance, once an important ally in the region, has refused to \nparticipate in patrolling the expanded area of the southern no-fly \nzone. Turkey, an ally since World War II, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have \nall expressed concern and refused to allow the United States to base \nsome of their actions in their countries.\n  By moving unilaterally, the President has isolated the United States \nin the region and weakened our position not only in the gulf, but it \ncould spill over into other regional issues such as the U.S. effort to \nfurther the Middle East peace process.\n  One point that has come to light which bothers me greatly is the lack \nof action to address growing concerns about the division and strains \nagainst the various Kurdish factions. Efforts to push diplomatic \nnegotiations could have prevented the situation from escalating to the \npoint that both Iran and Iraq were called into the conflict for support \nby the various factions.\n  In addition, when new intelligence reports indicated troop movement, \nwhy were there no efforts to deter the looming action before troops \nwere allowed to reach the Kurdish safe haven and quickly move into \nIrbil, remove the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and execute \napproximately 100 non-Kurdish Iraqi dissidents who based their anti-\nHussein activities out of the area?\n  Mr. President, the $1 billion-plus that the United States has spent \nestablishing and maintaining the Kurdish safe haven is also lost. It \nhas been acknowledged by U.S. officials that Saddam Hussein has left a \nmassive security presence. That presence will keep his political \nopponents muted, and serve as a constant reminder to Iraqis and, indeed \nthe world, that he intends to regain control of his entire country. \nSaddam is here to stay.\n  In closing, while I appreciate the President's efforts to brief \ncongressional leaders yesterday, I remain frustrated at the lack of a \nclear and precise direction on the part of the administration in \ndealing with Saddam Hussein. He is not going away, and neither are our \ninterests in the region. We have lost ground during this go-around. \nBut, we have been given a reprieve by the Iraqis, who recently \nannounced a discontinuance of attacks on United States aircraft \npatrolling the no-fly zone, and ceased efforts to rebuild air defense \nsystems destroyed by our missiles. Therefore, time is of the essence, \nand the President must get his policy on track, and this situation back \ninto balance.\n  And, President Clinton, you do accomplish this by vetoing the very \nbill that will fund our efforts in the Middle East and keep our men and \nwomen in uniform safe.\n  I say in conclusion that it is time that the White House woke up, \nthat America demand the answer to the fundamental questions: Why are we \nthere? What is our mission? What is our end game?\n  I must say to President Clinton, you have not demonstrated even the \nsimple logic of why you would want to veto a defense appropriations \nbill at a time when you are offering expanded activities in an area \nwhere no mission is clear. I say, Mr. President, step up to the mike \nand step up to the country. Do what you are supposed to do as our \nCommander in Chief. Respond, in a clear, unequivocal message, as to \nwhat is our mission and work with us to not only defend our troops but \nto finance them, because as you send them in harm's way, you have a \nsimple and most important obligation as our Commander in Chief, and \nthat is to make sure that they are well financed and well cared for.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [From Newsweek, Sept. 23, 1996]\n\n                      Why We Stopped the Gulf War\n\n                          (By Brent Scowcroft)\n\n       We have been listening to the same sad refrain for five \n     years; if only George Bush had finished off Saddam Hussein \n     when he had the chance at the end of the gulf war, we \n     wouldn't be in this mess today. There are two things wrong \n     with this reinterpretation of history. The first is that we \n     never had the objective of destroying Saddam's regime during \n     Desert Storm. The second is that had we continued the war and \n     overthrown Saddam, we might be worse off today.\n       We had a crucial but limited objective in the gulf war, to \n     reverse Iraqi aggression, and to cripple Saddam's offensive \n     military capabilities. The international coalition that \n     President Bush put together to fight the gulf war was based \n     on this carefully defined goal. We certainly hoped that \n     Iraq's defeat would lead to Saddam's collapse, but we viewed \n     that prospect as a potentially beneficial byproduct of our \n     victory.\n       If we had made Saddam's overthrow part of the objective, \n     there would have been no international coalition; even during \n     Desert Storm, our Arab allies stopped their troops at Iraq's \n     border because they wanted no part of an attack on Iraqi \n     territory. If we had continued to prosecute the gulf war \n     after we achieved or stated objectives, we would have \n     destroyed the coalition and squandered much of what our \n     victory had achieved.\n       So if we had pressed on to Baghdad in 1991, we would have \n     been on our own. And if we had succeeded in overthrowing \n     Saddam, we would have confronted a choice between occupying \n     Iraq with thousands of American troops for the indefinite \n     future and creating a gaping power vacuum in the Persian Gulf \n     for Iran to fill. There was no support among the American \n     people for the first alternative in 1991, and even less so \n     today. The second alternative would have put our vital \n     national-security interests in jeopardy.\n       Put simply, we recognized that the seemingly attractive \n     goal of getting rid of Saddam would not solve our problems, \n     or even necessarily serve our interests, any more than the \n     overthrow of Diem was a silver bullet to the conundrum of \n     Vietnam. So we pursued the kind of inelegant, messy \n     alternative that is all too often the only one available in \n     the real world. Having driven Saddam out of Kuwait and \n     destroyed much of his offensive military capabilities, we \n     concentrated on keeping the pressure on Iraq so that it could \n     not and would not once again threaten its neighbors. This is \n     the policy that the Clinton administration inherited. Saddam \n     may have made his move into northern Iraq two weeks ago \n     because he thought that with a presidential campaign \n     underway in the United States, we would not respond. Not \n     for the first time, Saddam miscalculated. We were right to \n     strike back, but we did so in a way that did no lasting \n     military damage to him and inflicted significant \n     collateral political damage on us. The cruise-missile \n     attack was quick, clean and easy. But it may have sent \n     Saddam the wrong message--that he would only pay the price \n     of a pinprick. When the smoke cleared, it looked to most \n     political\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\n     leaders around the world as though Saddam was better off \n     and the United States was worse off than before the \n     current crisis began.\n       A far more effective military response, though a more \n     dangerous one, would have targeted the Republican Guard units \n     that moved into northern Iraq. An air attack on those forces \n     would have put Saddam on notice that he must pay a real price \n     for his defiance. It also would have put on notice Iraqi \n     soldiers--on whom Saddam depends to remain in power--that any \n     time they march out on Saddam's orders, they will be subject \n     to devastating aerial bombardment.\n       Now we are into the next round. Saddam has fired missiles \n     at our aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. In return, we \n     have threatened a further ``disproportionate'' response and \n     are ostentatiously augmenting our military forces in the \n     area.\n       The next time we hit Saddam, we should hit him hard, and \n     where it hurts him most, so that he cannot mistake our \n     message. Airstrikes will have to focus tightly on Iraq's \n     military machine, making it clear that we intend to punish \n     Saddam, not harm the Iraqi people. The Republican Guard is an \n     obvious target.\n       The key point, however, is that the ``Iraq problem'' is not \n     susceptible to quick fixes. Dealing with Iraq will continue \n     to require patience and persistence, leadership and skill. \n     For the foreseeable future, a successful and sustainable--if \n     unsatisfying--policy is likely to share the same objectives \n     as the one we have followed since the end of the gulf war: \n     relegating Saddam to the category of a nuisance and \n     preventing him from re-emerging as a threat to his neighbors \n     or our vital interests.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified at the end of \n40 minutes, and I ask unanimous consent the remainder of my 45 minutes \nthen be delayed until 10:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Idaho \nfor talking about General Scowcroft, who is one of the great foreign \npolicy minds of our country, and I thank the Senator for talking about \nthe principles that we should have in foreign policy. I think it is \nvery important we look at the principles of foreign policy with the eye \ntoward letting our enemies, as well as our allies, know what they can \nexpect from us.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about today is a very important \nissue that is to be discussed in the Capitol, and that is defense \nspending. In fact, the President asked for $234 billion for defense \nspending. Congress asked the President to sign a bill for $244 billion. \nThere is a difference of $9.5 billion between the President's request \nand that of Congress.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are in military operations in Haiti, in \nBosnia, we have been in Somalia, which cost precious defense dollars, \nwe now have an escalation in the Middle East, we have 3,500 troops as \nwe speak on their way to Kuwait because we have an escalation there, \nand yet the President of the United States, while putting our troops \ninto these missions that are costing approximately $10 billion all \ntogether, nevertheless is asking us to cut $10 billion from the defense \nbudget.\n  Now, I point out some of the things that Congress would like to have \nin the defense budget that the President did not request. Two \nadditional F-16's, to replace fighters that are lost due to combat, \nsuch as Captain O'Grady, who was shot down and was a true hero in \nsurviving after being shot down by the Serbs. And, in fact, we are also \nsending F-16's right now to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to try to make sure \nthat we have enough F-16's, which are such an important base of our \noperations in the Middle East. In fact, we are sending 23 F-16's right \nnow. We are asking for two additional ones, which the President wants \nus to cut from the budget.\n\n  We added $66 million above the President's request for additional up-\narmored Humvees. I am sure my colleagues will remember that it was up-\narmored Humvees that saved the life of one of our soldiers in the early \ndays of the Bosnia conflict when his vehicle was destroyed--actually, \nit was struck by a landmine, but was not destroyed, because it was one \nof the up-armored Humvees. We want more of those to protect our troops \nif they are going to be in harm's way. But the President says ``no,'' \nhe wants to cut those, even though they are proven to have saved at \nleast one life in the Bosnia operation.\n  Next, $190 million for additional scout helicopter aircraft. They are \nplaying a major role in Bosnia today, and the Army is critically short \nof these scout helicopters. We are asking to upgrade the fleet of \nhelicopters because they are such an important part of our military \nreadiness. But the President says ``no.''\n  Then there is $53 million for night vision devices that allow our \nsoldiers to fight and win at night against this adversary that can't \nsee us. That's what we are asking, Mr. President, among other things, \nfor the readiness of our forces. Yet, the President, as the troops are \ngoing into harm's way for the protection of our interests, says he will \nveto a defense budget, unless we cut $2 to $3 billion out of it. Mr. \nPresident, you can't have it both ways. You cannot send our American \ntroops into the world to be police and peacekeepers and to secure the \ninterests of America--you can't ask them to do that if we don't have \nthe equipment and the protection for them with theater defenses. Mr. \nPresident, you can't do it.\n  Why would you threaten to veto a bill because it has $2 to $3 billion \nyou would like to put somewhere else, when you are asking more from our \nmilitary and they are performing? Mr. President, they are performing as \nthey always do. They are performing with guts, with patriotism, and \nwith belief in our country. They are representing our country. Mr. \nPresident, now is not the time to argue about cutting the defense \nbudget.\n  How much is this operation in Kuwait going to cost to defend against \nan aggression that might occur from Iraq? How much? We don't know how \nmuch. So, of course, the idea of cutting our defenses beyond bone, \nbeyond muscle, but into contingencies, does not make sense.\n  How could our Commander in Chief be talking about vetoing the Defense \nappropriations, the Defense appropriations bill? How could he be \ntalking about vetoing the Defense appropriations bill at the time that \nhe is sending our troops into a heightened area of awareness and \ncaution and readiness in the Middle East? How could he do it, Mr. \nPresident?\n  It's not right, and we, today, are calling on the President of the \nUnited States, the Commander in Chief, to work with us to keep our \ndefenses funded. He is commanding our armed services, and he must fund \nthem. Congress is trying to do that. Mr. President, work with us. If \nyou expect our troops to do the great job they always do, you must fund \nthem. You must give them the equipment. You must give them the \nballistic missile protection in the theater.\n\n  From my home State of Texas, we are sending 3,500 troops on the \nground to Kuwait. We have sent about 120 from Fort Bliss, with the \nPatriot missiles, to protect them. Mr. President, we even have missiles \nthat the President, the Commander in Chief, did not ask for, that have \nalready been used in this conflict with Iraq. As the Senator from \nArizona has said, the President did not ask for the missiles that he \nhas already used. We must have the replacements. We have already used \nthem. How could he at this time be talking about cutting $2 to $3 \nbillion out of our defense budget at the same time we are having cost \noverruns in Bosnia that will have to be funded, and we don't even know \nwhat Iraq will cost? This is not the time, and this is not leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ndistinguished President pro tempore, the dean of the Senate and the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, who has done so much to make \nsure that our men and women that serve our country are equipped and \ntrained and protected, the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nTexas on this special order to have a discussion on this very important \nmatter. She is a very able member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and stands for a strong defense. She does all she can to \npromote the welfare of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in urging President \nClinton to show his support for our men and women in uniform by \nindicating his support for the fiscal year 1997 Defense appropriations \nbill and conference report.\n  In his radio address on September 7, just days after he authorized \nthe cruise missile strikes against Iraq, President Clinton indicated \nthat he would sign the Defense authorization bill. This legislation, \nthe result of our work on\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee this year, authorizes \nappropriations for defense.\n  In expressing his support for the Defense authorization bill, \nPresident Clinton stated:\n\n       Once more, we have seen that at home and abroad, our \n     servicemen and women go the extra mile for us, and we must go \n     the extra mile for them. This bill makes good our pledge to \n     give our Armed Forces the finest equipment there is so that \n     they have the technological edge to prevail on the battle \n     fields of tomorrow . . . it also carries forward our \n     commitment to give our troops the quality of life they \n     deserve by funding family and troop housing improvements that \n     we want and by providing a raise of 3 percent . . .\n  Mr. President, I believe the President was absolutely right in these \nstatements of support for the Defense authorization bill and his \ndecision to sign it. Yet, here we are within only a week or so of these \nstatements, the administration is attempting to negotiate substantial \nreductions in the Defense appropriations bill.\n\n  I have tried to determine why the President might not want to support \nthe Defense appropriations bill. What events have transpired that might \nhave caused him to think that the Defense appropriations bill has too \nmuch money for defense?\n  The President has sent additonal airpower, seapower, and ground \ntroops to the Middle East to bolster our military force in that \ntroubled region. Every day, it appears more likely that the United \nStates will have to continue some kind of military presence in Bosnia \npast the December 20 deadline currently set for the withdrawal of our \nforces currently serving in Bosnia. In addition, United States forces \nwere recently dispatched to Haiti to help stabilize the government of \nPresident Preval.\n  Mr. President, the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997 \nauthorizes for appropriations $265.6 billion--$11.2 billion above the \nPresident's budget request. However, in real terms, this bill provides \n$7.4 billion less than last year's defense bill. Mr. President, this is \na very modest bill. Is there a Senator here who believes that our \nmilitary forces will be called upon to do less next fiscal year than we \nhave done in this fiscal year?\n  Mr. President, the Congress has indicated strong support for the \namounts of money provided for the Department of Defense in the Defense \nauthorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill. We passed a \nbudget resolution bill which supported this amount for defense. We \npassed a Defense authorization bill, voting several times in support of \nthe amounts for defense in this bill. I do not believe we should now be \nnegotiating these funds away for what appears to be political \ngamesmanship.\n  It is clear that this administration relies greatly on our military \nservices. The President must recognize that we must maintain a strong \nmilitary, capable of performing anywhere in the world and at a moment's \nnotice.\n  Now is the time when the Congress and the administration must stand \ntogether in support of our men and women in uniform, as the President \nhimself has stated, ``our service men and women go the extra mile for \nus, and we must go the extra mile for them.''\n  I urge the President to indicate clearly his support for the Defense \nappropriations bill as he has for the Defense authorization bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 3 of the \n5 minutes that I have remaining at the end be allocated now to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding that we provided 45 minutes of morning business to begin \nat 9:30 for the majority side of the aisle, with 45 minutes of morning \nbusiness to follow by our side of the aisle beginning at 10:15. My \nunderstanding is that the unanimous-consent request was previously \npropounded without objection, I think, by anyone on our side of the \naisle, to segregate the first 45 minutes so that the last 5 minutes of \nit would occur at the end of the hour and a half block.\n  If the Senator from Texas wished to change the agreement that was \nmade last evening about morning business, then I would urge that we \nmake that change in a manner that allows the additional 5 minutes \nbetween 10:55 and 11 to be controlled by the Senator from Texas and 5 \nminutes controlled by me from 11 to 11:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I do object, Mr. \nPresident. What I would like to do is ask that 3 of the 5 minutes from \nmy last 5 minutes go to the Senator from Idaho now, and then I would \nlike to have the last 2 minutes of the morning business time. So if you \nwould like to extend for 5 minutes, would you be willing to extend 5 \nminutes from 10:58 to 11:03?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not quite understand the request. My \nintention is not to prevent the Senator from Idaho from speaking in any \norder. My only point was that, if we are intending to change the \nagreement that was made last evening without consultation, then the \nagreement should provide, if the Senator from Texas has 5 minutes, at \n10:55 to 11 o'clock, that we would have 5 minutes from 11 to 11:05.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me add this. If you are wanting the last 5 \nminutes, how about your taking 10:55 to 11 and letting me have my last \n5 minutes, giving 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho at this time, and \nthen 2 minutes, before you go into your last 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The only caveat to that would be, why don't we just \nprovide that our side will have 45 minutes? To whatever extent that \ntakes us over the 11 o'clock hour, it does. We would want to have the \nfull 45 minutes. We have Senator Feinstein who wants to speak, and \nSenator Biden may be here to speak on a couple of things. I would like \nto make sure that we have equal time.\n  I was surprised that the agreement last evening, which was 45 minutes \non each side, was changed this morning without consultation. I have no \nobjection to anyone speaking at any time except that we would like to \nhave the last 5 minutes in this block today. So the Senator from Texas \napparently now has, by unanimous consent, 5 minutes from 10:55 to 11, \nand she is asking consent that the Senator from Idaho be included in \nthat.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am asking consent that we also in that request add that \nwe would have 5 minutes additional from 11 to 11:05 for our side to \nclose in morning business.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me see if I can make this easier. Let me just \ntake my last 5 minutes right now and then the Senator can have--if you \nare still wanting to go over, I am concerned about going past 11 just \nbecause of the order of voting and what Senators have been told. So if \nyou would like, the point is you would like to have the last part of \nthe debate, would you be willing to let me give 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Idaho, let me finish with 2 minutes, and then you take \nuntil 11. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. The agreement last evening was that we would have 45 \nminutes. We would insist under the agreement that our side receive 45 \nminutes. It is certainly acceptable to having you complete your morning \nbusiness now. In fact, if you wanted a couple of extra minutes, that is \nfine with me. We would simply provide that we would want an equal \namount of time on our side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. At this point, then, I would like to reserve my 2 \nminutes at the end and give the other 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't \nmean to quibble about this. But does that include the opportunity for \nour side then to extend beyond 11 o'clock, as I have indicated?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me ask if we could do this. Let me ask the \nSenator from Idaho to have up to 3 minutes now, and then the Senator \nfrom North Dakota would be able to get 45 minutes, and then I would \nhave 2 additional minutes, whatever that would take.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would object. Let me say to the Senator from Texas with\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\ngreat respect that we had an agreement last evening about morning \nbusiness. Without consultation, we have a unanimous-consent propounded \nand agreed to because no one on our side was on the floor. If you wish \nto propound a further unanimous-consent request, I will object unless \nwe restore the agreement that was obtained last evening of 45 minutes \non each side. You are certainly welcome to 5 minutes toward the end, \nprovided you accord the same opportunity to us. If you choose not to do \nthat, I would be constrained to object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In an effort to give the Senator everything I think \nhe has asked for, not to be quibbling, the only reason that I would \ngive up what I have by unanimous consent is because the Senator from \nIdaho has been waiting, and in order to give him 3 minutes I am going \nto give you whatever you want. So I will say that I will ask unanimous \nconsent that the 3 minutes of the 5 minutes that I have left be given \nto the Senator from Idaho, and that then I will have 2 additional \nminutes for my 45 minutes, and then the Senator from North Dakota will \ncontrol 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. These are precious \n3 minutes. I will make the best use of them.\n  For the 11th year in a row, we have cut the defense of this Nation--\n11 years. Last year, the administration assured the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that this year there would be no further cuts and \nthat we would see the adding of funds for procurement so that we could \nbuy the ships and the tanks and the trucks our men and women in the \nmilitary so critically need.\n  As passed, the current budget for the Department of Defense, the \nbudget that is now in question and we are talking about this morning, \ndoes not even keep up with inflation. What is in it? Things that are so \nstraightforward, such as a 3-percent pay increase for men and women in \nthe military, a very real issue, and all of the equipment that they \nneed.\n  Later today, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing \non General Downing's report on the terrorist bombing of Khobar Towers \nin Saudi Arabia. Nineteen Americans lost their lives in that bombing.\n  Yesterday, the President announced he was sending an additional 5,000 \nAmerican soldiers to Kuwait to keep Saddam Hussein in Iraq. In Bosnia \nthe elections have taken place. Now the administration is considering \nkeeping the American soldiers in Bosnia after the 1-year deployment we \nwere told would do the job. These so-called peacekeeping missions have \nshown us repeatedly that the world remains a very dangerous place for \nAmericans and certainly for the men and women in uniform. We must make \nthe hard decisions and spend what is required to protect our Nation's \nvital interests.\n  If the President wants to once again reduce funding for defense, I \nwould ask him, which requirements does he propose to cut? Which \nrequirements does he propose to cut? Is the President ready to remove \nour troops from Bosnia? If so, declare it. Is the President ready to \nend our enforcement of the no-fly zone over Iraq? If so, declare it. Is \nthe President willing to now say there is no need to send the troops to \nKuwait? If so, declare it. What do the cuts do to the responsibilities \nhe is giving to our troops? We continually ask our troops to do more \nand more and we ask them to do it with less and less. That is wrong. \nThat is not what a Commander in Chief should be asking of those troops \nthat are under that Commander in Chief's command.\n  Last night, we had the celebration of the 180th anniversary of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. We acknowledged the leaders that have \nbeen in that position. We acknowledged Senator Strom Thurmond and \nSenator Sam Nunn, who I believe are together on this issue. There was \nan interesting quote that was pointed out to us last night by President \nCalvin Coolidge who said:\n\n       The Nation which forgets its defenders will be itself \n     forgotten.\n\n  I think that says it all. Let us not forget our defenders. Let us not \nforget the men and women in uniform that we repeatedly ask to put their \nlives on the line.\n  No more cuts, Mr. President. No more cuts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 45 minutes under the previous order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the previous order was that I \nhad the last 2 minutes after Senator Kempthorne's 3 minutes and then \nthe Senator from North Dakota would have 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator wishes to take the time now, \nthat is fine, if there is no objection.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That was the agreement. I thank the Chair.\n  I think the Senator from Idaho said it all. If you are going to cut \nthe defense budget at the same time that you continue to ask our \nmilitary to do more with less, tell us where you want to cut.\n  The President of the United States is now threatening to veto the \nDefense appropriations bill if we do not cut $2- to $3 billion out of \nit. As 3,500 troops are on their way to Kuwait to defend the interests \nof this country, the President is threatening to veto the Defense \nappropriations bill. How could he do it? With troops going into Haiti, \nwith troops in Bosnia, overruns there right now, and more troops on the \nway to a hot spot in the Middle East, and he is telling Congress cut \n$2- to $3 billion out of the defense budget.\n  Mr. President, where do you want to cut? Are you going to cut F-16's, \nas you send 23 more to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia? Or are you going to cut \nthe cruise missiles that you did not put in the budget in the first \nplace which have already been used in your operation over Iraq? Is that \nwhat you want to cut? Or do you want to cut the Humvees with the added \narmor that has already saved one life in Bosnia when a landmine was run \nover by a Humvee but the protection was there and an American life was \nsaved? Is that what you want to cut?\n  Those are the things in our budget that the President did not ask for \nand would be asking us to take out. Mr. President, step up to the line. \nIf you are going to cut the defense budget, you tell us where you want \nto cut. It is very clear we are going to need Stealth bombers. We have \nalready used them. Are we going to start cutting Stealth bombers as we \nare sending them into harm's way?\n  Mr. President, step up to the line. Tell us where you want to cut. \nLet us be responsible. Let us fund our men and women who are defending \nthe interests of this country.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments, \nfirst, about the Federal Reserve Board and a piece in this morning's \nnewspaper about the Federal Reserve Board and, second, about the issue \nof confirming U.S. judges. First, the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Page 1 references the story on page 2 about the Federal Reserve \nBoard. Next Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board is going to meet in \nsecret and make a decision about whether or not it wants to increase \ninterest rates in our country. Apparently 8 of the 12 regional Federal \nReserve Bank boards have made a recommendation to the Federal Reserve \nBoard that they ought to increase interest rates and somehow that was \nleaked to the press. ``Newspaper Story's Apparent Leak of Advice on \nRates Shocks the Fed. Regional Banks' Opinions Are a Tightly Held \nSecret.''\n  Why is this interesting? Because next Tuesday the Fed will make a \ndecision that will affect every single American. If they increase \ninterest rates, they will tax every single American with\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\nhigher interest rate charges on their indebtedness. Will there be a \ndebate about it? No. Will it be public? Will it be a democratic system? \nNo. It will be done in secret, just as everything else is done in \nsecret. That is why this story talks about the FBI being called out in \nother circumstances to find out who leaked information about what is \nhappening at the Fed.\n\n  Why ought it be a crime to leak information? The American people \nought to have information about what is happening in monetary policy. \nWe ought to disinfect the Federal Reserve Board by opening the doors \nand providing some sunlight into their process, so the American people \ncan become, at least in some minor way, a part of the process in \ndetermining whether this country ought to have higher interest rates.\n  I simply want to point out how incredible this story is, written by \nJohn Berry. John Berry always writes stories from the institutional \nside of the Fed. I do not know, if he stepped back, six or eight paces \naway, he would see the absurdity of this institution which is now a \ndinosaur, the last remaining dinosaur in Washington operating in secret \nbehind closed doors with those who are coming from around the country, \nhired by their boards of directors in the regional Fed banks--the \nboards of directors are local bankers--coming to Washington, DC, to \nmake public decisions about interest rate policy that all Americans \nwill be confronting.\n  This obviously commends a much longer discussion than this. But next \nTuesday the Federal Reserve Board, if it is thinking straight, will \ndecide to just say no to higher interest rates.\n  Inflation is down one-tenth of 1 percent, announced last week. You \ncan almost find no inflation in this economy. It is down 5 years in a \nrow. Unemployment is down to 5.1 percent. The models that the Federal \nReserve Board use simply are not working. They have always felt you \ncannot have lower unemployment because lower unemployment would mean \nhigher inflation. Now they are scratching their heads, wondering how is \nthis happening? How is it that unemployment has come down to 5.1 \npercent and there is no new inflation?\n  If the Fed would open its doors and send some of its folks around the \ncountry to talk to real people, they will find wage earners know what \nthe Fed has not known for the last two decades. Wage earners know wages \nhave not been going up, they have been going down. The pressure to \ncreate more inflation from higher wages is not happening in this global \neconomy. The global economy and circumstances of our participation in \nit are pushing wages down, not up. It is time the Fed changes its \nmodels or goes out and talks to real American people about this and \nmaybe they would come to the right conclusion next Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10735-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FEDERAL JUDGES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. One point about Federal judges. We are nearing the end of \nthis congressional session. Some of us believe this Congress ought not \nadjourn until the majority party does for us what we did for them--yes, \neven in election years--and that is clear off the calendar and clear \nthrough the committee, judges, Federal judges that have been appointed \nby this President.

Now, having said that, and there will be more discussion \nabout that in future days, I want to turn just for a moment to the \ndiscussion we have seen on the floor of the Senate now for 45 minutes \nthis morning.\n  Senators have every right to come to this floor and talk about \ndefense policy, and the Senators who came are Senators for whom I have \ngreat respect. But I have real disagreement with those who would \nleverage the issue of American troops going in harm's way to the \nPersian Gulf this morning, leaving their loved ones because the \nCommander in Chief and our military people feel it is necessary to send \nthem to the Persian Gulf. I have real concern about those who would \nleverage that with criticism of the President for his defense budget \nproposals just weeks before an election, in an obvious attempt to try \nto find a way to undermine President Clinton on this Senate floor. But \nit not only tries to pull the rug out from under President Clinton, I \nthink it sends all the wrong signals at this moment as this country \nprepares to confront foreign policy initiatives that are serious.\n  The discussion on the floor is, ``President Clinton wants to cut \ndefense spending.'' Let us look at the record just for a moment. Oh, \nthe President has cut some in defense. I will give you an example of \nwhat he cut, he and Vice President Gore. There was a 16-page regulation \non how to buy cream-filled cookies at the Pentagon. They cut that. It \ndoes not take 16 pages of regulations anymore to buy cream-filled \ncookies because this administration said that does not make any sense. \nThat is nuts. Let us streamline all that.\n  They tried to buy $25,000 worth of ant bait to kill ants. It took \nthem months and dozens and dozens of pages of regulations and forms. \nThey cut that.\n  So, has the President wanted to cut some in defense? Yes--unnecessary \nregulations, unnecessary bureaucracy. It is about time. We ought to \ncommend them for that, not criticize them.\n  Now, on the question of spending, what was sent to this Congress from \nthe Defense Department? A budget. The cold war is over. The Soviet \nUnion does not exist. And from the height of the cold war we are now \nspending less than we were spending then. Does anyone in this country \nthink that we ought to spend now as much on military preparedness and \ndefense as we did at the very height of the cold war? Does anyone \nbelieve that? Of course not. We are not at the height of the cold war. \nThings have changed. Defense spending has come down some--not a great \ndeal, but some. So what is the debate?\n  The debate is this. The Pentagon prepares a budget. The uniformed \npersonnel, the service Secretaries going through the White House, they \nprepare a budget, send it to the Congress, and they say: Here is what \nwe think, as an Army, Navy, a group of Marines, and the Air Force, here \nis what we think is necessary to defend America. Here is what we think \nwe must build, what we must spend. Here is what we think we must \naccomplish to defend America.\n  That budget came to this Congress, giving us the best recommendations \nof those who wear our uniform in this country, the generals and the \nadmirals, the service Secretaries, saying here is what we want to \ndefend America. But when it got here it was not enough. We had folks in \nthis Chamber saying, ``You know, we think you are dead wrong. It is \ntrue we are the folks who stand up and boast every morning about how \nmuch we want to cut Federal spending, but we think you are wrong. We \nthink, Mr. and Mrs. Pentagon, over there in that big building, we think \nyou ought to spend $13 billion more. We think you ought to buy more \ntrucks, more ships, more planes, more submarines. We think you ought to \nspend more money because we think you are wrong.''\n\n  Everybody has a right to his or her opinion on what it takes to \ndefend this country. Everybody has a right to stand up and talk about \nthat. I do not deny that. But I would like to talk about a couple of \nthe specifics, because I think in many respects this has a whole lot \nmore to do with politics than it has to do with policy. It has a whole \nlot more to do with elections than it has to do with the defense of \nthis country. I want to run through just a couple of charts, because I \nthink it is instructive on this issue.\n  One of the big items we have been debating is the issue of star wars. \nI know they do not like to call it that, but star wars. There is a \nproposal called the Defend America Act. Who on Earth can be opposed to \ndefending America? The Defend America Act is to build an astrodome over \nAmerica, an astrodome effect that would prevent missiles from coming in \nand hitting our country. We have already spent somewhere around $99 \nbillion on research and development on missiles. We have built one ABM \nsite--incidentally, we built it in my State. It was declared mothballed \nthe very month it was declared operational, after the equivalent of \ntoday's $25 billion was spent on it. But we have people saying that it \ndoes not matter what the cost is, we need to build this.\n\n[[Page S10737]]\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the proposal that they have been \ntalking about here would cost up to $60 billion to build and up to $4 \nbillion a year to operate. And, in a reasonable time period, would cost \n$116 billion. The question is, where does that come from? Senator Dole \nheld a press conference about it, feeling--and it was in the Washington \nPost--feeling this would give him an edge in the election. This can be \na wedge issue. We support defending America with the star wars program, \nsomebody else does not, so therefore we are better than they are. At \nthe press conference he was asked:\n\n       Senator, how much do you think this is going to cost? And \n     where is the money going to come from?\n       Well, I'll leave that up to the experts.\n\n  The majority leader, asked the same question:\n\n       We'll have to look at that . . . I don't have a fixed \n     number in mind.\n\n  I will tell you what it costs, $60 billion to build, $4 billion a \nyear to operate. The question is where are you going to get the money, \nwho is going to pay for it, but, more important, do we need it? What \nkind of system do we need for our defense?\n  The reason I mention this issue is this issue happens to be one which \nis a very large expenditure that is proposed for which there is no \nproposed method of payment. It is just saying: We are for defense and \nthe other folks are not. I happen to think the defense of this country \nis critically important. I think there is a lot of waste in defense. \nBut I have been on plenty of military bases and seen men and women \nwearing the uniform of this country who do some wonderful things, and \nwho sacrifice greatly for this country. They ought to have the best \nequipment that we can purchase for them. They ought to fly the best \nairplanes we can purchase. I know, despite what a lot of people say \nabout our Defense Department, I think we have the best defense system \nin the world by far.\n  We spend far in excess of any other country or group of countries \ncombined. If you take all the NATO countries combined and throw all \ntheir defense expenditures into one pot, they don't measure up to our \nknees on defense expenditures. The fact is, we spend an enormous amount \nof defense money, far more than any other country in the world--far \nmore than any other country in the world--and for anyone to say somehow \nthose men and women and the equipment we buy don't measure up, I just \ndon't think they understand.\n  The controversy has not been that somebody is weak on defense. The \ncontroversy is some see defense as a jobs program. I have come to the \nfloor and said, ``Here are trucks the Pentagon said it didn't want that \nsome insisted be built. Here are jet fighters the Pentagon didn't want \nto build that some in Congress insisted they build. Here are ships that \nthe Defense Department said it didn't want to build at this point.'' \nThe Congress said, ``You must build.''\n  I even found buried deep in the Defense authorization bill an \nauthorization, I think, for $60 million to buy blimps. No hearings, no \ndiscussion, no debate, just somebody writing in, ``Let's buy blimps.'' \nLord knows what they would buy blimps for, but buried deep in an \nauthorization bill, ``Let's buy blimps.'' When the Defense bill is on \nthe floor, the sky is the limit.\n  So the question is not for this President or for this Congress of \nwhether we should have a strong defense, a defense this country can \ncount on. The President wants that, I want that, all my colleagues want \nthat. The question is, What kind of investments and expenditures will \nprovide a strong defense?\n  Did it strengthen our country to have 16 pages of regulations to buy \ncream-filled cookies? I don't think so. I suppose you can make the case \nthe person hired to interpret the regulations on how to buy cream-\nfilled cookies was defending America. It seems to me they were \ndefending cream-filled cookies. If we streamline that and that person \nis now doing something more meaningful in this country's defense, \ndoesn't that strengthen defense?\n  I urge you to look at what this Vice President and this President \nhave done in the area of reinventing Government and see what they have \ndone in the Pentagon in streamlining rules and regulations, especially \nwith respect to purchases and acquisitions. And if you are not \nimpressed by that, you will not be impressed by anything.\n  This administration deserves credit for that. The fact is, the \nPentagon is one of the largest organizations on this Earth, and like \nevery large organization in the public or private sector, it has an \nenormous amount of bureaucracy and fat. And this administration has \ntackled that.\n  But the administration has done more than that. This administration \nhas also proposed directed, specific investments in weapons programs \nand systems that will strengthen this country, and I think it ill \nbehooves other Members of Congress to come to this floor and try to use \nthis issue for leverage for an election. That is what this is about. \nThis is not about troops moving to Iraq or the Persian Gulf today. It \nis about an election that is held in early November. When I heard that \nthis morning, I thought, ``This needs a response. This really needs a \nresponse.''\n  I would like to just make a couple of other points. We are often, \nwhen we discuss these issues, having to economize, as is a classic case \nin the field of economics. We have to try to determine what are our \nwants and needs and what are our resources. The wants are almost \nunlimited and resources are limited. How do you respond to unlimited \nwants with limited resources? That is true in defense, and it is true \nin our entire budget.\n\n  I thought it was fascinating about a year ago when I was standing at \nthis point in the well of the Senate, and we had conflicting proposals \nthat I thought made it stark, as clear as it can be about priorities. \nWe had a tiny little program called the Star Program, a tiny little \nprogram, and the proposal was, ``Well, let's cut star schools 40 \npercent,'' and then a big program called star wars, ``Let's increase \nstar wars 120 percent.'' I can't think of anything clearer than where \nthe priorities were for those who opposed it.\n  Is there a relationship between education and defense? You bet. Where \ndo you think F-16's came from? Where do you think the stealth bombers \ncame from? Where do you think the Patriot missile came from? It came \nfrom the product of this country's education and genius and people who \ninvent, create, build, construct. That is where it all comes from.\n  My first job out of graduate school, after I got my MBA, was with the \nMartin Marietta Corp. I saw firsthand the marvels of engineering and \nthe genius of invention in not only NASA but also defense programs with \nweapons systems. It is quite remarkable. But the Martin Marietta Corp. \nknew, as do most others in this country, that that starts with \neducation.\n  You tell Americans that we will short change education and somehow we \nwill be a stronger country, we will have a better defense, and most \nAmericans will say, ``No, no, you're not thinking very straight.'' \nThomas Jefferson once said, and I have quoted this many times and I \nwill again because it is so important, ``Any country who believes it \ncan be both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and \nnever can be.''\n  So my point is we are hearing now today about criticism of a \nPresident who some believe has not proposed enough money for defense. \nWe have, in fact, a President who has proposed a defense budget that \nrepresents what the armed services believes is necessary to defend this \ncountry and that makes some very important strategic investments in new \nweapons programs and new systems, and I think the budget the President \nproposed is a good budget. In fact, if you take a look at last year's \nRepublican budget enacted by the Senate and take a look at the \nPresident's proposed budget and go to the outyears, 2000 and 2002, you \nwill see the President is proposing higher defense spending than those \nwho are now criticizing him. I don't understand that either.\n  So, there is more to say, I guess, but we will likely hear a great \ndeal about this and a dozen other issues where someone thinks they \nmight be able to drive a wedge between now and election day. It is \nimportant, I think, now, however, for us to decide that as troops go to \nthe Middle East and as we as a country try to speak with one voice \nabout our goals, we ought to decide that debate about defense policy is \nperfectly appropriate for all of us. But mingling a defense policy \ndebate at this point with the discussion about the role of our troops, \nI think, is not\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\nwhat we ought to do here in the Senate or elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, Senator Feinstein is here and is prepared to speak, I \nbelieve, on this and another subject. I, at this point, yield the \nfloor, and I may use some time later in the special order.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I also thank \nthe Chair.\n  I must say, I came to this floor to speak for the fifth time about \nmethamphetamine this morning. However, I happened to hear the preceding \nspeakers, and I really want to identify myself with the comments just \nmade by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Even on this side of the aisle, there is legitimate difference about \nhow much should be in the defense budget. I, for one, voted for more \nthan the President put forward in his budget. I think that is \nlegitimate, but I also think we should talk about it, and I think we \nshould debate it.\n  However, it is clear to all of us, I think, that we are engaged in a \nmilitary operation. Therefore, the lives of our pilots, of our men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, and of innocent civilians are at risk.\n  I think during a military operation, an attack on the President, on \nthe very policy that is determining that operation is, frankly, ill-\nadvised, I think it is highly partisan, I think it could put American \nand other lives at risk, and, frankly, I think it is just plain tacky.\n  So I want to say that. I would be hopeful that during a time of some \nnational emergency--and I think this operation does qualify--we can \ncome together as Republicans and as Democrats to support the Commander \nin Chief of the United States of America, who happens to be the \nPresident, whether that President is Democratic or whether that \nPresident is Republican. I pledge as a Democrat that should the \nPresident be a Republican, I would do the same, because I think it is \nimportant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10736-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10738-S10740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMPREHENSIVE METHAMPHETAMINE CONTROL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come here because I have spoken on \nthis floor five times about methamphetamine. There is good news. I \nthink it is stellar news. It is how this body can work together to \nsolve what is a very real problem in America. I mentioned before that \nmethamphetamine has been a major problem in the State of California. As \na matter of fact, the DEA has determined that California is the \n``source country'' for methamphetamine, much like Colombia is for \ncocaine. In Operation Pipeline, conducted by the DEA, 92.8 percent of \nall methamphetamine seized in a national drug operation actually \noriginated in California. Hospital admissions are up, way above that \nfor cocaine. Deaths are up. Medical costs are up. Methamphetamine has \nbecome a real problem and a national emergency.\n  Last June and July--that is 1995--I wrote to the Attorney General \nlaying out the vast extent of the methamphetamine problem in California \nand asking her for proposals to crack down on this trade, especially on \nthe precursor chemicals used to make methamphetamine.\n  Over the ensuing months, my staff and I worked with prosecutors, \nnarcotics officers, and the California Department of Justice, in a \nbipartisan way, to try to develop solutions. In February of this year, \nSenator Grassley and I, along with Senator Reid, introduced the \nMethamphetamine Control Act of 1996. We had a bipartisan group of \nSenators which also included Senator Kyl. Representatives Fazio and \nRiggs in the House introduced the same bill.\n  In April, President Clinton announced his national methamphetamine \nstrategy adding additional measures to attack meth. In July of this \nyear, Senators Hatch, Biden, Grassley, and I and others introduced the \nbill which was passed last night, incorporating our earlier proposals. \nFrankly, thanks to Chairman Hatch and Senator Biden, I think this is a \nmuch better bill than the original bill we introduced.\n  I note with some interest that yesterday was Senator Grassley's \nbirthday. How nice to have a birthday and at the same time to have a \nbill that you worked on which passed the Senate of the United States \nunanimously, and which will solve a major problem out there.\n  This would not have happened had it not been bipartisan. It would not \nhave happened had it not been for the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the ranking member of that committee coming together to \nwork on a problem. A lot of staffs were involved across the aisle. I \nthink they worked in the best bipartisan way this body can muster to \nsolve a real problem. That is practical.\n  You know, I often hear a lot about ideology around here. I have never \nbeen in a place that is more partisan than around here. Yet, the fact \nof the matter is, some problems take very conservative solutions, some \ntake more innovative solutions, and most take just plain sitting down \nat a table and working out a solution. And that is methamphetamine.\n  So last night the Hatch-Biden-Feinstein-Grassley bill, known as the \nMethamphetamine Control Act, was passed.\n  Among some of the things it does is it adds seizure and forfeiture \nauthority for precursor chemical violations.\n  It provides for stiff escalating civil penalties for the reckless \nsale of chemicals used to manufacturer methamphetamine.\n  It gives the Attorney General the authority to shut down chemical \nsupply houses which provide chemicals to clandestine methamphetamine \nmanufacturers.\n\n  It provides for restitution for the cost of cleaning up clandestine \nmethamphetamine labs, which runs about $7,000, $8,000 a lab.\n  It allows the Attorney General to require, by regulation, reporting \nthe sales of ordinary, over-the-counter, pseudoephedrine-containing \nproducts in quantities above 24 grams. This is really important because \nas there are controls on ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, which goes into \nover-the-counter cold medication, developed as a major source for \nmethamphetamine makers to buy. So they would go into something like a \nLong's drugstore that has maybe 30 feet of display space of over-the-\ncounter cold medication and they would buy maybe 5,000 packages, \neverything they could get their hands on, ring it up, not have to give \na name, address, a driver's license, anything, and walk out, open the \npackages or bottles, get children to open the blister packs, and go \ninto their clandestine labs and make methamphetamine.\n  This bill cracks down on that. I have heard that Long's, for example, \nis interested in being part of a major education program, which is \nprovided for in this bill, to educate people and their own retail \noutlets about what is happening in methamphetamine.\n  I am very proud to say that pharmaceutical houses, like Warner-\nLambert, became solidly in support of this legislation once they \nunderstood what was actually happening with their products.\n  So I think this bill is a Republican win; it is a Democratic win. It \nis a good, strong, tough bill. Amazingly enough, 2 months before a \nPresidential election, on a bipartisan basis, it passed the Senate of \nthe United States. We hope it will be marked up either today or \ntomorrow in the House of Representatives and we will get something \ndone.\n  Mr. President, you are a Republican. I am a Democrat. I happen to \nthink this is what the people of America sent us both here to do. So I \nwould like to send my warm congratulations to Chairman Hatch, to \nSenators Grassley, Kyl, Reid, most particularly to ranking member \nSenator Biden, whose staff worked very, very hard, and Senator Harkin, \nwho came aboard and was supportive early on. This is important \nlegislation. Oh, and, Mr. President, my staff just told me, you are \npart of this effort as well. Let me salute you and say thank you. \nCalifornians are grateful, and I think all of America will be as well. \nThank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       A. Methamphetamine is a very dangerous and harmful drug. It \n     is highly addictive and is associated with permanent brain \n     damage in long-term users.\n       B. The abuse of methamphetamine has increased dramatically \n     since 1990. This increased use has led to devastating effects \n     on individuals and the community, including:\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\n       1. A dramatic increase in deaths associated with \n     methamphetamine ingestion.\n       2. An increase in the number of violent crimes associated \n     with methamphetamine ingestion.\n       3. An increase in criminal activity associated with the \n     illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor \n     compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in \n     the United States.\n       C. Congress finds that illegal methamphetamine manufacturer \n     and abuse presents an imminent public health threat that \n     warrants aggressive law enforcement action, increased \n     research on methamphetamine and other substance abuse, \n     increased coordinated efforts to prevent methamphetamine \n     abuse, and increased monitoring of the public health threat \n     methamphetamine presents to the communities of the United \n     States.\n\n\n    title i.--importation of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals\n\n                  Sec. 101.

Coming from Kentucky, and I guess in some other States, we \nhave heard about midnight conversions or death-bed conversions. ``I've \nseen the light. Everything's going to be all right.'' Lo and behold, we \nfound for a long time that this side of the aisle has been pushing for \nadditional funding for education. And I read in the morning paper where \nthere was a midnight conversion. Somebody has been reading the polls.\n  For the first time in a Presidential campaign, education is No. 1--\nNo. 1. So rather than going out with a whimper, Republicans want to \nclose this session down with a bang. It is not enough. If you read the \nstories in the press, the Republicans were forced into putting this \nmoney in the budget by Democrats. That is the story. That is the story.\n  The midnight conversion was one we have been pushing hard, trying to \nget our amendment up yesterday, were refused, objected to, everything, \nbecause you did not want Democrats to offer their amendment yesterday. \nThat is parliamentary procedure. I understand it. Every Senator in here \nunderstands it. I think the public understood it.\n  So now the $2.3 billion or whatever the Republicans tried to put in \nlast night in their midnight conversion, we think, is not enough. It \nshould be a little over $3 billion. I hope that the Senate will allow \nus to vote on that amendment.\n  We are getting to a point now where we cannot get appropriations \nbills out. It is not our fault. We are left out. We have bills that are \ncoming up here that only the Republicans have dealt with--Democrats \nhave never been called into the room. That is the way it has happened \nfor over 18 months now. Somebody said, ``Why should Democrats be in?'' \nSome old fellow in the back said, ``Well, a blind hog finds an acorn \nonce in a while.''\n  Maybe, just maybe, they would have a good idea. A good idea has been \neducation. I do not know who said it, but I want to tell you I will \nremember it as long as I live: A cut in education never heals--a cut in \neducation never heals. That is what has happened here. The Republicans \ncutting education, that wound will never heal. I do not care how you \ntry to paint it, how you try to phrase it in a 30-second ad, how the \nincumbents and challengers try to play it back home, that cut that was \nout there will never heal. The people will remember how you wanted to \ncut education.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that the Republicans were converted \nlast night. I am glad the death-bed conversion worked because at least \nwe are a little over $2 billion closer to what the administration feels \nand we on this side feel should be available for education. It used to \nbe, and now I think it is a foregone conclusion, that a high school \neducation is not enough.\n  We worked hard in Kentucky with KET, with the Star Program, to get \nKET by television. It worked well. Practically every State in the \nNation picked up on it, the Star Program, so that everybody would have \nan opportunity, even if they worked, they could stay at home and get \ntheir GED. I do not know how many tens of thousands of GED certificates \nwere given as a result of the Star Program. It all came from Kentucky \neducational television. It was the pilot project that spread across \nthis country.\n  Now the President says that 2 years of college, 2 years of college \nought to be the norm. We hear all about this tax cut. I do not hear \nmuch about it now; it has kind of faded away--15 percent tax cut. For \nan individual making $200,000, your tax cut at the period of time \nproposed in the tax cut is $28,900. That is annual. That will put 19 \nstudents through the community college if my hometown. So we give one \nindividual making over $200,000 a year, the equivalent of giving 19 \nstudents their tuition, getting them through community college.\n  I do not think Government ought to be in everything. I think they \nought to be out of most things. But we have to give some leadership, \nand education is leadership in this country. The people understand it, \nconstituents understand it, and, lo and behold, Republicans found out \nabout it last night.\n\n  So as you read the story where Democrats forced Republicans to add \nover $2 billion in education, that is the story. They are cutting. The \ncut in education never heals, and the cut that was attempted in \neducation under the Republican budget, under the Republican \nappropriations bill, that cut will never heal because the people will \nremember what was attempted to do.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to bring our amendment up, and \nwe will be able to offer it as we wanted to and which we were \nprecluded. When you ask unanimous consent that your amendment be \nbrought up and it is objected to, everybody understands that. You think \nit does not resonate beyond this Chamber? Of course it does. People \nthat watch C-SPAN understand who is preventing the amendment to come \nforward to improve education, so that they, being the Republicans, \ncould make their effort last might and make some headlines today. Read \nthe story-- \nthe Democrats forced them to do it. The Democrats forced them to do it.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased at the movement in the right direction. I \nhope we can do a little bit more so that those students out there in my \nState and your State and other States will have an opportunity for \neducation and will not continue to burden the families with the \nborrowing of money and the struggling in order to see that their family \nis educated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, let me take the remaining couple of \nminutes of morning business to further amplify about the number of \njudges we need still to clear. We have on this calendar six judges, \nfour of them appeals judges, two district court judges. There is \npending in the Judiciary Committee 22 judges, 4 appeals judges, and 17 \ndistrict judges. In the last 40 years, Congress has never adjourned, \never, without confirming at least one Federal appellate court judge, \nand some are saying that will happen now. This would be most \nunfortunate.\n  Many of us have sent a letter on September 16 making this point. This \nconfirmation process on judges has virtually ground to a halt. That is \nunfair. It is unfair to the judges that have been appointed and are \nawaiting confirmation. It is unfair to the Federal court system, unfair \nto the American people. This is only about politics--only about \npolitics.\n  Now, the statistics are quite clear. In election years previously \nwhen we controlled the Senate, we did not do this. We pushed through a \nsubstantial number of judges. If you compare the numbers--I invite \nanybody to compare the numbers--what we see this year is a very few \njudges confirmed and many left on the calendar, with some proposing \nthat that is it, we will not have time to do them, or refuse to do \nthem, or will not do them. I think that is not fair to those awaiting \nconfirmation or to the American people.\n  We have confirmed fewer than 20 district court judges and not a \nsingle appellate judge during this session of Congress. The number of \nconfirmations--in our letter, we point out--even in past Presidential \nelection years far exceeded what we are experiencing today. For \nexample, the Senate confirmed an average of almost 55 Federal judges, \nincluding 10 appellate judges annually in the years 1980, 1984, 1988, \n1992. In each of these years, the Senate Congress confirmed no fewer \nthan seven appellate court judges. In our letter, we write, ``Have \ncircumstances changed so dramatically that the Senate would now turn \nits back on our rich tradition of bipartisanship in appellate court \nconfirmations?''\n\n[[Page S10741]]\n\n  I hope things have not changed that much. Circuit court dockets have \ngrown by over 20 percent in the last 5 years, we are told by the \njudiciary. So the failure to do this is not just a political failure, \nbut it is a failure that has profound impact on the Federal court \nsystem. To our knowledge, none of the nominees that are awaiting action \non the floor have been opposed by any member of the Judiciary Committee \nfor any ideological reasons. Some of us, who believe that the Senate \nought to complete its work on this, simply say, let us have votes on \nthese confirmations. The names are here, the nominations have been \nmade, and the candidates are available.\n  There was a need for these judges to be placed in the Federal \njudiciary, and this Senate has a responsibility to act. As I said \npreviously, this is not a circumstance that existed in prior years. But \nthis year it has been like pulling teeth to get any judgeships through \nthis Senate, because some believe that since they control the Senate, \nthere should be no judges appointed by an opposing party. It reminds me \nof the line-item veto legislation, which I supported for years in the \nHouse, and I supported it here. We passed it here, and the majority \nparty said they wanted it, but they did not want this President to have \nit during his term. We passed it, but they prevented President Clinton \nfrom having it this year. They control the Senate, and they were able \nto do that.\n  That didn't make much sense to me. Nor does this make any sense to \nme. Let's confirm judges. That's our job and our responsibility. It \ndoesn't matter who is President; appointments come and confirmations \nought to be made. This Senate ought to act.\n  So if there are those who think we are going to adjourn and slap each \nother on the back and thank each other for a job well done and leave \nall these judgeships in the lurch, for political reasons, they need to \nthink again, because a fair number of us will insist that we do our \nwork before we adjourn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GREENE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \nprofessional, a loyal public servant, a staff member and Senate \nofficial who has served the Senate with allegiance and honor during his \n28 years of working for this body, in this body, and with this body--\nHoward O. Greene.\n\n     It isn't enough that we say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     And it isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n     Then when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid,\n     For fear to do so might make him vain\n     Or cause him to lose his head;\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done'',\n     And see how his gratitude swells;\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Yesterday, a goodly number of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nexpressed their word to the living. Howard Greene served the Senate \nsince 1968 as a door messenger, a Cloakroom assistant, the Assistant \nSecretary for the Minority, Secretary for the Majority, Secretary for \nthe Minority, and most recently as Senate Sergeant at Arms.\n  Now, these are the bare facts about Howard Greene's Senate career. \nBut there is much more than one could say about Howard Greene's work. \nOver the years, I found him to be an individual of unfailing courtesy \nand cooperativeness, one who was always respectful of the Senators on \nthis side of the aisle as well as those on the other side. His word was \nalways his bond, and that counts a great deal in this day and time. He \nwas a man of strict principle in this Chamber, and absolute dedication \nto duty, dedication to his party, dedication to the Senate.\n  He carried out his many responsibilities in the various Senate \noffices which he held with distinction and uncommon integrity. He \nunfailingly presented his views in an objective and straightforward \nmanner.\n  During my years in the majority as leader of my party, and during my \nyears in the minority as leader of my party in the Senate, I always \nfound Howard Greene to be trustworthy, forthright, straightforward, \nhonest. It was not just a job for Howard Greene; it was a calling. He \nliterally devoted his life to this institution. And so today, he richly \ndeserves all of the accolades of yesterday, when a resolution \ncommending him for his outstanding service and an outstanding career \nwas adopted by the full Senate.\n  He will be missed on both sides of the aisle. I will miss him, and he \nwill be missed on a personal and on a professional basis. I wish him \nall the best in his future endeavors, and I hope that he will come \naround and see his old friends.\n  I consider him to be my friend. Friendship crosses the aisle, \nfriendship crosses party lines. ``He that hath friends must show \nhimself friendly.''\n  I say to my true and dear friend, John Chafee, a Republican Senator \nfrom the State of Rhode Island, who is my friend, has been my friend, \nand will always be my friend, that we should treasure friendships. I \ntreasure a friend and a friendship like that of Howard Greene.\n\n     I shot an arrow into the air,\n     It fell to earth, I knew not where;\n     For, so swiftly it flew, the sight\n     Could not follow it in its flight.\n\n     I breathed a song into the air,\n     It fell to earth, I knew not where;\n     For who has sight so keen and strong,\n     That it can follow the flight of song?\n\n     Long, long afterward, in an oak\n     I found the arrow, still unbroke;\n     And the song, from beginning to end,\n     I found again in the heart of a friend----\n\n  Howard Greene.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia for the very kind comments that he made about the \nfriendship that we have had. I am here now in my 20th year, and as I \nlook back on the individuals I have known here and the friends I have \nhad and the respect I have for them, there is none that stands higher \nthan the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who I feel \nlucky to have known. We have worked together on issues. Sometimes we \nhave been in opposition on issues, I will confess to that, but never \nwith rancor and always with friendship and always with, certainly from \nmy point of view, respect, and I would like to believe the respect was \nmutual.\n  I am absolutely confident that there is no tribute that Howard Greene \nhas received on this floor that will mean more to him than the one he \nhas received from the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, \nbecause he has, as do all the Members on this side and all the Members \nof the Senate, tremendous respect and affection for the gentleman who \nonce upon a time was majority leader, and he has been minority leader. \nHe has had every post in\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\nthe Senate. And Howard Greene, I know, will be very, very pleased to \nreceive the accolades that came from the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his kind remarks. He is a gentleman, and his high dedication \nto purpose is worthy of adulation and emulation. I shall always \ntreasure our associations over the years, and I look forward to the \nfuture years of service with my friend, John Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator and say how \nflattered I am by the kind comments that the Senator from West Virginia \nmade about me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10741-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10742-S10756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5361\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I call now for my amendment No. 5361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. It is now the \npending question.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5361, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, and I send that modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5361), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Page 78, line 12, strike ``and aircraft engine \n     emissions,''.\n       Page 78, line 19 through 24, strike all of paragraph (C) \n     and insert the following:\n       (C)(1) The Environmental Protection Agency shall consult \n     with the Federal Aviation Administration on aircraft engine \n     emission standards.\n       (2) The Environmental Protection Agency shall not change \n     the aircraft engine emission standards if such change would \n     significantly increase noise and adversely affect safety.\n       (3) The Administrator, as the Administrator deems \n     appropriate, shall provide for the participation of a \n     representative of the Environmental Protection Agency on such \n     advisory committees or associated working groups that advise \n     the Administrator on matters related to the environmental \n     effects of aircraft and aircraft engines.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have been able to \nreach an agreement with the managers on this issue. The amendment \noffered on behalf of Senator Chafee and myself corrects language in the \nbill that creates overlapping authority in the EPA and the FAA, \nconflicting regulations, and fiscal waste.\n  The result of the Commerce Committee's proposal contained in S. 1994 \nwould have been confusion and uncertainty for the airline industry, and \nunnecessary burdens for the taxpayers.\n  Let me explain the situation briefly. The Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990 require the EPA to set emission standards for new aircraft \nengines. The bill before us, however, grants the FAA the very same \nauthority. Thus, two different agencies would have the same authority.\n  With all the effort by this administration and Congress to downsize \nthe bureaucracy and trim agency budgets, I don't think the committee \nintended this duplication. The Secretary of Transportation acknowledges \nthat, if this provision became law, the FAA would have had to develop \nthe expertise and capacity to set emission standards. So this bill \nwould have required an entirely new office, with a new budget and new \nworkers all to do a job already being done by the EPA.\n  This just didn't make sense. The FAA is now straining to meet its \nbasic responsibilities in aviation security and safety. We should not \ndivert them from those critical missions by forcing them to duplicate \nwork already being performed by another agency.\n  Mr. President, this amendment corrects the situation by eliminating \nthe provision in S. 1994 which creates the FAA's duplicate authority \nover emission standards. I'm pleased that the compromise we reached \nwith the managers also requires greater cooperation between the two \nagencies by directing the EPA to consult with the FAA prior to setting \nnew emission standards for aircraft engines. The amendment also allows \nthe FAA Administrator to include representatives from the EPA on \nadvisory committees that deal with issues of aircraft standards.\n  This should facilitate coordination between EPA, the FAA and \ninterested parties early in the development of any future regulations.\n  In conclusion, I believe this amendment makes good sense all around. \nIt protects the taxpayer by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and \nduplication. It encourages better dialogue between government and \nindustry. And it avoids any weakening of our environmental standards.\n  I'm pleased the managers of the bill have accepted the amendment and \nI thank them for their willingness to work with us on this important \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis cooperation and the modification of his amendment. As far as this \nSenator is concerned, as far as our side is concerned and the \nadministration is concerned, his modification makes his amendment now \nacceptable.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McCain, is working on one \nother amendment. We feel we are ready to go at some point with your \namendment, which will be accepted, I am sure. I do thank him, again, \nfor his cooperation and congeniality.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky for his help on this and also \nSenator McCain, the floor manager of this legislation. This is \nsomething that has been worked out. Amazingly enough, we seem to have \neverybody satisfied. Having seen these things in the past, I am a great \nbeliever in getting things done, if we can.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum and see perhaps if we can get \nSenator McCain here just briefly and get this one accepted, if it is \nagreeable. If there is no other business, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FORD. As far as Senator Chafee's amendment is concerned, now, as \nmodified, this side has no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment. But \nalso I would like to thank Senator Chafee. He is the watchdog in this \nbody for environmental issues. I am very grateful that he would reach \nthis compromise so that we can move forward with the bill. Frankly, I \nthink the bill will be stronger now that we have his seal of approval. \nSo we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 5361, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5361), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Simon amendment \nNo. 5364.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Simon \namendment be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Again, I want to express my appreciation to Senator \nMcCain and Senator Ford for their assistance in this, also the folks \nfrom the FAA and EPA.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we sometimes appear not to be working as it \nrelates to the camera in the Senate Chamber. However, those that have \nbeen observing from the balcony and those who are staff and Senators \nwill understand we have been working feverishly for about the last 2 \nhours in order to accommodate Senators who have amendments that are \nreworded and so forth so that we might move forward with legislation \nthat is meaningful and that is doable.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. \nWe arrived at an agreement and modified his amendment and we were able \nto accept that.\n  I want everyone to know we have been working hard to put this piece \nof legislation together. It is important. Hopefully, we will be able to \nfinish by 2 o'clock.\n\n\n                           Amendment No.5359\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding acts of \n                        international terrorism)\n\n  Mr. FORD.

EXPENDITURES FROM AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       Section 9502(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to expenditures from Airport and Airway Trust Fund) \n     is amended by--\n       (1) striking ``1996'' and inserting ``1997''; and\n       (2) inserting ``or the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act \n     of 1996'' after ``Administration Authorization Act of 1994''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this bill calls for expenditures from the \nairport and airway trust fund.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee while he is in the Chamber. This legislation has a \nlot of implications associated with it concerning the way we are going \nto fund the Federal Aviation Administration, and a great deal of what \nis going to happen in the future falls under the authority of the \nFinance Committee. I thank Senator Roth for his cooperation, for \njoining us in an effort at reforming the Federal Aviation \nAdministration financially and for finding ways that we can fully fund \nit. I believe we could not have done so without the spirit of \ncooperation that he and his staff have displayed.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Let me join my colleague in complimenting Senator Roth. I \nbelieve it was almost unanimous among\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\nthose Senators who were here last night who were very concerned about \nthe so-called ticket tax expiring on December 31 and going through a \n10-month hiatus as we had, and it was finally worked out. Many of our \ncolleagues are going to be asking about additional security operations, \nnew and innovative ideas, new machinery, LOI's, letters of intent, that \nwe have on airports, things of that nature.\n  I encourage the Senator, if he could, to find a way in his good work \nto see if there is something we could do to extend the so-called ticket \ntax until such time as a report comes back with suggestions from the \ngroup on how to finance FAA. I think it would meet with a great many \naccolades and applause, and so forth, if he could do that.\n  Many of us have projects that are ongoing, and many of us have \nletters of intent. I do not want any Senator to look at me and say, \n``Where is the money?'' and I did not make every effort to try to \naccomplish that. So I say that to my friend in a spirit of cooperation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished colleague as \nto the urgency for action in this area, and the desire for the Finance \nCommittee to move expeditiously on the tax matters. I have to say, like \nthe Senator from Kentucky, I am very concerned about the security of \nthe airports and want to work very closely with the Commerce Committee \nin assuring it is adequate, and that whatever financing is necessary \nbecomes available.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Emergency Revocation Amendment to S. 1994\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment \nregarding the Federal Aviation Administration's [FAA] emergency \nrevocation powers; however, after conferring with the chairman and \nranking member I have withdrawn my amendment because they have agreed \nto work with me on this issue in the 105th Congress.\n  Aviation safety not only requires consistent diligence, but also \nbalance. It is balance that my amendment sought to achieve between the \nrights of the airmen to use their certificates and the need for the FAA \nto immediately revoke the certificates of unsafe operators. Over the \npast several years we have witnessed a sharp increase in the number of \nemergency revocations. In an revocation action, brought on an emergency \nbasis, the airman or other certificate holder loses the use of the \ncertificate immediately, without an intermediary review by an impartial \nthird party. The result is that the airman is grounded and in most \ncases out of work until the issue is adjudicated.\n  My amendment would have established a procedure whereby the airman \ncould request a hearing before the NTSB Board on an expedited basis to \ndetermine if a true emergency existed and therefore justified the \nimmediate revocation of the airman's certificate. If the NTSB decided \nno emergency existed, then the airman could have use of his certificate \nwhile the FAA pursued their case against the airman. If the NTSB \ndecided an emergency existed then the revocation would remain in effect \nuntil the case could be fully adjudicated.\n  Given the chairman's assurances of his willingness to work with me on \nthis issue in the 105th Congress, I have withdrawn my amendment and \nlook forward to working him and the ranking member to address this \nproblem.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to \nassure him that it is my intention that the committee work closely with \nhim on this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further, I concur with Chairman \nPressler and want to add my assurances that the Subcommittee on \nAviation will throughly examine this issue through the hearing process \nin the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, I too want to assure the \nSenator from Oklahoma that we will work with him to address the problem \nhe has highlighted.\n  Mr. FORD. If the Senator will yield, I agree with the chairman that \nwe should review this issue more closely in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairmen and ranking members. I appreciate \ntheir willingness to not only discuss this issue but to come to some \nresolution.\n  Mr. BURNS. I join my colleagues in calling for hearings on this \nimportant issue. This issue deserves our immediate attention and I look \nforward to working with the chairman in developing a record on this \nissue.\n\n\n                          The ``Age 60 Rule''\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I should like to address a critical issue \nthat is very familiar to Members of this body who have been involved \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration--it is the ``age 60 rule.'' In \n1959, the FAA implemented a regulation to prohibit pilots, having \nreached the age of 60, from flying jets regulated by part 121 of the \nFAA regulations--that is, passenger-carrying jets with more than 30 \nseats. This year, the FAA has extended that ban to include commuter \njets with more than 10 seats.\n  I do not want to hold up this very important bill in order to carry \nout a lengthy debate on whether or not the ban is justifiable. I am not \nhere to overturn that rule. Indeed, few of us here would be in any way \nqualified to do such a thing. Instead, I believe the FAA must certainly \nbe willing to treat pilots over the age of 60 in a manner that is fair \nand consistent with its treatment of other pilots.\n  The FAA, acting in the interest of public safety has concluded that \npilots--however experienced they may be--over the age of 60 should not \nbe allowed to fly. I would submit, however, that this conclusion has \nnot been supported through any independent study. It can not be \naccurately studied because no U.S. pilot over the age of 60 has been \nallowed to fly ``part 121'' aircraft at any time during the last 36 \nyears.\n  In light of this situation, the judiciary--in a number of cases, but \nnotably in the October 31, 1990 Baker versus FAA (7th Circuit Court of \nAppeals)--has upheld the FAA's position for the reason, as they stated, \nthat the issue of age discrimination is clearly subordinate to that of \npassenger safety. The court did point out, however, that one of the \nFAA's own studies on flight time for class III pilots indicated that \npilots between 60 and 70 with more than 1,000 hours of total flight \ntime and more than 50 hours of recent flight time had the lowest \naccident rates of any age group of pilots.\n  In conclusion, the court admitted that these pilots face a catch 22 \nin that they are unable to obtain exemptions from the age 60 rule until \nthey can show they can fly large passenger aircraft safely, yet they \ncannot show such ability until they obtain an exemption. In the end, \nthe court affirmed the FAA's order, saying, ``it is supported by \nsubstantial, albeit certainly not compelling evidence.''\n  In the FAA's ``part 121'' regulations, the FAA is empowered to grant \nexemptions to this rule if it ``finds that such action would be in the \npublic interest,'' however, no exemptions have ever been granted \nregardless of physical condition or safety record. This is in spite of \nthe fact that the FAA currently issues special certificates to pilots \nunder the age of 60 with histories of alcohol abuse or even heart \nconditions. The FAA's explanation is that it has ``present tests that \ncan predict the expected course of a known medical deficiency'' such as \nheart disease or alcoholism ``with sufficient accuracy to allow valid, \nindividualized judgments'' but that ``the same accuracy is not possible \nwhen assessing the decrements associated with the aging process.'' I do \nnot believe this is a consistent policy or a fair treatment of many \npilots with impeccable records, but who also have more than 60 years of \nlife behind them.\n\n  In this bill, which will do so much to advance the issue of airline \nsafety, I think it is a tragedy that there has been no mention of the \nfact that hundreds of this country's potentially safest and most \nexperienced pilots have been grounded because of a rule with little or \nno empirical basis. I strongly believe that the FAA should outline the \ncriteria by which it would consider exempting certain pilots from the \n``age 60 rule,'' so that even a very small number of exceptionally fit \npilots could be studied in order to form the basis for a future review \nof this outdated rule.\n  I know this issue was briefly touched upon in Commerce Committee \nhearings, but it was not explored in enough depth, so I would like to \nask my friend from Arizona, chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, whether he would\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nconsider calling hearings on this important issue to many airline \npilots, the ``age 60 rule.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend that the Aviation Subcommittee has \nheld a number of hearings on this in the past and I would again \nconsider having additional hearings on this very important matter.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator for his courtesy and his extremely \nhard work on this legislation.\n\n\n                    Terrorism and Aviation Security\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee for moving forward on this important bill and \nfor including provisions that seek to address terrorism and aviation \nsecurity. I have worked with the chairman on these important provisions \nfor many months. The Gore Commission recommended that the FAA move \nforward expeditiously with deployment of advanced explosive detection \nequipment, and this legislation contains provisions to implement that \nrecommendation.\n  For too long our efforts have fixated on finding the perfect \ntechnology that will give us a silver bullet against terrorism at our \nairports. While other countries have deployed explosive detection \ntechnology that is commercially available, economically reasonable, and \ncompatible with realistic air carrier operating conditions, our \nresearch-oriented approach has resulted in the U.S. deploying nothing, \nand thus becoming an attractive target for terrorists.\n  It is my understanding that the language in the managers' amendment \nrequires the FAA Administrator to deploy existing, commercially \navailable, and operationally practicable explosive detection devices.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. This legislation requires the FAA to begin immediate \ndeployment of commercially available explosive detection equipment. \nThis deployment will occur as an interim measure to address airport and \nair carrier security vulnerabilities while the FAA continues to \nundertake research and operational testing of equipment such as the \nCTX.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota if I am \ncorrect that the language contained in this bill will result in the \nspeedy deployment of a variety of explosive detection systems that are \ncost effective, and compatible with realistic operating conditions, \nsuch as those systems manufactured by Vivid Technologies, Thermedics \nDetection, EG, IonTrack, and AS\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect--that is the intent of this bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nhis clarification and I voice my strong support for these security \nprovisions.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, for years we have been asking passengers \nto pay money to support the safety needs of the aviation system. In \n1970, Congress created the airport and airway trust fund as a means to \nmake sure that the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] had enough \nmoney to build and support our Nation's airports and the FAA's own air \ntraffic control system.\n  The FAA's mission is to oversee the safety of the traveling public. \nWhen any accident occurs, as we have seen in the recent ValuJet and TWA \naccidents, there are many possible reasons for the accident. People on \ntelevision are quick to rush to conclusions. We use the expertise of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] to determine the cause \nof a crash. The Everglades crash scene, as Bob Francis, Vice Chairman \nof the NTSB, has indicated, was extremely treacherous and necessitated \na difficult investigation. The TWA accident presents the additional \ncomplication of a criminal investigation carried on side-by-side with \nthe accident investigation. One thing is certain--the FAA must be fully \nfunded to meet the challenges and aviation growth in the future.\n  S. 1994 incorporates much of the text of S. 1239, the FAA reform \nbill, reported by the Commerce Committee last November. Those \nprovisions call for an independent review of the precise needs of the \nFAA, followed by the submission of a funding proposal to finance the \nagency. The industry must recognize that ultimately we have to decide \nhow best to support and fund the agency. Delay is no longer an option.\n\n\n                          Oversight of Safety\n\n  When we take a broad perspective, we do know that aviation is the \nsafest form of transportation. More than 40,000 people die each year in \nhighway accidents. According to testimony before the Commerce \nCommittee, more people die each year because of electrocution--525--\nthan because of airline crashes. Yet, the tragic crash of ValuJet \nflight 592 into the Florida Everglades on May 11 is significant because \nit may well have been avoidable.\n  We can go back over every action by the FAA, every inspector general \n[IG] report, every report by the General Accounting Office [GAO], and \nstill not resolve what is safe. If someone says ``you need more \ninspectors or better training for inspectors,'' and a crash occurs, the \nperson pushing for more inspectors and training is touted as a sage by \nthe media. Anyone, however, can pick any issue in the aviation field, \nmake a broad statement, and tomorrow there may be a crash that may make \nthe statement appear to be the essence of wisdom.\n  The FAA oversees the activities of carriers and maintenance \nfacilities through its inspector work force. Each air carrier is \nassigned a principal operations, maintenance, and avionics inspector. \nFor a large carrier, there may be 30 to 60 FAA inspectors assigned to \noversee its operations. In addition, the FAA uses ``geographic'' \ninspectors who, for example, are responsible for air carrier operations \nat a particular airport or area. The geographic inspector may conduct \nramp inspections on a wide variety of aircraft types, even though the \ninspector may only be certificated on one aircraft type. As a general \nmatter, FAA inspectors are extremely well qualified. An air carrier \noperations inspector, for example, is required to hold a pilot's \nlicense, with a minimum of 1,500 flight hours.\n  The DOT IG's office testified on April 30 before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on problems concerning the inspector \nwork force. Substantial and serious concerns were raised and as a \nresult I asked the chairman for a hearing on that matter. The concerns \nraised by the IG included insufficient training for inspectors and the \ninadequate computerization of inspection reports. These are legitimate \nconcerns that must be addressed.\n  The FAA will be completing a review of its inspector work force \nperhaps this week. I wrote to the FAA Administrator expressing my \ndesire to work with him to address the inspector issues. GAO has \nindicated that the FAA inspectors need substantial training, perhaps \n$17 million more than requested by the FAA. The training budget has \nbeen cut by 42 percent from the 1993 level. If we are to expect the FAA \ninspectors to do their job properly, they must be adequately trained \nand have the tools needed to do their job. For example, the FAA is \nstruggling with developing a computer system to track inspector safety \nreports. The inspectors are frustrated with the new computer system, \nand spend far too much time inputting data, rather than doing \ninspections. The system is supposed to be able to aid the FAA in \ntargeting its resources. FAA management must work with its work force \nto get that system back on track so that the inspectors have confidence \nin the system. DOT needs additional inspectors.\n\n\n                           Aviation Security\n\n  Aviation security is an extremely complex issue. It involves \ntechnology, people, intelligence information, national security, and a \nrecognition that there are people willing to commit heinous crimes \naimed at our government and our citizens.\n  On December 21, 1988, Pan Am flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, \nScotland, killing 270 people. It took almost 2 years to pass \nlegislation to address some of the problems that stemmed from that \ncrash.\n\n  Investigators in New York have not yet identified the cause of the \ncrash of TWA flight 800, and numerous options are being considered. We \nhave to let the investigators complete their mission. The NTSB, Navy, \nFBI, and State and local personnel are working hard to determine the \ncause of the accident. We do know this, however--the public deserves \nthe best technology operated by the best trained individuals, to reduce \nthe risks of a terrorist attack.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\n  Another thing is clear--security is going to be costly. The FAA has \nestimated that it will cost as much as $2.2 billion to install up to \n1,800 machines at 75 airports. Today, there are approximately 14,000 to \n18,000 screeners, paid an average of $10,000 to $15,000 per year. These \nscreeners are one line of defense, but a critical one in the fight \nagainst terrorism. They need training, and they need to be paid in \naccordance with their responsibilities. The present turnover rate among \nthese employees is extremely high. Unless we change the way we provide \nsecurity, we cannot upgrade it. All the technology in the world still \nrequires a person to watch a screen, listen to alarms, and be able to \nrecognize materials that should not go on board an aircraft.\n  No matter what we do, safety comes first. Nothing should go onto an \naircraft without being screened. Cargo, company material, and baggage \nall should be subject to inspection.\n  Security changes may require a fundamental alteration in the way air \ncarriers provide services. Longer lines can be expected. Unfortunately, \nit is a price we must pay to deal with people in this world willing to \nstop at nothing.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill.\n\n\n                       Noise Mitigation Programs\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Within the programs authorized in S. 1994, the Federal \nAviation Administration reauthorization bill, are allocations for noise \nmitigation. Under the Airport Improvement Program [AIP], the Federal \nAviation Administration [FAA] has allocated funds to airports of all \nsizes to implement noise mitigation programs. Due to lower funding \nlevels of the AIP, the FAA has recently implemented a rule that limits \nan airport to $8 million maximum for Federal noise mitigation funds--$5 \nmillion a year for single family housing and $3 million a year for all \nother uses.\n  Mr. President, while this type of new cap may be appropriate in \ncertain circumstances, I believe that a single cap, regardless of an \nairport interests or needs, is inappropriate for two reasons. First, in \nevaluating existing noise programs around the country, I think it is \nevident that certain airports have made noise mitigation a top \npriority. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, for example, has been \nthe national leader and was the first to implement the local housing \ninsulation program to reduce noise impacts in houses surrounding the \nairport. Having enacted noise mitigation programs, certain airports \nthat enacted plans prior to imposition of this new cap, and after \nextensive negotiations and commitments with both the surrounding \ncommunities and the FAA, are now expected to follow through on previous \ncommitments. If the program cost exceeds the new cap, the FAA is \nessentially abandoning its previous commitments. I believe that is \nunacceptable.\n  Second, it is clear that large airports in densely populated areas \nshould have to implement broader noise mitigation programs than small, \ngeneral aviation airports. For that reason, a single, hard cap for all \nairports, regardless of size and location, is not the best way to \ndistribute funds in an equitable manner.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona knows that I included \nlanguage in the fiscal year 1997 Transportation appropriations Senate \nreport that directs the FAA to consider pledges and agreements made by \nthe airport authority, in consultation with the FAA, to communities \nprior to the promulgation of the new ceiling, and to make appropriate \nexceptions to the policy where necessary to meet legitimate \nexpectations of neighborhoods near airports. Because the fiscal year \n1997 Transportation appropriations House report was silent on the \nissue, the Senate language is the prevailing language that should be \nfollowed by the FAA.\n  I believe it is appropriate, however, to also discuss this matter \nwithin the context of this legislation to ensure that my sentiments on \nthis issue are correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senator from Washington. We all \nunderstand that, in an era of constrained budgets, it may be necessary \nfor the FAA to try to limit noise mitigation funds per airport. As the \nSenator mentioned, however, I agree that where prior commitments have \nbeen made it is necessary and appropriate that the FAA show flexibility \nso that those commitments may be honored.\n\n\n                        Train Whistle Provision\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the managers' amendment to the \nlegislation before us includes a provision that provides important \ndirection to the Department of Transportation with regard to the \nimplementation of a provision of the Swift Rail Development Act of \n1994.\n  Under this 1994 law, the Federal Government is required to develop \nregulations that direct trains to sound their whistles at all hours of \nthe day and night at most at-grade railroad crossings around the \ncountry, unless the local communities can afford to act on a specified \nlist of alternatives. The Swift Rail Development Act will require \ntrains to blow their whistles at approximately 168,000 railroad \ncrossings in the United States and more than 9,900 in Illinois--\nincluding about 2,000 in the Chicago area and 1,000 in Cook County \nalone.\n  This provision was inserted into the 1994 law without debate or \ndiscussion. Communities had no input into the process, even though it \nwill be communities that will be most affected.\n  I am acutely aware of the need to improve the safety of railroad \ncrossings. A recent tragedy in my home State involving a train and a \nschoolbus in Fox River Grove, IL, killed seven children and shattered \nthe lives of many more families. According to statistics published by \nthe Department of Transportation, someone is hit by a train every 90 \nminutes. In 1994, there were nearly 2,000 injuries and 615 fatalities \ncaused by accidents at railroad crossings around the country. Clearly, \nensuring the safety of our rail crossings is imperative.\n  The Swift Rail Development Act mandates that trains sound their \nwhistles at every railroad crossing around the country that does not \nconform to specific safety standards. It does not take into \nconsideration the effect of this action on communities, nor does it \nrequire the Department of Transportation to take into consideration the \npast safety records at affected at-grade crossings.\n  Requiring trains to blow their whistles at every crossing would have \na considerable effect on people living near these crossings. It is \nunclear, however, that there would be a commensurate improvement in \nsafety. In Fox River Grove, for example, the engineer blew his whistle \nas he approached the road crossing, but the schoolbus did not move.\n  At many railroad crossings in Illinois and elsewhere, accidents never \nor rarely occur, while some crossings are the sites of frequent \ntragedies. Just as we do not impose the same safety mandates on every \ntraffic intersection in the country, we should not universally require \ntrains to blow their whistles at every railroad crossing in the \ncountry.\n  When transportation officials decide to make safety improvements at a \nhighway intersection, they consider a wide range of factors, including \nits accident history, traffic patterns, and conditions in the \nsurrounding area. Every intersection is a case study. There are \nguidelines, but not inflexible rules.\n\n  The approach to railroad crossing safety should be no less reasoned. \nThe train whistle should be one tool in the transportation safety \nofficial's regulatory repertoire; it should not be the only one. \nBecause every community has a different history and different needs, I \ndo not believe that a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to railroad \ncrossing safety is appropriate.\n  In Dupage County, IL, for example, there are 159 public railroad \ncrossings. In 1994, there were accidents at only 18 of these crossings, \nand 45 have not experienced an accident in at least 40 years. On one of \nMETRA's commuter rail lines, 64 trains per day pass through 35 \ncrossings. In the last 5 years, there have been a total of three \naccidents and one fatality along the entire length of this corridor.\n  Every one of the crossings on this METRA commuter line has a whistle \nban in place to preserve the quiet of the surrounding communities. The \nimposition of a Federal train whistle mandate on this line would, \ntherefore, have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life \nof area residents. The safety benefits, on the other hand, would, at \nbest, be only marginal.\n  METRA's Chicago to Fox Lake line has 54 crossings and is used by 86 \ntrains per day. A whistle ban is in place on 37\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nof these crossings. Between 1991 and 1995, there were a total of 13 \naccidents on this line, with 5 injuries and 1 fatality.\n  In Des Plaines, IL, one of my constituents reports that she lives \nnear 5 crossings. In the last 11 years, there has been only one \naccident at any of these crossings. She will hear a train whistle at \nleast 64 times per day and night.\n  In Arlington Heights, IL, there are four crossings in the downtown \narea about 300 feet away from one another. A total of 5,400 residents \nlive within one-half mile of downtown, and 3,500 people commute to the \narea every day for work. Sixty-three commuter and four freight trains \npass through Arlington Heights every weekday between the hours of 5:30 \na.m. and 1:15 a.m.\n  Train whistles are blown at nearly 150 decibels, and depending on the \nweather, they can be heard for miles. According to one Burlington \nNorthern railroad conductor, a train traveling from Downers Grove, IL \nto La Vergne, IL--a distance of approximately 12 miles--would have to \nblow its whistle 124 times. There are 144 trains traveling this route \nevery day.\n  Mr. President, the residents of these communities, and others across \nIllinois and the country, are confused by the 1994 law that will \nrequire train whistles to sound at all hours of the day and night in \ntheir communities--in some cases hundreds of times per day--at railroad \ncrossings that have not experienced accidents in decades, if ever.\n  Under a Federal train whistle mandate, homeowners in many of these \ncommunities would experience a decline in their property values, or an \nincrease in their local taxes in order to pay for expensive safety \nimprovements. The 1994 law, in this respect, represents either a taking \nof private property value, or an unfunded mandate on local communities.\n  The train whistle mandate places the entire burden on the community. \nTrains will keep rolling through quiet, densely populated towns at all \nhours of the night, and both the railroads and the passengers will \nexperience no disruptions.\n  In aviation, by contrast, airline flights are routinely routed to \nminimize the disturbance to surrounding communities. Flight curfews are \nestablished, and restrictions are placed on certain types of aircraft \nin efforts to minimize the disruption to area residents. These \nrestrictions place burdens on airlines, passengers, and the \ncommunities; it is a joint effort.\n  The pending legislation includes a provision providing the Department \nof Transportation with important direction on how to implement the \ntrain whistle law in a more rational and flexible manner. It directs \nthe Secretary of Transportation to consider the interests of affected \ncommunities, as well as the past safety records at affected railroad \ncrossings. The concerns of local communities must be heard--not just \nthe sounds of train whistles.\n  It also addresses safety concerns. In situations where railroad \ncrossings are determined not to meet the supplementary safety \nrequirements, communities will have up to a maximum of 3 years to \ninstall additional safety measures before the train whistle mandate \ntakes affect. In these situations, the Department of Transportation \nwill work in partnership with affected communities to develop a \nreasonable schedule for the installation of additional safety measures.\n  Mr. President, I have been concerned about the implementation of the \nSwift Rail Development Act since Karen Heckmann, one of my \nconstituents, first brought it to my attention more than a year ago. \nSince that time, I have spoken and met with mayors, officials, and \nconstituents from Illinois communities, and visited areas that would be \nmost severely affected. In response to their concerns, I have written \nseveral letters to, and met with Transportation Secretary Pena and \nother officials numerous times, and have been working with the \nDepartment of Transportation to ensure that they implement the 1994 law \nin a manner that both works for communities and protects safety.\n  The pending legislation provides important congressional direction to \nthe Department of Transportation that is consistent with the ongoing \ndiscussions that I, and other members of Congress, continue to have \nwith the Department.\n  The Senate adopted a functionally identical amendment to the \nTransportation appropriations bill this summer. During conference \ncommittee consideration of that bill, the amendment was deleted and \nlanguage was instead inserted into the conference report that \naccompanies that bill.\n  I am pleased that the Senate today will again pass the strong, \nlegislative language providing direction to the Department of \nTransportation. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Ron Wyden, for \nhis work on this issue, and also the members of the Commerce Committee \nfor again accepting this important provision.\n  Mr. KERRY. This bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration is good legislation. I would like to commend the \ndiligent efforts of several Senators in drafting this legislation and \nin shepherding it through the committee process--including Senators \nFord, McCain, Hollings, and Pressler, and also the work of their \ncapable and helpful staffs.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important bill to our Nation because \nthe FAA plays such a critical role in our nation's transportation \ninfrastructure. We ask the FAA each year to ensure the safety of all \ncivil aviation and to oversee the continued development of our national \nsystem of airports. Significantly, through a comprehensive program that \nincludes a vast air traffic control network, and thousands of \nmaintenance inspections of our nation's civilian airlines, the FAA \ncarries out the important task of ensuring the safety of the millions \nof Americans that utilize air travel each year. This bill is also \nimportant to Massachusetts which relies very heavily on air transport \nfor both people and cargo. From Logan Airport in Boston to the smaller \nairports located throughout Massachusetts, airports and air transport \nare critical to the economic and social travel needs of the people of \nMassachusetts.\n  Foremost, I support this bill because it provides the FAA with the \nnecessary tools to carry out these important tasks. S. 1994 provides \nthe FAA with $9.28 billion in total budget authority for fiscal year \n1997 which includes $5 billion for operations, $2.28 billion for the \nairport improvement program, $1.8 billion for facilities and equipment, \nand $200 million for research, engineering, and development. This total \nfigure represents an increase of $1.13 billion over the FAA's total \nbudget authority for fiscal year 1996 and an increase of $1.07 billion \nover the administration's budget request.\n  But this bill does more than simply provide funding. In order to \nimprove our civil aviation system, the bill seeks to reform and improve \nthe FAA's operations. The bill affords the FAA a needed measure of \nautonomy from the larger Department of Transportation. For example, the \nFAA administrator will have the final authority to accept or reject \nproposed changes to FAA regulations. This change moves the final word \nto where it belongs: the agency with the expertise. In addition, the \nbill places time restrictions on the FAA's ability to act on pleadings \nfrom the aviation industry and other interested parties. This change \nwill lend a measure of certainty to the timing of FAA actions and, \nthereby, make it easier for the industry to forge ahead with business \nplans that depend on FAA regulatory action.\n  The bill also contains a provision to make sure that smaller airports \ncontinue to receive sufficient financial assistance should FAA Federal \nfunding levels decline. Specifically, S. 1994 caps the percentage of \nfunding that can be allocated to large and medium airports. This \nprovision will permit smaller airports, such as those in New Bedford \nand North Adams, MA, to continue to receive a substantial level of FAA \nfunding.\n  I am pleased to note that the bill does not reverse the FAA's long-\nstanding and sensible policy of permitting multi-modal independent \nauthorities, such as the Massachusetts Port Authority, to function as \nintended by their enabling statutes. For years, MASSPORT has been \npermitted to manage a multi-modal transportation system for the Boston \nregion, using revenues from Logan Airport, the Port of Boston, Tobin \nBridge, and other activities, to administer the system as a whole. At \ndifferent times, this has meant that one individual component has \nsubsidized other components that\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nMASSPORT operates. Because the region relies on all components working \ntogether, federal law has recognized such subsidies as legitimate \nand permissible. Indeed, without the authority to merge revenues, the \nentire transportation infrastructure of the greater Boston region would \nbe thrown into chaos causing disastrous consequences for the region's \neconomy. I want to thank Senator McCain and his staff for working with \nmy staff on this issue so that a compromise could be reached that is \nacceptable to all parties involved. I also want to recognize the \nefforts of Minority Counsel Sam Whitehorn for his contributions to the \ndiscussions between our offices and the ultimate agreement.\n\n  I also would like to call the Senate's attention to the FAA's recent \ndecision to award the contract for designing and constructing the next \ngeneration of air traffic control systems, known as the Standard \nTerminal Automation Replacement System or STARS, to the Raytheon Co. \nwhich is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts. The STARS program \nwill provide a complete replacement of critical air traffic control \nradar displays of aircraft in the ``terminal area''--the airspace \nwithin 50 miles of an airport.--The systems in use today are based on \noutdated technologies and their replacement is absolutely essential to \nkeep up with our Nation's increased air traffic demands. I am proud \nthat this Massachusetts company, known for years to be on the cutting \nedge of important technological advances, has been given the \nopportunity to reconstruct our air traffic control systems for the 21st \ncentury. I am equally pleased that the location of first implementation \nis to be Logan Airport.\n  Finally, and importantly, I am very pleased that this bill contains \nsome very important steps toward enhancing airport security that will \nresult in greater safety for commercial flights originating at U.S. \nairports. I have been pushing the FAA for several years to begin to use \nexisting advanced technologies far more capable than x-rays and metal \ndetectors to screen passenger baggage for explosives before it is \nplaced on aircraft. At long last, based on the conclusions of the Gore \nCommission established by President Clinton to address airline security \nin the aftermath of the TWA crash off Long Island, the FAA will be \ninstructed to move forward in this respect. Rather than awaiting the \narrival of a new sensor technology that can meet all desired sensor \nstandards perfectly or nearly perfectly, the FAA will be instructed to \nprocure and implement use of the best currently available technology--\nwhich is the approach taken by virtually all European nations. It is \nlong past time for the United States to take this step. I have \naddressed this subject at greater length with Chairman Pressler \npreviously during this debate.\n  Mr. President, this is a well crafted bill. I will vote for this \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n   Support for FAA Authorization Bill Air Travel Safety and Security \n                               Provisions\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nmanagers of the FAA reauthorization bill for incorporating into the \nbill many of the provisions of the Travelers Rights Act which I \nintroduced prior to the August recess.\n  Mr. President, air travel is fundamental to our national \ntransportation system. Americans who travel across this Nation and \nglobally would not be able to conduct their business without the \nconveniences of air travel. However, recently the dangers of air travel \nhave become even more clear. With the risks of air travel in mind, I \nintroduced the Travelers Rights Act to provide for a way that consumers \ncould obtain safety information. To provide to the public the safety \nbackground on airlines is a matter of common sense. It is a matter of \npublic policy to provide citizens the information necessary for them to \nmake choices in most other areas basic to their health, safety, and \nwelfare. Given that food labeling must reveal ingredients, automobile \nlabels must indicate maintenance and mileage, and under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, recently reauthorized, water contaminants must be \nrevealed annually to the water users and communities, we should do \nrequire no less in regard to air travel.\n  Besides mandating intensified security and safety for air travel, the \nprovisions of the Travelers Rights Act that have been incorporated were \nthe travelers' access to information and the safety survey and reports \nthat the FAA will be required to submit to Congress. There is \ninformation that ought to be available and if the customer seeks the \ninformation the airlines should expeditiously provide it. This bill is \nnot to scare travelers about the safety and security of air travel, \nrather on the contrary, I believe this bill will inspire confidence \nthrough openness and knowledge. Additionally, if customers of air \ntravel exercise their right to know about certain elements about the \nairlines, aircraft, and crew then that too will enhance the trust \nbetween customers and the airlines. In this effort to require knowledge \nand the coordination of information, Senators Ford and Wyden have been \nextremely helpful in their communication with the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  I do regret that absent from title III of the FAA reauthorization is \nthe Victims Rights Program, which I see as integral to expediting the \ndistribution of information to the survivors of victims of terrible \nairline accidents and destruction. The responsible Federal agencies \nshould be coordinated better to provide families the details and facts \nas quickly as possible and in such a manner so that survivors can \ngrieve and cope with tragedy with all of the knowledge that they need.\n  But I do commend Senator Ford for integrating into title III of the \nbill the provisions of consumer access that the Travelers Rights Act \ncontained.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the Senate moves to a conference with \nthe House of Representatives on the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 1996, I am hopeful conferees will give \nthoughtful consideration to the provisions included in the manager's \namendment adopted Tuesday evening. I noted with some concern that a \nnumber of provisions in this amendment were new to the bill, and in \nsome cases, not germane to the purpose of the legislation. I hope my \ncolleagues will share my interest in assuring that an appropriate check \nand balance is maintained as the 104th Congress continues its \nlegislative work.\n  While I support swift enactment of this important measure to \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, I am concerned about a \nprovision of the bill included with the manager's amendment amending \nthe Johnson Act. In response to concerns about the rapid growth of \nlegalized gambling in the United States in recent years, Congress \nrecently approved legislation to create a 2-year National Gambling \nImpact Study Commission. This Commission will conduct a comprehensive \nreview of the social and economic impact of legalized gambling on our \nNation, and will provide a report to Congress, the President, \nGovernors, and others, on this important issue. Until we know more \nabout the effects of this recent national trend, I have reservations \nabout changing a Federal law that could allow for further expansion of \nlegalized gambling in the United States.\n\n\n                     Amendment to the Johnston Act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there was \nlanguage included in the manager's amendment to the Federal Aviation \nAuthorization Act of 1996 that would allow a gambling operation off the \ncoast of California.\n  I am the chief sponsor of legislation establishing a gambling \ncommission to study the impact of gaming on municipalities, states and \ntribal governments. It is my feeling that we are making a mistake by \nsanctioning this new operation before we have a chance to study the \nCommission's findings.\n  The Federal Aviation Authorization legislation is an important bill, \nwhich is why I offered my support despite the language amending the \nJohnston Act.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we are considering the reauthorization \nof the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]. The FAA performs a \ncritical role in managing our nation's air traffic control system, \nwhich handles two takeoffs and landings of aircraft every second of \nevery hour of every day. Yet most Americans are unaware of the \ncomplexity and scope of this system, and simply take it for granted.\n  Nonetheless, the deregulation of the airlines and expansion of the \nair transportation system have imposed significant strains upon the \nexisting system.\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\n Some air control centers are using older equipment that is not as \nreliable as what is currently available. Other centers, that lack both \nequipment and sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers, are forced \nto delay flights. Reform of the FAA is needed, because increasing \ndemand for air travel will only exacerbate these problems at our \nnation's major airports.\n  My own state of West Virginia, however, does not have a major hub \nairport. We have not had to worry about delays of frequently scheduled, \nand low-priced flights. Our problems have been of an entirely different \nmagnitude. We have had to endure the cancellation of flights, the end \nof airline service to some of our communities, and a huge increase in \nfares charged to passengers who fly out of airports in West Virginia.\n  This dramatic decline in airline service to my state has occurred as \na result of airline deregulation. On the day that I cast my 14,000 \nvote, I observed that one of the votes that I most regret was \nsupporting airline deregulation. At the time, I was told it would lead \nto cheaper fares. It has, but only in some regions of the country and \nlarge urban areas, while my own constituents have paid hundreds of \ndollars more for even shorter flights. I was told that deregulation \nwould lead to an increase in the number of flights, and make air \nservice more convenient. Again, it has, but only if your city is \nfortunate to be at the center of a major market. My own constituents \nhave far fewer flights to choose from, and in many cases, must drive to \nan airport in another state in order to fly at a reasonable price. This \nis a far cry from convenience.\n\n  This bill addresses these concerns, as it directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to conduct a study to examine air fares that are charged \nto passengers using airports located in small communities, as compared \nwith air fares charged to passengers using large hub airports. The \npurpose of the report will be to determine if passengers using airports \nin small communities are paying ``a disproportionately greater price'' \nas compared with passengers using hub airports in large urban areas, as \nwell as to indicate the number of small communities that have lost air \nservice as a result of the deregulation of commercial air carriers.\n  I strongly support this study, and believe that an examination of the \nimpact of deregulation on rural America is long overdue. Nonetheless, \nfrom the perspective of West Virginia, it is almost self evident that \nsmall communities are paying a disproportionately greater price. For \nexample, if I want to fly from my office in Charleston, West Virginia's \ncapital and largest city, to my office in Washington, I will pay a one-\nway walk-up coach fare of $332. If I want to benefit from airline \nderegulation, I must spend over two hours driving to Columbus, OH, in \norder to fly for $179. In other words, I must drive west, consuming \ngasoline and adding another automobile to the highways, in order to fly \neast at a reasonable fare. To use another example, it costs twice as \nmuch to fly from Charleston to Houston, TX, as compared with flying \nfrom Columbus to Houston.\n  In a 1996 study by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the GAO found \nthat fares have decreased at small and large hub airports. However, \nairports serving small and medium-sized communities in the Southeast \nand Appalachian region ``have experienced sharp increases in fares \nsince deregulation.'' Not surprisingly, the GAO found that where low-\ncost carriers have entered a market, the fares have declined. But in \nareas that have not been so fortunate--where one or two higher cost \nairlines dominate service--fares have risen by more than 20 percent. \nWhen the GAO examined the fares charged per passenger mile at the \nCharleston airport, it found that fares had increased by 24.7 percent \nfrom 1979 to 1994.\n\n  Under the onslaught of deregulation, it is becoming increasingly \ndifficult for small airports in West Virginia to continue to operate. \nSeveral of these airports benefit from Essential Air Service (EAS) \nsupport. The EAS program was created as a direct result of airline \nderegulation, for even as the supporters of deregulation trumpeted its \nbenefits, they recognized that deregulation would hurt small airports. \nEAS was intended to be a temporary subsidy for small airports to help \nthem develop profitable service. The impact of deregulation has been so \nsevere that EAS has become a permanent necessity in order to keep some \nsmall airports open. This bill includes a provision that permanently \nfunds the EAS program at a level of $50 million, which is an increase \nof $24.1 million, when compared to current appropriations. If less than \n$50 million is obligated for EAS programs, the remaining funds will be \nmade available for grants to rural airports to improve rural air \nsafety. This increase in EAS funding, and the provision calling for the \nstudy of rural air fares, was offered in the Commerce Committee by \nSenator Byron Dorgan, and I wish to thank him for his efforts to help \nstruggling airports in small communities.\n  S. 1994 also includes a provision that requires that funding to large \nand medium hub airports would be limited to a percentage of total AIP \nfunding. This provision will help protect small airports from \ndisproportionate cuts in AIP funding, in the event that future levels \nof appropriations to AIP should decline.\n  This bill is a significant and positive step in examining the impact \nof deregulation on small airports in our country. But it is not enough. \nSmall airports across America are suffering under the burden of rising \nfares and declining service. As the Congress continues to examine the \nissues surrounding FAA reform in the next few years, it is my hope that \nthe impact of deregulation on small community airports can be given \nadditional consideration.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I rise in support of this legislation, \nS. 1994, to reauthorize the programs of the FAA. This is important \nlegislation, and I especially want to commend the chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, Mr. McCain, and also the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Ford, for working closely \nwith me on several provisions that have been included in this \nlegislation.\n  Suffice it to say that when consideration of this bill began, it was \na relatively modest reauthorization measure. No safety or security \nissues--certainly not any dramatic changes in safety or security \npolicy--were envisioned at that time. Now these concerns are finally \nback to the forefront where they belong. It is my view that with this \nlegislation the Senate takes the first step toward meaningful action to \nimproving aviation safety and security in our country.\n  I think it has to be understood that there is still a long way to go \neven with the enactment of this legislation, but with the passage of \nthis bill at least the prospect has begun in earnest to strengthen \nsafety and security for the citizens who fly in our country.\n  My view is that in particular it is time to adopt new policies that \nempower the consumer, make it possible for consumers to be in a \nposition to get critical information about aviation safety in our \ncountry. Right now it is possible for consumers to find out if their \nbags get crushed, and it is possible to find out if their flight is on \ntime. But it is pretty darned hard for consumers to find out if the \nairline that they fly on has been fined for violating a major safety \nlaw.\n  At present what happens is, if there is a violation of a major safety \nlaw by an airline, for a citizen to find out they have to file a \nFreedom of Information Act request in order to get the information \nabout a safety violation on the part of an airplane on an airline that \nthey fly regularly. I do not think that is good enough. I think \nconsumers deserve better. And Senator Ford and I have requested that \nthe Federal Aviation Administration undertake an effort to make this \nkind of information available to the citizens of our country.\n  In the next few weeks we expect to receive a report from the Federal \nAviation Administration about the best way to make important safety \ninformation available to the public, and this legislation that the \nSenate considers today requires a comparable report to the National \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, let me say that from my standpoint this is \nonly part of what needs to be done to empower consumers to get relevant \ninformation about safety and security. For example, today the Federal \nAviation Administration posts signs in U.S. airports about the security \ndangers in foreign airports, but there are not any signs about security \nproblems at our airports. It seems to me, again, that consumers, in \nline with certain uniform criteria so that the airlines and all who \nwork in aviation understand what the standards are--the airlines would \nbe expected to act in concert with those kinds of safety and security \ncriteria, and the public would have a right to know whether airports in \nour country are meeting those safety and security criteria just as we \nnow have postings with respect to security problems at foreign \nairports.\n\n  So I think that in these next few weeks we will begin to get \ninformation from the FAA with respect to how to make this key safety \ninformation public. I want it understood, Mr. President and colleagues, \nthat I think this is just the beginning.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. Both he \nand his staff have been very helpful to me in this effort to empower \nconsumers. I am going to make a couple of other quick comments with \nrespect to the legislation, but I want Chairman McCain to know that I \nvery much appreciate the help that he and his staff, as well as Senator \nFord, have given me on this; because, for the life of me, I cannot \nfigure out why it is right for consumers to find out if their bags get \ncrushed, find out if their flights are on time, but why they ought to \nhave to go out and file a Freedom of Information Act request to \ndetermine whether an airline has violated major safety laws. That is \nnot right. That has to be changed. On a bipartisan basis, working with \nChairman McCain and ranking member Ford, I think we can get it changed. \nWe will get that information with respect to the FAA in the next couple \nof weeks.\n  This legislation makes a positive step forward as well as by \nrequiring a comparable report from the National Transportation Safety \nBoard.\n  I also want to say to Chairman McCain that I want to work very \nclosely with him on the matter of security postings at our airports. I \nhave had a chance, both publicly and privately, to discuss this with \nofficials in the aviation field. It is important to do it in line with \ncertain recognized criteria. But it seems to me that, if an airline \npassenger in Phoenix, Portland, or anywhere else goes into an airport \nand finds out about overseas airports that have security problems, it \nseems to me they ought to have a right to know about the airports in \nour country where there are security concerns as well because I think \nthose empowered consumers, once they have that kind of information, \nwill help us and help us on a bipartisan basis to work for the kind of \nsafety and security that the public deserves.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, one of the other aspects of this bill that \nI think makes a positive step forward deals with the need for \nuniformity in definitions relating to safety. Right now an accident \ninvolving a death or a serious injury or substantial damage to an \naircraft is treated the same as an accident involving a plane backing \ninto a truck or a coffee-cup spill that causes problems which are also \nreported as an accident. An incident involves less severe mishaps that \naffect safety in other ways, such as planes hitting birds or things of \nthis nature. This legislation will provide some uniformity in terms of \ndefinitions in this area, and I think that is a fortunate step forward.\n\n  I also think this legislation is very helpful from the standpoint of \nrequiring more comprehensive employment investigations, including \ncriminal history record checks for individuals who will screen airline \npassengers, baggage and property. Under Senators McCain and Ford, what \nhas happened here is the legislative straitjacket that has hamstrung \nFAA efforts in this area are removed. I think that is a helpful step \nforward as well.\n  Finally, I think this legislation is a very important measure with \nrespect to the small airports of our country. These airports, such as \nBandon and John Day and Klamath Falls, in my home State, serve citizens \nin rural Oregon. This legislation makes it possible for those small \nairports around the country to get some help at a critical time. \nWithout the funding formula of this legislation, the smaller airports \nwould suffer disproportionate cuts in grant funding at a time when \nappropriations are especially tight.\n  So this is a piece of legislation that needs to be enacted. I think, \nwith respect to safety and security, it is important to note that when \nthis reauthorization began, safety and security were not much measured \nin what looked, at that time, to be a modest reauthorization. But the \nevents of the last few months have indicated that important and much \nmore significant action needs to be taken, especially with respect to \nsafety and security. I think the legislation that Chairman McCain and \nRanking Member Ford bring to the Senate moves us significantly in the \nright direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge adoption of the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for not \nonly his kind words but, far more important, for the exuberance, \npassion, and knowledge that he brings to the Aviation Subcommittee and \nthe Commerce,\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\nScience and Transportation Committee. Obviously, he is committed and \nknowledgeable on these issues. We value his participation and the very \nimportant contributions he has made to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me join my colleague, Senator McCain, in \ncomplimenting the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. He has been a great \nasset to this institution since he arrived and has been a tremendous \nasset to the Commerce Committee since he has joined us there. He has \nbeen thoughtful, he has been thorough, he has been amenable, but all \nthe time pushing forward as it relates to help in all pieces of \nlegislation, not particularly this one, in his effort to see that his \nconstituents are protected and are helped.\n  I compliment him on the contribution he has made to having S. 1994 at \nthis point, and I look forward to working with him in the future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5364\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Simon pension \namendment is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering \ninto a colloquy with the Senator from Illinois regarding his limited \nscope audit amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would be delighted to enter into such a colloquy.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. We have drafted a sponsors' memorandum to accompany \nthe amendment to assist with the interpretation of this legislation. \nWould the Senator agree that this interpretative memorandum embodies \nwhat the sponsors intend to accomplish with this legislative change to \nERISA?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would ask unanimous consent that the interpretive \nmemorandum be printed in the Record immediately preceding the \ndisposition of the amendment, and I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   Interpretive Memorandum for Repeal of Pension Limited Scope Audit\n\n       This amendment addresses potential deficiencies with \n     ERISA's current audit requirements for employee pension \n     benefit plans. Specifically, the legislation addresses the \n     ``limited scope audit'' provisions in ERISA. The sponsors of \n     the amendment intend this memorandum to accompany the \n     legislation to provide guidance to employee benefit plans, \n     accountants, auditors, and regulated financial institutions.\n       Under current law, ERISA Sec. 103(a)(3) requires the \n     administrator of a benefit plan to engage an independent \n     qualified public accountant to examine the financial \n     statements of the plan and render an opinion as to whether \n     the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity \n     with generally accepted auditing principles. However, under \n     Sec. 103(a)(3)(C), the accountant need not render an opinion \n     as to assets of the plan held by a bank, insurance company, \n     or other financial institution subject to State or Federal \n     regulation.\n       Since many pension plans have a material portion of their \n     assets held by regulated financial institutions, and an \n     accountant generally will not provide an opinion (e.g. the \n     accountant provides a disclaimed opinion) as to a plan when a \n     material portion of its assets are not accessible to the \n     accountant, a great number of plans receive no opinion. The \n     General Accounting Office and the Department of Labor's \n     Inspector General have identified the large number of \n     disclaimed opinions that have been issued as a source of \n     concern.\n       The sponsors intend this amendment to require, in virtually \n     every circumstance, that pension plan accountants rely upon \n     the audits (e.g. SAS 70 reports) performed for banks and \n     other regulated institutions. Thus, pension plan auditors, \n     relying upon the audit report of the regulated entity, would \n     be able to perform an audit and express an opinion on the \n     plan's financial statements without any scope restriction.\n       The sponsors recognize the concerns of pension plan \n     sponsors and regulated financial institutions regarding \n     duplication of effort, increased cost, and disruption of \n     operations that might otherwise be associated with modifying \n     the limited scope audit provisions of ERISA. The sponsors do \n     not intend that regulated institutions undergo multiple \n     independent audits to satisfy the requirements of this \n     legislation. Such a requirement would needlessly raise costs \n     to plans and disrupt the operations of the regulated \n     institution. For these reasons, the sponsors intend, in the \n     vast majority of cases, that plan accountants will rely upon \n     the audits (e.g. the SAS 70 report) performed by the auditors \n     of the regulated financial institution.\n       However, there are a narrow set of circumstances where the \n     SAS 70 report may not be, on its face, sufficient for the \n     plan auditor's purpose. The auditor's response to those \n     situations will vary depending on many factors, including the \n     plan's own system of reviewing the results of the regulated \n     institution's processing of the individual plan's activities. \n     Significantly, the situations where the pension plan auditors \n     needs physically to visit the regulated institution are very \n     infrequent, and are most likely to occur when problems are \n     identified with the regulated institution's processing.\n       The instances where the sponsors anticipate that plan \n     auditors may need to perform additional audit work, beyond \n     the SAS 70 report, include the following:\n       1. The SAS 70 report is a so-called Type I audit, which \n     includes a description of whether the policies and procedures \n     in place at the regulated institution's operation are fairly \n     represented and are suitably designed. However, the Type I \n     audit does not include an assurance on the functional, \n     operating effectiveness of the regulated institution's \n     policies and procedures, as would be provided under a Type II \n     SAS 70 report. In this situation, the plan auditor may need \n     to perform tests of the controls, depending upon whether it \n     is more efficient to reduce the assessed level of control \n     risk at the regulated institution or to perform additional \n     work at the plan.\n       2. If the SAS 70 report covers a different reporting period \n     than the plan's fiscal year, then the auditor may need to \n     inquire of the regulated institution as to whether there were \n     any changes to the institution's policies and procedures \n     during the period not covered by the SAS 70 report. If the \n     difference in coverage period is significant, or there have \n     been material changes to the regulated institution's policies \n     and procedures as they relate to the plan's transactions, \n     then the plan auditor may need to gain an understanding of \n     the policies and procedures in effect during the period not \n     covered by the SAS 70.\n       3. If the SAS 70 report is limited as to its coverage of \n     the regulated institution's policies and procedures as they \n     relate to the plan being audited, then the auditor may need \n     to gain an understanding of the policies and procedures not \n     covered in the SAS 70 report. For instance, if the SAS 70 \n     report does not address the policies and procedures specific \n     to the services performed for the plan, or the report does \n     not cover activities performed by subservices, then \n     additional work may be required (such as, in the latter case, \n     obtaining a SAS 70 report from the subservicer).\n       4. If the SAS 70 report identifies instances of \n     noncompliance with the regulated institution's internal \n     control structure policies and procedures, then the auditor \n     would have to consider the effect of those findings on the \n     assessed level of control risk of assertions in the plan's \n     financial statements.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I strongly support the Jeffords-Simon amendment, and I \nstrongly urge the Senate to approve the Pension Audit Improvement Act \nof 1996. This will make a significant improvement in the safety of \nworking Americans' pensions.\n  The amendment will require that every penny of assets held by pension \nplans is subject to rigorous annual audit. Plan participants and the \nDepartment of Labor will be able to identify where plan assets are held \nand what investment vehicles are being used to fund pension benefits.\n  Under current law, if a pension plan invests a large percentage of \nits assets in a highly leveraged insurance company, plan participants \noften have no way to know that their benefits are at risk.\n  Current law exempts nearly one-third of the $3 trillion in assets \nheld by pension plans from the strict audit requirements of the ERISA \nstatute. That's more than $950 billion in pension plan assets that \npension plan participants and the Department of Labor cannot track.\n  This amendment will change all that. Under the amendment, plan \nsponsors will be required every year to provide a detailed audit of 100 \npercent of a plan's assets. Plan participants and the Department of \nLabor will have the tools necessary to assess whether plan sponsors are \nliving up to strict fiduciary requirements. Hard-working Americans \nshould not have to fear that their pensions will disappear before they \nretire.\n  This amendment is sensible and needed. It enhances the safety of the \nvast assets held by America's pension plans. Working Americans deserve \nthe pensions they have labored hard and long to earn. This amendment \nwill significantly advance that goal and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. FORD. We are ready to accept the Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5364) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, there may be additional colloquies that \nmay be submitted between now and 2 o'clock, when I intend to propound a \nunanimous consent agreement concerning a vote on this bill today. But, \naccording to the unanimous consent agreement entered into last night, \nthat completes the amendments that are applicable to the omnibus FAA \nbill. That would complete our consideration of the bill, with the \nexception of the entry of colloquies and final passage, on which we \nwill be asking for a rollcall vote.\n  In that case, Mr. President, before I turn to my friend from \nKentucky, I\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nwant to express my deep and profound appreciation for his effort on \nthis legislation. This legislation is the product of many years of work \ntogether. He and I have been concerned about issues of aviation safety \nfor the last 10 years that we have closely worked together. We have \nbeen concerned about the very serious issue of FAA reform and providing \nthe right amount of funding for the FAA. We have been concerned about \nso many aspects of this bill from FAA reform to airport security to \nairline safety to airport revenue diversion and many others. We have \nbeen through a very long hearing process in all areas of this omnibus \naviation bill. I think, when you look at the broad scope of this bill, \nit is really a fundamental piece of legislation as far as aviation in \nAmerica is concerned. It would not have been possible without the \nbipartisan effort, especially led by my friend from Kentucky.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Pressler, who urged us on, who made valuable and important \ncontributions, and without whose leadership this legislation would not \nbe possible. Senator Hollings, of course, who is one of the more \nknowledgeable individuals on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, has been extremely helpful, as well as Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. President, I also would be remiss in not pointing out that \nSenator Ford, Senator Pressler, Senator Hollings and I worked very \nclosely with the Administration on this very important legislation. The \nSecretary of Transportation, Secretary Federico Pena, the Administrator \nof the Federal Aviation Administration, Mr. David Hinson, and \nespecially--certainly especially--Ms. Linda Daschle, who did, really, \nthe difficult spade work involved with this bill, especially FAA \nreform, spending literally hundreds of hours of negotiations in \ncrafting this legislation between the Administration and Congress and \nDemocrats and Republicans. So I especially thank Linda Daschle for her \ntireless stamina and outstanding work.\n  I also would like to thank our staff: Paddy Link, Tom Hohenthaner, \nMike Reynolds, and Mike Korens of Senator Pressler's staff, Mitch Rose \nof Senator Stevens' staff, of course, Sam Whitehorn of Senator \nHollings' staff and Tom Zoeller of Senator Ford's staff. Sam and Tom \nhave been extremely helpful and cooperative. Finally, I would like to \npersonally thank the tireless efforts of Chris Paul and Mark Buse on my \nstaff. They worked very hard and spent many long hours, and I am \nespecially grateful to them, as well. As I have said earlier, the staff \nof the Finance Committee worked with us in order to complete this bill \nand I wish to recognize them.\n  I would like to add one final note before yielding the floor to my \nfriend from Kentucky.\n  Last night and again today, the Senator from Kentucky and I talked \nabout this issue of the ticket tax. Mr. President, it was a disaster. \nIt was a disaster when we let this ticket tax lapse last December. I \nvalue the opinion of my friend from Kentucky on this. It is almost \nunconscionable for us to go out of session and let this ticket tax \nlapse again. We all know that the ticket tax lapses on the 31st of \nDecember. Congress will not be doing anything until, at best, late in \nJanuary, and it could be much longer than that.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues that the Senator from Kentucky and \nI will be having to, if necessary, resort to parliamentary measures in \norder to get this ticket tax extended, ideally until such time as the \ncommission reports out its recommendations or the Finance Committee \nwill complete the entire process, but certainly a year, I would say, as \na bare minimum. There is going to be a big crush of business coming up \nin a week or so. I do not intend to inflict further damage on our \nability to complete our obligations--they are not our privileges; our \nobligations--to the American public concerning the maintenance, the \nimprovement of and the safety of America's aviation system.\n  Again, I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation on this \nbill. It is a very complex piece of legislation, encompassing a lot of \ndifferent issues concerning aviation, in fact, just about everything we \ncan think of. I thank my colleagues for their consideration.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I know the Senator from Kentucky \nhas comments before I propound the request concerning the vote at 2 \np.m. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 1994, the Federal \nAviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 1996. As the ranking \nmember of the Aviation Subcommittee, I want to thank the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Senator McCain, for his leadership and determination \nin bringing this bill to the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, as the 104th Congress comes to a close, there are many \nbills which are labeled as ``must pass.'' But this bill truly is a \nmust-pass piece of legislation.\n  The FAA reauthorization act includes provisions which reauthorize the \nAirport Improvement Program [AIP]. The AIP program funds hundreds of \nairport improvement and construction projects throughout our Nation. \nBut the program expires on September 30. Without this reauthorization \nbill, the FAA would be unable to fund many worthy aviation \ninfrastructure projects. We cannot let that happen. The FAA's forecasts \nfor the aviation industry project tremendous growth. Those forecasts \nproject an average increase of 3.7 percent in domestic passenger \ntraffic by the year 2007. One of the big growth areas will most likely \nbe in the regional and commuter industry. In 1995, regional and \ncommuter air carriers carried 53.7 million passengers. By the year \n2007, the FAA projects these same carriers to carry 96.9 million \npassengers--an annual growth of 5.4 percent.\n  The tremendous growth of air traffic will place tremendous challenges \non airports and airways management. That is why it is so important for \nthe Senate to pass S. 1994. We cannot permit the AIP program to lapse. \nWe must continue to support many worthy airport construction and \nimprovement projects that will help to sustain and support the growing \ndemand for air carrier services, both passenger and cargo.\n  These increased demands on the air transport system require the \nCongress to re-examine the way in which the FAA is managed and funded. \nThe FAA is predominantly funded through the airport and airway trust \nfund. The monies which are in the trust fund are distributed among \nspecific programs and functions, including the FAA's operations \naccount, the facilities and equipment account, research, the \nengineering and development account, as well as the Airport Improvement \nProgram.\n  The trust funds is supported solely through revenue derived by a 10 \npercent passenger ticket tax, interest paid on Treasury certificates, \nand other taxes associated with air travel and aviation. However, on \nJanuary 1, 1996, the aviation excise taxes lapsed. That lapse in the \ntaxes resulted in a loss of $500 million a month in trust fund \nrevenues. With the enactment of the minimum wage and small business tax \ncredits act, the aviation excise taxes were reinstated, but only to the \nend of this calendar year.\n  This experience has highlighted some problems and concerns with the \nFAA. Without a steady and reliable source of revenue, the FAA cannot \nfulfill its mission to promote a safe and reliable aviation system. To \nthat end, S. 1994 establishes a 11-member panel to conduct an \nindependent assessment of the FAA financing and cost allocations \nthrough 2002. This independent panel shall include individuals who have \nexpertise in the aviation industry and who are able, collectively, to \nrepresent a balanced view of the issues which are important to all \nsegments of the aviation industry, including: general aviation, major \nair carriers, air cargo carriers, regional air carriers, business \naviation, airports, aircraft manufacturers, the financial community, \naviation industry workers, and airline passengers.\n  This independent assessment is required to complete its work within \n12 months. At which time the panel will make a report to the Secretary \nof Transportation. S. 1994 includes provisions which would provide for \nexpedited consideration of any legislative proposal forwarded by the \nindependent panel.\n  It is important to point out that we want this panel to be \nindependent. It is\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nimportant that this panel consider all the options which can be \nconsidered for funding the FAA. By including all segments of the \naviation industry, it is our hope that the independent panel will \nproduce an unbiased and balanced report which considers all the pros \nand cons to funding options. We need to depoliticize the process for \nfunding the FAA. By creating this independent panel, it is our hope \nthat we can get a fair and reliable assessment of needs and funding \nsources. And through the expedited procedures contemplated in the bill, \nwe hope to be able to enact those funding options as quickly as \npossible so that we will not face another funding lapse to the trust \nfund and the FAA.\n  This funding study will build upon personnel and procurement reforms \nalready in place at the FAA, which were included in the \nTransportation Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996.\n\n  In addition to the independent study on funding solutions for the \nFAA, the bill also includes provisions for the creation of a Management \nAdvisory Council. Mr. President, I think we all acknowledge that the \nFAA has been an agency with its problems. Some of that criticism is \nwell-deserved. But, I think that most Members will also acknowledge, \nthat under the current leadership of David Hinson, the FAA is beginning \nto respond to the challenges. We want to build on these improvements \nand we want to enable the FAA to improve its management so that it is \nprepared to face the challenges of the 21st century.\n  The Management Advisory Council [MAC] will be composed of 15 members \nto provide the Administrator with input from the aviation industry and \ncommunity. Membership on the MAC will include representatives from all \ngovernment and all segments of the aviation industry; all of whom will \nbe appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. Members of the MAC should be selected from among individuals \nwho are experts in disciplines relevant to the aviation community and \nwho are collectively able to represent a balanced view of the issues \nbefore the FAA. It is important to note that selection for MAC \nmembership is not required to be based on political affiliation or \nother partisan considerations.\n  As was noted in the committee's report on S. 1994, the MAC is not \nanother paper tiger. Rather, it is intended that the MAC's \nrecommendations be taken under serious consideration by the \nAdministrator.\n  Among the issues that we expect that the MAC to examine are: air \ntraffic control modernization; FAA acquisition management; rulemakings \nand cost-benefit analysis; review the process by which the FAA \ndetermines to use advisory circulars and service bulletins; review of \nold rules, including FAR part 145.\n  Mr. President, since the Commerce Committee reported S. 1994, we \nexperienced another air tragedy: the destruction of TWA flight 800 over \nthe Atlantic Ocean. At this time, we do not know what caused that \ntragedy. But we do know that we need to reexamine our aviation security \nmeasures. Following this tragedy, the President appointed Vice \nPresident Gore to head a special commission on aviation security. \nEarlier this month, the Gore commission presented to the President's \nits initial report to the President. That report made a number of \nrecommendations including the purchase of explosive detection \nequipment; the placing of security equipment at our major airports; \nincreasing the use of passenger profiling through the use of existing \ndata bases and air carrier computer reservation systems; criminal \nbackground checks and FBI fingerprint checks for all security screeners \nand other airport and airline personnel with access to secure areas; \nincreasing funding to be used to facilitate a greater role for the U.S. \nCustoms Service and other law enforcement agencies; designate the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to deal with the families and \nrelatives of crash victims; and provide additional funds for the \ntraining of airport security screeners. Within the managers amendment, \nwe have included legislative language that will give the FAA the legal \nauthority to undertake and implement the recommendations of the Gore \ncommission.\n  It is important to note, however, Mr. President, that the Gore \ncommission has not completed its work. In fact, the review of aviation \nsecurity and safety is a dynamic and evolving process. While we have \nattempted to include security provisions within this bill, it is \nanticipated that the Congress will be considering further security \nrecommendations and enhancements as the Gore commission continues its \nwork.\n  I want to express my thanks to the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nLautenberg] and the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] for their \ncontributions to this effort. I look forward to working with them in \nthe future on this issue.\n  Mr. President, let me thank all Members who have expressed an \ninterest in this bill. As my colleagues are aware, last night, Senator \nMcCain and myself worked throughout the evening to fashion a managers' \namendment. Within that amendment, we have tried to include provisions \nand language that are of concern to other Members. I want to express my \nappreciation to my colleagues for their willingness to work with us on \ndrafting this managers' amendment. Because of their cooperation and \nassistance, I believe that we will be able to move this bill forward \nquickly and complete action prior to September 30.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by addressing one particular issue, \nthe privatization of airports. I am aware that the House bill includes \na provision which would establish a pilot program for six airports. I \noppose those efforts because the definition of privatization allows the \nnew airport owner to divert revenues off of the airport; to receive \nFederal grants; to collect federally authorized PFC's; allow major \ncarriers to dictate who runs an airport; and gives general aviation no \nsay in privatization. In my mind, this form of privatization is a new \nform of corporate welfare. Moreover, Mr. President, privatization is \nopposed by the airlines, by general aviation, and by the airports. I am \nnot opposed to finding new and innovative solutions to financing our \nairports. But I do not believe that privatization is a means to achieve \nthat end.\n  Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Arizona, the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce and Transportation \nCommittee. It is always a joy to watch him work. It is a joy to work \nwith him. He has the kind of tenacity that is needed around here at \ntimes to accomplish something that is important not only to this \ncountry but internationally.\n  Senator McCain is called on for more than just aviation. Senator \nMcCain is leaned on quite often as it relates to our defense policy. \nHis love of the country and his defense of military personnel is always \nabove reproach and without doubt.\n  So I am pleased that we have had this opportunity to work together, \nbecause the ingredients in this piece of legislation, if we can \nmaintain it in conference, bring us to a point, I think, I say to \nSenator McCain, that we have been striving for for a long time.\n  We have learned something, and I hope a lot of our colleagues have \nlearned something. One of the top five Senators in the U.S. Senate over \nthe centuries is from Kentucky. He is Henry Clay. Henry Clay was known \nas ``the Great Compromiser.'' Compromise is not a nasty word, it is not \na word that you ought to run from. But that is how you accomplish \nthings around here.\n  Henry Clay described compromise as ``a negotiated hurt.'' A \ncompromise is a negotiated hurt. Sure, it hurts to lose something that \nyou feel strongly about, but you usually get something. My father \nalways told me, ``You give up something, you get something,'' and that \nis compromise.\n  So I think in the proceedings on this bill, once it was brought up, \nthat we have injected the Henry Clay philosophy. We have worked \ntogether. We have had give and take. We have had Senators who were very \nreluctant to give up what they wanted, but somehow or another we found \na way to modify their amendment so that it would not be so onerous to \nsome and yet pleasing to the offeror of the amendment.\n  So the experience of the moment is always something that builds on \nthe education of the time spent in this institution.\n  Let me join with my friend in thanking his staff--I will not go \nthrough the list--for all of their fine cooperation,\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\nand my two--I want to say staffers, but they are my friends. That is \nthe way I look at them, Sam Whitehorn and Tom Zoeller, and the others \non the staff and those from other committees who have been working with \nus. We found an air of cooperation and camaraderie that has been \nunusual, I think. So I am very pleased with the cooperation we have \nhad, and I thank my friends.\n  Mr. President, let me thank all Members, too, who have expressed an \ninterest in this piece of legislation. As my colleagues are aware, last \nnight, Senator McCain and I worked throughout the evening to fashion \nwhat we referred to here as a ``managers' amendment.'' Those are \namendments to be offered to the bill that we were able to work out and \nfind agreement on. Rather than go through the long harangue of debate \nand running back and forth, our staffs worked together and our Senators \ncooperated. So we worked hard to fashion what we refer to and what was \noffered, what was adopted, as the ``managers' amendment.'' Of course, \nthe leadership in putting that together is given to Senator McCain for \nhis extraordinary effort in putting this managers' amendment together.\n\n  Within that amendment, we have tried to include provisions and \nlanguage that are of concern to not only our Members but others, \nbecause when we pass legislation, we either help or hurt our \nconstituents. We either make it better or worse. So we have to be \ncareful, once we agree on it, of what it does for the safety, for the \nbetterment of the economy, whatever it might be. Even though we may \nagree, it is for those beyond this Chamber for whom we are here to \nwork.\n  Sometimes I don't always vote the way I personally feel. I think it \nwas Hamilton who said in referring to the Congress, ``In these Halls, \nthe people's voice shall be heard by their immediate representative.'' \nThat is us, and we vote what we hear from our constituents. Sometimes \nit is not exactly the way we would want it, but you try to respond to \nthose who are interested.\n  I think we have another interested group out there that we have not \nhad before, and it is the so-called ``C-SPAN junkies.'' I read the \nother day where some tape C-SPAN and come home at night and watch us. I \ndidn't know we were that good. I thought maybe some of them just turned \nus off. But these are people who have watched us, listened to us, and \nhave become informed.\n  I don't know how many calls you get, but every once in a while, \nsomeone will call and say, ``I heard you speak. I don't agree with \nthat. I think you ought to do this,'' and it has been an interesting \nperiod in the institution of the Senate.\n  I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to all my colleagues \nfor their willingness to work with us in drafting this piece of \nlegislation. Because of that cooperation and assistance, I believe we \nwill be able to move this bill forward quickly and complete action, \nhopefully, before September 30.\n  So we have some time. I assure my colleagues, as Senator McCain and I \nhave assured each other, as soon as this bill is passed, we are going \nto work. We are not going to rest on our laurels and beat our chests, \nWe passed a bill. We are not finished. We have a conference to go to. \nWe have a final bill to complete. We have to have one that the \nadministration will agree to. As Senator McCain said, we have worked \nwith the administration. We have tried to work with all parties. I \nbelieve in the end we will have a piece of legislation that will be \nacceptable all around.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by reiterating one particular issue, \nand that is the privatization of airports. I am aware that the House \nbill includes a provision which would establish a pilot project of six \nairports. Up front--I am not trying to kid anybody--I oppose those \nefforts because the definition of privatization allows the new airport \nowner to divert revenues off of the airport, to receive Federal grants, \nto collect Federally authorized PFC's, allow major carriers to dictate \nwho runs an airport, and gives general aviation no say--gives general \naviation no say--in the privatization.\n  So in my mind, Mr. President, this form of privatization is a new \nform of corporate welfare--a new form of corporate welfare. Moreover, \nMr. President, privatization is opposed by the airlines, by general \naviation, and by the airports. I am not opposed to finding new and \ninnovative solutions to financing our airports, but I do not believe \nthat privatization is a means to achieve that end.\n  So having said that, Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go to \nthird reading.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments? If not, the \nquestion is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport calendar No. 588, H.R. 3539.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3539) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken, and the text of S. 1994 as passed by the \nSenate is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I would like to thank my friend \nfrom Kentucky. I remember when I was a new Member of the Senate, he was \nkind enough, as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, to come to my \nState and have a hearing on the Grand Canyon and other issues. That has \ncharacterized our relationship now for more than 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that final passage occur on \nH.R. 3539, at 2 p.m. today, and that paragraph 4 of rule 12 be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10742-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, something is going to happen today in the \nState of Arizona that will have great impact on the State of Utah. I \nwould like to discuss that issue in somewhat greater detail than I have \nbeen able to do in the press. Unfortunately, we now live in a time \nwhere the press looks for the 7-second sound bite or the two-sentence \nsummary to print in the newspaper, and the overall issue gets lost. So \nI appreciate the opportunity to lay out the whole circumstance of what \nhas happened, and is happening, for the record.\n  Several weeks ago in the Washington Post there was a story about a \nleak out of the White House saying that the President was considering \ncreating a national monument in the State of Utah, somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 2 million acres. That came as unexpected news to me and \nthe other Members in the Utah delegation, and we raised the issue. \n``Oh, no,'' we were assured, ``nothing is really under consideration. \nThese are just discussions that are taking place in the White House, \nand they probably should not have\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\nbeen leaked. There shouldn't be any press discussion about it because \nnothing really is going to happen.''\n  But the rumors persisted. The buildup continued to the point that our \nGovernor decided to call Secretary Babbitt. I also called Secretary \nBabbitt and asked about this issue. Finally, last Saturday, Senator \nHatch and I were invited to go to the Interior Department to meet with \nSecretary Babbitt and members of the White House staff to talk about \nthis proposed national monument.\n  When we got there, having been told in advance that the Secretary was \ngoing to calm our fears and lay out a full statement of what was going \non, I got a little startled when the Secretary began the presentation \nby saying, ``We're here just to listen.'' And that was all. Well, \nSenator Hatch and I indicated that we were very concerned that \nsomething as significant as this was going to be done without any \nconsultation with Congress, let alone Members of the Utah delegation. \nCongress as a whole, having historically played a significant role in \nthe creation of national monuments, was being cut out.\n  ``Well,'' said Secretary Babbitt, ``I can tell you categorically, no \ndecision has been made with respect to this.'' We said, ``We read in \nthe newspapers that the President is going to announce it on Wednesday, \nwhen he's in Arizona at the Grand Canyon.'' And Secretary Babbitt \nrepeated, ``I tell you categorically, no decision has been made.''\n  When we met with the press afterward, they asked us, ``What do you \nthink will happen?'' I am afraid I am cynical enough, Mr. President, \nand I said, ``I believe the President will make the announcement on \nWednesday.'' Senator Hatch--perhaps he is a little more trusting--said, \n``I can't believe that the President would do that, given the \nassurances we've just been given.''\n  It is not just Republicans that are involved; the Democratic \nCongressman who represents the district in which this monument will be \nformed, uttered the same concern, expressed the same amazement on the \nfact that he had not been consulted, and came away from his interview \nwith Secretary Babbitt saying ``I have been assured there is nothing \nimminent going to happen.''\n  So we had the Democratic Congressman saying, ``nothing imminent.'' We \nhad the senior Senator from Utah saying he was sure there would be no \nannouncements. As I say, I was more cynical. I predicted that there \nwould be an announcement. I went away from the meeting convinced that, \nin spite of the assurances we were given that no decision had been \nmade, in fact we were on a track toward a certainty of an announcement \non Wednesday--today.\n  We then went through the weekend. And at the beginning of the week, \nthe news reports started to come in, from CNN and elsewhere, that the \nPresident was going to announce the formation of a major national \nmonument in Utah when he was at the Grand Canyon. ``Oh, no,'' said the \nWhite House. ``We deny these news reports. Anybody who says that is \ngoing to happen does not know what he is talking about. No decision has \nbeen made.''\n\n  Once again, I continued to believe that the President was going to do \nit.\n  Today I received a phone call from Leon Panetta. He told me, to my \ngreat surprise, that today the President will announce the creation of \na new national monument in the State of Utah in the neighborhood of 2 \nmillion acres. Among the other things Mr. Panetta told me was that \nthere will be a 3-year period for the development of a management plan \nfor this land. In that 3-year period, he said, all of the issues will \nbe dealt with and sorted out.\n  That is, frankly, Mr. President, a ``trust us'' kind of statement on \nthe part of the administration. ``We are going to turn the process \ncompletely around. Instead of going through the development of the plan \nand then creating the monument, we will create the monument, and \ndevelop the plan after the fact,'' but ``trust us, we will take care of \nall of your concerns.'' Given the history leading up to this \nannouncement, Mr. President, it is fairly difficult for many people in \nUtah to trust the administration on this one.\n  That having been said, I want to take the balance of the time to talk \nabout the misconceptions surrounding this entire circumstance. I cannot \nfind a better place to summarize most of those misconceptions than \ntoday's New York Times. They have an editorial entitled ``A New and \nNeeded National Monument.'' Once again, Mr. President, the fact that \nthis appears in the New York Times the day the President is making his \nannouncement says to me that they knew far in advance of Leon Panetta's \ncall to me that the President was going to do this, their protestations \nto the contrary notwithstanding. Based on the New York Times editorial, \nthere are several misconceptions about western land use which continue \nto perpetuate myths, at least in Manhattan, if not all of the Eastern \nStates that are unfamiliar with the realities in the West.\n  The editorial starts out praising the President for placing an area \noff limits to development. Now, I am sure that to the people in the New \nYork area, development means hotels, condominiums, and other commercial \nactivities. But this land is already developed in many areas by western \ndefinition; that is, there are grazing activities going on in this \nland.\n  Mr. Panetta assured me that the grazing would be allowed to continue. \nThere is hunting that goes on in this area. Mr. Panetta assured me that \nthe hunting would be allowed to continue. There are State parks already \nin this land, which means tourism. Mr. Panetta assured me the State \nparks would be excluded from the designation and tourism would be \nallowed to continue. Finally, there are thousands of people who live \nwithin the boundaries of this national monument. I assume they will be \nallowed to continue to live there under the same circumstances. We will \nnot find out until we go through this 3-year process.\n  All these activities constitutes, in western terms, development, Mr. \nPresident, and I was assured by the Chief of Staff in the White House \nthat that kind of development will be allowed to continue. So when the \nNew York Times says the President is setting the area ``off limits to \ndevelopment,'' the New York Times is at odds with the statement of the \nPresident's Chief of Staff.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The President's move is also virtually certain to block \n     plans by a Dutch company, Andalex Resources, to develop a \n     coal reserve twice the size of Manhattan that sits right in \n     the middle of the wilderness area. The administration has \n     tried to persuade the company to swap these lands for an \n     equivalent amount of coal in less vulnerable parts of the \n     State, but the company has said no.\n\n  Two items, Mr. President. No. 1, the suggestion that the coal reserve \nis right in the middle of the wilderness area--``wilderness,'' by \ndefinition in the law, means land where there is no evidence of the \npresence of humans and, very specifically, land where there are no \nroads. I have, myself, driven over the existing road to the mine site. \nYou cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, say that an area where \nthere is an existing, used road, constitutes wilderness. The mine site \nis not smack in the middle of the wilderness area. The mine site is \nmiles away from the wilderness area.\n\n  Second, the New York Times says the administration has tried to \npersuade the company to swap out for lands of equal value. That is a \nvery interesting statement to make in the newspaper. Here are some of \nthe facts, if you take the Bruce Babbitt method of appraisal of value.\n  The market value of the coal in this area is $1.2 trillion. There are \nsome who say, why, that is an inflated figure. You cannot expect to get \nthat much out. They are right. But that is the way Bruce Babbitt \nappraises minerals in the ground when he wants to make press release \nstatements about how valuable a developing gold mine is. So we will use \nthe Bruce Babbitt method of appraisal here and say we have 1.2 trillion \ndollars' worth of coal. I do not know of any other coalfield in the \nState, or the Nation or the world that comes to $1.2 trillion in \nprojected value. How can they say ``we are going to swap out equal \nvalue, but you, nasty coal company, are not willing to cooperate?'' I \nwould say to the administration, find me another coalfield with an \nestimated value of $1.2 trillion before you start talking about swaps. \nThe New York Times conveniently does not mention that when they talk \nabout the swap.\n  The New York Times goes on to talk about the way the President has \ndone\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\nthis. He is doing it under the Antiquities Act. He says that is what \ngives him the right to act without consulting Congress, and the New \nYork Times obviously agrees. It says:\n\n       The Antiquities Act, inspired by the discovery of \n     archaeological treasures in the Southwest at the turn of the \n     century, has served as a useful mechanism for Presidents to \n     preserve valuable public lands without congressional consent. \n     The act has been invoked 66 times, and many of the Nation's \n     most treasured sites, including the Grand Canyon, where Mr. \n     Clinton will make his announcement, began as protected \n     monuments and ended up as national parks by act of Congress.\n\n  All true. What they do not tell us, however, Mr. President--and, \nindeed, what they may not know--is that the Antiquities Act has never \nbeen used by a President since the passage of the two landmark land \nusage acts by Congress, NEPA and FLMPA. For the C-SPAN junkies, NEPA is \nthe National Environment Policy Act; FLMPA, the Federal Land Management \nPolicy Act. NEPA and FLMPA were Congress' attempt to bring order to the \nprocess. NEPA and FLMPA have clear procedures for moving ahead on a \nmatter of this kind, and no President has ever ignored NEPA and FLMPA \nto create a national monument until now. Citing the precedence of \nTheodore Roosevelt and his use of the Antiquities Act, as the New York \nTimes by implication does, does not excuse Mr. Clinton from violating \nappropriate processes.\n  Enough about the misconceptions in the editorial. There are other \nthings that need to be brought to our attention that we should \nunderstand about this proposal. One thing I hope the editorial writers \nin the New York Times will realize, if they do not already, is that \nthere is a great difference between a national monument and wilderness. \nWilderness, as defined by the law, is a territory that is set aside \nbecause there is no evidence that human beings have ever been there.\n  Although there is clear evidence of human activity in most of this \narea, there are about 350,000 acres that qualify as wilderness, under \nthe most strict definition of that term. The Utah delegation wanted to \nset aside those 350,000 acres as wilderness. We were prevented from \ndoing so by a filibuster on this floor. We had enough votes to pass it, \nbut we did not have enough votes to shut off debate.\n  Those 350,000 acres of pristine wilderness will now be included in \nthe national monument. What does that mean? That means that tourists \ncan go there; that means people can camp there; that means people can \ntake mechanized vehicles there, because all of that is permitted at a \nnational monument. It is not permitted in a wilderness area, but it is \npermitted in a national monument.\n  Ironically, when you create a national monument, you must, of \nnecessity, create visitor centers. There are buildings within a \nnational monument, which would not be allowed in a wilderness area. You \nmust pave the roads because the tourists don't go over Jeep trails. We \nhave plenty of national monuments in Utah, with miles and miles of \npaved roads. Ironically, we are now going to see the road, which they \nare trying to stop the coal company from using, paved, so that tourist \nbuses can go over it.\n  And then we must have concessions. If you have a 2 million acre area \nset apart for tourism, you have to have a place for them to relieve \nthemselves, a place to refresh themselves. And you are going to see \nrefreshment stands, hot dog stands; and you are going to maybe even \nsee, in as in the big national parks, hotels, cafeterias, and movie \ntheaters--all set up to meet the demands of the tourists. Do you do \nthis to protect the wilderness? I am not sure that the people who are \napplauding this set-aside as being a way to protect the wilderness \nunderstand that a national monument is not a road to wilderness. A \nnational monument is a road to a national park, and a national park is \na major tourist attraction with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, \nof people coming to an area that is now completely desolate. This is \nwhat the New York Times thinks is a really good way to protect the \nwilderness and the pristine nature of this land.\n  Going on to further misconceptions, one thing that the folks in \nManhattan have probably never heard of, because it is unheard of in the \nEast, is something we in the West call school trust lands. When the \nWestern States were created, the Congress, in addition to holding most \nof the land in Federal ownership, created a series of alternate \nsections every so often along the land. Almost thrown across the face \nof the land like smallpox eruptions, these sections would be owned by \nthe State and held in trust for the value of the school children in \nthat State. There are over 200,000 acres of school trust lands in the \narea that the President will set apart as a national monument. Oh, we \nare assured that the money that would come to the school children, if \nthese lands were used for mineral development, will be made up some \nother way. If you go, again, to the Bruce Babbitt method of appraisal, \nat $1.2 trillion, the amount the schoolchildren would get out of it \nwould be on the billions of dollars. Are we prepared in this Congress \nto appropriate billions of dollars to make the Utah schoolchildren \nwhole? Of course, we are not. And, of course, that number is too high. \nBut whatever the appropriate number is, the President is asking us to \ntrust him that Utah schoolchildren will be made whole. I can tell you \nhow Utah's schoolchildren have reacted. In Kane County, the county \nwhere the majority of this monument will lie, the city of Kanab has, \ntoday, shut down in protest. The schoolchildren have been let out of \nschool and they are walking the streets of Kanab wearing black armbands \nand carrying posters protesting the administration's decision. The \npresident of the Utah Education Association--a group not known for its \nRepublican proclivities--has publicly said that the administration has \ncommitted ``felonious assault on Utah schoolchildren'' by the way they \nare approaching this.\n  That may come as news to the New York Times, who has never heard of \nschool trust lands, but those are the reactions of the education \nleaders--not the Utah congressional delegation, not the Republican \nestablishment--but the education leaders in the State of Utah.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I summarize this way. We have a proposal from the \nPresident to create a massive, new national monument in my State. Am I \nopposed to a new national monument in Utah? I can't be opposed in \nprinciple. A new national monument will indeed mean many tourists and \ngreat activity in my State. But we have been given this proposal after \nassurances that it was not going to happen, at a time when we were told \nit wasn't going to happen, with a presentation that we should now trust \nthe administration to work out all of the details.\n  If, indeed, the whole thing is done in proper good faith, I believe \nwe could end up with a national monument that makes sense in one area, \nwilderness that made sense in another area, and mineral activity that \nmade sense, environmentally, in the third area.\n  The President's actions do not lead me to believe that that will be \nthe result. On the contrary, the way he has proceeded leads me to \nbelieve that we are in for a protracted period of controversy and \ndifficulty over this issue. I wish the President had followed the \nprocedures laid down by the Congress in NEPA and FLPMA and had given us \nan orderly process to produce a worthwhile result. Instead, he has \nchosen a photo op that will undoubtedly be gorgeous. As we look at the \nevening news, we will see the President with the Grand Canyon in the \nbackground, with Vice President Gore standing at one side and Carol \nBrowner at the other side, proclaiming his protection of the beauties \nof nature from the plunderers. Then when the photo op has passed and \nthe television images have faded from our screen, the realities of what \nhe has done will leave us with 3 years of hard slogging trying to sort \nthis out and come up with the proper kind of result.\n  I don't wish to say that I do not trust the administration. They say, \n``Trust us in this circumstance,'' but I conclude with the advice that \nwas left by Ronald Reagan: ``Trust but verify.''\n  I intend to do whatever I can through this process to see that the \nadministration keeps its initial pledges of guaranteeing that existing \nrights will not be trampled, and that the schoolchildren of Utah will \nbe taken care of. ``Trust but verify'' should become our watchword.\n  Mr. President, there is one other thing about the coal mine that \npeople should understand and is not outlined in most of the press \nreports dealing\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nwith this land. We have images of coal mining that are very, very \nhurtful. We see strip mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. We see \nsmokestacks belching out black smoke and blaming it on coal. When the \nadministration talks about stopping coal mining in this area, there is \nan immediate emotional reaction that this is a good thing to do. I have \npersonally been to the proposed location of this mine. We are not \ntalking about strip mining here, Mr. President, we are talking about \nmining below the surface of the ground. The only impact on the ground \nwould be a mine opening smaller than one of the walls here on the side \nof the Senate --an opening just wide enough to bring out the trams \ncarrying the coal, and that is it. With long-wall mining technology, \nyou can go into the mine and produce the coal with no more impact on \nthe surface than that.\n\n  Second, we are not talking about the kind of coal that comes out of \nWest Virginia and Kentucky, a high-sulfur coal which when burned \nproduces dramatic damage to the atmosphere. We are talking about the \nlow-sulfur coal that the environmentalists are hoping we can find to \nburn in this country. We are talking about coal that will produce the \nright kind of environmental impact when it ultimately ends up in a \nfurnace somewhere.\n  So, by saying we are going to stop the production of low-sulfur coal \nin Utah, people are in fact admitting they are going to increase or at \nleast maintain the burning of high-sulfur coal that comes from \nelsewhere with the appropriate damage to the environment.\n  Finally, all of this talk about a Dutch company implies that you are \ngoing to see a giant come from overseas to somehow fasten itself on \nUtah and suck things out of Utah's ground. The company may indeed have \nits shareholders as citizens of a European country. I do not know \nexactly where they live. I do know the company has been a responsible, \ntax-paying, job-producing corporate citizen of the State of Utah for \ndecades. It is already mining coal in an environmentally sensitive way \nin central Utah. It has demonstrated that it knows how to do it, \nminimizing any kind of environmental impact. If there ever was a \ncompany I would want to proceed with the development of these coal \nresources, it would be one with the experience and the track record of \ngood corporate citizenship which this company has shown in the years it \nhas operated in Utah. So it is true to say that their shareholders \ndon't live in Utah or maybe in the United States. But that I find is \nirrelevant when one recognizes what they have done for our State and \nhow important the economic activity that they have generated for our \nState has been.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10756-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like for a moment to \ncomment on the pending legislation, the FAA Reauthorization Act, to add \na few words in support of comments made by Senator Wyden earlier \nregarding the train whistle amendment.\n  I am particularly gratified at the activity of the managers in \naccepting the language of the train whistle amendment because I think \nit does represent a step in the right direction in calling for Federal-\nState cooperation, Federal-State partnership and engagement and \ninvolvement of local governments in the decisionmaking process.\n  Certainly, we are all concerned about safety, and safety is at the \ncore of the legislative authority pertaining to the train whistle \nrequirement. At the same time, our laws have to achieve a balance. We \nhave to balance the various interests, particularly the interests of \nlocal communities in maintaining quality of life in those communities--\nareas like my own and those represented by Senator Wyden. There are \nparts of my State, for example, in which you have the confluence of \nmany different railroad lines, in particular in suburban communities, \nwhich may mean that, at the behest of safety, the communities lose \nwhatever quality of life they have because you may have train whistles \nsounding every 5 minutes.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Chicago area has been known \nhistorically as the transportation hub of the United States. So in the \nhub, when we have the confluence of many different rail lines, the \ntrain whistle issue cuts to the heart of our ability to balance the \nneeds of communities, to maintain communities where people can live \nversus our national need for safety.\n  So I think the language of this amendment goes a long way in \nencouraging local input, in encouraging flexibility, and encouraging \nthe kind of cooperation we need. The days of heavy-handed bureaucratic \nresponses to these kinds of issues have to be over. We have to begin to \nexplore ways in which we can maximize local input, at the same time \nrecognizing our connection as a national community.\n  I believe the train whistle language does that, recognizes the \noverarching interests that bring us together, but it also provides \nlocal governments the capacity and ability to be heard without having \nto spend a lot of money for lawyers and hiring specialists and the \nlike, that they can do it in a simplified and straightforward manner.\n  So I thank the managers of this legislation. I thank Senator Wyden \nfor his leadership in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10759-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this title, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the \n     Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n\n     SEC. 603. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this title and the amendments made by \n     this title shall take effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                     Subtitle A--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 621. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, \n     being one of the few non-defense government agencies that \n     operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while \n     continuing to rely on outdated technology to carry out its \n     responsibilities for a state-of-the-art industry.\n       (2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation \n     system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, \n     with the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. \n     The General Fund contribution over the years is one measure \n     of the benefit received by the general public, military, and \n     other users of Administration's services.\n       (3) The Administration must become a more efficient, \n     effective, and different organization to meet future \n     challenges.\n       (4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it \n     may become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient \n     General Fund contributions to meet the Administration's \n     future budget needs.\n       (5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the \n     national air transportation system by seeking to spend all \n     moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses \n     representing past receipts must also be spent for the \n     purposes for which such funds were collected.\n       (6) The aviation community and the employees of the \n     Administration must come together to improve the system. The \n     Administration must continue to recognize who its customers \n     are and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the \n     system to make safety improvements and increase productivity.\n       (7) The Administration projects that commercial operations \n     will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 \n     percent by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion \n     and system modernization, these needs cannot be met.\n       (8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future \n     challenges and needs cannot be met.\n       (9) The Administration must have a new way of doing \n     business.\n       (10) There is widespread agreement within government and \n     the aviation industry that reform of the Administration is \n     essential to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected \n     growth of aviation within the next decade.\n       (11) To the extent that the Congress determines that \n     certain segments of the aviation community are not required \n     to pay all of the costs of the government services which they \n     require and benefits which they receive, the Congress should \n     appropriate the difference between such costs and any \n     receipts received from such segment.\n       (12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user \n     fees on segments of the industry,\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\n     an independent review must be performed to assess the funding \n     needs and assumptions for operations, capital spending, and \n     airport infrastructure.\n       (13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and \n     assessment must be performed of the costs to the \n     Administration and the costs driven by each segment of the \n     aviation system for safety and operational services, \n     including the use of the air traffic control system and the \n     Nation's airports.\n       (14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity \n     in that it is a participant in the daily operations of an \n     industry, and because the national air transportation system \n     faces significant problems without significant changes, the \n     Administration has been authorized to change the Federal \n     procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the \n     Administration has the ability to keep pace with new \n     technology and is able to match resources with the real \n     personnel needs of the Administration.\n       (15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-\n     term planning or timely acquisition of technology by the \n     Administration.\n       (16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, \n     personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration will \n     continue to experience delays and cost overruns in its major \n     modernization programs and needed improvements in the \n     performance of the air traffic management system will not \n     occur.\n       (17) All reforms should be designed to help the \n     Administration become more responsive to the needs of its \n     customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.\n\n     SEC. 622. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure that final action shall be taken on all \n     notices of proposed rulemaking of the Administration within \n     18 months after the date of their publication;\n       (2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional \n     review, to establish a program to improve air traffic \n     management system performance and to establish appropriate \n     levels of cost accountability for air traffic management \n     services provided by the Administration;\n       (3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable \n     Administration within the Department of Transportation; and\n       (4) to make the Administration a more efficient and \n     effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, \n     growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling \n     public.\n\n     SEC. 623.

Madam President, I want to speak for a few minutes on \nthe issue of education funding, which is of vital importance to most \nAmericans and certainly is to the people in my State.\n  First of all, I think we need to put the issue into context. When I \ngo around my State of New Mexico, I talk to people at townhall meetings \nand I ask, what percentage of the Federal budget do you believe is \ncommitted to improving education? Usually I start by saying, ``How many \nof you think 15 percent of the Federal budget is committed to \neducation?'' Quite a few hands go up in the audience. Then I say, ``How \nabout 10 percent?'' and even more hands go up. I say, ``Five percent?'' \nand not that many hands. So the consensus in my State is that perhaps \nwe are spending about 10 percent of our Federal budget on education.\n  Madam President, the truth is, we are spending 1.4 percent, less than \n2 percent, of our Federal budget on education. It is in this context \nthat we need to consider the proposals which have come forward in this \nCongress to actually cut back on Federal support for education.\n  At the same time, as baby boomers' children enter the schools, as \nenrollment grows in my State, as it is growing in many States around \nthis country, we are seeing Federal support for education dropping in \nabsolute terms.\n  I had a chance to visit Las Cruces, NM, with a group of experts on \neducation who were looking at the problem of Hispanic students who are \ndropping out of our schools in very large numbers in my State and \nthroughout the country. We were having lunch in a restaurant, an \nexcellent restaurant named Roberto's in Las Cruces. I recommend it to \nanybody. But we were having lunch there, and a woman recognized me and \ncame over to introduce herself.\n  She said that she was a seventh grade teacher. She taught math in the \nseventh grade. So I suggested she sit down with this group of experts \nand talk to them about what needs she saw in education.\n  The first thing she raised was, ``We would certainly appreciate \nanything that you can do to get us more money for supplies.'' And I \nsaid, ``What do you mean, `supplies?' '' She said, ``We get an \nallocation. I, as a seventh grade teacher, get an allocation of $50 a \nyear for supplies for my entire class, and that includes the cost of \ncopying materials that I want to pass out to my students. So we wind up \neither with me not providing the materials or with me paying for it out \nof my pocket or having bake sales or depending upon charity of some \nkind to cover this cost.''\n  Madam President, it is in that context that we are talking about \ncutting funds for education here at the national level. It is also in \nthe context of a defense bill which is pending or will be pending soon \nhere in the Senate that goes $9.4 billion over what the Pentagon \nrequested this year.\n  So we are cutting back on education funds and adding over $9 billion \nto what the Defense Department requested, and I think the American \npeople believe that our priorities are out of whack. The priorities of \nthis Congress are not the priorities of the American people. The \nAmerican people would like us to spend more than 1.4 percent of the \nFederal budget on education.\n  I also want to say that this issue about whether the Federal \nGovernment should help or whether it is none of the Federal \nGovernment's business is really an inside-the-beltway kind of an issue, \nas far as I can tell. When I go home and talk to teachers and parents, \nthey are not particularly concerned about which level of government is \nproviding the support. What they want is to see the local school \ndistrict and the\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\nState and the Federal Government working together to solve the real \nproblems of providing quality education.\n  This is a real issue here. Today, as I understand it, some Members on \nthe House side announced yet another proposal to repeal Goals 2000. \nThey did so by making a statement about how this is a first step toward \neliminating Federal involvement in education. Madam President, this is \nnot the burning issue, this issue of eliminating Federal involvement. \nIt is not the burning issue in my State. The issue is how do we get the \nresources and the support to educate our children in the way we believe \nthey should be educated.\n  In a State like mine, which is growing, student enrollment is also \ngrowing. It is estimated by the year 2002 we will have 20,000 \nadditional students in my State. These are students who we are not \npresently planning funding to support.\n  We need technology in our schools. I think everybody here, the \nPresiding Officer, has been a leader in trying to assist schools in \nobtaining technology to improve education.\n  We need to put our money where our mouth is on this issue of \ntechnology for education, and begin here at the Federal level to \nsupport local school districts and States in their efforts to obtain \ntechnology and upgrade the quality of education through the use of \ntechnology.\n  We simply have to do more than the House has proposed to do. In my \nview, I am encouraged that there have been negotiations. I am \nencouraged there seems to be a bipartisan consensus to restore funds to \na previous level in most areas. Frankly, Madam President, I believe we \nneed to do better than this bipartisan discussion seems to be taking \nus.\n  As I understand it, the majority leader has an amendment he will \noffer in this area. It should be praised in several respects. It is \nstrong in such areas as special education grants to the States and \ntitle I funding and several smaller student aid programs. However, as I \nunderstand the amendment, it would be at a level of $2.3 billion, which \nis still substantially less than the $3.1 billion that Senator Harkin \nwould propose in his alternative amendment. By cutting away at some of \nthose funds that Senator Harkin would provide, it keeps us from \naddressing some key areas.\n  In particular, as I understand it, the Lott amendment provides no \nadditional funds for key programs such as the Goals 2000 Program, for \nbilingual education, for school-to-work, for teacher training, for the \nTRIO Program, nor does the Lott amendment provide $68 million in \nadditional funds the Department needs to continue its very successful \ndirect lending program. This amendment also fails to increase education \ntechnology programs to the same extent that the Harkin amendment would. \nIn addition, the Lott amendment would appear to not include any \nadditional funding for Head Start or job training programs.\n  As I understand the Harkin amendment, in contrast, it increases \nspending levels for key programs well beyond the previous year's level \nin the committee bill or in the Lott amendment. There is $136 million \nmore for Goals 2000, $77 million for bilingual and immigrant education, \n$227 million more for education technology programs. Clearly, those are \nvery important to us as we approach the new century.\n  Cutting, freezing, or even reluctantly supporting minor increases in \neducation funding is simply the wrong way to go, in my opinion. We need \nsome restructuring in our schools. All of the problems in our schools \ncannot be solved by additional resources. That is clear. We need \nsmaller schools. We need better trained teachers. We need to have \nclassrooms that are better equipped. Clearly, funding is part of the \nsolution. Just as funding is part of the solution to improving and \nmodernizing our defense capability, adequate resources are part of the \nsolution to improving and upgrading the quality of education for our \nstudents.\n  I hope very much, Madam President, before the Congress adjourns, we \ncan get a chance here on the floor of the Senate to vote for a level of \nfunding which is equal to what the President requested in education. I \ndo not think his request was in any way excessive. It still keeps us at \nabout 1.5 percent of the official budget. It is a very modest increase \nby any measure. I believe that is consistent with what the American \npeople would like to see in the area of education.\n  I hope, very much, that we will have a chance to vote on that level \nwhich is represented by the Harkin amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that. I know it is consistent with the people I speak to in my \nhome State. I believe it is consistent with the majority view \nthroughout this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10776-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1997--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I understand the conference report on \nthe Transportation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee is now \nbefore us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move that the Senate adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I withhold making that motion at this time.\n  Mr. President, we are here to present the conference report, myself \nand Senator Frank Lautenberg, representing the State of New Jersey and \nthe ranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee. We have enjoyed a marvelous working \nrelationship, and I take another opportunity to thank Senator \nLautenberg for his fine support. His contribution has been great. We \nhave had not only a wonderful working relationship, but we enjoy a deep \npersonal friendship as well, by which I am blessed.\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\n  Also, at this time I would like to comment that Anne Miano of my \nstaff took on this role as being the chief clerk of the Transportation \nSubcommittee really kind of in the winding down days of the Senate, \nshowing her great capacity to move into the No. 1 slot upon the \nretirement of Pat McCann, who had held that position for many years. I \nthank her especially for her efficiency and her quick comprehension of \nall the details which she now has performed so well as the chief clerk \nfor the majority on this subcommittee.\n  Peter Rogoff is also a very fundamental part of our operation. As I \nhave said frequently and I say again, Mr. President, the relationship \nthat exists between the minority and the majority--and I have been in \nboth--is that we hardly know a distinction, at the staff level \nespecially, and he has filled in, provided me with information as well \nas Senator Lautenberg. We have no distinctions of partisanship, no \nlabels that separate us. It is a marvelous kind of collaborative effort \nthat Peter Rogoff and Anne Miano now--and before Pat McCann--enjoy.\n  We have now concluded our conference for the fiscal year 1997 \nDepartment of Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill, \nH.R. 3675. In total, this conference report contains $12 billion in new \nbudget authority for transportation programs and projects and $35 \nbillion in outlays.\n  The conference report includes funds to continue the vital air \ntraffic control operations for the Federal Aviation Administration, the \nsearch and rescue activities of the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as many \nother critical functions of the department. In addition, it will \nprovide billions of dollars for needed infrastructure projects across \nthe Nation.\n  I am particularly pleased to point out that this report includes $150 \nmillion for State infrastructure banks programs. This program will \npermit interested States to use innovative financing to stretch their \ntransportation dollars and maximize the Federal investment in \ntransportation. Ten States are already in the program and this \nappropriation will allow even more States to participate. I believe \nthat the SIB's Program will become increasingly important in the years \nahead as States work to find modern financing tools to help improve \ntheir State's transportation networks.\n\n  The Essential Air Service has been funded at $25.9 million, the \nSenate-passed level for this Program. I have heard from many Senators \nin support of the EAS Program. They have told me that without the EAS \nprogram, people in communities dependent on EAS service would find \nthemselves isolated and be forced to drive long distances to reach \ntheir destinations. I am pleased that we were able to increase the \nfunds for this program, which had received only $10 million in the \nHouse-passed bill. In other words, we are now more than 2\\1/2\\ times \nthat House figure.\n  The conference report includes an increase for FAA operations of \n$254.3 million above the fiscal year 1996 level. This 5-percent \nincrease will support the hiring of 500 new air traffic controllers, \n367 new aviation safety inspectors, and other regulatory oversight \npersonnel. It also provides a 9-percent increase in funding for field \nmaintenance of air traffic equipment.\n  In light of the recent TWA flight 800 tragedy, the conferees have \nfully funded the administration's request of $36.055 million for \naviation security technology. This amount includes $27.4 million for \nresearch and development into new devices to detect explosives and \nweapons, and $1.3 million to harden aircraft against the effects of \nexplosives. We have fully funded the administration's request for \noperational security by providing $71.9 million to fund about 780 \nsecurity personnel.\n  The conferees included $13 million for FAA research, engineering, and \ndevelopment in order to improve aviation safety in hazardous weather. \nThis amount is about $6.6 million above the administration's request \nfor weather research and will enable FAA to place a higher priority on \naviation weather safety research.\n  The conference report contains $1.46 billion for grants for the \nAirport Improvement Program [AIP]. This is an increase of $10 million \nabove the fiscal year 1996 level and $110 million above the \nadministration's request. I believe that these grants are very \nimportant for airports around the Nation and will do much to improve \nthe quality of aviation service for the public.\n  I would also like to underscore that we have provided an obligation \nlimitation of $18 billion for grants to States from the highway trust \nfund. This amount is $450 million above the fiscal year 1996 level for \nthe Federal-aid highway program. We have rejected the administration's \nrequest to make some previously exempt highway programs part of the \noverall obligation ceiling and rescind $300 million of previously \nauthorized ISTEA projects. The conferees were not able to include an \namendment that was adopted on the Senate floor to address the impact of \nthe reporting of excise tax data on the allocation of Federal-aid \nhighway funds. This issue and other related issues will be taken up \nduring next year's debate on reauthorizing the ISTEA Program.\n  A total of $760.45 million is provided for all Amtrak accounts--\nincluding the Northeast corridor--an increase of $10.45 million above \nthe fiscal year 1996 level. This appropriation includes $115 million \nfor the Northeast corridor, a freeze at the current level. It also \nincludes $80 million in high-speed rail funds for Amtrak, as well as \n$342 million for operations, the amount requested by the \nadministration. Amtrak capital is funded at $223.45 million, which is \nclose to the fiscal year 1996 level of $230 million.\n  The conferees were mindful of Amtrak's need for more funds and added \n$38 million to the Transportation Subcommittee's conference allocation \nin order to increase Amtrak's capital account. Amtrak's long-term \nproblems require legislative solutions that cannot be addressed by the \nAppropriations Committee on this bill. The conference report includes \nlanguage assuring States where Amtrak has announced service cuts that \nthey may use their CMAQ--Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nImprovement Program--funds to preserve rail service.\n  In addition, this conference report contains $1.9 billion for \ndiscretionary transit capital grants. This includes $380 million for \nbus-related projects, $760 million for new starts, and $760 million for \nfixed guideway modernization. The conferees also added $97 million to \ntransit formula capital grants, and agreed to the Senate-passed level \nof $2.149 billion--this program includes $400 million in operating aid.\n  Transit helps to provide affordable, efficient, and reliable \ntransportation to get people to work, school, and to reach needed \nservices. Moreover, transit funds help to improve air quality, mitigate \nhighway congestion, and provide expanded mobility for elderly and \ndisabled persons.\n  I believe that the funds contained in this conference report will \nassist States in making their transportation systems more efficient. \nThey also will enhance transportation safety throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I could go on at considerable length in identifying \nmany of these accounts. I think these that I have identified very \nclearly indicate what the committee's priorities have been, both from \nour creating the Senate bill, as well as our defense of that Senate \naction in the conference with the House of Representatives. I want to \nsay, we have had excellent support from the House of Representatives in \nour conference. It was a very efficient conference. It did not drag on \nforever. I believe we had over 170 amendments that we had to deal with \nin conference. As I recall, at the staff level the staff had resolved \nover 153 of them. Then, as the principals got together prior to the \nformal conference, we resolved further. This was, I would say, a \nharmonious, effective, cooperative conference experience.\n  So, I really do not think we have any unresolved, vital, important \nissues. We have not been able to get the level of funding we would like \nfor many of these important issues, but nevertheless I think we have \ncovered the basic priorities of the administration, of the Senate, and \nof the House of Representatives.\n  In closing, I want to say I do not believe we can overemphasize the \nimportant and vital need of addressing our national infrastructure, \nwhether it be by water, by highway, by rail, by air, by all the modes \nwe have employed in transportation. Urban centers are in deep need of \nfurther assistance in the infrastructure to maintain the viability of \nurban centers. And rural areas,\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\nwhich figure so much into our overall economy, have to have, certainly, \nconsideration as well in their special needs.\n  I always like to repeat a factor, here, that I think sometimes we \nforget. A lot of people think the infrastructure is sort of a local \nmatter, a local interest, a local priority. Let us not forget, when the \ngreat President, and the great general, Dwight Eisenhower, out in \nTopeka, KS, in his administration, launched the Interstate Highway \nSystem, he launched it as an Interstate Defense Highway System. He said \nsuch a tying together by a complex infrastructure of transportation was \nas vital to our national security as were the armaments in our arsenal.\n  He also said that about his Education Defense Act, relating to moneys \nfor education, for health, for housing, for a productive economy.\n  So, I hope we will see this, not as individual States, individual \ncommunities, as important as that is, but also as a national interest \nof high priority for the security of the Nation.\n  Again, it was not only President Eisenhower who gave us that lesson, \nbut we have been reminded frequently by the Senator from West Virginia \n[Mr. Byrd] of the importance of maintaining our commitment to the \ninfrastructure, as I have sat on everything from a summit with the \nWhite House settling certain budget problems, as well as having heard \nhis admonitions on the floor of the Senate. I yield the floor at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? I do not believe Senator Lautenberg \nhas spoken yet, but I want to respond to something the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon said.\n  Daniel Webster, in his reply to Hayne, in 1830, January 26, was \ncritical of Hayne for asking a question as to why he, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, should support a canal of importance to the State of \nOhio.\n  And Webster said that we who represent the people of New England do \nnot limit our patriotic feeling to geographical limits such as ``rivers \nand mountains, and lines of latitude, beyond which public improvements \ndo not benefit us.''\n  But, he said, ``I look upon a road over the Alleghanies''--and that \nstruck me as being pretty significant. Daniel Webster, speaking of a \nroad across the Alleghenies, or ``a canal round the falls of the Ohio, \nor a . . . railway from the Atlantic to the western waters'' saw these \nas being ``an object large and extensive enough to be . . . for the \ncommon benefit.'' If he were to question such things, said Webster, \nsince they are of sufficient import to be ``for the common benefit,'' \nhe would not be willing to face his constituents in New England.\n  So, long before our time, Webster and Clay--Clay was an advocate of \nthe great American system which dealt with the banks, with tariffs, and \nwith public investments in highways and canals and railroads, so these \nwere early advocates of infrastructure. They looked at the importance \nand benefits that would accrue to the Nation, not just to a locality or \ncommunity or a State. I wish that some of those critics who criticize \nwhat they call pork, which is really infrastructure, will go back and \nread the speeches of those great Senators--Clay and Webster.\n\n  Perhaps those of today will get a new understanding and light upon \nthese very important subjects, and 10, 15, 20 years from today, people \nare going to look at the crumbling infrastructure and wonder where we \nhave been.\n  When God went to the Garden of Eden looking for Adam in the cool of \nthe evening, Adam hid from God. God said, ``Adam, where art thou? Adam, \nwhere art thou?'' And one day our constituents will say, ``Where were \nyou? Where were you when you failed to build infrastructure for the \nfuture?''\n  I have a statement commending the chairman and ranking member, but I \nwill withhold my statement until Members have had an opportunity to \nrespond. I just could not resist recalling the words of Webster when he \nspoke of the significance of building for the future, building \nhighways, canals and railroads. I shall remember Mark Hatfield as one \nwho thought and believed the same way as Daniel Webster. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nHis eloquence is always very commending. But I couldn't help but \nreflect when he goes back to Daniel Webster, that this bill has been \ncrafted across this aisle, between Democrats and Republicans. But if we \nlived in that period of time, I am convinced all three of us would have \nbeen Whigs, because we have to attribute to the Whig Party, even though \nwe sort of fluff it off as an insignificant part of our great history, \nthat it was the Whig Party that held fast in the words of Daniel \nWebster and Henry Clay and others that building a national \ninfrastructure was of the utmost priority. It was the Democrats who \ntook issue with them on that subject, and is an interesting way of how \nour political labels and our political philosophies tend to evolve and \nflow. But I have no doubt that on this issue, the three of us would \nhave been of one party.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We're Whigs at heart. We're Whigs at heart.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield to my colleague at this time for his opening \nremarks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, obviously, as the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee on Transportation of Appropriations, I strongly \nsupport H.R. 3675, the Transportation appropriations bill for this \ncoming fiscal year. The conference report was filed by the \nTransportation appropriations conference on September 16, just a couple \nof days ago. But this bill is marked by more than just dollar amounts \nor designated programs. This bill exhibits the extraordinary leadership \nof the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, as well as the very distinguished former \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee--two gentlemen who have left, \nto use the expression, a mark on this body that will endure far beyond \nthe lives of anybody within earshot of our voices.\n  It has been a real privilege for me to work with these gentlemen. I \ncame here at a rather mature status in life. I spent 30 years in the \ncorporate world before coming to the U.S. Senate. But one of the great \ndelights of serving here is to have the occasional respite from the \ntensions and the differences that are so prominent in this body of ours \nwhen we hear from people like Senator Mark Hatfield or Senator Robert \nByrd, who bring not only experience but wisdom to our deliberations.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I have to tell you that I worry about the \nU.S. Senate. I worry about our governance and our congressional \nresponsibilities when we lose contact with someone like Mark Hatfield, \nwho has chosen to retire, and many other fine colleagues who have also \nchosen to make this their last year in the U.S. Senate.\n  I find it to be a very depressing prospect, because so much \nexperience and so much knowledge will leave the floor of this U.S. \nSenate, and I hope those of us who are left to carry on for however \nlong that is, can learn from the examples set by Senator Mark Hatfield \nand by Senator Robert Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd is going to stay with us and he is going to keep \nworking, thank the Lord for that. But this bill is uniquely marked by \nthe fact that it is the last transportation bill that Senator Mark \nHatfield is going to manage. His is a very special legacy. He will be \nremembered for his spirit, his integrity, for his character, for his \nintelligence, and for his friendship. I will sorely miss him. I don't \nwant this to turn into a eulogy, Mr. President, but I couldn't let this \nbill be considered without noting the unique contribution made to our \ncountry in these transportation programs by Senator Hatfield.\n  Given the funding limitations we face in this year's appropriations \nprocess, I think this conference agreement does a very good job. It \naddresses numerous and sometimes competing transportation needs \nthroughout the country.\n  There is no question that the conference agreement before us \nrepresents a much more balanced approach than did the House-passed \nbill. The conference agreement goes a long way toward addressing the \npriorities of Members. Moreover, the conference agreement also \naddresses many of the priorities of the administration.\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\n  As such, the President has indicated that he will sign this bill when \nhe receives it. I almost want to say ``hallelujah,'' because it gives \nus added reason to get it over there.\n  As is the case with all appropriations conferences, I cannot say that \nthe Senate position ruled the day on all contentious matters addressed \nby the conferees. Indeed, I am disappointed with several individual \nissues contained in the conference report. However, by no means is it \nthe fault of our distinguished chairman. After hours of tough \nnegotiation, matters were necessarily resolved in a fashion that would \nensure the passage of the separate and independent transportation bill, \nagain, that will gain the President's signature and avoid getting \ncaught up in the quagmire of a continuing resolution.\n  One result that I find to be exceedingly disappointing is the action \nby the conferees in rejecting an amendment that I offered to ensure \nthat no State endures a cut in its annual highway funding from the huge \nFederal-Aid Highway Program.\n  The conference agreement before us calls for the overall obligation \nceiling for the major highway formula program for the Nation to \nincrease to a record-high level of $18 billion. This level is a full \n$450 million higher than the current year's level, $450 million higher \nthan the House-passed level, and $350 million higher than the original \nSenate-passed bill.\n  I have always--and again I join with the other Whigs here--I have \nalways supported increased infrastructure spending, especially in the \nhighway area. I was shocked, however, to find that under formulas \ncontained in the authorizing law, ISTEA, 28 States--28--will actually \nreceive less money from the highway program in 1997 than they did in \n1996. I want to restate that. At the same time as we are going to be \nproviding an unprecedented increase in the highway formula program, a \nlarger increase than was granted in either the House or Senate bill, a \nmajority of the States will actually endure a cut in their highway \nobligation ceiling below the current year's level.\n  This situation stems from the formulas contained in ISTEA, Mr. \nPresident. It is a formula already established. However, I do feel \nthat, when we provide historic funding increases to the program, States \nshould at least be held harmless--they should be guaranteed at least \nwhat they received for the preceding year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table be printed in the \nRecord which displays each State's highway obligation ceiling at the \ncurrent funding level opposite the level they can expect to receive in \nfiscal year 1997.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              COMPARISON OF ESTIMATED FY 1997 OBLIGATION LIMITATION                             \n                                             [Dollars in thousands]

As I earlier stated, I offered an amendment in the \nconference on this bill to implement a hold-harmless provision to \nensure that, as we added a half billion dollars to the National Highway \nProgram, no State would be cut below the current year's level. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was not accepted, and we are where we are.\n  Mr. President, this is a scenario that will serve as the backdrop as \nwe attempt to reauthorize ISTEA in the next congressional session. More \nthan half the States will actually see their highway funding cut as we \nappropriate--a historic funding increase to the National Highway \nProgram. As we approach ISTEA reauthorization, I hope and expect that \nall Members will focus on these formula issues and work to restore \nfairness to the highway program so all States will benefit when we add \nsubstantial sums to the program.\n  Mr. President, Amtrak funding is a favorite subject of mine; it is a \nfavorite subject, I know, of the chairman of the Finance Committee and \nof our other colleagues who recognize the value of having Amtrak, the \nnational passenger rail service, improved, maintained and available. \nWhen it comes to Amtrak funding, the conference agreement is a vast \nimprovement over the House-passed bill.\n  I am grateful to my many Senate colleagues who joined us to try to \nget an adjustment. I am disappointed, however, that the funding for \nAmtrak's Northeast Corridor Improvement Program--that is the corridor \nthat runs from Washington up through Boston --will be funded at $115 \nmillion, which is well below the President's request.\n  Mr. President, the key to Amtrak's future is the expeditious \ncompletion of the major infrastructure improvements that have begun in \nthe Northeast corridor. If these things are forced to drag out, costs \ngo up, changes come in, and as we all know, sometimes even political \ninfluences begin to change the course of events.\n  Amtrak's own studies indicate that all--and I emphasize all--of the \nincreased revenue that Amtrak can hope to capture in the near-term will \ncome from the Northeast corridor. That is where the traffic is, the \nlargest share of the population that is served by the railroad.\n  In recent months we have heard the usual arguments from Members of \nCongress that Amtrak must become self-sufficient. Now many of the \nMembers who have advocated substantial cuts in the railroad's operating \nsubsidy are bemoaning the fact that they are going to lose Amtrak \nservice. The conference agreement before us, they should be aware, cuts \nAmtrak's operating account some $50 million below Amtrak's request.\n  Some of these Members are now trying to find a way to restore service \nto their constituents. I know that Amtrak service is valuable wherever \nit exists, but funding cuts cannot be inflicted without pain. The \nsolution is improving Amtrak's revenue wherever possible.\n  I have long believed, Mr. President, that we should have a \nfinancially healthy and adequately capitalized national railroad that \nserves as many areas of the country as possible. I want to support \nMembers' efforts to maintain service throughout the country, but I also \nbelieve that my colleagues need to recognize that the key to Amtrak's \nself-sufficiency, the key to Amtrak having enough revenue to operate \nthese lines throughout the Midwest and the Far West, is adequate \nfunding for Amtrak's Northeast corridor. That is where the revenue \nopportunities lie. That is where the investment has to be made in order \nto generate the revenue to feed these less productive, less revenue-\nproducing parts of the system.\n  Amtrak's president, Tom Downs, recently testified at the Senate \nCommerce Committee. He explained that, were it not for the recent \npositive financial performance of the Northeast corridor, the trains \nnow slated for termination in the next few months would have been \nterminated several months ago.\n  The corridor carries half of all Amtrak riders, and generates well \nover\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\nhalf of Amtrak's passenger-related revenues. As I stated during the \nconference on the transportation bill, I expect to seek increased \nfunding for the Northeast corridor on any legislative vehicle seeks to \nprovide funding to Amtrak to maintain service on the lines currently \nslated for termination.\n\n  Finally, I want to point out where this bill sits in regard to the \nfunding stream for the airport and airways trust fund. As many Members \nknow, the tax-writing committees extended the ticket tax, which \nfinances the aviation trust fund, only through December of this year. \nOnce again, come the beginning of the year, the ticket tax will expire, \nleaving the trust fund without an adequate revenue stream.\n  The conference agreement before us assumes obligations from the \naviation trust fund totaling $5.1 billion in fiscal year 1997. I am \ntold by the FAA that, with the termination of the ticket tax this \ncoming December, the trust fund will be between $400 and $500 million \nshort in financing the FAA's 1997 appropriation.\n  I want everybody to think about that, that while there are \nsubstantial funds in there right now, they are drawn down at a rate of \nhalf a billion dollars a month. With the expiration of the ticket tax, \nthe FAA will literally run out of money absent any further action of \nthe tax-writing committees. The agency will either be required to cease \nmaking airport grants, terminate certain procurements, terminate some \nresearch projects, or slow down expenditures in critical operating \nareas, such as controller training and safety inspections.\n  Mr. President, these shenanigans with the aviation trust fund must \ncome to a stop. It is not fair to the employees of the FAA, not fair to \nthe airports, not fair to the traveling public. So I want to add my \nvoice to those of Senator McCain, Senator Ford, Senator Dorgan, and \nothers who are insisting that some action be taken before the end of \nthis session to make sure that the ticket tax is extended beyond the \nend of the year. I feel that it is critical to point out that no \nSenator has been more diligent in advocating appropriate action by the \nauthorizing and tax-writing committees than our distinguished chairman \nof the full committee and subcommittee, Senator Hatfield.\n  The conference agreement on the transportation bill was truly a \nbipartisan effort. Throughout the process, Chairman Hatfield exhibited \nhis customary openness, fair-mindedness, and delicate hand. He was, \nonce again, the conductor of the orchestra, trying to make rhythm and \ngood sound out of the cacophony that prevails at times during these \nconferences.\n  In those 2 years as chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, once \nagain, Senator Hatfield has left his mark. He is an informed, wise, \njust policymaker in the transportation arena. He believes deeply in the \ninfrastructure investment that our country has to make. I agree with \nhim. I admire his leadership and will always treasure his friendship.\n  The Senator from Oregon mentioned President Eisenhower and his \ncreation of the highway system in 1952. My graduation certificate from \nmy Columbia diploma carries President Eisenhower's signature because he \nwas then president of Columbia. I served under his leadership in World \nWar II. I do not think he knew I existed. I knew he existed because he \ncame through my area one time and we scraped and cleaned and made sure \neverything looked right. I did join him here, but I came a long time \nlater. It was a pleasure to have him lead our country.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I voice my support for the conference \nagreement, and thank Senator Hatfield for his courtesy throughout his \ntenure as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nTransportation Subcommittee. I also want to note the excellent job done \nby staff, by Peter Rogoff on my side, Anne Miano on the other side, \nMike Brennan, and those staff people who worked throughout the process. \nWe had a retirement take place in the middle of this bill, and Anne \njumped into the fray, as did Peter. We are grateful to them for superb \nand loyal service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to express my thanks to the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee for his dedicated work throughout the \nyear in this body, his work on the Appropriations Committee, where he \nhas always stood as a solid rock in the interest of the economy, in the \ninterest of improving our country's infrastructure, and where he has \nbeen a dedicated servant of his State.\n  This will be the last appropriations bill he will manage on the floor \nof the Senate. I say to him I shall not forget him in the coming years. \nI shall remember him as one who demonstrated supreme courage, high \nintegrity and steadfast patriotism always. I also should think of him \nas one who could very well have sat during the deliberations of the \nConstitutional Convention, which operated behind closed doors during \nthose days, from May into September, and which, 209 years ago \nyesterday, completed its work.\n  Benjamin Franklin, according to a story, which may or may not have \nbeen apocryphal, said in response to a lady's question after the \nConvention had finished its work--the lady's question was, ``Dr. \nFranklin, what have you given us?'' And his answer, according to the \nstory, was, ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' He did not say, \n``A democracy.'' He said, ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.''\n  I think of that, and Senator Hatfield as someone who could very well \nhave graced the membership of that Convention, along with Benjamin \nFranklin, Elbridge Gerry, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and George \nWashington, who presided over the Convention.\n  So it was on yesterday, 209 years ago, that that conference completed \nits work. It was a gamble. Those who wrote the Constitution did not \nknow, of course, what the future would be, how their work would be \naccepted, or how long they would be in the minds of their countrymen.\n  Mark Hatfield is one who has stood steadfast in the defense of that \nConstitution. I remember him for many things. I will thank him again \nand again for the inspiration he has provided to me and to others in \nthis body.\n  While I did sign the conference report to accompany this bill, the \nRecord will note that I excepted myself as to the disposition of \namendment No. 150, to which the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Lautenberg, has referred. This amendment pertained to the Baucus \namendment and the overall issues surrounding the distribution of \nFederal aid highway funds for the coming fiscal year. I was \ndisappointed that the Senate receded to the House regarding the Baucus \namendment, since it sought to correct an error made by the Treasury \nDepartment in calculating highway gas tax revenues.\n  The result of the insistence in the House conferees in not correcting \nthe error is that my State of West Virginia will see $6 million less in \nFederal aid highway funding than it would have received had this \ngenuine mistake been corrected.\n  Moreover, I am especially disappointed that the conferees did not \naccept Senator Lautenberg's amendment which would have ensured that no \nState would see a cut in Federal aid highway funding below the 1996 \nlevel. Members should take note of the fact that the conferees on the \ntransportation bill increased the Federal aid highway formula \nobligation ceiling to a historically high level of $18 billion.\n  Now, I have been an advocate for increased infrastructure spending in \nour Nation especially in the area of highways. Normally, I would be \nhere to praise the conferees' work in finding more money for highways \nthan was contained in either the House or Senate bill. But a thorough \nreview of the impact of the existing highway formulas on this program \nshows, as Senator Lautenberg has just stated, that only 22 States will \nenjoy any increase at all in highway formula funding next year. Those \nStates will see very sizable increases of up to 25 percent, while a \nmajority of States--28 in number--will see their funding cut below the \ncurrent year's level, by anywhere from 1 percent to 17 percent. All of \nthis takes place as the overall obligation ceiling for highways is \nincreased 2.6 percent. I cannot support a policy of this kind, which \ndirects all the increased funds for the highway program to 22 States \nand indeed reallocates funds from those other States to give more money \nto the\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\n22 States. The problem that gives rise to this situation is embedded in \nthe formulas pertaining to the highway program as contained in ISTEA.\n\n  I, perhaps, ought to do as Demosthenes did, speak with pebbles in my \nmouth, so that I can better be heard above the sound of the ``waves of \nthe sea.''\n  I fully expect these issues to be revisited thoroughly during the \nupcoming reauthorization of that bill. Careful review of the \ndistribution of highway obligation authority for next year indicates \nthat the two States that will lose a larger percentage than any others \nare Rhode Island and Montana--precisely the two States represented by \nour chairman and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. As such, I am confident that Senators Chafee and Baucus will \ntake a hard look at these formula issues and rectify this problem as we \nreauthorize ISTEA next year--and I hope that my voice is better by \nthen. I apologize to the Senators for such a weak voice today. I am \nimposing on other Senators who are straining to hear me, I am sure. But \nI intend to work with the Senators to rectify this and other problems \nin connection with next year's ISTEA reauthorization.\n  Let me make clear that my upset concerning the disposition of this \nitem should not be viewed as a reflection on the efforts made by the \nchairman of the Transportation Subcommittee and the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Hatfield, nor on the very capable ranking \nmember, Senator Lautenberg. Senator Hatfield has been very attentive to \nmy transportation concerns throughout this year's process. He has been \na most able and conscientious steward of the transportation budget of \nthe Nation. I appreciate his efforts, as well as those of Senator \nLautenberg, who has been an excellent chairman in the past and an \nequally excellent ranking member. I appreciate not only their efforts, \nbut that of all the conferees on this very important transportation \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, I want to join my \ndistinguished colleague from New Jersey in the very kind and gracious \nremarks he made about the chairman, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Oregon. Like him, it has been my pleasure to join with him from \ntime to time. I have often sought his counsel. He is a leader, he is a \ndoer, he has brought great wisdom to the Senate, and we will be poorer \nas an institution without him.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, as I was \nlistening to his remarks and I looked at these two Senators--one from \nWest Virginia and one from Oregon--it seemed to me one of the best \nreasons to be against a two-term limitation, because of the expertise, \nknowledge, and good judgment they bring to this institution. We are \nindeed all richer for it.\n  I must rise to express my disappointment in the funding levels for \nAmtrak in the fiscal year 1997 Department of Transportation conference \nreport. While the House-Senate conference committee did not reduce \nAmtrak funding as drastically as the House originally proposed, I am, \nas I already stated, very disappointed that Amtrak will not receive the \nfull funding contained in the Senate-passed bill.\n  Frankly, we would not have done as well if it hadn't been for the \nSenate conferees. I do want to express my great appreciation to Senator \nHatfield and Senator Lautenberg for their leadership, for their efforts \non behalf of Amtrak, and I say that the fight is not over.\n  Mr. President, I believe the appropriation numbers for Amtrak are, \nfrankly, shortsighted and do not help the Nation's transportation \nneeds. Our goal is for Amtrak to be self-sufficient, and we cannot \nachieve that goal without adequate funding for capital improvements. \nHow can Amtrak be expected to provide better service and attract more \nriders without the needed funding to modernize?\n  Now, as you know, twice this year, the Senate has voted in support of \nproviding Amtrak the capital funds needed to preserve innercity \npassenger rail as a critical component of our country's transportation \nnetwork. On May 23, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution supporting the creation of a capital trust fund for \nAmtrak. On July 30, the Senate resoundingly defeated--82-17--an attempt \nto cut fiscal year 1997 appropriations for Amtrak expenses to a level \nwhich would have crippled passenger rail services. But those votes of \nconfidence from the Senate cannot balance Amtrak's books. Financial \ninvestment in the system by Congress is critical. Recently, Amtrak \nannounced that fiscal year 1997 included cost-cutting and revenue-\nenhancing initiatives, designed to keep Amtrak on a course of reducing \nits dependence on Federal operating grants.\n  Amtrak is committed to the goal of totally eliminating its dependence \non Federal operating grants by the year 2002. But it cannot do this \nwithout a strong source of capital funding. As my colleagues are well \naware, I have been working to provide a dedicated source of capital \nfunding for Amtrak to avoid just this sort of annual appropriation \ncrisis, in which Amtrak's viability hangs by a thread.\n  My staff and Senator Robert Byrd's staff have been meeting in an \neffort to craft a proposal that would take 4.3 cents per gallon fuel \ntax to the highway trust fund, with one-half cent of that tax going to \nAmtrak for 5 years. The legislation would provide a total of $2.8 \nbillion for Amtrak over the next 5 years. Under this proposal, for the \nfirst time ever, Amtrak would have a dedicated source of funding. New \nrevenue for capital improvements would allow Amtrak to purchase new \nlocomotives, to operate more efficiently, and to attract new \npassengers.\n  As my good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, pointed out, there \nmust be Northeast corridor improvement if we are going to increase the \nnumber of passengers that utilize the system and thereby increase the \nrevenue available to help make the railroad system self-supporting.\n  As a Nation I believe that we must take steps now to make sure that \npassenger rail service remains a viable means of transportation into \nthe next century. The current funding levels for Amtrak will not allow \nthis to happen.\n  I might add that the conference report does include my earlier \nproposal to allow States to use remaining dollars for Amtrak, and I \nbelieve this is a wise move.\n  In closing, I want to again restate my disappointment in this \nconference report but urge my colleagues to support Senator \nLautenberg's and other efforts to boost Amtrak's funding for next year \nthrough an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  In addition, I also ask that my colleagues continue to support my \nefforts to give Amtrak a secure funding source for capital improvements \nto avoid just this sort of appropriations crisis.\n  In closing, I once more thank my distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember for their efforts in this regard, and for that I am indeed \ngrateful.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis kind personal remarks. I also thank him for focusing again on this \nvital part of our national transportation system, Amtrak.\n  I have to say to the Senator that I can't disagree with a word he \nsaid vis-a-vis the importance of Amtrak not only to the East and \nNortheast corridor specifically but throughout the whole Nation. I have \nto say that we lost a leg of that Amtrak due to cutbacks and reductions \nfrom Portland to Boise, the Pioneer. It was a hard pill to swallow. \nThat affected my constituency very directly. We lost a number of other \nlegs to the Amtrak.\n  But, Mr. President, I have to come back to some fundamentals here in \nwhich we operate, and to say not only have we at the Senate level--we \ncame into the conference with $872 million for Amtrak. That is all the \nfunding relating to Amtrak; and had to deal with the House of \nRepresentatives with $542 million. We came out with $760 million which \nis still $10 million more than the level of 1996.\n  When I say we have to look at the context in which we in the \nAppropriations Committee operate, we have to go back to the budget \nresolution. We have to go back to the proposition that there are those \nwho think we can balance the budget by only an 18 percent\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\nbaseline; namely, the nondefense discretionary programs.\n  Mr. President, I want to say--now from my perspective--that we will \nnever balance the budget on that kind of a baseline. But we exempt all \nentitlements, we exempt all mandated spending programs, we exempt the \nmilitary, or the defense programs, and then we come down to 18 percent \nwhich is the nondefense discretionary part of the budget. We say we are \ngoing to balance the budget on that. With the expansion of these \nothers, particularly the entitlement programs, by the year 2011 or \n2015--wherever you want to light on with these economic projections--we \nwill not have a penny of money left for nondefense programs and \nchallenging even defense programs because they will all be swallowed up \nby the entitlements. But, oh, we get so nervous any time we talk about \ntouching those entitlements. When I say ``entitlements,'' I mean \nincluding Social Security. You can say, ``Well, Hatfield, it is easy \nfor you to say that. You are on your way out. You do not have to face \nthe consequences.'' I want you to know that I voted in 1986 for an \nacross-the-board freeze on all entitlements. I had a reelection \ncampaign facing me in 1990.\n\n  Nevertheless, that is not the important part of it. I am making the \npoint simply that we cut $22 billion off of Federal spending levels, \nand it was all in nondefense discretionary.\n  A lot of people talk about reducing the size of Government. It is \neasy to talk that. But let me tell you. It has been the appropriators \nthat have been really at the business of reducing the size of \nGovernment, but with, of course, the assistance of the Budget \nCommittee, and many other committees as well. But I am saying we are \nthe executioners. And we have been put into a situation, as I have said \nbefore, of performing surgery without the benefit of anesthetics. We \nhave to face up to these. And we shoulder the burden.\n  So I say that we are going to have to begin to really put this into \ncontext when we are dealing with the lesser amount for Amtrak--or the \nlesser amount for some other favorite program, or worthy program such \nas Amtrak--that what the appropriators ended up doing was the command \nof the reductions made by the body. And that command took place in many \ndifferent forms--not just the Budget Committee or the budget \nresolution. I am happy to say that we have raised the level for Amtrak. \nMaybe it is a very small amount. But many other accounts went down 10 \npercent, or 15 percent, or 20 percent. Amtrak went up a fraction. But, \nnevertheless, we had what you might call a freeze level of Amtrak.\n  I want to say, too, at this point that I am very, very impressed with \nTom Downs. I am a staunch supporter of Tom Downs. He has been given a \ntremendous task of administering Amtrak, and he has not been given the \ntools really to do the job or to fulfill the mission which has been set \nfor Amtrak. The Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, made that very clear--\nabout Amtrak ultimately becoming self-supporting.\n  So, Mr. President, I join with the critics of this appropriations \nbill. But all I can say is we have done our very best under limited \nconditions of not only dollars but policies that surround us.\n  Senator Byrd brought up the Baucus amendment. I have to say again \nthat my State was not affected that much one way or the other. But when \nyou get into rewriting formulas, it is very, very difficult to do that \nwithout the support or the acquiescence of the authorizing committees. \nI have to say that we dropped that. We receded to the House because the \ninformation we had was the House authorizing committee would not \nconsent to those formula changes proposed by the Baucus amendment. The \nHouse operates under perhaps more structure than the Senate. Being a \nmuch larger body it is incumbent that they do operate that way. I am \nnot being critical. But the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation of the Appropriations Committee brings in a statement of \nthe chairman of the House authorizing committee that he will in no way \nacquiesce for the appropriators to take this kind of action, that sort \nof freezes in the appropriators on the House side more so than it does \nwith us because we are a smaller body and we operate a little more \ninformally, and we communicate quickly maybe even on the floor while we \nare debating an authorization action that is being offered on an \nappropriations bill as a rider. Not so the House.\n  So I think there we were really in a situation where we needed a \nbill. We wanted a bill. We have a bill now that I am convinced the \nadministration will sign, and we can have one less bill in the \ncontinuing resolution that we are going to face this next week. My \nfriends, it is going to be a very, very difficult continuing resolution \neven with fewer bills but it certainly would be more complex with more \nbills.\n\n  So I am only here to say that we have done our very best under the \ncircumstances. So it is not just a decision rendered by Senator \nLautenberg and myself as leaders of this appropriations subcommittee. \nMuch of the problem we are facing here responding to critics has been \nimposed by the body, by the Congress, through the budget resolution \nprocess, and by their orders to exclude military spending--exclude the \nprograms of entitlements from this commitment we have to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 and the reductions have to take place in \nGovernment spending. I just want to put it in that context.\n\n  One last thing I want to do here today before I yield the floor. I \nwas negligent a moment ago because I did mention Anne Miano and Peter \nRogoff on their contributions as staff people. I did forget Joyce Rose \nbecause, like many people in this institution who quietly operate at \nstaff level, in the background, we sometimes forget them, and I \napologize for that. I cannot really say I have forgotten her because it \nwas merely an oversight. She has been an integral part of our operation \nby which we have been able to bring this bill to the floor, and I am \nvery grateful.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Hatfield, for his support of Oklahoma City's proposal to \nconstruct a rail trolley system in the downtown area, which includes \nthe acquisition of additional buses and bus routes connecting various \nparts of the city to the downtown circulator. The transportation system \nis an integral component of the city's $285 million locally funded \nMetropolitan Area Projects [MAPS] Program. MAPS, funded through a 5-\nyear, 1-cent city sales tax, is an aggressive project which includes \nthe construction of an indoor sports arena, a professional baseball \npark, renovations of convention and civic centers, and construction of \na canal system in downtown Oklahoma City. Federal funding for the \ntransportation system is the only Federal assistance included in the \nMAPS program.\n  The conference report for fiscal year 1997 transportation \nappropriations includes $2 million for the Oklahoma City project. It is \nmy understanding the committee supports the city's proposal to acquire \nequipment with these funds, such as buses and bus stops, which will be \nan integral component of the downtown transportation system. The \nFederal funds provided in this bill for this purpose will be matched \nwith local funds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I applaud the city's effort and support its proposal to \nproceed in the manner outlined by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the conference report \nto the Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1997.\n  I commend both the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Chairman Hatfield, and the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Congressman Wolf, for \nbringing us a balanced bill considering current budget constraints.\n  The conference report provides $12.6 billion in budget authority and \n$12.3 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of \nTransportation, including Federal-aid highway, mass transit, aviation, \nand maritime activities.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \nthe bill totals $36.1 billion in outlays.\n  The subcommittee is essentially at 602(b) allocation in both budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  While I am pleased with many aspects of the bill, I must object to \nthe\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\nmanner in which the conference dealt with the Baucus amendment. The \nSenate had unanimously agreed to this important amendment during floor \nconsideration of H.R. 3675.\n  The rejection of the Baucus amendment will directly lead to 31 States \nlosing 1997 highway funding. New Mexico will lose $20 million when \ncompared to 1996--a reduction of 12 percent.\n  This reduction is totally unacceptable and I will be working with my \ncolleagues over the next few weeks to address this critical issue \nbefore the end of this congressional session.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     TRANSPORTATION SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT     \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........         37\n  H.R. 3675, conference report....................  .........  .........\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..............  .........         37\n                                                   =====================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........     23,748\n  H.R. 3675, conference report....................     11,991     11,668\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........     11,991     35,416\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........  .........\n  H.R. 3675, conference report....................  .........  .........\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget.........................................  .........  .........\n    Resolution assumptions........................        605        602\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory............................        605        602\n                                                   =====================\n      Adjusted bill total.........................     12,596     36,055\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........         37\n  Nondefense discretionary........................     12,050     35,416\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................        605        602\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total allocation............................     12,655     36,055\n                                                   =====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................        -59  .........\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total allocation............................        -59  .........\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

The bus and bus facilities distribution table included \nin the statement of managers accompanying the conference report--House \nReport 104-785--directs funds to Hood River, OR, for buses. However, it \nhas lately been brought to my attention that these funds can best be \nused for intermodal purposes. I ask my colleague if he will agree that \nthe notation ``buses'' should be interpreted by the Federal Transit \nAdministration to include an intermodal project at Hood River?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. It is my understanding that this interpretation \nis acceptable to the conferees.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator. This interpretation will enable \nHood River to make the best use of these funds according to local \npriorities.\n\n\n                       Amtrak Privatization Study\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conference report on \nH.R. 3675, the Department of Transportation and related agencies \nappropriations bill for FY 1997, incorporated the Amtrak Privatization \nStudy that was included in the Senate report.\n  As my colleagues know, within 1 year, the Federal Railroad \nAdministration is to conduct a study of reforms and specific \nprivatization options that I believe hold the potential to revitalizing \nintercity passenger rail service in the United States. As the sponsor \nof the Senate report language, I want to emphasize that this is a very \nimportant undertaking. Congress has failed to enact much-needed reforms \nin liability and other areas during this Congress, and Amtrak is facing \nnumerous financial difficulties. Accordingly, Amtrak announced its \nintention last month to cut back routes as a means of reducing its \ncurrent operating deficit. In my view, Congress must not sit by and \nwatch Amtrak wither away.\n  The language included in the ``Statement of Managers'' refers to the \nSenate initiative, which permits the Federal Railroad Administration's \nstudy to include the recommendations of the Discovery Institute Inquiry \non Passenger Rail Privatization of October 1995. As many may know, \nrepresentatives from the Discovery Institute in Seattle, WA, have \nalready done substantial work on passenger rail privatization. In fact, \nI recently met with Bruce Chapman, president of Discovery Institute, \nwho indicated that the Discovery Institute intends to give this matter \nhigh priority. Already, Discovery has scripted plans to form a high-\nlevel Public-Private Council, which would assist in the study process, \nanalyze various options, and make recommendations to the Federal \nRailroad Administrator for the final report, which is to be transmitted \nto Congress by August 1, 1997. Because of its continued enthusiasm \nregarding this issue, I would hope that the Discovery Institute is \nallowed to play a significant role in the Federal Railroad \nAdministration study following its commencement later this year.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Let me thank the Senator from Washington for his \nthoughts on this matter. I was pleased to work with Senator Gorton on \nthis issue because I recognize the importance of passenger rail in the \nPacific Northwest, and I agree with his comments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the leadership of my \ncolleagues from Oregon and New Jersey, Senators Hatfield and \nLautenberg, for their key role in bringing this Transportation \nappropriations bill to this point, which should take it to a White \nHouse signature.\n  No bill is ever all that we might like it to be, of course, and this \nbill is not an exception. Among its disappointments is the fact it does \nnot reverse the troubling course of this Congress towards disinvestment \nin critical areas of our infrastructure such as passenger rail. Amtrak \ncontinues to be underfunded; this bill contains $565 million for Amtrak \nin fiscal year 1997. This number is simply not sufficient for Amtrak to \nfunction effectively and to meet the intercity passenger rail needs of \nour Nation's rail passengers. We continue, for ideological and other \nreasons, to insist on inadequately funding Amtrak. The results are \nalready apparent. The difficult cuts in Amtrak service with which we \nnow struggle in central and western Massachusetts and other areas of \nthe country are a direct result of this course. Ironically, as Amtrak \nis beginning to cut service and eliminate routes, Senators who often \noppose Amtrak funding suddenly emerged at a hearing last week as strong \nproponents of intercity passenger rail service. I hope these Senators \nwill join me next year as I continue to fight for increased funding for \nAmtrak and to ensure that we have a sufficiently capitalized intercity \npassenger rail system.\n  In addition, the conference report appropriates only $115 million for \nthe Northeast Corridor Improvement Project. This is another example of \nthe Congress failing to respond to important needs of its citizens. The \nNortheast corridor is where the greatest proportion of Amtrak's \npassengers are, and NECIP, therefore, represents the key to Amtrak's \nfuture. We cannot continue to attract riders if we do not furnish them \nwith a first class mode of transportation. Those Members who seek to \nsee Amtrak ``whither on the vine,'' in the words of the Speaker of the \nHouse, are attempting to achieve this goal by short-funding NECIP. I \nwill continue to fight in the future for sufficient funding of this \nimportant project.\n  Before I depart this topic, I want to express my sincere gratitude to \nSenator Lautenberg of New Jersey, who continues to be one of the best \nfriends that Amtrak has in the Congress. I know that the Senator from \nNew Jersey did all he could to maximize funding for Amtrak in the \ncoming year, and I look forward to working with my friend next year as \nwe continue to fight for Amtrak and our Nation's rail passengers.\n  Senator Lautenberg also sought through this bill to ameliorate the \neffects of a formula alteration affecting highway funding under the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--or ISTEA. His efforts \nwould have been helpful to Massachusetts and 27 other States who are \nlosers under that alteration. I regret his proposal for a temporary \nhold harmless was rejected. The result is that this important funding \ndistribution issue will have to be confronted next year when ISTEA \nreauthorization legislation is considered.\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\n  As much as I wish the conference report could have provided more \nadequately for Amtrak and provided the hold harmless for highway \nfunding, I still deeply appreciate the work of Chairman Hatfield and \nSenator Lautenberg with respect to many other provisions in this bill. \nThis bill makes extremely important commitments to Massachusetts on \nseveral projects which form the backbone of intracity and commuter rail \ntraffic in my State, and in these very tight fiscal times, such \ncommitments are all the more important.\n  This bill continues the Federal Government's commitment to the \nrebuilding of Worcester's historic Union Station, the hub of \ntransportation in that city and, indeed, for all of central \nMassachusetts. It continues the Federal Government's commitment to the \nfurther development of the Gallagher Terminal in Lowell, which has \nbecome one of the Nation's most successful intermodal facilities, and a \npivot point for commuter traffic among and between the Merrimack \nValley, southern New Hampshire, and greater Boston.\n  This bill makes a critical initial commitment to the creation of a \ntrue intermodal facility at Springfield's Union Station, which, like \nWorcester's, will become the focal point for expanded transit in its \narea--which is the Pioneer Valley. And this bill makes a similar \ncommitment to Cape Cod, which will create a new intermodal center in \nHyannis to help the Cape address its need to provide alternative \ntransportation in a region often choked with cars.\n  Finally, this bill continues the government's commitment to the South \nBoston Piers Transitway Project, on which the city of Boston has rested \nso much hope and expectation for a renaissance along its waterfront.\n  On another matter, with regard to the Coast Guard budget, I would \nlike to bring attention to the fact that this is the 7th year in a row \nwhere the Congress has failed to appropriate for the Coast Guard the \namount sought in the President's budget. I am pleased that we came \ncloser than we have the past 6 years, but we still failed to meet the \nmark. I find this action very troubling when the Coast Guard has been \none of the star performers in the administration's efforts to reduce \nthe size of Government and eliminate all excess waste from the budget. \nJust this past year, the Coast Guard executed, very successfully I \nmight add, a very aggressive internal streamlining effort without \ncommensurate reductions in any of the services that it provides to the \nAmerican public. The Coast Guard continues to do more with less.\n  With the renewed focus on the war on drugs, the Coast Guard will be \none of the lead agencies in our effort to stop drugs from entering our \ncountry and ultimately ending up in the hands of people--even \nchildren--in our neighborhoods and schools, yet no additional resources \nare being provided for this purpose, so the Coast Guard will have to \nabsorb the cost of executing this renewed effort. If we want the Coast \nGuard to continue to provide the services that many Americans have come \nto take for granted, we must not continue to shoulder it with greater \nresponsibilities and more missions without adequate resources to do the \njob.\n  We must be vigilant in our obligation to the men and women of our \nNation's oldest continuous seagoing service, and the world's premier \nmaritime experts and guardians of the sea. We must ensure that they \nhave what they need to do the job, and to remain ``Semper Paratus'' \n(always ready).\n  This bill bears the mark of Chairman Hatfield's thoughtful \nleadership, which we will so sorely miss in the next Senate, and of the \ndistinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, \non whose knowledge and leadership on transportation issues I and many \nof my colleagues have come to depend.\n  We in Massachusetts owe Senator Lautenberg a continuing debt of \ngratitude, not only for the work he has done in this Congress under \nvery difficult conditions, but for the work he has done for so many \nyears past. Senator Lautenberg understands the needs and priorities of \nour State and all the Northeastern States, and he understands them \nalmost instinctively. He has been our champion for a fair and equitable \napproach to Federal transportation policy that supports the economies \nand the public convenience of every area of this country, including the \nkind of enormously complex urban areas that we both represent. I want \nto thank him, once again, for his help with these important matters. It \nalso is fitting that I say thanks to his staff, Peter Rogoff, who \nconsistently has been helpful and accessible to me and my staff. In \nfact, it is a pleasure to deal with all the staff for this \nsubcommittee, who epitomize the professionalism that enables this \ninstitution to get its work done for the American people.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when we passed the fiscal year 1997 \nTransportation appropriations bill in this Chamber, it passed with an \nimportant amendment offered by my distinguished colleague, Senator \nBaucus. The Baucus amendment would have corrected an accounting error \nmade by the Treasury Department with regard to the State distribution \nformula for highway trust fund obligation authority.\n  When the Transportation appropriations bill went to conference, the \nconferees refused to accept the Baucus amendment, which would have \nempowered the Federal Highway Administration to remedy this error and \nwould have given Congress the time needed to adjust this formulaic \ndistribution issue next year when we consider ISTEA's reauthorization.\n  The bottom line result in this conference report is that 28 States \nare losing money for general road repair, construction, maintenance, \nand service in a year in which the overall obligation ceiling for these \nexpenditures is rising to its highest level in history. This conference \nreport increases overall highway spending authority to $18 billion, a \nfull $450 million higher than the current year's level. Thus, in a year \nin which we are pumping half a billion dollars into this program, 28 \nStates are getting hit with reductions, some of which are very serious.\n  In contrast, there are some big winners because of this accounting \nerror. Texas is receiving a $183 million increase, which is about 19 \npercent greater than last year. Arizona, which also borders New Mexico, \nis receiving a 24 percent increase; and California is receiving a 9 \npercent increase. Clearly, in a year in which we are raising the level \nof expenditures for highways, some States will naturally see an \nincrease in spending authority. But I do not feel that there is any \njustification for the serious cuts that many States are now facing \nbecause of this conference report.\n  My own State of New Mexico received approximately $169 million from \nthe Federal Highway Administration during the last fiscal year. New \nMexico would have received roughly the same level of spending authority \nif the conference report had followed the Senate bill recommendation. \nBut as we can now see, New Mexico is getting a real decrease of about \n12 percent, amounting to a $20 million reduction from last year's \nlevels. New Mexico's total obligation limitation from Federal Highway \nAdministration funds is $149 million. I can't accept this.\n\n  I had intended to support this year's Transportation Appropriations \nConference Report. I was pleased that the Albuquerque, NM-based Urban/\nRural Intelligent Corridor Application [URICA] project had been funded \nat a level of $2 million. The Alliance for Transportation Research, a \nconsortia of Sandia National Laboratory, the city of Albuquerque, Los \nAlamos National Laboratory, and the University of New Mexico, has been \nat the forefront of many important innovative transportation \ninitiatives. New Mexico has been well-positioned in advanced efforts in \ntransportation system problem solving.\n  The goal of this URICA project is to implement a system that helps \nintegrate the transportation needs of physically challenged citizens \nwith fixed transportation systems in both rural and urban regions.\n  This conference report also encourages cities and regions in the \nUnited States to consult with Los Alamos National Laboratory on the \nproblem of transportation and air emissions. Los Alamos has also worked \nwithin the New Mexico-based Alliance for Transportation Research to tie \ntogether technologies from this important national laboratory with air \nquality monitoring programs and remediation efforts.\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\n  This report also provided ongoing essential air service funding, \nwhich is critically important to three regions in my State which are \nClovis, Alamogordo, and Silver City.\n  And I also endorse the $1 million appropriation included in this bill \nthat would be provided to Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California \nfor increased Mexican border law enforcement activities.\n  I did want to support this conference report, but unfortunately, \nwithout much warning and little fanfare, 28 States will be seeing less \nhighway funding authority next year while 22 States will be reaping \nincreases, some of which are very large increases.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I must vote against this Transportation \nAppropriations Conference Report, and if asked by the President about \nmy opposition, I will recommend that he veto this legislation from the \nCongress. We were not sent here to protect and defend the results of \naccounting errors. I urge my colleagues to reject this conference \nresult as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that the criticisms \nI am about to make are in no way directed at the chairman of the full \ncommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee. I think they \nshare my views on these issues. I am under no illusions; the chairman \nsaid earlier that the Senate had straitjacketed the committee in many \nways and the House had stiffed the committee in other ways, that what \nwe were able to do here on the Senate side in conference was not made \nextremely difficult. I understand that.\n  I rise today to point out what I believe to be some serious flaws in \nthis legislation. This Transportation appropriations bill, I am sorry \nto say, is unacceptable.\n  I do not want to mislead my colleagues. I am not sure there was a \nrequest for a time agreement, but I indicated to floor staff if there \nwas I would object, and to be completely blunt with my two colleagues, \nI have never engaged in a filibuster in my 23 years, almost 24 years in \nthe Senate, and I am, quite frankly, weighing as I speak and my staff \ntalks whether or not there would be any utility in my doing that.\n  The chairman makes a very important point relative to the continuing \nresolution. My fear and concern is that even were I successful in \nkeeping this bill from passing, the continuing resolution would, in \neffect, include the numbers that, in fact, are the ones that disturb me \nthe most about the bill.\n  So to the extent that I do not want to mess up their schedules and be \nstraightforward with them, which is what I am going to do, I would just \nsuggest they stay tuned for another few minutes. I will, quite frankly, \nmake that judgment and determine whether to do what I have never done \nbefore, to engage in what we say is extended debate.\n  Let me direct my comments this afternoon to what I think are the most \nserious flaws in this legislation.\n  First, I think this appropriations bill badly fumbles the task of \nputting our Nation's passenger rail service, Amtrak, on its feet, \nearning operating income and ending its operating subsidies. I want to \nremind you that is the goal we all signed on to--we, the Congress. We \nsaid that our goal is, in the Senate and the House, that Amtrak will be \nable to operate without subsidies by the year 2002, or, put another \nway, we are not going to help them after that.\n  Implicit in setting that goal--and I remember how reluctant some of \nus were to agree to that goal because there is no other major passenger \nrail service in the world that does not have some government subsidy, \nnone that I am aware of. It always surprises me; my friends in my home \nState, my friends in the Senate will be somewhere on business or \npleasure that takes them to another country, and they will come back \nand they will talk about, gosh, I was on that bullet train in Japan, \nor, gosh, I was on the train in Germany, or, gosh, I was on that train \nin Sweden. It is remarkable. They are clean and they are fast and they \nare on time. Why can't we have that here?\n  The reason we do not have it is we do not support the passenger rail \nservice like they do in other countries. Now, there are a lot of \nreasons we do not do that, not the least of which is our industries, \nlike the cement industry, like the blacktop industry, the trucking \nindustry, see rail as a threat. They do not see it as an adjunct to the \neconomic growth and vitality of the Nation. They see it as a threat.\n  So we have had incredible difficulty doing what other countries have \ndone, and that is to look at transportation as a whole, not look at \ntransportation as airplanes and highways but looking at the entire \ncomponent of what constitutes transportation--passenger transportation \nand freight transportation in this country.\n  I know Senator Lautenberg has labored mightily, and I mean that \nliterally, to try to convince people--along with Senator Moynihan, \nbefore he went over to the Finance Committee--that we have to look at \ntransportation in a different way than we have up to now, thinking only \nin terms of highways.\n  There is a lot of money in it, and for the life of me I cannot \nunderstand why the highway interests in this country, which we support \nby hundreds of millions of dollars--it is not as if we are against \nhighways if you are for mass transit or you are for mass transit \npassenger service. They have fought tooth and nail anything that spends \nany of our highway trust fund moneys or any moneys for anything other \nthan laying concrete and blacktop.\n  Now, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that in \ncertain parts of our country we cannot lay much more concrete and \nblacktop. In the Northeast corridor, from Richmond up to Boston, there \nis not a whole lot more land available to accommodate the increased \ntraffic patterns.\n  What do we do, make I-95 20 lanes wide? By the way, you think I am \njoking. In some places, I-95 is already 10 lanes wide. Where are we \ngoing to accommodate this extra movement of people when Amtrak is no \nlonger available in our corridor? And also, what happens when, as we \nrepeatedly see happening, there is a constant cutback in Amtrak into \nrural areas and into States in the Midwest and the Northwest that \nprofited very much from the access to Amtrak?\n  It is a funny thing, it seems, that old expression of ``the more \nthings change, the more they remain the same.'' I used to be a county \ncouncilman in 1970 in our State's largest county before I was elected \nto the Senate. I was a big booster in the late 1960's and 1970 when I \nwas a council person, for mass transportation, because it was obvious \nat that time the county I lived in, was the fastest growing county in \nAmerica. As a matter of fact, ``Candid Camera,'' Allen Funt's ``Candid \nCamera,'' did a whole program on taking the four-lane highway that \nconnected Pennsylvania and Delaware at the Pennsylvania-Delaware border \nat the northern part of the county and on the Pennsylvania side as they \ncrossed into Delaware put up a giant sign with the permission of the \nhighway department: ``Sorry, Delaware Closed Today,'' and people were \nactually stopping. People actually stopped. It was a ``Candid Camera'' \nstunt.\n  So, in the midst of all of that, some of us, myself in particular, \nstarted to turn toward trying to deal with mass transit, a minor thing. \nWe are talking about 450,000 people in the county. It is not like we \nare talking about--there are 10 counties in New Jersey bigger than that \nand there are probably 20 cities bigger than that. And so we are not \ntalking about a vast number of people in relative terms in relation to \nother places.\n  I found something interesting. This is the part about ``the more \nthings change, the more they remain the same.'' I would be told that \nthe bus service--we had no rail service--the bus service we have, that \nis, servicing the community, is losing money. And so when it starts to \nlose money, what we do is we go out and cut out a route. Let us assume \nfor the sake of discussion there were 50 bus routes, and the system is \nlosing money. They say, well, we have to cut some expenditures here, \nand so we are going to cut out two routes.\n  Now, assume it had 50 routes and 100,000 people getting on the bus. \nIf you cut out two routes, you would think that you would have, then, a \ncommensurate reduction in the amount of ridership. But that is not how \nit works. When you cut out two routes, twice as\n\n[[Page S10787]]\n\nmany people who rode those routes stopped taking the bus because the \nchoices are diminished, not just the people who rode that one route. \nWhat happens is, it has a geometric impact. As you cut a piece in terms \nof your operation, what you do is you cut a much larger piece in terms \nof ridership. That is how it works.\n  So, here we are. In the name of saving Amtrak, we put Amtrak's \nleadership in a position of having to make significant operational cuts \nin service. So, when they cut the train that goes through Montana to \nthe State of Washington, what do they do? They cut alternatives, so \nthat means fewer people ride the train in Illinois as well. It means \nfewer people ride the train in Indiana. It increases in geometrical \nproportion to the cut that is made.\n  It also has a very serious political impact. Then the Senators from \nMontana or the Senators from other States that got cut say, ``What \ninterest do I have in funding this Amtrak thing, it does not service my \nState anymore?'' And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n  There was one place, one section in the National Passenger Rail \nService System that, if we improved it, could make money, money enough \nto, in turn, through Amtrak, subsidize other Amtrak routes so that you \nwould be able to, without coming back to the Government or the \ntaxpayers, say, OK, we can keep that train going through Montana \nbecause Amtrak management says we make a surplus in the trains that run \nfrom Boston to Washington. That was part of the whole deal we made \nhere. We said, OK, we will run the risk of having this whole passenger \nrail service go belly up by the year 2000 by committing not to have any \nmore subsidies. But we need to do some things in the interim to put the \nsystem in a position to be able to make it.\n  So what did we do? In this legislation we went out and we slashed, by \na significant amount, the amount of money that would be available to \nfurther modernize the corridor, as they call it, between New York and \nBoston.\n  What has happened is that Amtrak is an electrified system. What has \nhappened, once you get above New York City--actually in New Haven, CT--\nyou have to switch the trains you use. The tracks are old and some of \nthe bridges need to be repaired and some of the curves have to be \nstraightened out, et cetera, because it is not electrified. So we made \na deal. We said, OK, we are going to electrify the whole system so it \nis unified all the way along that megalopolis, and we said we are going \nto bring in modern high-speed trains that allow us to compete, in fact, \nwith air transportation and road transportation between Boston and \nWashington. We even picked out the trains we were going to purchase. \nAnd because the projections were that ridership would be up because we \nhad improved the number and type of trains that were being used, so \nthat we would generate enough capital, and we would generate enough \nmoney to operate as well as maintain the system. And we would have \nmoney left over to go out and continue the train in Texas which is \nbeing cut, continue the train in Louisiana which is being cut, in \nMontana, et cetera, so we could build the system.\n  By the way, obviously, I am sure some are sitting there, willing and \nready, and I do not blame them, to make the ad hominem argument, which \nis: Obviously, Joe Biden wants this because it affects the Northeast \ncorridor where he lives. It affects his State employment, affects his \nState's economy, it affects the whole region.\n  That is true. But look beyond that. Notwithstanding the fact that it \npositively affects my State and the Northeast corridor, it is the only \nsalvation for the rest of the system. We can duplicate that process \nover time on the west coast. So we can have the capability of similarly \nmoving people rapidly, with high speed, on the west coast. We do not \nneed quite as much improvement because you do not have to electrify the \nsystem, and so on and so forth.\n\n  What have we done? We have done what we used to do in the county \ncouncil days. In order to save money, allegedly, we will, by this \nlegislation, force Amtrak to make further cuts, further reducing \nAmtrak's capability to meet the goal which we all set and insist that \nthey be able to meet by the year 2002. We are guaranteeing, unless we \nget a supplemental or defeat this or change the number that is in this, \nwe are guaranteeing that Amtrak cannot meet the goal.\n  It is a little bit like saying to someone you are coaching on the \ntrack team who has great potential:\n  Look, I will tell you what we are going to do. You do not have much \nmoney. You have to pay me my salary, and I know you don't have enough \nmoney to have me train you, and you have 9-second capability in the \nhundred meter, which is world class. But I will tell you, in order to \nsave money, you have to wear old Keds sneakers. You cannot wear shoes \nthat, in fact, are the kind that are light, lightweight, modern and \nfunctional. By the way, we cannot afford starting blocks. So I am going \nto continue to coach you if you can break the record. But, in order for \nyou to get me as a coach, what you have to do is we have to cut out \nthese frills--the frills meaning your shoes and the starting blocks--\nguaranteeing you will never get out of the blocks in order to keep me \nas your coach, because you never get to the number, you can never get \nto the speed, you can never get to the time I am going to be satisfied \nwith in order to be able to continue to coach you.\n  So why start the process in the first place? That is kind of where we \nare now. I mean, the idea that the rail connection between Boston, \nWashington, and New York, will basically have to be put on hold--by the \nway, we need to up the authorization in this bill for the Northeast \ncorridor to be able to keep Amtrak on track, which is about $17 million \nin outlays, I believe that is the number, to be spent next year to \ncontinue to complete the project.\n  I know my colleagues understand all this Senate jargon, congressional \njargon, but the bottom line is, unless the number is higher, we do not \nhave $17 million to do what needs to be done to keep the Northeast \ncorridor project on time and be able to get us in a position where we \ncan buy those train sets and where we can in fact begin to generate the \nrevenue you need in order to meet the objective of being free of \nsubsidies by the year 2002.\n  Let me point out one other thing that has been pointed out repeatedly \nby Senator Lautenberg. If you deal with this fairly and you measure \n``the Government subsidies,'' both in direct expenditures and in tax \nexpenditures that go for highways, that go for the airlines and go for \nmass transit, Amtrak gets subsidized less.\n  For example, all you may not realize, when you pay for your plane \nticket, the Government subsidizes an air traffic controller that makes \nsure you can land or not land, it subsidizes the building of that \nairport and runway, it subsidizes that control tower. The airline does \nnot pay for that. They pay part of it, but they do not pay anywhere \nnear the cost of it. It is a significant subsidy.\n  So all the airlines are out there touting that this is a subsidy to--\nI should not say that--touting this is a subsidy to Amtrak, ``Why \nshould we pay to subsidize a person's ticket, a woman who wants to get \non a train in Gainesville, FL, and go to Raleigh, NC? Why should we do \nthat?\"\n  I ask the reciprocal question: Why should we do that for someone \ngetting on an airplane? The subsidy is greater for the airline industry \nthan it is for the passenger rail service, and the same way with \nhighways. We have a highway trust fund that pays for the laying of the \nconcrete and the putting up of the barriers, et cetera, but it does not \npay for all those cops that are out there, it does not pay for all \nthose maintenance crews, it does not pay for the accidents when they \noccur, it does not pay for a lot of things. So we subsidize beyond--\nbeyond--what we, in fact, collect in the gasoline tax for the highway \nsystem.\n  Why is it we apply a different standard when we are talking about the \n``subsidies for passenger rail service?'' I will tell you why. Because \nthere are a lot of people who make a lot of money and have a lot of \ninfluence down here who, in fact--and they are good people--who, in \nfact, make the concrete that gets poured on the highways. If you are \ngoing to spend money on a railroad, you are not pouring concrete on a \nhighway. That is how they view it.\n  A lot of people out there make an awful lot of money in the trucking \nindustry. I suggest to you all that you\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\nwalk down the corridor connecting the House and the Senate Chambers, \nand there are political cartoons that are on display, historical \ncartoons on display--I believe it is on the first floor--that show \ncartoons from the days of the turn of the century. Some of them you \nwill remember from your grade school and high school civic books where \nthey have the pictures of the bloated Senators, like blimps, \nrepresenting the big mega interests, the oil cartels and the railroad \ninterests and the rest.\n  This is an ongoing fight. This is money; this is power. This is a big \ndeal to a lot of different people. They do not think of the national \ninterest. What they are thinking of--and it is human nature--is their \nown particular selfish interests.\n  Look, how many railroads at the turn of the century were happy to see \nautomobiles come into existence, and then trucks? They did everything \nin the world to keep trucks and highways from being built, because they \nknew if you were able to put this stuff on the back of a truck and cart \nit down the highway, then they did not have the cargo going on top of a \nrail car where they were charging a fee to send it to folks. The folks \nwho owned the railroads did not want that, and here we have come full \ncircle. The folks who pour the concrete, the folks who make the \nblacktop, the folks who put up the reflectors on the highways do not \nwant rail passenger service. They don't want it, because they view it \nas somehow that will affect how many more highways they build.\n  In a sense, it will. If we, in fact, have Amtrak go belly up in the \nNortheast corridor, we are going to have to build other lanes of I-95--\nnot figuratively, literally--we are going to have to build more lanes, \nunless you want to get on 95 and go bumper to bumper from Washington to \nNew York, or maybe you do not want to go to New York anymore, but that \nis what it is going to take. You will have to do that.\n  You will have a few people make a whole lot of money, but you sure \nwon't help the environment. You are going to pollute the environment \nmore. You sure won't help in terms of safety, and you sure won't help \nin terms of public policy, and I do not know why we cannot get that \nthrough to people, why that doesn't resonate.\n\n  I realize we have a love affair with the automobile. I have a love \naffair with my automobile. I have a 1967 Corvette I had restored. Next \nto my kids--maybe my dog comes next--I love it. So I have a love affair \nwith my car, too, but that does not mean I also cannot be rational in \nhow I am going to approach what are the environmental and \ntransportation needs for this country.\n  So what happens here? What happens here is that we are in a \ncircumstance where--and I have not even mentioned yet the cuts to the \n28 States that are small States in highway trust fund moneys. You have \ntens of millions of people going through my little old State of \nDelaware on I-95, and you just got our transportation money, highway \nmoney, too. You give us a nice double whammy here. I mean ``you'' in an \neditorial sense. The appropriations bill makes sure that we diminish \nthe prospects of Amtrak, which is critically important to my region, \nand I think to the Nation. By the way, you are going to force us to \nhave to build more highways, and then you turn around and say, ``By the \nway, we're not going to give you as much in highways.'' We are going to \nget less money this year with a $400 million increase in expenditures \nthan we did last year with a highway bill that was $400 million less. \nTalk about sharing in the wealth. There is a lot of wealth to be \nshared, but the small States, 28 States, are not sharing this.\n  Without belaboring the point about the highways, it is not long ago \nthe Senate passed its version of the Transportation appropriations \nbill. Under the leadership of Senators Lautenberg and Hatfield, that \nbill provided funding for Amtrak's capital function and important \nNortheast corridor improvement projects at appropriated levels. Some of \nmy colleagues may recall, and I know that I do, that my good friend, \nSenator McCain from Arizona, offered an amendment to return to the \ncompletely inadequate funding levels that Amtrak had in the House \nversion of the bill, which is what we are closer to now in this \nversion. Specifically, his amendment would have cut the Northeast \ncorridor funding to zero from $200 million in the Senate bill and would \nhave cut overall capital spending in half from $250 million in the \nSenate bill down to $120 million.\n  Mr. President, we had what I would like to think was a pretty good \nexchange of views on the role of passenger rail in our Nation's \ntransportation system and how our Federal system of Government \nallocates the many benefits and burdens shared by the citizens of all \n50 States.\n  Senator McCain's proposal in the end was defeated by 82 to 17--82 to \n17--and that was an overwhelming endorsement of the funding levels \nprovided for Amtrak by the Senate in its version of the bill. But \ndespite the best efforts of Senator Lautenberg, this conference report \nwas a giant step backward toward the wholly inadequate numbers of the \nHouse bill, which is what Senator McCain was pushing.\n  The bill before us today is not just a step backward, it is a step on \na very slippery slope toward the demise of our country's passenger rail \nsystem. Under the mistaken assumption that a penny cut from Amtrak's \ninvestment functions somehow is a penny saved, this bill actually \noffers us the formula for failure, as I referenced earlier, by cutting \nimportant investment functions.\n  Mr. President, the legislation actually reduces the efficiency of the \nremaining dollars spent on Amtrak. Good business practice that Congress \nhas demanded of Amtrak requires investment in equipment and services \nthat will increase ridership, increase revenues and increase Amtrak's \nability to become self-sufficient when it comes to its operating \nexpenditures.\n  Amtrak has undertaken just such an investment program, and the \nNortheast corridor improvement project is a major portion of it. By \nstraightening out the right-of-ways, by strengthening bridges and \noverpasses, by extending electrification along the route between Boston \nand Washington, this project is going to make possible the inauguration \nof the most modern, high-speed rail connections along one of the \ncountry's most populous transportation corridors--and be able to be \ntransferred, I might add, as well to the west coast.\n  All over the globe other advanced economies and some not so advanced \nare also providing such services to their citizens. This country is \nfinally approaching the standard set elsewhere for clean air, fuel \nefficiency, and convenient passenger rail service that can take some of \nthe load off the rest of our overburdened transportation system.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if anyone really thinks that the answers to \nour transportation problems lie in more asphalt, lie in more concrete, \nincreasing our dependency on an already overloaded highway system in \nsignificant sectors of the country? If the improvements to Amtrak's \nNortheast corridor were fully funded and completed, it would remove \n325,000 drivers from the crowded I-95 corridor--325,000. That does not \neven raise the issue of, if it goes under, how many people will it add \nto that corridor.\n  Herein lies the problem. Highway guys do not like that, to pull a \nthird of a million people off I-95. Your maintenance is down, you do \nnot have to pour as much concrete, you do not have to expand as much, \nthough the air would be cleaner, there will be fewer accidents, there \nwill be less overall cost to the economy, and there will be greater \ncomfort and efficiency. That is what it is about.\n  Are we prepared to undertake the construction of more expensive \nairports? My friend from New Jersey and I are bordering States. One of \nthe things they are trying to figure out in South Jersey and Northern \nDelaware is, as the Philadelphia airport continues to get overcrowded, \nwhat relief airports are we going to build? Where are we going to build \nother airports? How congested can the air get in a Delaware valley that \nis 10 million people? Think of what it is for my colleague from New \nJersey in the northern part of his State where there is probably closer \nto 15 million. I do not know what the number is, but it is bigger than \nthe Delaware valley.\n  Where do you go? How many airplanes can you circle? Come with me on a \nFriday night, sit out in my yard,\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\nwhich is just 22 miles from the Philadelphia airport. It looks like \nfireflies lined up as far as the eye can see, wasting fuel, wasting \ntime, increasing dangers, because there is not enough space to be able \nto land all those planes at one time.\n  So what are we going to do? Are we going to build more airports? Let \nme tell you, that will cost you more than building more Amtrak \ncapability. What it also does--concrete guys are happy. There is an \nawful lot of concrete in those airports, an awful lot of concrete.\n  So I just do not understand where people think this is going to go. I \ndo not know where they think our traffic and control systems--how many \nmore flights can they take, especially now? If you live in the middle \nof Montana or the middle of Nebraska or the middle of other parts of \nother big States, yeah, there is all kinds of room for this; there are \nnot many people, but all kinds of room for more airports. But they do \nnot need the airports there. They need the airports where we are.\n  So what you are saying to us on the west coast and the east coast and \nthe congested areas is, you are saying, ``OK. Pick your poison, \nBiden.'' We either are going to congest the airways or we are going to \ncongest the highways. We are going to increase the safety risk. Which \ndo you want? I say, you are giving me a Hobson's choice. It is a false \nchoice.\n  Have those systems in place, improve them--they will probably have to \nbe expanded anyway--but give us also another alternative, a clean \nalternative, an economical alternative, in relative terms. Allow us to \nhave rail transportation which will benefit the whole country.\n\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee understands, and as Senator Lautenberg \nlikes to remind us, annual ridership on Amtrak's Northeast corridor \nalone is equivalent to 7,500 fully loaded 757 jets. I did not know that \nnumber until he raised it. But think of that. Just the passengers in \nthe Northeast corridor. Understand, the passengers in the Northeast \ncorridor are going, in the Northeast, to either Washington, Baltimore, \nWilmington, Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, et cetera.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I was going to remind him as we discuss this and ask \nif he was aware of the fact we would be loading the skies with some \n1,500 more flights a week--that is typically in a 5-day week--where the \ndelays now are unbearable, even when the sun shines bright.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Plus the fact that I want to know whether the Senator \nwas aware that if we had to relocate or substantially expand the Logan \nAirport, which would be required in the Boston area absent substantial \nAmtrak improvements, the cost to the taxpayer would be several billion \ndollars.\n  Mr. BIDEN. With a ``B,'' billion.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Hardly compares with a few hundred million dollars \nspent to get Amtrak's Northeast corridor up to shape where we could \nproduce a surplus revenue cash flow that would not have us here with \nthe beggar cup waiting every year to try to get a few dollars.\n  I want to say to the Senator that the case you make is so clear. I \nhope that some of our colleagues who come from distant places are able \nto see the connection. It is just like the Army Corps of Engineers. If \nthey are not financed to take care of the problems out West, then they \nare not available nor would they be available in the East. This is a \nnational thing, even though its presence is principally in the heaviest \npopulated area of our country.\n  When it comes to services that are headquartered here, like the FAA--\none does not say, ``Well, wait a second. Don't put more money in the \nFAA safety research office in Washington, because we are out in \nColorado or New Mexico or someplace''? They say, ``No. Keep on \ninvesting because we all benefit from such investments.'' Would the \nSenator agree?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would agree fully. The Senator from New Jersey, since he \nhas been here--I am not being solicitous here--has been a leader on a \nnumber of issues, but two in particular, on environmental issues, and \non this issue of transportation.\n  That image, of which is literally true, of 7,500 fully loaded 757's \nis something I hope everybody kind of keeps in their minds. But put it \nanother way. I ask my colleagues from other States that do not have the \nsame congestion problems, OK, Amtrak goes belly up. Who do you think is \ngoing to come after your highway money? Who do you think is coming \nafter your highway money then? Do you think we are going to sit around \nand say, OK, we are just going to go to gridlock in the East? We are \njust not going to do anything? We are going to have a new battle. So \nthe money you think you are benefiting from by not spending on Amtrak \nand putting more money in the highways in States that do not have \nAmtrak because we are not competing for as many of those dollars with \nyou, we will have to if it changes.\n  What formula will you be able to draft that in fact will not justify \nour getting the significantly larger amount of the highway trust fund \nmoneys? We are talking about a third of the Nation's population. This \nis a big deal. We are not asking for anything that we are not entitled \nto, that does not make good public policy, that is not in the national \ninterest, and that is not anything any other mode of transportation is \nnot already getting.\n  But, again, keep that image in mind. I just see it now, folks, those \n7,500 fully loaded 757's bouncing around annually beyond what we have \nnow. Try to get home from National Airport when you are going home for \nthe weekend to whatever State you are from.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What do you think would happen if there was a bad \nweather day along the way? The economy of the country would grind to a \nhalt because we are inextricably linked with our other sections of the \ncountry in our business, the stock market, you name it. What might \nhappen when those 7,500 airplane trips try to deal with a snowstorm in \nthe East, or tornadoes or hurricanes, whatever else is the latest in \nthe mode of weather disasters?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator makes a good point. He and I ride Amtrak a \nlot. When I leave my house in the morning, I commute every day. I have \nclean hands here; I have a naked self-interest. I ride Amtrak every \nday, OK, and have been doing it for 24 years. As my mother says, ``When \nyou are hung by your thumbs long enough, you get used to it.'' I have \nbeen riding a long time.\n  Literally one of my rituals, I say to my friend from New Jersey, as I \nshave, I turn on the weather channel, because if airports are socked \nin, I will not get a seat on Amtrak. I better get to the station early. \nThe converse of that is true. What happens if there is no place to go? \nRight now Amtrak ridership increases exponentially when there is bad \nweather because the airports are not flying, the airlines are not \nflying, or they are so delayed the business people and others cannot \ncount on them.\n  The funding levels in this bill that delay the upgrade are adding to \nthe cost of air pollution, wasted time in traffic, airport delays, \nhighway and airport maintenance costs, and safety problems. Even more \nfoolishly, Mr. President, by indefinitely delaying the completion of \nthe Northeast corridor improvements, this bill will indefinitely delay \nthe day when new high-speed transit--already ordered, already funded in \nthe same legislation--will be able to go into full operation. Not only \nis this a pointless waste of the new equipment, but a false economy.\n  By postponing the day when full high-speed rail service becomes \navailable between Boston and Washington, this bill means Amtrak will \nlose indefinitely the ability to generate profits, precisely the goals \nwe have been told and we have told Amtrak they must, in fact, meet.\n  Once lost, these profits will never be made up. Every year without \nprofits is another year Amtrak routes suffer and go further in the red \nink, another year in which Amtrak will need operating subsidies from \nthe Congress. Instead of committing to the investment now that will \nstart generating this income, that could support other less profitable \nroutes, this legislation guarantees that Amtrak will remain hobbled. So \nthe consequence and impact will be that\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\ntrain that our friends from Texas--and I compliment them on their \neffort--are trying to maintain going into Texas will be lost, that \ntrain that the Governor of Montana wants to get back in Montana will \nnot be able to be routed because it cannot sustain itself.\n  It is like the business of setting up electric and telephone service. \nIt is not as profitable to run a line 8 miles down a road to a farm to \nlight a farmhouse and a barn as it is to run a line a mile and a half \ninto a neighborhood that has 450 homes. So what happens? The people who \nlive in the 450-home neighborhood end up subsidizing the person who \nlives out there on the farm. That is what we are about as a Nation. \nThat is why, for example, we subsidize water in the West. My mother \npays her taxes and I pay my taxes in the East so that somebody else's \nmother can have a glass of water in Arizona or in southern California \nor in many of the Rocky Mountain area States that are fed by the \nColorado River, and the billions of dollars we have spent on dams.\n  I do not complain about that. That is not a complaint. It is an \nobservation. That is what we are supposed to do. We are one Nation. We \nare one Nation and different areas of the Nation have different needs. \nIf the taxpayer of the United States stops subsidizing, or never \nsubsidized in the first place, what was done to the Colorado River, \nthere would not be 32 million people in California.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am about to do something I have been warned is unwise, \nand that is to enter into debate and ask questions without knowing in \nadvance what my position will be. I do this in the hope I might learn \nsomething, but I realize I might get caught. It is with some \ntrepidation I do this.\n  I say to the Senator from Delaware, first, in the spirit of full \ndisclosure, I am sure he does not know this. I would plead guilty. I am \nthe lobbyist in the Nixon administration who was responsible for \nconvincing the Congress to create Amtrak in the first place. I worked \nas a head lobbyist for John Volpe of the Department of Transportation. \nMy final assignment in the Nixon administration was to convince the \nCongress to create Amtrak. In the process of convincing the Congress, I \nremember saying to the appropriate chairmen of the appropriate \ncommittees that Congress only has to subsidize Amtrak for a few years, \nthat within 3 and certainly no more than 4, Amtrak would become a \nprofitmaking corporation, stand alone, based on the projections that \nwere then being made for the use of train service.\n\n  Then political reality set in after the bill was passed. The blessed \nHarley Staggers, late chairman of the House Commerce Committee, made it \nvery clear that nothing would proceed unless a train servicing all of \nthe junior colleges in West Virginia was kept on. Indeed, the senior \nSenator from Montana, who was then the majority leader, made it clear \nthat nothing would pass the Senate unless a train to Yellowstone in \nMontana was kept on.\n  Now, my question is this, Mr. President. I recognize fully that \npassenger transportation in the Eastern corridor--we abbreviate and say \nBoston to Washington--is a very intelligent use of the rails. I \nquestion, however, from personal experience, all of the rest of \nAmtrak's route structure. I ask the Senator from Delaware if he has any \nsense of whether or not trains are being kept on for those parts of the \ncountry where they have nostalgic value but not the kind of practical \nvalue that he has described in his own commute, daily, from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to answer my colleague's \nquestion. Let me first say to him that one of the reasons why he is so \nwell-respected in this institution, and he is on both sides of the \naisle, is because he has such intellectual integrity and he is so \nstraightforward. I assure you, my answers to this or other questions \nwill not attempt to nor could they in any way cause you trepidation.\n  I must admit I did not know that the Senator was with Secretary Volpe \nat the time. It is just one more reason I admire you.\n  You did the right thing. Maybe the projections were not what they \nshould have been. The Senator is correct. What happened was a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle--and Members of the House--who had \nsome significant power said, we want you to run a train into a section \nof the country or a section of my State where we could not justify the \ncost that it would entail to run the train relative to the number of \npeople it serviced. That actually happened.\n  What also happened was, we came along over the years and we finally \ntold Amtrak that they, in fact, had to make some significant cuts, \nparticularly the last 3 years. So they went out and they went after all \nthose nonprofitable routes. I will not say with certainty because I \ncannot say, I do not know, to the best of my knowledge, but all of the \nmost egregiously costly routes that were maintained are gone now--gone, \nin the last 3 years. I cannot say to him I know that every route that \ncontinues to exist is fully justified if you use a cost-benefit ratio \nin terms of the number of people riding it versus the cost of \nmaintaining the service.\n  Let me add one other point. I think the problem is not merely that \none person gets on the train when you need 15 people to meet the cost \nof running the train. What we should do, and what we did in part with \nthe landmark highway bill that we passed several years ago, the so-\ncalled ISTEA, we did what should have been done but did not quite take \nit far enough. We should have said to the State of West Virginia, or \nthe State of Delaware, Montana or Utah, we should have said what ISTEA \nstarted. That is, we should say we have the transportation moneys, most \nof which are generated by the highway trust fund. Now, you in your \nState should be able to, after you meet the minimum-plus of your \nhighway needs, you should be able to take some of your highway trust \nfund moneys if you choose, Governor, and State legislator, and you \nshould be able to take that and say to Amtrak in West Virginia, ``Look, \nit may be nostalgic, but it is important to us, and we are willing to \nput up our money to you, Amtrak, so that you, Amtrak, nationally, don't \nhave to swallow the loss of maintaining a train that goes to every \njunior college,'' or whatever the example you gave was.\n\n  That should be a decision that the State should be able to make. Now, \nthat State may say, ``Look, we want to be able to connect those junior \ncolleges. It is cheaper for us to add a lane of blacktop connecting \nthose,'' or, ``We want to put on a bus that is maintained by the West \nVirginia Department of Transportation,'' or whatever. And so the one \npiece that I don't think my colleague from Utah could have envisioned \nback in 1970, or thereabouts, was that you had to look at the whole \ntransportation component. I think you did the right thing back then. \nBut what we did not do about this and a lot of other things, like we \njust did on welfare--we have to give States more flexibility to be able \nto use their funds. What we do now is straitjacket them.\n  Senator Roth and I have been pushing three things. In your State, \nSenator, you have, in addition to your State highway--I know you know \nthis much better than I do, and I am not being solicitous. But for the \npurpose of people understanding our dialog here--your State, your \nGovernor, your legislature gets, figuratively and literally speaking, a \ncheck for highways. Now, you get it in two or three different ways, \nsometimes, under the new highway bill. You get one that comes for \ninterstate, you get one that comes--and then you get one for rural \ntransportation. There is a section of the highway trust fund, the \nhighway bill, the so-called ISTEA bill, that says if you don't want to \nbuild a highway to connect Provo to some small little town, then you \ncan take some--only a small portion--of your highway trust fund money \ngoing to your State and you can buy buses--and this goes from the \nridiculous to the sublime--or you can build bicycle paths or walking \npaths, but you can take some of those highway moneys.\n  But you are not allowed to take any of that money for inner-city rail \ntransportation. It may be that you want to connect to Las Vegas, NV, to \nSalt Lake City because a lot of people go that route. That is a long \nway, by eastern standards, but not so long by western standards. You \nmay say, instead of us building a highway to have the economic benefit \nthat we anticipate--although I suspect that many in Salt\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\nLake would not want to be connected to Las Vegas, but I don't know.\n  Assuming that was the decision. Then it seems to me that you should \nbe able to say, and the Governor of the State of Nevada should be able \nto say, ``We want to take these highway trust funds and build a rail, \nand we want to have a train run this way. It is better for us, less \ndamage to our environment,'' or whatever. You may say, ``No, we want to \nbuild a highway.''\n  So what the missing link here is, and what we are fighting so hard \nfor is to get basically three things that will put Amtrak in the \ncircumstance where they can be as you asserted in 1970 they would be in \n3 years. Let me tick them off and I will stop and I will be happy to \nhear what my friend has to say.\n  One is to say, look, there are certain basic capital improvements \nthat are needed in areas where we know there is a need, where we know \nthere is a ridership, where we know there is the market to get this \nthing up to the point where it is running a surplus. No. 1. That \nrelates to the Northeast corridor expansion--that is, electrifying and \nstraightening out the old routes, et cetera, and buying these train \nsets. By the way, these train sets are also available for the west \ncoast because there is a growing need, and the Governors in the States \nof Washington, Oregon, and California say they see how it would be \nprofitable for them to have it available. So that is one thing we do.\n  The second thing we have to do, it seems to me, is say that in order \nto deal with this transportation component in the areas where we know \nthe need exists, we should take one-half cent of a highway trust fund, \nwhich is now about 18 or 19 cents for a gasoline tax--take one-half \ncent and dedicate it to a trust fund for intercity rail service. That \nwould generate $600 million a year, one-half cent. Then we would be out \nof the business of us having to depend on direct appropriations. And by \nevery estimate, that would maintain the entirety of Amtrak's national \ncapital needs per year.\n\n  The third thing we should do, in my humble opinion, is we should not \nkeep unprofitable routes on, making Amtrak have to swallow the cost of \nthat. We know why it works that way--in order to get votes. You have to \nget 51 votes here for anything to happen. So we should say to the \nStates, if you want Amtrak, where it is not profitable for them to send \na train, pay them, just like you pay to build a highway, like you pay \nto build an airport, or for anything else. Here is how you can do that. \nWe are going to allow you--you, the State--to have the flexibility of \nthe funds that are available, one small portion of the funds you get, \ninstead of building another highway. I am oversimplifying it--it costs \n$200,000 a year to run this train through Montana to the ski resorts, \nwhich you say generates--I think $30 million, the Governor said, a \nyear. Now, Amtrak can make on its own $100,000 of the $200,000. You \nhave to come up with the rest.\n  Make a choice, Montana legislature, make a choice. Do you want to \nbuild an extra route or highway into Sun Valley, or do you want a train \nto continue to run? If you don't want to do it, fine, you don't have to \ndo it. Amtrak shuts down that train. But it's flexibility, and it seems \nto me it is consistent with a rational national transportation policy. \nWe are then not telling the people of Utah that they have to spend \nmoney to build rail systems out there that they don't want, where, \nenvironmentally, practically, politically, substantively, it makes more \nsense to build a highway. Conversely, we are saying to Amtrak, you no \nlonger have to carry the burden of training the system to maintain \nsystems that don't meet the economic imperative of breaking even. And \nso that is what this whole game plan was supposed to be.\n  My complaint about this bill is, I say to my friend from Utah, before \nI yield to him, is that they have taken one of the legs out of that \nthree-legged stool--the only way Amtrak is going to make it. It is a \ncatch-22 situation. I think the Senator may have gone with some of us \nover to the Library of Congress the other night where Joseph Heller, \nthe author of ``Catch-22,'' was one of the readers. And Trent Lott, the \nmajority leader, read a passage from a great book series that they are \ndoing. It was quite an interesting event. I hadn't read ``Catch-22'' \nsince college. Hearing Heller get up there and read a passage of \n``Catch-22,'' and watching him laugh at his own passages, was kind of \ninfectious. But this is kind of a catch-22 for Amtrak. We need your \nvote. We need the vote from the Senators from Texas and the Senators \nfrom Montana and the Senators from Arkansas. But if you don't have a \ntrain going into your State, then you say--and I am not being \ncritical--you say, well, why should I vote for this? Why should I vote \nfor this? So what Amtrak has done up until now is they have been caught \nin that catch-22. They know if they don't keep the train going--I will \npick somebody deceased, Harley Staggers--if we don't keep the train \ngoing for Harley Staggers into his district in West Virginia, they \nain't going to get the money. They are not going to get enough votes to \nget it passed.\n  So we blame Amtrak for continuing to run on unprofitable routes. But \nAmtrak management sits there and says, ``I know if I don't run that \ntrain, we don't get to run them anywhere.'' And so the bottom line, for \nme, is that this particular bill takes out one of the three pieces of \nthe equation that are needed to make the assertion of the Senator from \nUtah in 1970, in fact, true. I think the three things that need to be \ndone--and I will not repeat them--are things that meet the test of \nequity, fairness, national interest, and parochial needs, without the \nFederal Government demanding any State do anything they do not want to \ndo.\n\n  I would be happy--I see my friend--to yield to him.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment with the understanding that my \nfriend retains the floor.\n  First, let me share a bit of history that I am sure my friend from \nDelaware will find instructive in this. What the Senator from Delaware \nhas described was, in fact, in the original legislation where we had \nthe opportunity to say to the Governor, ``If you want this to continue \nin your State, you have to pay x amount.'' And that is how we got rid \nof a lot of the trackage.\n  I remember one New England Governor, whose State will remain \nnameless, who complained bitterly that certain trains had to stay. We \nrealized that quickly it was a matter of State pride. And we ran the \nnumbers. We sat down with him, and said, ``Governor, for the amount of \nmoney you have to pay you could afford to pick up every one of the \npassengers that get on this train at his or her home in a limousine and \ndrive them to any location in the United States cheaper than you could \nkeep this train.'' When he looked at it, he said, ``You mean the \naverage boarding of that train is 3 per day?'' We said, ``Yes. You are \ntrying to hang onto this train as a matter of State pride. That is what \nit is.''\n  That is how we got rid of a very large chunk of the original \npassenger network. And that is what led us to believe in 1970 that we \ncould, in fact, rationalize this network to the point where it would \nperhaps become profitable. But a number of things happened in the \nmeantime. I have had people say to me that the airplane has destroyed \npassenger services in the United States--rail passenger service--as \npeople prefer to take the airplane. That is not true. It was the \nInterstate Highway System that destroyed the rail passenger service in \nthis country. Something like 98 percent of intercity trips in this \ncountry are still done on the Interstate Highway System. When we built \nthe Interstate Highway System we sounded the death knell for rail \npassenger service except in congested corridors like Washington to \nBoston where it is just as fast to take the train as it would be to \nfly.\n  I had an office in New York as well as an office in Washington when I \nwas in private business. I found that I could get to downtown New York \njust as fast on a metroliner as I could by taking the plane to \nLaGuardia and then fighting the traffic with a taxicab.\n  So I assure the Senator from Delaware that I am in favor of doing \nwhat I can to see to it that intelligent rail passenger service \ncontinues in the heavily congested corridors, primarily the Northeast \ncorridor.\n  So all I would say to my friend is that I was unaware of the details \nof this bill until I heard him speaking. I will now examine it. I \nassure him that\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\nmy vote will not be based on whether or not there is a train running \nthrough Utah but on what makes good national policy sense. That does \nnot mean that I will vote with the Senator. That just means that I will \nlook at the issue in the way I would not have had I not heard him speak \non it.\n  I will make one comment on the discussion he has had with respect to \nthe National Highway Trust Fund. Again, during my years in the \nDepartment of Transportation, I was getting intimately acquainted with \nthe National Highway Trust Fund. And one of the other programs that I \nwas responsible for convincing the Congress to pass in that same period \nwas the airport and airways trust fund. We naively believed when we got \nthat bill through both Houses of Congress and down to President Nixon's \ndesk that we had solved the funding crisis for the FAA for perpetuity. \nNow there is a trust fund set up to be funded by ticket revenues and \ntakeoff and landing charges at the various airports that would see to \nit that the FAA never need compete with any other agency for Federal \nfunds. It had its own trust fund and its own source of funding.\n  Well, Mr. President, then came along the unified budget. I do not \nknow which President it was that did it. I am afraid if I checked it \nthat I would discover that it was probably a Republican. But the fact \nis that the highway trust fund always runs a surplus. The funds are \nsubjected to appropriations, and the money to build our highway \ninfrastructure is always constrained by political decisions made on \nthis floor and at the other end of the Capitol. And the people who run \nthe Federal Highway Administration can no longer, as it was envisioned \nthat they would when President Eisenhower worked to create it, depend \non a steady source of income for their fund. Neither can the people who \nrun the FAA depend on a steady source of funds because their fund is \nalways overfunded and Presidents always dip into that fund. Now they \nsay they do not dip into the fund. They use the mechanisms of the \nunified budget to underappropriate from the fund so the money in paper \nis still there but in fact it is never spent.\n\n  I say to the Senator that, if he created a trust fund for rail, he \nwould discover that subsequent Presidents would do the same thing to \nthat trust fund that they have done to the highway trust fund and the \nairport and airways trust fund, and every other fund. They would render \nit, frankly, a dead letter.\n  If we were to spend the amount of money--to conclude this on the \nairport and airways trust fund--on the airport and airways trust fund \nactually on airports and airways right up to the full amount that comes \ninto the trust fund every year, we wouldn't have the current problems \nthat we have.\n  Not to delay the debate, but my friend enjoys a good anecdote. So I \nwill leave him with this as I leave the floor.\n  In a discussion about computer systems and their vulnerability to \nhackers getting into computer systems and having access to information \nthat they do not have, the expert who was running that discussion said, \n``All parts of the Government are vulnerable. The hackers can get into \nanything--the Pentagon, the Social Security files, anything--with one \nexception; and, that is the FAA computer system running our air traffic \ncontrol system. The reason it is not vulnerable to a hacker is that it \nis so obsolete and so ancient that no amount of modern computer \nactivity can get into that.''\n  So I share that with my friend and indicate to him that a trust fund \nmight not be the answer to his problem. I assure the Senator that I \nwill now look at this bill in a new light.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize I still have the floor. A number \nof people want to speak. Before my colleague leaves the floor, let me \nsay that one of the things that I know he has knowledge about is how so \nmuch has changed in the last 30 years. And that is that we had plenty \nof room to expand with airports in certain areas. We do not have that \nsame flexibility now. We had the ability to expand the highways in \ncertain areas. We do not have that now. He may be right that this trust \nfund might in fact meet the same fate that he suggested the others had. \nBut the bottom line is that I am a lot better off with this than I am \nwith any other alternative that I can think of. I think that is fair. I \nthank him. I know he sincerely means it when he says he will listen. \nAnd I thank him very much for that. I thank my friend from Oregon. He \nindicated that he might have a question. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nyielding.\n  I want to discuss briefly the Amtrak issue with him, and in effect \npose the question that I am having to wrestle with at home, and your \nsense of how you handle it. I have been both as a Member of the House \nand in the Senate a member of the Commerce Committee a very strong \nsupporter of Amtrak. I think that it is important to have a national \nrail program. It is important policy for our country. I have been in \nsupport of the Senator from Delaware. In fact, I remember, as the \nSenator from Delaware does, your Governor, our former colleague. He \ncalled me a bit ago in terms of the funding formula that we all wanted. \nAnd I was in strong support of it at that time because I think it is \nimportant that the east coast of the United States have good rail \nservice. But I tell my friend that because of what I have seen with \nAmtrak in the last few months in terms of their handling of the \nPioneer, which is a run that serves rural Oregon--it also serves Idaho \nand Wyoming, and the rural west--that it leaves me very troubled.\n  I want to just take a quick minute and tell the Senator my concern.\n  My concern is that the new philosophy in terms of Amtrak is \nessentially to tell people I represent in rural eastern Oregon you are \nsupposed to put up your hard-earned tax dollars today to support the \ndevelopment of all these runs on the east coast of the United States, \nin densely populated areas, and then maybe if those runs are \nexceptionally profitable we will come back and one day have rural \nOregon get served with Amtrak service. My constituents are very \nexasperated by this.\n  I had a community forum in Hermiston, OR, on this, and Amtrak \nofficials came. Now, this is not the Senator from Oregon. These are \nAmtrak officials. And they told the community: We have given you lousy \nservice. In fact, people don't even know when the train is going to \nshow up. That is kind of the joke. There has been absolutely no \npromotion, and there has been absolutely no investment in \ninfrastructure.\n  Now, what our communities have said--and I think this is a reasonable \nproposition--is that what they would like to have is 1 year to get the \nState governments out in the West and local governments and the Federal \nGovernment together to try to come up with a new cost-effective \nstrategy to keep that Pioneer serving rural Oregon open. They did not \nsay the Federal Government is supposed to write out a check today for \neverything. They said give us a year in order to try to have a new \npartnership that acknowledges what the Senator from Delaware has \ncorrectly said, which is that times really have changed. We understand \nthat. And so, give our communities and our staffs 1 year to try to come \nup with a new plan, and the Amtrak officials, who very much like this \nSenator to vote for their budget covering east coast lines, will not \ngive our part of the country, rural Oregon, a 1-year deferral to try to \nwork it out.\n  I would just close this by asking my friend from Delaware, if the \nSenator were in front of a community meeting in rural Oregon where \nthose folks are being asked to support the lines in the East and they \nare being told after Amtrak admits that there has not been any service, \nthere has not been any promotion, there has not been any investment, \nthat they still cannot have a year for self-help to come back. What \nwould the Senator tell those folks in that community? I say this out of \nfriendship to the Senator and as one who voted for the Senator's \nrequest.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand. Mr. President, let me respond by saying that \nthat is an incredibly difficult position for the Senator from Oregon to \nbe placed in.\n  What I would try to do is explain to my constituency in eastern \nOregon what the facts are. I would point out to them that the Amtrak \nofficials who went back from that meeting and met with the Amtrak board \nsaid, you know, we should keep this going for another year to give them \na chance to work\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nthis out, and were met with a response that said, if we do not cut 10 \nmore routes and cut out another $1.5 million or $2.6 million, whatever \nthe number may be, Mr. Wolf, the chairman of the committee over on the \nHouse side, is going to cut everything out, because he is going to turn \nto us and say that Amtrak is doing what the Senator from Utah has said. \nAmtrak is continuing to put money into a line that costs money. And we \nhave run out of runway. We, the Amtrak management, have run out of \nrunway.\n  Then I would say to them that Amtrak's inability to give you another \nyear is not related to what they really want to do. The truth of the \nmatter is, Amtrak knows that their ultimate future lies in a national \nrail system--not a Northeast rail system, but a national rail system--\nand the reason it does is that we are going to, over the next 30 years, \nhave increases in population and shifts in population around this \ncountry that cannot be accommodated merely by building more airports \nand highways. So for every day that we grow older as a country, the \nnecessity for extending rail as a mode of transportation increases \nexponentially.\n  Then I would say to them that we had a problem back in 1934 and 1935 \nand 1936 when all those Eastern Senators and their constituency said, \nwhy in God's name are we paying to build those dams out there in the \nWest? Why are we doing that? I do not understand that. I am taking my \nhard-earned tax dollars to build a dam on the Columbia River, or on the \nwhatever river, and I do not know eastern Oregon well enough to cite a \nspecific dam, if it does affect eastern Oregon. And I would say what \nhappened then was somebody stood up and said, look, this is in the \nnational interest.\n\n  Now, if we spend the billions of dollars to build those dams out \nWest, if we spend the billions of dollars to do those things, what we \nwill eventually do is our economy will grow in the East as well. We \nwill benefit, but you are not going to see it for a day, a week, a \nyear, 10 years, a decade. It may take several decades for that to be \nseen. And that is the hardest thing to convince any constituency that \nunderstandably is aggrieved and understandably has need for a service \nand has money being taken out of their pockets for something they do \nnot see develop quickly.\n  The last thing I would say to them is that those who are pushing the \nhardest to continue to fund Amtrak are the people who support you the \nmost, who are the people who are saying, we should give you a year and \nwe should give you more than that, we should give you flexibility to be \nable to work out compacts with the other States in the region in order \nto be able to use other moneys that are available to you to keep the \nPioneer running.\n  However, I do not in any way suggest that it is an easy sell. We are \na nation, whether we are in the East, West, South or North, that is \nvery much accustomed to and seeks an instant answer to a larger \nproblem. My experience has not been in eastern Oregon, although I have \nbeen there once at a major political event, but my experience has been \nthat when one explains in honest terms to your constituency the overall \nbenefit that will accrue to them, in fact, sometimes they are willing \nto forbear them not having movement immediately.\n  But I certainly appreciate the Senator's problem. Let me tell you \nsomething that happened to me recently. I will not mention the Senator. \nI got a call from the president of Amtrak saying, ``I don't know what \nto do. One of the States that we need help from is telling us that they \nwant to keep their particular train going in their State. These two \nSenators have said basically, if you don't continue to keep this train \nmoving, we are not going to be willing to vote for the things that need \nto be done,'' whether it was the half-cent gas tax, whether it was the \nuse of rural funds, or whether it was the direct funding. And, he says, \n``Then I got a call from a major political figure who holds significant \noffice beyond Senator here in this body, saying, if you continue to \nfund that train which is not making money, I will not be willing to \nsupport Amtrak's long-term needs.''\n\n  It is really a catch-22 circumstance. That is why I wish we could all \nbasically say time out, time out for a couple of years.\n  Let us explain two things. Unless you get the Northeast corridor up \nand running with the new train sets, you have no section of the system \nthat is going to be generating a profit. Unless you provide more \nflexibility to the States to be able to kick in and work in compacts--\nyou helped me in the compact amendment we had last year.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. With no compacts, we are not going to be able to run \ncertain lines. And unless we provide an alternative source of revenue \nfor capital investment, we are not going to be able to maintain the \nsystem.\n  So why don't we look at transportation needs as a whole? That is why \nthis is so debilitating. I will yield the floor----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield just one second more? I will be \nvery brief.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator's case would be logical, in many respects, to \nmy constituents, if my constituents were not acknowledging there does \nneed to be change. The Senator mentioned the dams in Bonneville. We are \nnow reinventing Bonneville. We have all our Governors out, trying to \nset about to adopt practices that relate to the next century.\n  The same is true in the Amtrak area. But what would not make sense to \nmy constituents is to say, ``Look, we are going to slam the door on \nyou. We are not going to give you the chance to try to change, to have \nlocal communities do more, to have States do more, to be cost \neffective. We are just going to shut the door on you and, instead, \nadopt what sounds almost like supply-side transportation policy, which \nis have the east coast of the United States make lots of money on their \nruns and presumably some day some of it may trickle down.''\n  I know the Senator does not intend that, but I want him to understand \nI intend to work closely with him. I am a supporter of Amtrak and \nsupporter of a national rail system. But it is getting harder and \nharder to explain to folks in rural Oregon how they are supposed to \nwait, they are supposed to be cut off, when they are committed to \nchange. The citizens of my region are saying, ``You bet, it is \ndifferent now than it was 30 years ago, and we are not being given the \nchance to change.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Oregon, I truly do understand \nthat. At the beginning of my comments, which started some time ago, I \nstarted off by saying that the more things change the more they remain \nthe same. I cited my experience as a county councilman dealing with bus \nservice in our most populous county. Some of my friends said it had to \nbe totally self-sufficient. So the bus service was put in the position \nof having to cut routes that were not, in fact, profitable. As they cut \nroutes that were not profitable, exponentially ridership dropped off. \nThe more they cut one route, twice as many riders dropped off because \nfewer options were available because of transit changes.\n  Once you start down that road, you are headed for the demise of the \nsystem. What I am saying to the Senator is that this is only one of the \nthree pieces of effort we have to have underway. I am suggesting that \nI, personally, and I suspect everyone who supports Amtrak, understands \nand appreciates that it is in everybody's best interests if eastern \nOregon has access, if eastern Oregon has the Pioneer. The more you \ninvest, the more ridership you generate. But I think we put an \nartificial timeframe on Amtrak and a standard, a bar, so high they \ncannot possibly meet it.\n\n  I see my colleagues are standing on the floor here. Before I yield to \nthe chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, I would like \nto acknowledge, because he asked for a couple of minutes and I will let \nthe ranking member conclude when that should occur, but the man who, in \nfact, wrote the book about the megalopolis, I mean literally, not \nfiguratively, literally, literally the guy who wrote the book is the \nsenior Senator from Rhode Island. I say to my friend from New Jersey--\nhe asked whether or not at some point, shortly, we would be willing to \nyield him 2 minutes. But I will yield the floor and let the chairman \nmake the decision.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask recognition from the Chair.\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy, in a moment, to yield to whomever \nthe Chair recognizes. But we are getting lots of inquiries because I \nknow that there is a request to have a rollcall vote. That has not yet \nbeen propounded. In fairness to our colleagues who have work to do, as \neveryone here on the floor has, we started this debate shortly after 2 \no'clock this afternoon, and I think in fairness it would be a good idea \nif I could ask the Senator from Delaware how long the Senator from \nDelaware thinks the debate might go? I wonder if the Senator from \nDelaware would answer that question?\n  If the Senator from Delaware could answer the question as to how much \nlonger he needs? Obviously, he has as much time as he requires. There \nis a request for a rollcall vote I know.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response to my friend's question, and in \nresponse to his counsel, I will seek no more time. I, frankly, was \ngoing to attempt a filibuster on this bill but I think--I am not being \nfacetious when I say this--the wisdom of the chairman is correct. I \nprobably would end up no better off, even if I succeed, in terms of \nwhat would come out of a continuing resolution.\n  But I will tell the chairman, although I am not going to pursue any \nstrategy other than voting ``no'' on this legislation and on a \ncontinuing resolution, I am hoping to convince some of our colleagues, \nnotwithstanding the fact we will have passed this legislation today, \nand I expect it will pass, that we get a supplemental to, in fact, give \nus an opportunity to work out things we are working out with the \nSenator from Oregon. But I do not seek recognition beyond voting \n``yes'' or ``no'' when the time comes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator very much. Mr. President, I \nwonder if I might yield to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, \nand I ask unanimous consent I be able to yield up to 3 minutes or 4 \nminutes, as the Senator needs, and still retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, my purpose for rising was to congratulate \nand thank the Senator from Delaware for underlining this point. Those \nof us living on the east coast in the corridor have it as part of our \nlives. It has been in my own life. I know what it means to many \nmillions of people.\n  The book to which he referred, which was written about 30 years ago \non this subject, is still pretty well current, because in this 30 years \nso little progress has truly been made. I look forward to the day, \nwhile I may not be here, but I look forward to the day in the not too \ndistant future where we will have high-speed railroads, really high \nspeeds, as our friends in Europe have, speeding around the country to \nthe different cities of our great land.\n  In this regard, I am struck by the number of States that are \ntraversed by the high-speed railroad. And, from a political viewpoint \nfor both parties, about a fifth of the electoral votes in the United \nStates are traversed by the high-speed railroad. I hope that will help \nspur on support.\n  I have some regrets about retiring myself. I look forward to visiting \nWashington in the years to come on a high-speed railroad.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, by agreement with our colleagues on \nthe Republican side, I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further votes during today's session.\n  The Senate will now begin consideration, though, of S. 39, the \nMagnuson Fisheries Act, under a previous unanimous-consent agreement \nreached in August. Any votes ordered with respect to that bill will be \nstacked to occur at 11 a.m. on Thursday.\n  Also, during the session of the Senate on Thursday, I expect the \nSenate to consider the Merchant Marine Act, H.R. 1350, possibly the \npipeline safety bill, and any other calendar items that may be cleared \nfor action. The Senate may also consider available appropriations bills \nconference reports, if agreements can be reached with respect to \namendments in order on those.\n  I know a lot of work has been put into this Magnuson fisheries bill. \nI think it is a very good piece of legislation, and it is very \nimportant for fisheries and conservation all over our country--the \nNortheast, Northwest, the Gulf of Mexico. I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts here. He has worked on it, and, obviously, the Senators \nfrom Washington, and Senator Stevens, of course, has been very \ninstrumental in this legislation. I commend one and all that have been \ninvolved in it.\n  It would have been a real travesty if we would have left this very \nimportant piece of fisheries legislation on the table. I hope you can \nget it done tonight. I assume there could be as many as three votes \ntomorrow. I assume most of the amendments have been worked out, and I \nknow you will continue to work on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10794-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10794-S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the leader for his courtesy and \nfor his support in moving forward on this bill. The statement made by \nthe leader is correct. As I understand it, there could be, possibly, \nthree votes tomorrow. We are going to try to work that out tonight and \nsee what happens. It is my intention this evening to offer the \nmanagers' amendment to S. 39, which is a bill to reauthorize and \nstrengthen the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation Management Act.\n  This managers' amendment will replace the substitute that was \napproved and reported by the Commerce Committee and will be adopted as \noriginal text when it is adopted by the Senate. This is bipartisan \nlegislation that has been in the works now for over 3 years. We called \nit the ``Sustainable Fisheries Act.'' It is the most significant \nrevision of the Magnuson Act since that bill was enacted in 1976.\n  I first introduced that 200-mile limit concept in the Senate, Mr. \nPresident, in 1971. We never envisioned the problems that exist today. \nI was very grateful to my friend from the State of\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\nWashington--I used to call him my ``southern neighbor''--Senator \nMagnuson, for having worked on that bill for a period of time. It was \nmy motion, made after the bill was passed, that named the bill after \nthe former Senator from Washington, who had been chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and of the Appropriations Committee.\n  At that time, in the 1970's, we had two primary goals--to Americanize \nthe fisheries off our shores within a 200-mile limit and to protect the \nU.S. fishery resources, or to protect the capability of the fisheries \nto sustain themselves.\n  We thought Americanization would go a long way toward conserving the \nfishery resources of this Nation. Foreign vessels have now given way to \nU.S. vessels that are capitalized now far beyond what we ever \nenvisioned in the seventies, and the fisheries waste continues to get \nworse in many areas.\n  This bill, S. 39, revitalizes the conservation measures of the \nMagnuson Act. Senators Kerry, Pressler, Hollings, Murkowski, Inouye, \nLott, Simpson, and Pell have cosponsored this bill that I have \nintroduced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these and others who may wish to be \nadded as cosponsors to this bill be added for the Record if their \nrequest is made before the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. S. 39, for the first time, would require: First, the \nreduction of bycatch in fisheries; require the fishery management \ncouncils and the Secretary of Commerce to prevent overfishing; \nauthorize a vessel and permit reduction program to help eliminate \novercapacity in our fisheries capability; require council members to \nrecuse themselves from voting on matters they would personally benefit \nfrom; require fishing communities to be considered in fishery \nmanagement decisions; create a lien registry to keep track of \nencumbrances on limited access permits; and create a new registration \nsystem to keep track of fishing vessels themselves.\n  This bill, S. 39, will strengthen existing sections of the Magnuson \nAct to protect essential fish habitat; streamline the approval process \nfor fishery management plans and regulations; strengthen emergency \nregulatory authority, and expand research activities.\n  The waste reduction provisions of S. 39 are particularly needed now, \nMr. President. Under S. 39, the regional councils will be required to \ninclude measures in every fisheries management plan to prevent \noverfishing. If a council allows a fishery to become overfished, the \nSecretary of Commerce will be required to step in and stop it.\n  We continue to support having management decisions made in the \nregions themselves. But if the fisheries management councils have \nallowed a fishery to become overfished, we want it to be stopped \nimmediately. And this bill will authorize the Secretary of Commerce to \nstep in at that point.\n  But I remind the Senate that the management decisions may be made and \nshould be made by the councils themselves, and this bill preserves that \nauthority.\n  Under S. 39, the councils will also be required to reduce the amount \nof bycatch in every fishery around our country. This bill will give the \ncouncils new tools, including harvest incentives and penalty fees, to \nstop wasteful practices.\n  The bycatch problem is of great concern in my State of Alaska, where \nover half of the Nation's fish are harvested each year off our shores.\n  In 1995, 60 factory trawlers discarded nearly as much fish in the \nBering Sea as was kept in the New England lobster fishery, the Atlantic \nmackerel fishery, the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery, the Pacific \nsablefish fishery, and the North Pacific halibut fishery combined.\n  The waste in that area was as great as the total catch of all the \nmajor fisheries off our shores. These 60 factory trawlers threw \noverboard--dead and unused--about one out of every four fish they \ncaught.\n  I have a chart here to call to the attention of the Senate. Last \nyear, the Bering Sea trawl vessels--this is all the trawl vessels and \nnot just factory trawlers that are committing waste-- \nthrew 17 percent of their catch overboard, dead and not used. That \ntotal catch, as you can see by the chart, exceeds by almost 500 million \npounds the total catch of all five of the major fisheries of the United \nStates.\n  That is the way we are trying to find to reduce their bycatch. \nBycatch is the harvest of fisheries that are not in the targeted \nfishery area; not the fish that a vessel is trying to catch, but the \nfish that is caught incidentally.\n\n  I hope that this bill will bring a stop to this inexcusable amount of \nwaste.\n  This bill also addresses the divisive issue of individual fisheries \nquotas, the so-called IFQ's, or CTQ's.\n  The ``individual fishing quota'' as defined in S. 39 means both the \ntransferable and nontransferable quotas that are known as IFQ's. We \nplace a moratorium on new IFQ programs until September 30 in the year \n2000.\n  In the meantime, the National Academy of Sciences will study IFQ's \nwith the Secretary of Commerce, the councils, the regional councils, \nand two regional working groups to address many unresolved issues.\n  There are only three IFQ plans in our Nation today. Two of them are \non the east coast: the wreckfish IFQ program and the surf clam IFQ \nprogram.\n  The largest IFQ program went into effect last year in the halibut/\nblack cod fisheries off my State of Alaska. The Alaska program involves \nalmost 100 times as much fishing vessels as the two east coast \nprograms.\n  IFQ's are a new tool that we did not even consider in 1990, the last \ntime we reauthorized the Magnuson Act. They were not even dreamed of \nwhen we first passed the Magnuson Act.\n  Unlike other limited access systems, IFQ's allow the potential \nconsolidation of fishing efforts in a fishery. This characteristic may \nprovide a useful tool to allow the market to drive a reduction in \nfishing capacity when needed, Mr. President. However, it has potential \nnegative and other unknown effects.\n  We are worried about the new level of capital requirements of IFQ's. \nWe are worried that fisheries will become investor owned totally under \nIFQ's and not the family traditional fishing that has been the hallmark \nof America's fisheries. We are worried about the impact of IFQ's on the \nfishing communities themselves. And we are worried about foreign \ncontrol of IFQ's, once they are established, and the fisheries \nthemselves if a rigid U.S. ownership standard is not set for them.\n  In other words, we Americanized the system. And, now, if we really \nlet IFQ's go unrestrained, we could really end up with more ownership \nof the IFQ's and destroy the whole purpose of the Magnuson Act to \ncreate an Americanized zone within which we would protect our fisheries \nand have a conservation ethic to be the major goal of the Magnuson Act.\n  The Magnuson Act, this bill, would permanently ban transferable IFQ's \nin the House version that we received. That was H.R. 39.\n  Our Senate bill puts a 4-year moratorium on both transferable and \nnontransferable IFQ's. We just do not have enough information yet, Mr. \nPresident, to decide what limitations ought to be put on the IFQ's, if \nany. We need facts, and we need a study.\n  I believe the House will agree with this approach, Mr. President.\n  The academy's IFQ report will be due in the year 1998, one year \nbefore the next reauthorization of the Magnuson Act.\n  S. 39 includes measures important to predominantly Native and \naboriginal communities in both Alaska and Hawaii. For Alaska, this bill \nwill codify the community development quota programs already adopted by \nthe North Pacific Council. For Hawaii, it will provide CDQ authority \nbased on the concepts that have already been developed in Alaska.\n\n  As I mentioned, this bill has been a bipartisan effort. It has not \nbeen an easy job, Mr. President, to bring together all of the diverse \nviews in this body on this issue. But it is the best of what this body \nshould be doing--responding together to the devastating, wasteful \npractices that we know of, and making every vessel follow sound \nconservation practices.\n  I want to take the time to specifically thank my good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, who has worked with me for some time on \nthis issue. Through the change of political control, we find ourselves \nworking together with very slight difference. This time I was chairman. \nThe last time he\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nwas. But in purpose we have had a singular purpose, and that is to stop \nthe wasteful practices.\n  Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings, the chairman and ranking \nmember of our committee, and Senators Lott, Snowe, Inouye, Murkowski, \nGorton, Hutchison, Breaux, and Murray, and all their staffs, have been \nvery cooperative in this effort.\n  As I said, it has been contentious. Anyone that has ever dealt with \nfisheries and fishermen know the issues will get contentious. It takes \na long time to work out these disputes.\n  I thank the staff involved: Trevor McCabe and Earl Comstock, who have \nworked with me; Tom Melius, who worked with Senator Pressler; Penny \nDalton, who worked with Senator Kerry and Senator Hollings; and Glenn \nMerrill and Alex Elkan, Sea Grant fellows in the Commerce Committee who \nworked with us this year.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the product of hearings we have held \nthroughout this country.\n  We went to Maine; we went to Massachusetts, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Louisiana; we went into Seattle; several places in my State, \nand we have held several hearings right here in Washington. This is the \nway I think the Senate should work. We should go out to the people, get \ntheir views and come back and try to find a way to meet the major \ncontentions that have been pressed on us from out in our country.\n  It is not an easy bill for us to handle in the way we are now \ncompelled to handle it because of the timeframe as we close the \nsession. It has taken the cooperation of the majority and minority \nleader--and I do congratulate Senator Daschle for his role in this \nalso--to make certain that we have had the time to proceed.\n  Where we are now is we have a time agreement and we have a specific \nallocation of opportunities for Members to offer their amendments. I \nbelieve most of those amendments have been cared for in our revisions \nof the managers' amendment which is a bipartisan effort by myself and \nSenator Kerry and our staffs, working with all the staffs of the Senate \nthat were interested in this issue.\n  It is my intention now to yield to my good friend, and I know he has \na statement to make. But we are hopeful that Senators who may have some \ninterest in making comments realize what the leader has said. We will \ndebate this tonight. We will debate the amendments that are offered \npursuant to the agreement tonight but tomorrow there will be no debate. \nWe have not asked for debate tomorrow. We just want to vote on the \namendments that might be presented to us tonight and then final passage \nof this bill.\n  To me this is the most significant piece of legislation to be \npresented to this Congress. It will be the hallmark of conservation of \nfisheries throughout the world. I hope the Senate does not miss that. \nThe world is looking to us to see what we are going to do with regard \nto protecting the fisheries within our 200-mile limit. These are strong \nmeasures, Mr. President. The authorizations going to these councils are \nvery strong. The regional fisheries councils were a creature of this \nCongress, as a matter of fact of this Senate. They amount to delegation \nof authority from the Federal Government to a new body created by \nFederal legislation and requests the States to delegate similar \nauthority to those bodies. That has been carried out, and nowhere has \nthe council been more involved in the daily lives of people than in my \nState through the activities of the North Pacific Fisheries Council. It \nis a unique council. It is totally off the waters of one State but it \nhas members from the States of Washington and Oregon and a national \nrepresentative also.\n  So it is something I hope the Senate realizes means a very great deal \nto me personally and to my State. Half of the coastline of the United \nStates is off our shores. More than half of the fisheries are off our \nshores. More than half of the fish that our people consume come from \nthe waters off the shores of Alaska. We want to preserve the \nreproductive capability of those fisheries. We do not want to see a \ncontinuation of the numbers on this chart.\n  When we see the possibility of hundreds of millions of pounds of fish \nbeing wasted because of fishing practices that could be avoided, we \nbelieve it is time for the Congress to act. I am glad that we have \nreached the point now where I believe the Congress will act, and I am \nhopeful that the House of Representatives will be willing to accept our \nchanges and modifications to this bill.\n  Again, I commend my good friend who has traveled with me throughout \nthe country for hearings on this measure, and I yield to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska not just \nfor his comments but I particularly thank him for the great personal \nfriendship that we have built over the course of these years working \ntogether on this and also for the great bipartisan approach to this.\n  This is tough legislation. There are enormous competing interests all \nacross this country--sport fishermen, commercial fishermen, 15 \ndifferent kinds of commercial fishermen in one particular area, all of \nthem tugging at each other, a huge amount of vendors and others with \ninterests to each of those fishermen, processors, foreign export \ninvolvement. The competing interests are as broad and as complicated as \nalmost any that I have confronted in the course of my time in the \nSenate, perhaps with the exception of the Clean Air Act or something \nthat similarly brings every part of the country against another.\n\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Alaska has done a terrific job \nof helping to build that bipartisan effort here. We started out 4 years \nago when I was chairman of the subcommittee, and at that time we held \nhearings in various parts of the country. At the time that the Senate \nswitched control this bill basically stayed the same. The names \nswitched, Senator Stevens took over the subcommittee, but we continued \nto work in the same bipartisan way, and I think it is a tribute to his \nefforts and to Senator Hollings' efforts as the ranking member of the \nfull committee that we are now able to be here and able to proceed.\n  It is with great satisfaction that I am able to commend to my \ncolleagues this piece of legislation which is appropriately called the \nSustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. It is without question the most \nimportant rewrite of our fishing laws, the Federal fishing laws since \n1976 when the Magnuson Fisheries and Conservation Management Act was \nenacted, and at that time as many remember we Americanized the \nfisheries within 200 miles of our shore. We reached out and said we are \ngoing to try to manage that 200-mile coastline better.\n  It has been a long time in coming, but this bill is going to result \nin a significantly improved regime for the management of the Nation's \nmarine fishery resources. These amendments improve and strengthen the \nstandards upon which the current management regime is based, and it \nenables us to further enhance our capacity to be able to restore and \nmaintain healthy and sustainable fisheries.\n  The amendments that are offered in this bill were developed in \nconjunction with and for the most part supported by a diverse \nrepresentation of groups, all of them with an interest in the marine \nfisheries including the commercial and recreational fishermen, the \nenvironmental community, coastal communities, and States.\n  In recent months we have all read many editorials that have been \nbuilding up support around the country for the passage of this bill. I \nwill share a quick piece from my hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe \nwhich wrote that ``Before U.S. Senators go home . . . they have an \nobligation to complete legislation extending the Magnuson Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, the foundation for rescuing America's \ntroubled fishing industry.''\n  Enactment of S. 39 is critical if we are going to put our fisheries \nback onto a sustainable path and literally avert an environmental \ncatastrophe on a national level.\n  Of the 157 fishery resources for which the National Marine Fisheries \nService manages, 36 percent--51 different stocks--are overfished; 44 \npercent or 69 stocks are fully harvested, and 20 percent are \nunderutilized. The main point illustrated by these figures is that\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\nmany of the fishery resources that have provided the greatest economic \nbenefit to fishermen and to this Nation are just simply overfished or \napproaching the overfished level. This situation is being exacerbated \nby the demands of a population with an increasing appetite for eating \nfish. The net effect has been that we have too many fishermen chasing \ntoo few fish.\n  We are precariously close to fisheries failures in many of our most \ncommercially important fish stocks, and it is imperative that we take \nimmediate action if we are to avert disasters such as the one that we \nare currently experiencing, literally living in, off the waters of New \nEngland. S. 39 provides guidance and the tools necessary to help ensure \nthat fishery failures will be avoided and the fish stocks can be \nrebuilt to provide the greatest possible economic benefit to our \nNation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this bill came neither easily nor quickly. It \nis the result of 4 years of work, the subject of 15 hearings and \ncountless staff hours and meetings among Senators and interested \nparties. I commend all of those parties for the fact that we are now on \nthe floor, able to pass this legislation, as I am confident we will in \na matter of hours. I would like to point out that, from the start, it \nhas been the willingness to be bipartisan that has brought all of us to \nthis point, and I think that is a tribute to the way in which the \nSenate can work when people set their minds to it.\n  It has been my sense that Senator Stevens' own commitment to this \nobviously came out of the fact, which many may not realize, that he was \none of the original crafters of the Magnuson bill when it was first \npassed in 1976. He has had a long-time commitment to achieving this. \nObviously, because he represents the State of Alaska, he has enormous \ninterests in what we are doing here today.\n  I also would like to express my gratitude to Senators Gorton and \nMurray for their recognition of the importance of this bill and the \nbenefit that it holds out to our Nation as a whole. Fishery issues \nrarely lend themselves to unanimous agreement, as both Senator Stevens \nand I have described, and the scope and breadth of the changes that are \noffered in this bill are such that the competing interest groups have \nhad to fight fiercely to try to reach accommodation and compromise. The \nSenators from Washington have, quite rightly, represented the interests \nof their State. That is what they are supposed to do and that is how we \nare supposed to work through this process. I commend both of them for \nhaving done that diligently and tenaciously in this effort.\n  But in the end, it is our final responsibility to balance all of the \nparochial interests with the interests of the Nation as a whole. I \nbelieve that, while there may be parts of this bill which may not \nprovide the full level of benefits that one particular group or another \nmay want, in the end this bill provides an overall benefit and balance \nto the Nation that greatly exceeds the sum of its parts.\n  Fishing has been and continues to be an extraordinarily important \npart of this Nation's heritage. We know that very, very well in \nMassachusetts, in New Hampshire--the Chair's State--in Maine, and all \ndown our coastline. Since the first settlers came to this country, we \nhave been dependent on the sea. We have, however, found that as Federal \ndata on the overutilization of fish stocks has increased, we now \nunderstand there is a growing problem in the management of these \nresources. That growing problem threatens the sustainability of these \nrecreationally and commercially valuable resources. So, before I \nelaborate on the benefits of S. 39, I would just like to highlight for \na moment the economic asset that the fishing industry carries to this \ncountry.\n  Directly or indirectly, the seafood industry contributes nearly $50 \nbillion annually to the U.S. economy. According to data for 1994, U.S. \ncommercial fishermen landed 10.5 billion pounds of fish and seafood \nproducts, producing a record $3.8 billion in dockside revenues. By \nweight of catch, we are now the world's fifth leading fishing nation, \nand the United States is also the world's top seafood exporter, with \nexports valued at $7.4 billion. Millions of salt water anglers have \nturned marine recreational fisheries into a multimillion dollar \nindustry that caught an estimated 361.9 million fish--that includes \nthose caught and released alive--and an estimated 66.1 million fishing \ntrips; an extraordinary amount of activity. As an economic asset, \nrecreational fisheries and related industries generate over $7 billion \nannually to our economy.\n\n  In New England, we have, tragically, become all too familiar with the \ndownside of all of this. We have seen the collapse of the cod and the \nhaddock fisheries. It has come about principally because of overfishing \nand, as a result of that overfishing, our fishermen have fallen on hard \ntimes. In 1992, overfishing was estimated to cost Massachusetts alone \nabout 88 million pounds of groundfish harvests worth at least $193 \nmillion annually. For all of New England, annual losses total at least \n$350 million and 14,000 jobs. While we do not have specific numbers for \nNew England, at the national level the Department of Commerce estimates \nthat rebuilding our fisheries to a more productive level could create \n300,000 new jobs and billions of dollars in additional revenues.\n  So, I want to emphasize what we are doing here today is not the \nsignal of the end of the fishing era, it is not the signal of a \ncontinuing decline in fisheries; it is our effort to guarantee that \nthere is a growth industry, that there is an industry for the future. I \nrepeat, the national estimates are, if we do this properly, we can \ncreate 300,000 new jobs, billions of dollars of additional revenue, and \nwe can have sustainable fisheries for generations to come.\n  The testimony of Nantucket fisherman Capt. Mark Simonitsch at a \nhearing I held in New Bedford summarizes the cost of overfishing very, \nvery well. Let me just share his words. He said:\n\n       You sit there and you think over the years that, if you can \n     finally pay your mortgage off, that the money is all going to \n     go into your pocket. This year, I've yet to catch 50,000 \n     pounds of fish. I have lost thousands of dollars. And my crew \n     has made so little, a crew that has been with me, believe it \n     or not, for 17 years, they may not come back next year. So I \n     have chosen today to talk about solving the hard problem, \n     Senator, and that's getting fish back.\n\n  That statement was from a Massachusetts fishing captain who called \nthis crisis to the attention of all of us.\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act goes a long way toward solving the \nproblem of getting the fish back. In addition, the bill calls for \nmonitoring the health of fisheries and limits on harvests to prevent \noverfishing from recurring. To quote Captain Simonitsch again, he said \nit's time to stop ``all this wheelhouse thinking and tire kicking'' and \nget the bill enacted.\n  The bill also continues my fight for assistance to New England \nfishermen, extending Federal authority for fisheries disaster relief \nand authorizing vessel and permit buyout programs to reduce excess \nfishing capacity and pressure on the fishing industry itself.\n  In addition to preventing overfishing, the Sustainable Fisheries Act \ncalls for action to address two other important environmental \nconcerns--reducing bycatch and waste, and protecting fish habitat.\n  As the director of the New England Aquarium pointed out in a recent \nletter:\n\n       At least 20 percent of our total fishery catch is thrown \n     overboard dead or dying. In 1994, the U.S. fishing fleet off \n     Alaska dumped a staggering 750 million pounds of bycatch, \n     more fish [was dumped overboard and thrown away] than was \n     caught by the entire New England fleet last year.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The greatest long-term threat to the viability of our \n     nation's marine resources could be the continuing loss and \n     degradation of coastal marine habitat. Louisiana alone has \n     lost half a million acres of wetland since the mid-1950's. \n     The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that $200 \n     million is lost annually in reduced catches due to ongoing \n     habitat loss.\n\n  As all of us know, if you destroy the habitat, you destroy the \nnurseries and you destroy the ecosystem on which those nurseries are \ndependent, which then diminishes the ability to have a sustainable \nfishery. We need to understand the linkage of those wetlands and the \nrole they play in the spawning of fish and of the ecosystem to the \ntotal catch that will ultimately be available.\n  I might add that a couple of years ago, the Senator from Alaska and I \ntook steps through the United Nations to end driftnet fishing. \nDriftnets, 30,000\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\nmiles of monofilament nets were being laid out at night in the \nnorthwest Pacific. These nets would break off and fish on their own. \nThey would be what are called phantom nets or ghost fisheries where \nthey would float to the surface as plastic and trap fish, mostly salmon \ncoming out of the Columbia River, and they would sink to the bottom \nwhere the scavengers would eat the carcasses until it was light enough \nand drift some more.\n  There are still some individuals in certain nations who are \ncontinuing this outlawed practice of driftnet fishing. That is the kind \nof example of protection we need to be involved with to deal with the \nconcerns of habitat and of bycatch and waste. This bill would require \nthe fishery management plans to assess bycatch levels in each fishery \nand take steps to minimize the bycatch and the mortality of bycatch \nwhich cannot be avoided.\n  In addition, fishery managers are required under this bill to \nidentify essential fish habitat and to minimize the adverse effects on \nhabitat due to fishing.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the bill before us addresses many of the \nproblems affecting the management of our fisheries and provides \nessential tools to reversing the damaging trends that I have outlined. \nOur Nation's fisheries are literally at a crossroads, and significant \naction is required to remedy our marine resource management problems \nand preserve the way of life of our coastal communities.\n  I believe that this bill goes a long way toward solving the hard \nproblems and providing help for fishermen and coastal communities \nduring the difficult rebuilding period. The opportunity to fish and to \nhave fish on the dinner table is something that many Americans have \nsimply taken for granted in the past. But unless we take the steps that \nare set forth in this bill to ensure that these vital resources are \nconserved, they will not be there for future generations.\n  This is a vital bill. It is a good bill for the environment, as \nSenator Stevens said, and I share the view it is the most important \nenvironmental legislation that we will pass in this session. It is good \nfor fishermen, it is good for economic welfare of this Nation, and I \nremain committed to the goal that fishing will continue to be a part, \nan essential part, of the culture of our coastal communities of the \nUnited States and of Massachusetts and of our economies. It is that \nimportant, and it means that much\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to say that there has been \nan extraordinary effort by both the majority staff and the minority \nstaff who have labored literally for years, but particularly in the \nlast few months, and an extraordinary amount of time has been put into \ndeveloping this bill.\n  I would like to thank, on the Democratic side, Penny Dalton, Lila \nHelms, and Kate English, who each have done just a tremendous job. On \nthe Republican side, I would like to thank Trevor McCabe, Earl \nComstock, and Tom Melius. And during the past 2 years there have been a \nnumber of people on my staff who have served as legislative fellows on \nmy staff or on the Commerce Committee and who have put in an enormous \namount of time and energy to make this bill possible. Particularly I \nwould like to thank Steve Metruck, Alex Elkan, Peter Hill, and Tom \nRichey for their contribution to this legislation.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, are we under controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Are we divided equally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 60 minutes equally divided. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining. The Senator from Alaska \nhas 14 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there being relatively few people here, I \nask unanimous consent that that time be extended at least for those \nMembers who are willing to speak on this issue tonight.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in order to keep an agreement here so we \ncan know the time, I ask how much time the Senator from Washington \nneeds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time does Senator Murray need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Approximately 10 minutes or less.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in addition to the \ntime allotted to both sides, the Senators from Washington be allowed to \nspeak: Senator Gorton for 15 minutes and Senator Murray for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, our journey to this point on this bill has \nbeen long and tortured. And at the end of the road I find a product \nthat, from the Washington State perspective, is greatly improved from \nthe measure that passed out of committee and immeasurably better than \nH.R. 39, which was rejected by every Member of the Washington \ndelegation, Republican and Democrat alike, and which has my support. \nLet me make absolutely clear, however, that even though I will vote for \nS. 39, as amended by the manager's amendment, any unilateral changes \nmade by the House will be the death knell to the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct in this Congress.\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act has been sold, and bought hook, line, \nand sinker, by the national press and the majority of my colleagues, as \nthe strongest environmental bill of this Congress. That is, I am \nafraid, an overly simplistic characterization.\n  I do not, and have not, taken issue with the true conservation \nmeasures in S. 39. But the act is as much a social and economic \nmanifesto as an environmental one. The bill is as much about the \nallocation of fishery resources--the allocation between commercial and \nrecreational fishers, between processors and harvesters, between on-\nshore and offshore processors, and yes, between Washington and Alaska, \nas it is about the conservation of fish.\n  Before I comment on what I think is wrong with this measure, I would \nlike to recognize those aspects that are sound. I generally endorse the \nmeasure's conservation provisions; its treatment of individual fishing \nquotas; and its efforts to mitigate the effects of the Federal court's \nallocation of shellfish resources to Indian tribes in Washington State.\n\n\n                   Conservation of Fishery Resources\n\n  The conservation provisions in S. 39 are the only aspect of the bill \nthat most of the public knows or cares about. Contrary to reports, I \njoin my colleagues in lauding those provisions that aim to reduce waste \nand bycatch in the fisheries, to prevent overfishing, and to restore \noverfished fisheries to health. But I take a more cautious view of the \nextent to which these worthy goals will be achieved than do most of my \ncolleagues and members of the national press.\n  This bill pushes the regional fishery management councils, some of \nwhich have proven unwilling to practice sound management, in the \ndirection of responsible conduct. In fact, I don't believe that the \nSustainable Fisheries Act empowers the fishery management councils, or \nthe Secretary of Commerce, to do much more than these entities already \nare empowered to do. Rather, the Sustainable Fisheries Act is a \nstatement by Congress that conservation of the resource must be a \npriority, and the bill highlights the tools that councils and the \nSecretary can use to achieve this goal.\n  I approve of inviting fishery managers to act more responsibly, but I \nurge vigilance. Regional politics and short-term interests have \nconspired in the past to undermine responsible resource management to \ncertain fisheries. It is naive to think that this bill alone can \ncorrect this condition. It cannot. So while I support the conservation \nprovisions in S. 39, I caution that the work of ensuring responsible \nconservation and management of fishery resources does not end with the \npassage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act--it only begins.\n\n  Ironically, the fishery that has been singled out in S. 39 for \nparticularly stringent waste and bycatch reduction measures is the \nNorth Pacific groundfish fishery. I do not now object, and have never \nobjected to the bill's prescriptions for this Washington State-\ndominated trawl fishery, but it is important to note that the singling \nout of this fishery is a function of politics and not sound science.\n  Despite its Alaska-heavy composition, the North Pacific Council, to\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nwhich many of the bill's waste and bycatch reduction provisions are \naddressed, has been praised for its resource conservation measures. \nDespite its recent dramatic public demonstrations, even GreenPeace \nacknowledged in 1992 that ``The North Pacific * * * provide[s] a model \nfor the way other [regional fishery management] Councils should be \nmanaging the fisheries in this nation and probably in the world.'' \nAgain, I do not oppose strong and sensible bycatch and waste reduction \nmeasures in the North Pacific groundfish fishery, but only so long as \nthe singling out of any sector of a fishery is supported by scientific \nevidence. I note that recently, GreenPeace launched a public relations \nattack on the Seattle-based factory trawlers in the Bering Sea pollock \nfishery. Certainly GreenPeace is within its rights to do so. I \nsincerely hope, however, that as we continue to strive toward \nresponsible management of our fisheries, that we do not allow policy to \nbe set by meretricious activists whose often uninformed rantings drown \nout the voices of scientists, fishery managers, and environmentalists \nwho properly place conservation ahead of a radical social agenda.\n\n\n                                 ifq's\n\n  My opposition to this bill has often mistakenly been reduced only to \na disagreement over the treatment of individual fishing quotas. \nIronically, I believe that Senator Stevens and I were, from the \nbeginning, more in agreement on this issue than on a number of others \nthat affect the allocation of resources in the North Pacific.\n  Although I am not an unqualified supporter of IFQ's, it is hard to \nignore the success of the North Pacific halibut-sablefish IFQ program \nthat was implemented last year. The program has not been flawless, but \nits initial effectiveness in improving safety, providing fresh fish \nyear round to consumers, and reducing overcapitalization in a fishery--\nwithout a regional epidemic of bankruptcies or a hemorrhage of the \nFederal budget in the form of Federal buy-out assistance--is promising. \nThroughout this process, I have tried to ensure that this infant \nprogram will continue without interruption. I sincerely appreciate \nSenator Stevens' support on this issue.\n  I believe that Senator Stevens and I agree that IFQ's are a powerful \ntool, and that it is reasonable to adopt a moratorium to suspend, for a \ntime, the implementation of new IFQ programs until we have had the \nchance further to study and better to understand the social and \neconomic effects of IFQ's on the conservation and management of \nresources, on participants in all sectors of the industry--harvesters \nand processor alike, and on the American public.\n  Senator Stevens and I have disagreed, however, on the duration of \nthis moratorium. We also had a critical disagreement over whether or \nnot IFQ's should be barred indefinitely in the North Pacific by \nrequiring a supermajority vote of a council to adopt new IFQ's in the \nabsence of further congressional action on this subject.\n  Despite these disagreements, the Senate has reached a reasonable \ncompromise. The moratorium on the implementation of new IFQ's is longer \nthan I would have liked--it is 4 years--but it is finite, and requires \nno supermajority vote of councils after the moratorium expires. The \ncompromise provisions also permit councils to study and develop IFQ's \nduring the moratorium. Moreover, the moratorium on IFQ's will not \npreclude the implementation of a new bycatch accountability system that \nshould help to reduce bycatch by holding every vessel accountable for \nwhat it catches.\n  Significantly, the Sustainable Fisheries Act provides for a \ncomprehensive study of IFQ's by the National Academy of Sciences, which \nstudy which will be available to educate Congress when we next consider \nthis issue. Education is critical: despite my reservations about \nimplementing new IFQ's in the North Pacific at this time, I consider it \npure folly to adopt the House approach of crippling all prospective \nquota programs before we have had the chance to assess them adequately.\n\n\n            Mitigating the effects of U.S. versus Washington\n\n  I fully support the provisions of the bill that attempt to mitigate \nthe loss to Washington's commercial crabbers caused by the adjudication \nof tribal claims to shellfish in a subproceeding of U.S. versus \nWashington. Last year, a decision by a district court, a decision that \nis now on appeal, allocated a large portion of the catch to Indian \ntribes and threatens to deprive nontribal fishermen, who have been \nfishing for generations, of their livelihoods.\n  We have amended S. 39 in two ways to try to mitigate the loss to \nnontribal commercial crabbers in Washington. First, the manager's \namendment now authorizes State-managed fisheries, such as the 250-\nvessel inner Puget Sound dungeness crab fishery, to obtain Federal \nfunds for a license buy-out program.\n  Second, for the coastal dungeness fishery, the manager's amendment \ngives Washington, for a limited time until a Fishery Management Plan is \nin place, tools to regulate all crabbers equally in the exclusive \neconomic zone adjacent to the State. This new regulatory authority will \nhelp to ensure that the cost of the tribal allocation will be borne \nmore fairly by all commercial crabbers who fish in the EEZ adjacent to \nWashington, not just crabbers whose vessels are registered in the \nState.\n  The managers amendment permits the Washington Department of Fish and \nWildlife, among other things, to set pot limits to slow the pace of \nfishing by all nontribal commercial crabbers to help facilitate \nmanagement or settlement with the tribes.\n  Although this provision gives Washington, Oregon, and California new \npowers to regulate vessels not registered in these respective States, \nand restates these States' ability to regulate landings, the provision \nis intentionally silent on whether the limited access program in each \nState can be enforced in the EEZ. I anticipate, however, that when it \nprepares a Fishery Management Plan for dungeness crab, the Pacific \nCouncil will be guided by the limited access programs already in place \non the west coast.\n  Having just described those aspects of the bill that I support \nheartily, I would like to speak for a moment to those that I believe \nare subject to serious reservations.\n  There are three provisions in this bill that I think are misguided. \nThey are: The provision regarding fishing communities; the demotion of \nthe role of efficiency in fishery management; and the creation of a \npermanent entitlement program for Native Alaskans in the form of \ncommunity development quotas.\n\n\n                          fishing communities\n\n  The managers' amendment corrects a fundamental inequity in the \noriginal S. 39, that would have further skewed the allocation of North \nPacific fishery resources in Alaska's favor by giving economic \nprotections and preferences to fishing communities, and by defining \nthese communities so as apparently to exclude any in the State of \nWashington.\n  While my parochial concerns have been fully addressed in the \nmanager's amendment by redefining ``fishing communities'' to include \nthe communities of tens of thousands of Washingtonians employed in the \nfishing industry, I continue to believe that establishing a national \nstandard to protect fishing communities is bad policy. It authorizes \nnothing certain except for bad policy and litigation.\n  Moreover, it seems to me to be contrary to the purported conservation \ngoals of this bill to attempt to insulate fishing communities from the \neconomic effects of instituting sound management and restoring healthy \nstocks. Correcting years of irresponsible management and concern for \nshort-term profit cannot be accomplished painlessly, though we should \nstrive to minimize that pain. Continuing to delay the inevitable, \nhowever, by giving councils another excuse for ineffective conservation \nmeasures will only make more likely the total demise of our fisheries.\n\n\n                               efficiency\n\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act demotes the role of efficiency in \nfishery management and conservation by changing national standard five \nfrom one of promoting efficiency in the use of fishery resources, where \npracticable, to merely considering efficiency. Again, this change was \nmade on the pretext of improving conservation, but the provision's \nauthors have never been able to explain how the current standard \nundermines conservation efforts, and why this change is needed.\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\n  Under the guise of promoting conservation, this provision promotes a \nfoolish social agenda--one that fails to reorganize a sensible balance \nbetween the legitimate interests of traditional small-vessel fishers, \nthe interests of consumers, and the need to improve productivity to \nremain competitive in a global economy.\n  There is, I believe, a perception that an attack on efficiency is a \ntriumph for small vessels and a blow to what are perceived to be the \nlarger, more cost-effective vessels such as those in Washington's \nfactory trawlers fleet. This perception reveals a disturbing trend \ntoward unfairly demonizing more productive, more efficient fleets. I \nrepeat my earlier adomination--we need to recognize that good \nmanagement, not small vessels or large vessels, leads to sound \nconservation and healthy fisheries, and that there is room in a healthy \nand efficient fishery for both.\n\n\n                                 CDQ's\n\n  Without a doubt, the allocation-related provision in this bill that I \nfind most objectionable is the provision mandating a permanent \nentitlement program for Native Alaskans through community development \nquotas--an entitlement program that will be paid for largely by the \nWashington fishing industry. Codifying this assistance program is not \nonly inappropriate in a bill that purports to deal with resources, not \nsocial management, but is inappropriate in this Congress, which just \nrecently succeeded in reforming another entitlement program called \nwelfare.\n  CDQ's are set-aside programs that reserve a sizable percentage of \nvarious fisheries for Native Alaskan communities. Currently, CDQ's are \nnot authorized by the Magnuson Act. Nevertheless, the Alaska-dominated \nNorth Pacific Council has reserved 7\\1/2\\ percent of the largely \nWashington-fished Bering Sea pollock stock for Native Alaskan \ncommunities, and even larger percentages in the halibut and sablefish \nfisheries. Recently, the council recommended CDQ's for crab and \ngroundfish, but this recommendation has not yet been approved by the \nSecretary of Commerce. Not surprisingly, the council has not imposed \nCDQ's on fisheries dominated by Alaskans.\n  The fundamental unfairness of CDQ's was certainly appreciated by \nother Members of this body, for the Sustainable Fisheries Act, while \ngoing after fishermen from Washington State, protects other fishermen \nfrom this particular poison by specifically prohibiting CDQ programs in \nalmost every other part of the country.\n  But since CDQ's would be a reality even in the absence of a Magnuson \nAct reauthorization, our ability to limit this unfair practice was \nslight indeed.\n  In exchange for allowing this bill to proceed, I have exacted \nconcessions on the issues of CDQ's. But these concessions are small. \nFirst, to provide relief for the Bering Sea crabbers who, even before \nthe implementation of CDQ's are struggling to survive amid record low \nstocks, the managers' amendment provides for a graduated phase-in of \ndevelopment quotas. In addition, the manager's amendment provides for a \nstudy of CDQ's to determine if these development quotas are meeting \ntheir stated purpose of facilitating participating communities' entry \ninto commercial fisheries, and to recommend how long this social \nassistance program should last.\n  Having commented on some of the substantive provisions in this bill, \nI would like to speak for a moment on the process that brought us to \nthis point. As I stated in my opening remarks, getting here has not \nbeen easy. And I have come as far as I intend to go.\n  The committee mark of S. 39 was sprinkled with sweeteners for most \ninterested parties--except Washington harvesters. Washington's sizable \nfishing fleet was presented with a poison pill more palatable only than \nthe outrage our House delegation was forced to swallow last October.\n  Despite this strategic isolation, I had two invaluable assets--time, \nand the unwavering support of Senator Murray. As much as I would like \nto avoid having to repeat this process, I have truly appreciated the \nopportunity to work so closely with my colleague form Washington State.\n\n  When it became clear that Senator Murray and I had no intention of \nsuccumbing to the attack on our State's fishing industry, a sincere \neffort was made to address our concerns. Much of the credit for this \nfinal compromise is due to the tireless and creative efforts of Senator \nKerry and his staff, Senator Pressler and his staff, and the majority \nleader and his assistants. Credit is due, too, to Senator Stevens and \nhis staff. Because of the different composition of our industries and \nour constituencies, the Senators from Washington and Alaska may rarely \nagree on the substance of fishery bills. But although we may lack \nagreement, I have never lacked trust and respect--I sincerely \nappreciate the constructive manner with which Senator Stevens and his \nstaff have worked with me and my office even as he resolutely protected \nthe interests of his constituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate this afternoon \nis the Sustainable Fishery Act, the Magnuson Act, and is the outcome of \na very long and very difficult process. Only great willingness to \ncompromise on everyone's part has enabled this bill to reach the Senate \nfloor this evening.\n  This bill has been almost 4 years in the making, and it has gone \nthrough many changes, and improvements have been made along the way. I \nwant to take this opportunity to thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for their willingness to work through the \ndifficult allocation issues in this bill so that the strong \nconservation provisions of this bill can move forward.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to thank my \nsenior Senator, Senator Gorton, for his tremendous work on this bill \nand the opportunity to work with him on an issue of natural resources. \nHis tenacity and perseverance throughout this debate has been very \ninstructive and very much appreciated. I also want to take this \nopportunity to thank both his staff and my staff, Justin Le Blanc and \nJeanne Bumpus, for their tireless work on this bill, as well.\n  Mr. President, we have reached a fair and reasonable compromise on \nthis bill. As we send this bill to the House, I urge them not to \nundermine this bill by altering it to reflect parochial interests.\n  This bill serves two purposes: to conserve fishery resources and to \npreserve the fishing industry. It contains new provisions to address \noverfishing, bycatch, and impacts on fish habitat.\n  These provisions will strengthen our ability to conserve fish \nresources, and they will allow us to develop long-term, sustainable \nfisheries. This bill will enable us to turn around depleted fisheries \nand ensure we have fish for the future.\n  The help of the fishing industry is directly related to the health of \nthe resource. The conservation provisions will, therefore, benefit the \nfisheries as well. By protecting the fish, the bill also protects jobs.\n  The bill sustains the fishing industry in other ways, as well. \nNatural standards promoting efficient use of fishing resources and \npromoting the safety of life at sea will help our fishers continue \nfishing. New consideration for fishing communities recognizes all \nfishers, no matter where they live, depend upon the fish.\n  Detailed studies of controversial fishery quota programs will be \nconducted by the National Academy of Sciences. A study of individual \nfishing quota programs will allow us to evaluate the potential benefits \nof such programs. A short moratorium on IFQs will allow us to review \nthis study and to evaluate the success of existing programs. We should \nnot prejudge the appropriateness of IFQ's at this time. Let's allow the \nstudy to provide us guidance on this important issue.\n  The Academy will also study community development quotas. The impacts \nof the new mandate for CDQ's on the fishing industry in the North \nPacific need to be evaluated.\n  These programs will transfer considerable sums of money from \nWashington's distant water fleet to Alaskan coastal communities. The \nstudy will allow us to discern the effectiveness and appropriateness of \nthis social assistance program.\n  The bill provides authority for fishery disaster relief programs, \nparticularly buy-back programs which will\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nhelp stabilize fishing fleets. Many fishing fleets are suffering from \ntremendous harvest reductions as a result of natural disasters or man-\nmade situations.\n  The recent Federal court decision in Washington State awarding native \nAmerican tribes 50 percent of the shellfish has severely impacted the \nnon-Indian shellfish harvesters. These provisions will provide an \nopportunity to help these fishers.\n  The temporary extension of Washington State jurisdiction into Federal \nwaters will also allow the State to implement the reduction in non-\nIndian shellfish harvests fairly and equitably. I thank the junior \nSenator from Oregon for his willingness to reach an agreement on this \nissue.\n  In its original form, this bill could well have undermined the \nfishing industry of Washington State. But thanks to compromise and \nconcession on all sides we have reached an agreement. We are now \ndebating a bill that, in many ways, will benefit the Washington State \nfishing industry.\n  It keeps options open for Washington State fishers, and it ensures \nthat we will have a strong, vital, sustainable industry long into the \nfuture. I support passage of this legislation and look forward to its \ntimely submission to the President for his signature.\n  This bill will reauthorize the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act. The Magnuson Act was first passed in 1976 to \nAmericanize the fisheries off the coasts of the United States and to \nensure that the bountiful harvests being extracted from these seas were \nbenefiting U.S. citizens and our economy. Over the last 20 years, this \ngoal has by and large been achieved. In 1996, a new challenge faces us: \nThe development of sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee a \ncontinued abundance of fish and continued opportunities for U.S. \nfishers.\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act will improve the conservation and \nmanagement of our fishery resources by re-emphasizing both. While the \noriginal intent of the Magnuson Act was to Americanize the fisheries \nand invest the management of the resources in those who know them best, \nthe fishers; the outcome has not always been sound management or \nlongterm conservation. This bill will help improve this situation. With \nprovisions to prevent overfishing, to ensure the rebuilding of \noverfished stocks, to minimize bycatch, and to consider fish habitat, \nthis bill places a greater degree of focus on the long-term \nsustainability of both the resource and the fishers harvesting the \nresource.\n  Strong new measures to reduce bycatch, the catching of unwanted or \nprohibited fish, and new considerations of essential fish habitat will \nhelp to maintain healthy fish stocks. The distant water fleet of the \nNorth Pacific, based in my State, is often accused of wasting an \nincredible amount of fish. Estimates suggest that up to 580 million \npounds a year of fish are dumped overboard dead or dying.\n  Federal fishery scientists have determined that the total population \nof Bering Sea groundfish alone is 44 billion pounds. Of that 44 billion \npounds, scientists have determined that the acceptable biological \ncatch, that is, the sustainable harvest level, is nearly 6.6 billion \npounds. As an extra precaution, the North Pacific Fishery Management \nCouncil has established an annual groundfish harvest cap of 4.4 billion \npounds, leaving one-third of the allowable biological catch \nunharvested.\n  With a total groundfish harvest of 4.4 billion pounds, 580 million \npounds of discards suggests a bycatch rate of approximately 13 percent. \nThe largest fishery in the United States, the North Pacific pollack \nfishery, is one of the cleanest fisheries in the world, with a bycatch \nrate of only 2 percent according to the United Nations Food and \nAgriculture Organization [FAO]. Compare these numbers with the average \ndiscard rate in world fisheries of 30 percent.\n  It is also important to note that the discarded fish in the North \nPacific are quantified by Federal Fishery Observers and are counted \nagainst to the total allowable catch levels of the various species. To \nreduce bycatch is to make more efficient and responsible use of fishery \nresources. That is why this bill seeks to reduce bycatch in our \nNation's fisheries. And that is why participants in the North Pacific \ngroundfish fisheries have proposed requiring all fishers to retain all \npollack and cod caught, regardless of what species the fishers are \ntargeting. This step alone should reduce the amount of fish discarded \nin the North Pacific by one-half.\n  The amount of bycatch in the North Pacific is still very high. While \nthe participants in those fisheries are beginning to address the \nproblem, this bill will create new and stronger incentives to fish more \ncleanly. I strongly support the conservation provisions of this bill. I \nlook forward to the improvement management of our fishery resources \nthey will allow.\n\n  This bill also recognizes that the health and sustainability of fish \nstocks are more than just conservation issues, they are also economic \nand social issues. The people who take part in U.S. fisheries, the \nfishers, processors, and supporting industries, are all vitally \ndependent upon the fishery resources, their abundance and \nsustainability. This bill recognizes that dependence by requiring new \nconsiderations of the impacts of fishery management decisions on \nfishing communities.\n  The definition of fishing communities in this bill will work well. \nFishing communities are those communities ``substantially dependent \nupon or substantially engaged in the harvest of fishery resources.'' \nThis definition recognizes that fishers are fishers no matter where \nthey live. An individual fisher and his or her family, whether they \nwork on a big boat and or a small boat, are equally dependent upon the \nfish for their livelihoods no matter where they live. The fisher from a \nsmall New England port, an Alaska coastal town, or a metropolitan area \nlike Seattle all make their living from the sea, their lives are all \ntied to the health and abundance of the fish they catch. They all \ndeserve to be considered when difficult and painful fishery management \npractices need to be implemented. Under this bill, they will be.\n  In addition, this bill preserves the National Standard to promote \nefficiency in fishery management plans. According to the National \nMarine Fisheries Service [NMFS], an efficient fishery harvests fish \nwith a minimal use of labor capital, interest, and fuel. Management \nregimes that allow a fishery to operate at the lowest possible cost are \nconsidered efficient. In encouraging efficient use of fishery \nresources, this National Standard highlights one way that a fishery can \ncontribute to the Nation's benefit with the least cost to society. To \nweaken the efficiency standard would be to suggest that \novercapitalization, too many boats fishing for too few fish, is \nacceptable when we all know it is not. It is in the Nation's best \ninterest to promote efficient and sustainable use of our natural \nresources. Methods of efficiently harvesting fish within acceptable \nconservation limits should be the norm if the United States wants to \ncontinue to be competitive in the growing global market for fish \nproducts.\n  This bill places a 4-year moratorium on a somewhat controversial \nfishery management tool, individual fishing quotas or IFQ's. IFQ's \nallocate percentages of the total allowable catch of a fishery to \nindividual participants. If they are transferable, they can be bought \nand sold either among participants or in a larger market. While \nopponents of IFQ's feel they are a privatization of a public resource \nand will result in large corporations owning the bulk of U.S. \nfisheries, proponents view IFQ's as an important fishery management \ntool that can address a number of the problems plaguing U.S. fisheries \ntoday.\n  Under current open access systems, there is a race for fish. Those \nwho fish fast and furious win. This management style leads participants \nto fish inefficiently, catching as much fish as they can as quickly as \nthey can without consideration for high bycatch rates or the harvest of \nlower value target fish. It creates incentives to invest in excess \nharvesting and processing capacity--bigger and better boats, bigger \nnets, more gear, and larger plants--than are needed to efficiently and \nsustainably harvest and process the allowable catch. This \novercapitalization, while not creating huge conservation issues, \nweakens the economic viability of the fleet, threatening participants \nwith bankruptcy and ruin. While it hasn't been much of an issue in the \nNorth Pacific, overcapitalization can create\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nenormous pressure to increase harvest levels beyond acceptable limits.\n\n  In addition, this race for fish creates serious safety considerations \nin many fisheries. Under this race, fishers feel compelled to keep \nfishing even when the weather or the conditions of the vessel or the \nhealth of the captain or crew would suggest otherwise. Unless fishery \nmanagement plans provide opportunities and incentives for fishers to \nsit out storms and return to port for repairs or medical attention, \nlives will continue to be lost. The crab fishery in the North Pacific \nis the most dangerous occupation in the Nation. According to the U.S. \nCoast Guard, the 1990-94 average annual fatality rate in the crab \nfishery is 350 deaths per 100,000 workers, with a 1990-94 annual \naverage of 7 deaths among 2,000 crabbers. The fatality rate for all \nU.S. fisheries over the same time is only 71 deaths per 100,000 \nworkers. The all occupations rate is only 7 deaths per 100,000 workers.\n  For this very reason we included the promotion of safety of life at \nsea in the National Standards of the Magnuson Act. This provision \nremains in the bill. Fishery management plans will now be required to \npromote safe fishery practices. The Fishery Management Councils will \nnot only have to consider safety, they will have to promote it to \nextent practicable. There are many ways to promote safety, and IFQ's \nmay be one way.\n  When the halibut fishery in the North Pacific was conducted under \nopen access, the fatality rate was almost as bad as crab, with 250 \ndeaths per 100,000 workers. Under the IFQ plan of the last two seasons, \nthe halibut fishery fatality rate dropped to zero. While two seasons of \ndata is certainly not proof, it does suggest that IFQ's can address the \nsafety issue by eliminating the race for fish.\n  Because of their potential to address issues such as waste, \novercapitalization, and safety, IFQ's are considered by fishery \nmanagers in academia and State and Federal Government agencies, as well \nas environmental groups such as the Center for Marine Conservation, \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and the World Wildlife Fund, as a promising \nfishery management tool that should be available to the Fishery \nManagement Councils for their consideration. I agree. I believe that \nIFQ's should remain in the Councils' toolbox. Many of the concerns \nraised by opponents of IFQ's can be addressed within the design of any \ngiven IFQ system, much as they have been in the halibut/sablefish IFQ \nprogram. Issues such as entry-level quota share opportunities, \nownership requirements, and caps on consolidation of shares can and \nhave been incorporated into IFQ plans at the Council level.\n  Despite all this, I understand a fair degree of controversy remains \nover IFQ's. Because of that, I have agreed to a short moratorium on the \nimplementation of IFQ's while the Councils consider, discuss, and \ndevelop potential IFQ plans. However, I objected to provisions that \nprejudged the appropriateness of IFQ's as a management tool and created \nundue hurdles for IFQ's plans to overcome. This bill includes a \ncomprehensive study of IFQ's by the National Academy of Sciences [NAS]. \nThe assessment of IFQ's by the NAS will allow us, if it is determined \nnecessary, to develop a broadly supported national policy on IFQ's \nduring the next reauthorization of the Magnuson Act in 1999. This study \nshould provide us the guidance we need in our assessment of IFQ's as a \nfishery management tool. We should withhold from determining their fate \nnow, before we have the insights of the NAS study.\n\n  However, there are a number of issues regarding IFQ's on which there \nis currently agreement and these have been included in the bill. IFQ's \nmay be revoked or limited at any time in accordance with procedures \nunder the Magnuson Act. They shall not confer the right of compensation \nto the holder if revoked or limited. They shall not create a private \nproperty right to the fish before the fish are harvested. IFQ \nallocations should be fair and equitable and opportunities should be \nprovided for small vessel owners and entry-level fishers. These are \nbroadly-supported provisions on IFQ's and have appropriately been \nincluded in the bill\n  Unresolved issues regarding IFQ's will be assessed by the NAS. Issues \nsuch as transferability, duration, corresponding processor quotas, \nconservation impacts, fishery characteristics, and potential social and \neconomic costs and benefits to the Nation and to participants in the \nfishery all will be analyzed by the NAS. The NAS will also study \nmechanisms to prevent foreign control of our Nations fishery resources \nand should investigate foreign ownership in both the harvesting and \nprocessing sectors. In addition, the NAS is required to study the \nappropriate level of U.S. ownership of fishery vessels with particular \nreference to a relatively high U.S. ownership threshold. The NAS should \nconsider this threshold in light of existing requirements for \nparticipation in U.S. fisheries.\n  I look forward to the outcome of this study of IFQ's by the NAS and \nto the discussion with my colleagues that will undoubtedly ensue upon \nthe report's release.\n  While this bill imposes a moratorium on IFQ's, it mandates the \ndevelopment of another quota program: Community Development Quotas or \nCDQ's. CDQ's are guaranteed allocations of Bering Sea fishery resources \nto Native Alaskan coastal communities. It is argued that these \ncommunities have had a historical and traditional participation in \nthese fisheries and were excluded from the Americanization of the \nfisheries during the late 1970's and the 1980's. While these \ncommunities certainly engaged in the harvest of near-shore fish \nspecies, it is less clear that they participated in the Deep Ocean \nfisheries of the North Pacific. The existing CDQ program in pollock has \ntransferred approximately $25 million from the participants in the \nfishery, predominantly the distant water fleet from Washington state, \nto the CDQ communities. The mandated expansion of CDQ's will increase \nthis cash transfer almost 5 times to $117 million.\n  CDQ's were originally proposed as a temporary program to provide \nthese communities with the capital and expertise to venture into the \nfisheries on their own. Under this bill, the CDQ program has been \nturned into a permanent entitlement. I want to make myself clear on \nthis issue. I think it is laudable to empower these impoverished \ncommunities to develop independent business ventures and sustainable \neconomies. The question arises as to whom should bear the burden of \nsuch efforts. Unfortunately, under the CDQ programs mandated under this \nbill, the participants in the Bering Sea fisheries, Washington State \nfishers fishing in Federal waters, bear the entire burden alone. A \nburden that should be borne by society at large, and particularly by \nthe neighbors of those communities, other Alaskans.\n  However, this bill contains a study of CDQ's, again by the NAS, to \ninvestigate the implications of these programs for the Native Alaskan \ncommunities and fishery participants. The study will evaluate the \neffectiveness of the program in meeting the stated objectives of \ndeveloping self-sustaining commercial fishing activities in the \ncommunities and employing community residents in commercial fishing \noperations. The study shall evaluate the social and economic conditions \nin the communities. I think it is important for this evaluation to \ninclude an assessment of what other types of assistance programs are or \ncould be made available to these communities. This study will provide \nvaluable insights into the effectiveness and appropriateness of the CDQ \nprogram.\n  In addition, this bill recognizes that not all of the Bering Sea \nfisheries can bear the full burden of the proposed CDQ programs at this \ntime. The Bering Sea crab fishery is in a serious state of decline at \nthis time and the crabbers are suffering under the strain of reduced \ncatches. This bill recognizes the state of affairs in the crab fishery \nby phasing in the CDQ percentage allocation over the next several \nyears, to ease the crab fishery into the larger CDQ allocations.\n  This bill contains important provisions that will enable Washington \nState to mitigate the impacts on shellfish harvesters of the recent \nFederal court decision allocating 50 percent of shellfish to the treaty \ntribes of Washington State in their usual and accustomed areas. These \nprovisions include a limited extension of State management authority \ninto the Federal Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] for Dungeness crab. This \nextension, although\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nrather limited in scope and time, provides the State of Washington the \nauthority it must have to effectively implement the court order to \ncomanage the shellfish resources such that the tribes may harvest 50 \npercent of the resource.\n  In addition, this bill contains authority to implement fishing \ncapacity reduction programs, or buy-back programs. These programs will \nallow fishing fleets severely impacted by a natural disaster or some \nman-made decision beyond the control of fishery managers, such as the \nrecent Federal court order regarding tribal shellfish harvests, to \nmitigate the impacts of such situations by buying people out of the \nfishery in order to restore viability to the fleet. It is anticipated \nthat the state of Washington could use such authority to develop a buy-\nback program for the Inner Sound Dungeness crab fleet so severely \nimpacted by the recent shellfish decision.\n  We have all come a long way on this bill. I reiterate my support for \npassage of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair announces that, by leadership \nagreement, previous time restraints have been removed.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to make comments \nabout a bill that I have been fooling around with for almost as many \nyears as I have served in the Congress. I remember quite well when I \nwas in the other body and served as chairman of the Fisheries Committee \nback in 1972, I hate to say how long it has been that we started \nworking on the concept, over 20 years ago, to say that the fishing \nareas around the United States belong to the people of the United \nStates.\n  At that time, we were being literally inundated by foreign fishing \nfleets from Japan and other nations which saw the areas around the \ncoastal waters of the entire United States off of our 30 coastal States \nas very valuable areas. They were coming in and really displacing our \nown American fishing men and women, and doing it at a rate that would \nhave soon, I think, destroyed the areas of the United States as far as \nfisheries is concerned.\n  We came up with the Fisheries Management Conservation Act. It was a \nvery long and drawn-out process that we entered into to come up with \nthis legislation that said that these waters are going to be reserved \nfor the U.S. industry first, and that you could only fish if you are a \nforeigner if you had a fishing agreement with our country that gave you \nan allocation of how much you could fish for.\n  It was an interesting effort to try and get the foreign fishermen \nout. We came up with an acronym, one that I was proud of coming up \nwith. The whole premise of the bill was to ``phase out foreign \nfishermen.'' We called it POFF. Puff--they were gone. Today, the \nforeign fishermen have been essentially removed from our U.S. waters. \nIt is mainly now being fished by American fishing men and women, and \nthe industry is really an American industry. So now the great challenge \nis not to keep the foreigners out, but rather to manage the stocks in a \nway that preserves them for the U.S. industry. This is what this \nlegislation is about.\n  All of the councils that we have around the country are composed of \nexperts in the fishing area, men and women who represent recreational \nfishermen, commercial fishermen, scientists, who serve on the fishing \ncouncil, and their job is to come up with management programs for the \nvarious species. It took a long time to reach the point where we are \ntoday. Today, the challenge is sound management. You can only have good \nmanagement if you have good science. You cannot come up with a fishery \nplan that makes sense if you do not know how many fish you have in the \nwaters off of our coasts.\n  Therefore, the science is incredibly important, to have the best \navailable scientific information about the conditions of the stock. \nThis legislation moves in that direction to allow for even better \nscience to be obtained, to make these decisions. I applaud the Members \nwho have been involved in insisting this be what our standard is.\n  In addition, the question of bycatch, something that every fisherman \nis affected by: If you are fishing for shrimp and catching a lot of \nother fish that you are not targeting, you have a bycatch, an extra \ncatch that you are not trying to do. We need a lot more studies on \nbycatch, on how to prevent bycatch without destroying the fishermen who \nare going after a targeted species. In this legislation, there is more \nwork in that area as well.\n  By and large, we have to resist the temptation for us to try and \nmanage fisheries from here in Washington. I don't think we have a fish \nbiologist as a Member of the Senate. We are not biologists. I don't \nthink anybody has that background. We should make sure that the \ncouncils do the management plans, working with the National Marine \nFishery Service. We have to be very careful if we try and say that the \ncouncils cannot do this or that because we in Washington know better. \nThe councils have the first obligation of coming up with management \nplans based on science. Now and then, we get inundated by one \nparticular group of fishermen, maybe recreational fishermen, that say, \n``You have to ban all catches of red snapper,'' and then the commercial \nboys say, ``No, you need to catch more red snapper because there are a \nlot more out there.''\n\n  We are tempted to enact amendments to legislation here in Washington \nthat would do fishery management from the floor of the Senate or from \nthe Commerce Committee. I suggest that that is the wrong way to do it. \nWe ought to strengthen the councils and not weaken them, and let them \ncome up with the proper management plans. This is an issue that never \nhas been Democratic or Republican; it's where you are from, the \ndifferent areas of the northeast, the southeast, the gulf coast, and \nthe Northwest. We have intermural battles here between Alaska and \nOregon and Washington, between Texas and Louisiana and the gulf and \nFlorida. But we have come together with this piece of legislation.\n  I commend John Kerry and Ted Stevens for their ability to bring this \nproduct to the floor. Is it perfect? Of course not. Nothing here ever \nwill be. But it is a good bill and one that makes sense. I congratulate \nthe ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee for their work. \nI support this legislation. We will monitor how it is implemented very \ncarefully to see if further improvements can be made in the future. It \nhas been a long time since 1976 and all those years since we tried to \nput this together. It is working. We can take a lot of credit and be \nproud of the work we have done. There is a lot more that needs to be \ndone, and this legislation moves us in that direction. I support the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time is remaining?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining. \nThe Senator from Alaska has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator from Oregon requests how much time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Does the Senator have 5 or 6 minutes?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 39, the Sustainable \nFisheries Management Act. This bill is a good step forward in the \nmanagement of our Nations' fisheries, addressing important areas of \nconcern such as rebuilding over-fished stocks and collecting better \ndata so we can manage our fisheries more effectively. I guess I'm the \nonly Member of Congress in the position of voting for this legislation \nin both Houses of the Congress.\n  I want to thank Senators Stevens and Kerry, and their staffs \nespecially, for their help and guidance to me, the newest member on the \nCommerce Committee, on issues of great importance to the fishermen, \nfishing communities, and the fishing industry in Oregon. I commend them \nfor their hard work on this legislation and hope that we will be \nsigning this bill into law in the very near future.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Murray and Gorton for their \nwillingness to address an issue critical to the Oregon crab fishery. I \nam satisfied that the compromise we have reached will go a long way to \nhelping the State of Washington address its crab management concerns, \nand assure Oregon crab fishermen continued access to crab fishing areas \noff of the Washington coast.\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\n  The State of Washington is currently struggling to address management \nissues arising from a recent Federal court decision that requires the \nState of Washington to provide Washington's Indian tribes with 50 \npercent of the Washington crab fishery. Historically, Oregon crabbers \nhave also fished off of Washington's coast and it is easy to see how \nthis new situation could create conflict.\n  Historically as well, Oregon, Washington, and California have enjoyed \nan excellent working relationship with regard to the crab fishery. So, \nit was with concern that I reviewed the original proposal to extend \nstate jurisdiction into the Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] for all \nfisheries without a Federal management plan. In my view, this original \nproposal had the potential to restrict many Oregon fishermen from \nfishing in their traditional areas.\n  With respect to the crab fishery alone, the potential effects were \nominous for all segments of the crab fishery in Oregon, crab fishermen, \nthe coastal communities of Astoria and Warrenton and the crab \nprocessors in those communities who provide employment to hundreds of \nworkers.\n  The Oregon crabbers fishing off the Washington coast represent a \nsignificant percentage of the crab landings to Astoria and Warrenton: \nthese boats land almost 85 percent of the crab processed in these two \nports. To say that this fishery is significant to these communities \nbarely coveys the vital importance of this fishery to the economy of \nOregon's north coast. Fishermen, equipment suppliers, crab processors, \nand their employees are all intimately tied to this natural resource.\n  The compromise Senators Murray, Gorton, and I have reached restricts \nthe extension of State jurisdiction to conservation measures within the \ncrab fishery only. These restrictions would apply equally to all boats \nfishing in the same waters. Each State's limited entry programs and \nlanding laws are respected. To address the harvest requirements of \nFederal Court Order, U.S. v. Washington 89-3, the State of Washington \nmay close areas or restrict the number of crab pots laid by crabbers. \nOur intent is to give the State of Washington flexibility in meeting \nrequirements of the Federal court order while minimizing the \nrestrictions on Oregon's crabbers.\n  Perhaps the most important part of the State jurisdiction provisions \nis a clause stating that the Pacific Fisheries Management Council \nshould develop and submit a fishery management plan for Dungeness crab \nand other shellfish. The timely development of a Federal fishery \nmanagement plan for Dungeness crab is essential if we are to avoid \ninter-State conflicts in the future. To this end, the bill also \nrequires the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to report to the \nrelevant Senate and House Committees within a year regarding their \nprogress on a plan.\n  Again, I appreciate the willingness of the Senators from Washington \nto address this issue. I look forward to working with them on these \nissues in the future.\n  As I mentioned above, I have voted on both the House and Senate \nversions of this bill. Not only did I support the House bill, I voted \nfor key conservation amendments that were adopted as floor amendments, \nincluding those on over-fishing and habitat protection. The \nconservation provisions of S. 39 are also significant, several of which \nare of particular importance to Oregon. Reauthorization of the Magnuson \nAct is a high priority for Oregon fishermen and conservation groups \nalike.\n  The new mandatory provisions requiring fishery management councils to \ndevelop criteria for determining when a fishery is over-fished, and for \nrebuilding those fisheries, will help us set a solid target for \nrebuilding over-fished stocks both in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Likewise the measure adding a new national standard to the Magnuson \nAct requiring that conservation and management measures minimize by-\ncatch--the incidental harvest of nontarget fish--makes a good effort at \nreducing one of the most distressing aspects of our fisheries.\n  The bill also defines essential fish habitat and requires the \ncouncils to minimize adverse effects on habitat due to fishing.\n  I shall note at this time some disappointment with regard to the \ncommunities provisions. While in the House I supported Congressman \nMiller's proposal on communities. The Oregon fishery is in large \nmeasure family owned and shore-based, and I would have preferred to \nhave communities language in the bill that recognized and protected our \nfishing communities more fully.\n  During our discussions on passage of the bill, it was made clear to \nme that a protracted fight over the communities language would \njeopardize the entire Magnuson reauthorization. In my view this would \nhave hurt Oregon more than it would have helped. Reluctantly, I have \nfor now agreed not to insist on stronger communities language and get \nthis reauthorization done.\n  Mr. President, although S. 39 is not perfect, it is one of the \nstrongest pieces of conservation legislation to pass the Senate this \nyear. I urge passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this year marks the 20th anniversary of \nthe Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, our Nation's \nprimary law to protect and develop the wealth of fishery resources \nfound off American coasts. Those resources are a valuable national \nheritage. In 1995, U.S. commercial fishermen landed a record 9.9 \nbillion pounds of fish, producing over $3.7 billion in dockside \nrevenues. By weight of catch, the United States is the fifth largest \nfishing nation. We are also the world's top seafood exporter, with \nexports valued at $3.3 billion in 1995.\n  Over the past two decades, the Magnuson Act has guided the \ndevelopment of the U.S. fishing industry, as we successfully \nAmericanized our fisheries. However, in some regions we unfortunately \nwere more successful in promoting fishing than in preserving fish. As \nthe competition among U.S. fishermen grew, the unique and participatory \nprocess established by the Magnuson Act began to show a few signs of \naging. Three years ago the Commerce Committee began a systematic review \nof Federal programs and regulations that affect marine fisheries \nmanagement. Since then we have held over a dozen hearings here in \nWashington and in fishing communities around the Nation. We have heard \nfrom almost 200 witnesses from South Carolina to Maine and from Hawaii \nto Alaska. The final result of that review is the bill before the \nSenate today. S. 39, the Sustainable Fisheries Act, represents the \nefforts of Senators Stevens and Kerry, myself and other Members to \naddress the issues identified. This reauthorization of the Magnuson Act \nbuilds upon our past experience to stop overfishing and waste, protect \nessential marine habitat, and streamline the management process.\n\n  Turning to the Southeast, where commercial fishermen landed over 275 \nmillion pounds of seafood--valued at $238 million--in 1995, fishing \nplays a vital role in the economies of many coastal communities like \nMurrells Inlet, Charleston, McClellanville, and Beaufort. In addition, \nthe sportfishing industry is an important part of the regional and \nlocal economies. In 1995, an estimated 2.3 million anglers participated \nin marine recreational fisheries in the south Atlantic region. These \nfishermen made over 18 million fishing trips, catching more than 65 \nmillion fish, including seatrout, catfish, and red drum.\n  The south Atlantic Spanish mackerel fishery, in particular, has been \ncited as a Magnuson Act success story. Prior to the 1980's, mackerel \ncatches essentially were unregulated, leading to over-harvesting by \nboth commercial fishermen and sport anglers. The South Atlantic Council \nthen stepped in to implement quotas, bag limits, and trip limits and \nthis once-depleted population now seems well on its way to rebuilding. \nUnfortunately, for every success story like Spanish mackerel or striped \nbass, we still hear all too many tragedies.\n  In addition, we have seen growing interest in reducing waste and \nunnecessary bycatch in our fisheries. The United Nations estimates that \nabout 27 million tons of fish each year--about a third of world \nharvests--are caught and thrown back because they are too small, there \nis no market, or a quota has been exceeded. South Carolina shrimpers \nare far too familiar with this issue and have struggled for years to \nprevent endangered sea turtles from drowning in their nets. The spirit \nof cooperation and innovation that they have shown in working with \nState and\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nFederal managers to successfully tackle the sea turtle problem \ndemonstrates an approach which should be effective in dealing with \nother bycatch problems.\n\n  Habitat protection also has become a greater concern in recent years \nas coastal development and marine pollution threaten the environment \nand subsequently the health of many fish stocks. Half of the world's \npopulation now lives within 40 miles of the coastline, and scientists \nestimate that by the turn of the century, more than three-quarters of \nAmericans will live within 50 miles of the U.S. coastline. Essential \nfish habitat must be identified and conserved if we are going to \nmaintain healthy fish stocks in the future.\n  Finally, while the growing frustration with large government \nbureaucracies and overregulation is not confined to marine fisheries, \nwe certainly need to take steps to streamline the process and eliminate \nunnecessary redtape. The goal of the council process established under \nthe Magnuson Act was to ensure the participation of all those affected \nby fishery regulations. However, we cannot allow that process to become \nso cumbersome that it fails to effectively conserve our fisheries \nresources, and we must have in place reasonable safeguards against \nconflicts of interest.\n  Those of us who are interested in the protection and responsible use \nof our marine resources have learned a lot about managing marine \nfisheries over the past two decades. We recognize that the days of \nsuperabundant fish stocks are gone forever, and we are confronting a \nbasic fact of life--there aren't enough fish to go around. We also have \nseen that rebuilding efforts, like the plan for Spanish mackerel, can \nbe successful. And we now understand the importance of ecological \nconsiderations like habitat and bycatch in managing our fisheries.\n\n  Building on that increased understanding, S. 39, the Sustainable \nFisheries Act, extends the authorization of appropriations for the \nMagnuson Act through fiscal year 1999. The bill also: First, caps \nfishery harvests at the maximum sustainable levels and requires action \nto prevent overfishing and rebuild depleted fisheries; second, broadens \nexisting Federal authority to identify and protect essential fish \nhabitat; third, minimizes waste and discards of unusable fish; fourth, \nstreamlines the approval process for fishery management plans and \nregulations; fifth, tightens financial disclosure and conflict-of-\ninterest requirements for council members; sixth, establishes a \nmoratorium on management plans that allow private ownership of harvest \nquotas and fees to cover the administrative costs of such a plan; and \nseventh, reauthorizes other fishery programs and statutes, including \nthe Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act, the Anadromous Fish Conservation \nAct, and the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act.\n  Mr. President, S. 39 is the result of extensive bipartisan efforts by \nSenator Kerry and Senator Stevens. As a result of their hard work, we \nhave before us a good bill that furthers the goals and policies of the \nMagnuson Act. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this vital \nlegislation today.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I very strongly support the passage of \nS. 39, a bill to reauthorize and revitalize the Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act, also known as the Magnuson Act. This is without a \ndoubt the single most important conservation bill that has come before \nthis Congress.\n  The text before us today has changed greatly since the bill I had the \nhonor to cosponsor, along with Senator Stevens and Senator Kerry, in \nthe final days of the 103d Congress. In the almost 2 years since that \nday, Senator Stevens and Senator Kerry have led a remarkable bipartisan \neffort to resolve other Members' problems with the bill as originally \nintroduced.\n  I cannot say, Mr. President, that I am completely happy with all of \nthe changes that have been necessary to accommodate the interests of \nvarious Members. However, Mr. President, I can say that I have watched \nthe evolution of this legislation with very close attention, and am \nconfident that the managers have made every possible effort to make \nthose accommodations without violating the integrity of the bill.\n  I also want to recognize the tremendous effort that has been made by \nby fishing industry groups, the environmental community and others, all \nof whom participated in bringing this bill to this point, just steps \nfrom completion.\n  My own efforts in connection with this bill have largely focused on \ncertain issues that have recently exploded into international \nprominence--fishery bycatch and discard.\n  Worldwide, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations reports that with total fishery landings of 83 million metric \ntons, plus discards of up to 27 million metric tons, we may be taking \nas much as 10 million tons per year more than the oceans can sustain.\n  I introduced the first bill to address bycatch and discard back in \n1993. Today, almost 3 years later, I am very pleased to say we are \nfinally on the verge of taking action. The bill before us follows the \nlead of my early bill by establishing a new national standard calling \nfor bycatch to be avoided where possible, and where it cannot be \navoided, for steps to minimize the resulting fishery mortalities. This \nwill put us on the road to stopping the shameful waste that is \ncurrently occurring in many fisheries.\n  Following this principle, Senator Stevens has authored a separate \nsection of the bill for Alaska only, which calls for annual bycatch \nreductions for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea off Alaska.\n  Among other provisions, this bill will improve fisheries conservation \nand utilization, on which so many individuals in our coastal \ncommunities depend. It will for the first time address the problem of \noverfishing by requiring corrective action to be taken when a fishery \nis or is in danger of becoming overfished. It will also strengthen the \nfisheries management process by improving the way that regional fishery \ncouncils function, improve the way fisheries research is conducted and \nmake many other changes of great importance and urgent need.\n  Mr. President, two issues which have been most contentious during \nthis reauthorization process are the prospects for a new type of \nfishery limitation called an individual fishing quota program, and for \na community development quota program intended to pass through some of \nthe benefits from fisheries in the Bering Sea to disadvantaged, largely \nNative communities in that area.\n  In Alaska, and elsewhere, there has been considerable debate on \nredesigning fishery management using an individual fishing quota \nsystem. I won't attempt to get into the level of detail necessary to \nexplain how this would differ from the existing system of management. \nSuffice it to say that supporters believe this would solve most of \ntoday's problems of overcapitalized fisheries with the least government \ninterference, and opponents claim it would not only be costly to the \ngovernment but hugely unfair to those who are excluded and to \ncommunities dependent on fishing.\n  The bill before us represents a compromise between these two \npositions. It contains a moratorium on new individual fishing quota \nsystems, and a comprehensive study of their potential--both good and \nbad--and of their actual impacts in those cases where they have already \nbeen used. I believe this is a compromise worthy of the Senate's \nsupport.\n  In the case of the community development program proposal, we also \nsee the results of sensible, needed compromise. The bill before us \ntoday provides a mechanism to assign some of the volume of fish coming \nfrom Bering Sea fisheries to the task of helping provide a stable, \npermanent economic base for some of the poorest, most disadvantaged \ncommunities in the country. This is a very worthy goal, and it is also \none that I believe deserves the support of my colleagues.\n  There are far too many other specifics in this bill to recount them \nall, or to provide my views on each and every issue the bill addresses. \nInstead, let me close with this: if there is anything on which we can \nagree, it is the need for productive, healthy oceans. That is the goal \nof this bill, and this bill is Congress' farthest ever reach toward \nreaching it. Let's not waste it.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, in support of the manager's substitute for the \nCommittee on\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nCommerce, Science and Transportation's amendment to S. 39. I wish to \nthank my colleagues Senator Stevens and Senator Kerry for their \nleadership in accommodating a multitude of diverse concerns and \nrequests and bringing this monumental legislation to the Senate floor. \nS. 39 represents a truly bipartisan approach to fisheries issues that \nare of vital importance to our nation's economy and environment.\n  There are many commendable features to the manager's amendment \nincluding a section which provides authority for the western Alaska and \nwestern Pacific community development quota (CDQ) programs.\n  Mr. President, for 190 years the United States limited its authority \nto regulate fishing in the waters surrounding its coast to the three-\nmile territorial sea. Exploiting that forbearance, by the mid-1930s, \nforeign fishing vessels routinely fished for salmon, crab, and other \nfish stocks within sight of the Alaska coast.\n  In 1976, in order to end foreign fishing within 200 miles of the \ncoast of the United States, the Congress enacted the Magnuson Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (MFCMA). Section 302 of the Act divides \nthe 200-mile zone--which today is known as the exclusive economic zone \n(EEZ)--into eight subzones and establishes a fishery management council \nfor each subzone. The Act authorizes each council to prepare a fishery \nmanagement plan and authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to approve and \nby regulation implement each fishery management plan (FMP) for each \nfish stock located within its subzone that the council determines \n``requires conservation and management.''\n  In addition to preventing overfishing, the Congress intended the \nSecretary's implementation of fishery management plans to advance an \nequally important policy objective--the transfer of the economic \nbenefits derived from fishing inside the EEZ from foreign fishermen to \nUnited States fishermen. When the Magnuson Act was enacted, with little \nexception, American fishermen were not participating in fisheries \nbeyond the territorial sea.\n  In the EEZ Alaska subzone, for example, in 1975 Japanese and Soviet \nfishermen harvested 1,310,000 metric tons of pollock, while United \nStates fishermen harvested less than 3,000 metric tons. And Japanese \nfishermen harvested 30,000 metric tons of sablefish, while United \nStates fishermen harvested 1,000 metric tons. By 1987, United States \nfishermen had replaced foreign fishermen in the Alaska subzone. And by \n1991, United States processors had replaced foreign processors. As a \nconsequence, in 1992, U.S. fishermen harvested pollock and other \ngroundfish in the Alaska subzone that had an ex-vessel value of $675 \nmillion.\n\n  Between 1984 and 1992, the catch of pollock by U.S. fishermen \nincreased from 8,400 metric tons to 1,402,300 metric tons, and the \ncatch of sablefish by U.S. fishermen increased from 9,900 metric tons \nto 23,700 metric tons.\n  The revenues realized by U.S. fishermen who replaced foreign \nfishermen in the pollock fishery conducted in the Alaska subzone \nincreased from $1.4 million in 1984 to $388.8 million in 1992. And the \nearnings of U.S. fishermen who replaced foreign fishermen in the \nsablefish fishery increased from $7 million to $53.5 million.\n  However, there was one group of U.S. fishermen--the Eskimo and Aleut \nfishermen residing in 55 Native villages scattered along the windswept \ncoast of the Bering Sea--who, through no fault of their own, were \nprecluded from participating in the fisheries which the Secretary's \nimplementation of fishery management plans in the Alaska subzone had \nforced open.\n  For generations, life in the Native villages had revolved around \nsubsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering. Isolated by their distant \nlocations and indigenous cultures, between the entry of Alaska into the \nUnion in 1959 and the enactment of the Magnuson Act in 1976, residents \nof the 55 villages were left out of Alaska's poststatehood rush to \neconomic and social modernity. In 1990, the median population of the 55 \nvillages was 278 persons.\n  In 1968, the Federal Field Committee for Development Planning in \nAlaska described the situation in the region in which most of the \nvillages are located as follows:\n\n       Bluntly put, the region has no apparent base for economic \n     growth. It has a rapidly growing population without local \n     employment prospects and generally without the cultural, \n     educational, and skill prerequisites for successful out-\n     migration. In the foreseeable future, outside of the \n     conversion of the present subsistence [salmon] fishery in the \n     Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers to a more efficient commercial \n     operation, any growth of opportunity either for employment or \n     for enterprise in the region, will result directly from \n     government action. The only prospect for expansion of the \n     public sector, in turn, can be anticipated as a result of \n     efforts to overcome the cultural and economic handicaps of \n     the region's population.\n\n  The Field Committee's assessment accurately described the underlying \ncause of a growing social crisis in Bering Sea coastal villages that, \nover the succeeding 20 years, intensified. In 1970-71, for example, the \nvillage of Nome experienced 9 suicides and 22 suicide attempts in 24 \nmonths, committed primarily by Eskimo adolescents. A knowledgeable \nlocal physician described the epidemic of self-destruction as ``the end \nresult of a long series of problems'' caused by ``the traditional \nvillage life dying out and the [subsistence] culture becoming \nnonexistent;'' a social upheaval that young Natives returning home \n``from outside schools to find their skills unneeded in the village'' \nexacerbated.\n\n  Seventeen years later, the situation both in Bering Sea coastal \nvillages and in other Native villages had deteriorated to the point \nthat as the Anchorage Daily News, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its \ncoverage, explained in 1988:\n\n       Across the state, the Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts of Bush \n     Alaska are dying in astonishing numbers. By suicide, accident \n     and other untimely, violent means, death is stealing the \n     heart of a generation and painting the survivors with despair \n     . . . An epidemic of suicide, murder and self-destruction \n     threatens to overwhelm cultures that have for centuries \n     survived and prospered in the harshest environments on earth \n     . . . The village of Alakanuk [one of the 55 Bering Sea \n     coastal villages referred to above] lived on the razor's \n     edge: a town of 550 with eight suicides, dozens of attempts, \n     two murders and four drownings in 16 months. This was Eskimo \n     Armageddon. But while Alakanuk's experience has been the \n     worst, it is by no means an isolated example. The pace of \n     suicide, self-destruction and abuse is accelerating all over \n     Alaska.\n\n  The Daily News series, which was entitled ``People in Peril,'' drew \npublic attention to a social crisis of which Native leaders long had \nbeen aware. Seizing the opportunity, the Alaska Federation of Natives \n[AFN], a statewide organization representing Native interests, prepared \na report documenting the conditions and challenges confronting the \nNative people, entitled ``A Call for Action,'' that was submitted to \nthe Congress. In pertinent part, ``A Call to Action'' concluded that:\n\n       [L]arge numbers of Natives who want to work in their home \n     villages or region have no possibility of doing so. In most \n     Native villages, the prospects for private sector economic \n     development are limited, and due to declining oil revenues, \n     state spending is projected to steadily decline throughout \n     the 1990s. The projected decline in economic activity in \n     rural Alaska coincides with the steadily increasing number of \n     young Native adults who will be seeking to enter the work \n     force. Every effort to take advantage of limited \n     opportunities for private economic development should be \n     encouraged.\n  For Eskimo and Aleut residents of Bering Sea coastal villages, AFN's \nadmonition was particularly ironic because, due in large part to the \nMagnuson Act, the ocean lapping at their doorsteps was roiling with \nprivate economic activity that for 16 years had been regulated by the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council [Council] and the Secretary in \na manner that had for the most part excluded their participation, even \nthough section 301(a)(4)(A) of the act required the Council and the \nSecretary to regulate the opportunity to participate in Bering Sea \nfisheries in a manner that was ``fair and equitable'' to all fishermen, \nincluding Eskimo and Aleut fishermen who reside in Bering Sea coastal \nvillages.\n  The Council and the Secretary's failure to regulate Bering Sea \nfisheries in a manner that provided fishermen in Bering Sea coastal \nvillages a ``fair and equitable'' opportunity to participate was \nparticularly troubling given the fact that the Council and the \nSecretary both have a fiduciary obligation to exercise their regulatory \nauthority in a manner that advances the well-being of Alaska Natives.\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n  Two months after the Alaska Federation of Natives presented A Call \nfor Action to Congress, in May of 1989, the Council planning committee \nrecommended that the Council amend its relevant fishery management \nplans to establish a western Alaska community development quota \nprogram. The objective of the program was to facilitate access to \nBering Sea fisheries by Eskimo and Aleut residents of Bering Sea \ncoastal villages by providing the villages in which they reside an \nopportunity to harvest a small portion of the total allowable catch of \ncertain fish stocks.\n  After careful review and numerous opportunities for public comment, \nin June of 1991, the Council approved an amendment to the Bering Sea \nand Aleutian Islands groundfish fisheries management plan that \nestablished a western Alaska community development quota program for \nBering Sea pollock and allocated 7.5 percent of the Bering Sea pollock \ntotal allowable catch to ``communities of the Bering Sea coast'' that \nparticipate in the program. In May of 1992, the Secretary approved the \namendment and in November of that year promulgated a rule adopting \nregulations which established a procedure for village participation in \nthe program.\n  The regulations identified 55 eligible Bering Sea coastal villages. \nTo be eligible, a village was required to be located within fifty miles \nof the Bering Sea coast and to have been determined by the Secretary of \nthe Interior, pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nbe a ``Native village.'' In addition, the residents of an eligible \nvillage must have conducted more than half of their commercial or \nsubsistence fishing effort in the waters of the Bering Sea. Finally, an \neligible village ``must not have previously developed harvesting or \nprocessing capability sufficient to support substantial'' participation \nin the Bering Sea groundfish fishery.\n\n  To participate in the western Alaska pollock community development \nquota program, the 55 villages formed six organizations: the Yukon \nDelta Fisheries Development Association, the Bristol Bay Economic \nDevelopment Corporation, the Norton Sound Economic Development \nCorporation, the Coastal Villages Fishing Cooperative, the Aleutian \nPribilof Island Development Association, and the Central Bering Sea \nFishermen's Association. Each organization then submitted a community \ndevelopment plan to the Governor of Alaska. When the Governor approved \nthe plans, in December of 1992, the Secretary issued each organization \nthe share of the 7.5 percent of the pollock total allowable catch that \nthe Governor had determined was needed by the organization to implement \nits community development plan.\n  Each community development quota organization has entered into a \njoint venture with an experienced fishing company to assist in the \nharvesting of its share of the pollock community development quota \nallocation. These joint venture efforts have provided employment for \nvillage residents on joint venture fishing vessels, in the processing \nof the pollock catch, and in the management of the joint ventures. Of \ncoequal importance, the sale of the catch has provided working capital \nthat each organization has used to finance village fishery-related \neconomic development activities that otherwise would not be occurring.\n  To what extent has the western Alaska pollock community development \nquota program contributed to alleviating the social problems described \nin ``A Call for Action''?\n  Alarmed by ``A Call for Action's'' documentation of the accelerating \nsocial disintegration taking place in Native villages, in 1990, the \nCongress established a Joint Federal-State Commission on Policies and \nPrograms Affecting Alaska Natives to conduct ``a comprehensive study'' \nof ``the social and economic status of Alaska Natives,'' and to \nrecommend actions that the Congress and the State of Alaska should take \nto better address the needs of Alaska Natives for ``economic self-\nsufficiency * * * and reduced incidence of social problems.''\n  In 1994, the Commission published a three-volume report that \nsummarized the results of its investigation. Among the recommendations \nlisted in its report, the Commission urged the Council ``to expand the \ncommunity development quota [program] to other fisheries in the \nfuture.''\n\n  In fact, while the Commission was studying the community development \nquota program, the Council had already acted upon the Commission's \nreport by recommending to the Secretary that he establish a western \nAlaska community development quota program for Bering Sea halibut and \nsablefish, in which the six community development quota organizations \nare presently participating. And in June of 1995, the Council \nrecommended to the Secretary that he establish a third western Alaska \ncommunity development quota program for Bering Sea crab species and \nother groundfish species.\n  To facilitate the efficient implementation of the programs, the \nsubstitute amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act amends the \nMagnuson Act to require the North Pacific Fishery Management Council \nand the Secretary to establish a single western Alaska community \ndevelopment quota program and to annually allocate a percentage of the \ntotal allowable catch and guideline harvest levels of each Bering Sea \nfishery to the program. The eligibility standards for participating in \nthe program are the same standards that the Secretary previously \nestablished by regulation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the substitute amendment \nalso authorizes the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council \nand the Secretary to establish a western Pacific community development \nprogram.\n  Much like their brothers and sisters in Alaska, those indigenous \npeople who for centuries had traditionally fished in the waters of the \nWestern Pacific, have been increasingly foreclosed from access to the \nfishery, largely due to the fleets of foreign fishing vessels whose \nnumber, vessel size, and methods of harvesting have dominated the \nWestern Pacific fishery.\n  The Western Pacific community development quota program would be \napplied in the Western Pacific Region but would not, in all likelihood, \nemploy a percentage of the total allowable catch of any particular \nspecies. Accordingly, while there is a section of the substitute bill \nthat addresses fees associated with the allocation of a percentage of \ntotal allowable catch, it is not anticipated that the requirements of \nthe section addressing fees would apply. Rather, it is anticipated that \nthe Western Pacific program would place a priority on enabling access \nto the fishery for those that have been economically-fore closed from \nsuch access. Measures to enhance access might include regulation of \nlimited entry permits, area closures, fishing zones, and vessel size. \nJoint venture agreements for the harvesting and processing of fish \nmight also be employed as they are in the north Pacific region.\n\n  In addition, under the western Pacific program authority, the Western \nPacific Regional Fishery Management Council would be authorized to take \ninto account traditional indigenous fishing practices in preparing any \nfishery management plan.\n  The substitute also establishes authority for the Secretary of \nCommerce and the Secretary of the Interior to make direct grants to \neligible western Pacific communities, as recommended by the Western \nPacific Fishery Management Council, for the purpose of establishing \nfishery demonstration projects to foster and promote traditional \nindigenous fishing practices. The demonstration projects are intended \nto foster and promote the involvement of western Pacific communities in \nthe conservation and management of fisheries through the application of \ntraditional fishing practices as a means for developing or enhancing \nwestern Pacific community-based fishing opportunities, the preservation \nof the island-based cultural values that shape their historical \nconservation ethic, and the development and implementation of \ncommunity-based research and education programs.\n  I am also pleased that the manager's substitute includes a provision \nauthorizing Pacific Insular Area Fisheries Agreements for the purpose \nof enhancing fisheries conservation and management in the Pacific. This \nprogram will be funded under terms similar to those imposed on U.S. \nfishermen who seek access to fish resources in foreign waters. This \nprogram will greatly benefit\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\nour Nation and fisheries resources throughout the Pacific Ocean.\n  I congratulate Senator Stevens, Senator Kerry and their staff, \nparticularly Penny Dalton, Alex Elkan, Trevor McCabe, Earl Comstock, \nGlenn Merrill and Tom Melius for this great accomplishment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank Senator \nStevens for giving me the opportunity to offer this amendment. Before \ndiscussing some of the provisions of this amendment, I want to commend \nSenator Stevens for his achievement in bringing this bill before the \nSenate and for ultimate passage.\n  As those of us from coastal States know, fisheries management issues \ncan be extremely complex in both technical and political senses. These \ncomplexities are greatly heightened at the present time when so many of \nour fisheries are either fully or overexploited.\n  That is why the reauthorization of the Magnuson Act has been a long \nand arduous process. But Senator Stevens and Senator Kerry have been \nable to work through the complexities and conundrums and resolve \nseemingly intractable disputes in an effort to fashion compromise \nlegislation that we are considering today. It is truly a monumental \nachievement. Senator Stevens in particular has been a leader in \nfisheries issues for a decade and, as a framer of the original Magnuson \nAct, deserves our appreciation.\n  Mr. President, if you ask any American what they think of when they \nthink of Maine, they will tell you lobsters. Maine is indelibly linked \nwith its lobster industry, and with good reason. Lobstering is a proud \nand historic tradition in our State. It exemplifies some of the best \nqualities of Maine, and indeed, the American character--rugged \nindependence, a willingness to work hard, and a profound respect for \nmother nature.\n  Of course, lobstering is also an essential element of the Maine and \nNew England economies. If you drive along the coast of Maine and see \nthe lobster boats moored in the harbors of our 144 fishing villages, \nand the lobster traps spread out in the yards of the homes nearby, it \nwon't take you long to understand how many people depend on the lobster \nindustry for a living.\n  My amendment is designed to protect the lobstering tradition in Maine \nand New England. It is a very important amendment, Mr. President, \nbecause the lobster resource now faces a serious threat. And if this \nthreat remains unaddressed, our lobstering tradition could be \njeopardized.\n  My amendment deals with a wasteful and destructive form of lobster \nharvesting known as dragging. The original amendment I was prepared to \noffer would have imposed tough new restrictions on dragging within 60 \ndays. But after listening to concerns expressed by other Senators, I \nhave agreed to substantially revise the amendment. This is a true \ncompromise, and it is very deserving of the Senate's support.\n  Most people know that lobstering is general conducted with traps that \nare baited and rest on the ocean bottom. This is the time honored and \nsustainable method of catching lobsters. The trap method permits the \nlobstermen to bring lobsters to the surface alive and unharmed, and \nthen to safely discard those lobsters that should not be retained, such \nas juveniles, egg-bearing females, and older brood stock lobsters--\nlobsters that are essential to replenishing the resource.\n  There are other ways to catch lobsters, however. Some fishermen drag \nnets, like those used to catch finfish such as cod, along the ocean \nbottom to scoop up the lobsters. But these nets are indiscriminate. \nUndersized and oversized lobsters, along with egg-bearing females, get \nswept into the nets. When the nets are dragged across the bottom, and \nthey hauled up to the surface, many lobsters are broken and crushed, \nincluding those that should be protected and returned to the water \nsafely to reproduce.\n  This method of harvest is very damaging to the resource. That's why \nCanada, the world's largest lobster producer, and Maine, the United \nStates' largest producer, prohibit any of their vessels from dragging \nfor lobsters. That's why Massachusetts, America's second largest \nlobster producer, just enacted a new law to sharply restrict dragging \nby any of its vessels. And it's why Massachusetts and New Hampshire \nprohibit dragging for lobsters in State waters.\n  Inexplicably, however, dragging for lobsters is permitted under the \nstatus quo in Federal waters. And because Federal lobster management is \ncurrently in a state of limbo, we do not have comprehensive and active \nlobster management in the Federal zone at this time. The Commerce \nDepartment has turned Federal lobster management over to the Atlantic \nStates Marine Fisheries Commission [ASMFC], a State-based organization. \nBut the commission is not expected to complete a plan until sometime \nlate in 1997.\n\n  Obviously, lobsters don't recognize the State-Federal line. They \ncross it at will. So anything that happens on one side of the line \naffects the lobster resource on the other side. It's the same stock. \nThus, lobstermen in State waters can abide by the strictest regulations \npossible, but their conservation efforts will be undermined as long as \ndragging occurs right across the State line--and there is no doubt that \nit is occurring.\n  Reports in New England indicate that there are increasing numbers of\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\ndragging vessels engaged in directed fishing for lobsters in the \nFederal zone just outside State waters. The Maine Marine Patrol has \nseen an increase in directed dragging in the Federal zone. And lobster \nindustry officials from Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire are \nreporting it.\n  And these officials expect dragging activity to increase further over \nthe next couple of years as new groundfishing restrictions take effect \nand prompt more displaced groundfishermen to seek alternative fishing \nopportunities.\n  My original amendment sought to control the unwise practice of \ndirected, or intentional, dragging for lobsters. A dragger would have \nbeen prohibited from landing more than 100 lobsters per 24-hour fishing \nday, with a maximum limit of 500 lobsters for a fishing trip of 5 days \nor longer. These landings limits were taken straight from the law \nenacted this summer by Massachusetts and signed by the Governor. States \ncould have set the tighter limits, but landings would have been capped \nat the levels in the amendment.\n  These landings limits were intended to make it economically \ninfeasible for dragger vessels to intentionally target lobsters, while \npermitting draggers that unintentionally catch lobsters when they are \nfishing for other species, like cod, to sell their incidental by-catch. \nIt would have prevented draggers from easily circumventing the \nconservation laws of Maine and Massachusetts.\n  While I thought the amendment was a very reasonable one, other States \nexpressed concern about the abrupt imposition of new Federal \nregulations on them, so I agreed to a substantial compromise. Instead \nof imposing the landings limits immediately, the amendment I am \noffering today permits the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission \nand the Secretary of Commerce to develop and issue regulations for a \nFederal management plan for American lobster by December 31, 1997.\n  If a plan is not completed by the end of 1997, then the amendment \nwould require the Secretary to implement the landings limits that were \ncontained in the earlier amendment. To prevent an explosion in new \ndragging effort before the deadline, the amendment directs the \nSecretary to monitor lobster landings, and if he determines that a \nsubstantial increase in dragging is occurring, he is given \ndiscretionary--and I repeat, discretionary--authority to issue interim \nregulations to control the increase.\n  Mr. President, the deadline in my amendment is obviously more than a \nyear away and it gives the ASMFC and the Secretary ample time to get a \nhandle on Federal lobster management. In fact, the commission has said \nthat it can complete a plan by the fall of 1997, so the deadline is \nrealistic. My amendment will simply help to ensure that the commission \nmeets its own schedule for a plan, which will, hopefully, address the \ndragging issue. If the commission fails to meet this deadline, then and \nonly then will the dragging restrictions go into effect. Once the \ncommission completes its plan, the restrictions would be voided.\n  This is a very fair amendment, Mr. President, and, frankly, it \nrepresents a substantial compromise on the part of the American lobster \nindustry. It provides plenty of time for the management process to \nwork, while sending a message to the appropriate authorities that the \nissue of dragging for lobsters must be addressed. But if that process \nbogs down, and we're faced with the prospect of more and more dragging \nfor lobsters, then responsible lobstermen will receive some interim \nprotection until the commission completes its plan.\n  Lobster dragging is not only inconsistent with the conservation of \nthis fully exploited resource, it discourages conservation efforts \naimed at trap lobstermen. Trap lobstermen in Maine are facing stringent \nnew State regulations. All lobstermen who fish in the Federal zone will \nhave to reduce fishing effort by at least 20 percent in order for the \nASMFC to meet its goals. How can we expect these responsible lobstermen \nto sacrifice and accept burdensome new regulations when wasteful and \ndestructive dragging is allowed to continue unabated just across the \nState line?\n  The answer is that we can't. What we can expect is that these \nlobstermen will resist new regulations imposed on them, and the \nconservation program for the entire resource will be undermined.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about responsible fishing practices. \nAnd it is about equity for responsible fishermen. With the substantial \nconcessions that I have agreed to, this amendment gives the appropriate \nauthorities plenty of time to work out a comprehensive plan. But if the \nprocess fails, then we have to act.\n  The amendment is pro-conservation, and it is pro-lobsterman. It is \nstrongly supported by the State of Maine, the State of Massachusetts, \nand the entire lobster industry throughout New England and the \nNortheast.\n  Mr. President, my amendment presents an opportunity for Senators to \ncast a vote for equity for the great majority of America's lobstermen \nwho fish the right way, and for a healthy lobster resource. It would be \nthe height of irony if the Senate passed this Magnuson reauthorization \nbill, whose hallmark is the protection of America's fisheries, without \napproving this modest amendment. We can't let that happen, Mr. \nPresident. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nefforts. As she knows, we had a number of issues for a number of \ndifferent Senators. But I think she has gone a long way in helping to \nget resolved any of those issues, and we are delighted to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5381) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's amendment be made a part of the managers' amendment when I \npresent it later this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I could extend comments at length because \nof some of the comments made by the Senators from Washington. I do not \nintend to prolong the debate.\n  I want to state, however, that the provisions for the community \ndevelopment quotas are based in part on the authority of Congress to \nregulate the commerce of the Indian tribes. The communities of the west \ncoast of Alaska are predominantly Alaska Native people. They were there \nand fishing a long time before anyone else came on the fishing scene. \nAs a matter of fact, there were no factory trawlers off Alaska from the \nState of Washington until about 9 years ago. During the period of time \nsince then the amount of fish taken by those trawlers has come up from \nzero to at one time as high as 65 percent. As a result of negotiations, \nthere is now allocated 65 percent to the fisheries offshore and 35 for \nthe onshore fisheries.\n  We are allocating a portion of the fisheries to the communities \ninvolved that are historic native communities along our coast. I am sad \nthat the Members from Washington do not agree with that concept. We \nhave watched, I might say, with awe the development of the Indian law \nin the State of Washington that leads to a substantial claim by the \nIndians of Washington on the fish of the rivers, particularly the \nColumbia.\n  This is not the place to get into the argument about it, but we have \nworked out in Alaska a basis of allocation to protect the species. The \nMagnuson Act was designed to protect the fish, not fishermen. The \namendments for CDQ allocation are to protect communities, not \nfishermen. They are to protect the traditional fishing communities \nalong the west coast, and as I said half the coastline of the United \nStates is involved and very few communities are protected under the \nprovisions of the CDQ concept.\n  I do appreciate the comments they made and the attitude that has been \ndemonstrated here by all Senators to try to get this bill resolved in \nthe Senate and get it to the House and hopefully to the President \nbefore this Congress adjourns. I do want the Senate to know, however, \nthat this is not a subject that will go away. We will be involved in \nfisheries legislation, I am sure, as long as the Senate and the \nCongress are in being and as long as there are fisheries because it is \na matter of Federal jurisdiction. Whether we\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nlike it or not, we have to exercise our responsibility and we have to \nfind a way to accommodate the claims of persons who are entitled to \nfish in the waters off our shores.\n  We have tried our best to do that while at the same time protecting \nthose people who have traditionally relied upon the sole source for \ntheir income, and that is the fish resources off the State of Alaska. \nThat is the case for those Native communities. They are devastated now, \nMr. President, and we are trying to find a way to protect their future.\n  I do believe we have the right as the Congress of the United States \nto pass a law which commits a portion of the fish resources to those \ncommunities under the constitutional powers of the United States \nCongress to deal with the rights of Indian people, and that is why I am \npleased to have the provisions in this bill which I think confirm the \naction of our regional council. The fisheries development quotas were \nfirst put into being by action of the council itself. We are now \nconfirming that that is legitimate action under the concept of the \nMagnuson Act.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention now to offer the managers' \namendment. I would like to ask at the same time that the clerk under \nthe direction of the staffs of myself and Senator Kerry be authorized \nto make the technical amendments necessary to incorporate the \namendments that have already been adopted. The amendments that were \ncovered by the time agreement are to be put into the managers' \namendment, and we are doing that at the present time. And the amendment \nof Senator Snowe will also be put in the managers' amendment.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum, if I might just do it for a \nmoment. I will yield to my friend from Massachusetts if he wishes to \nmake some comment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5382\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n to authorize appropriations to provide for sustainable fisheries, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 5382.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this amendment be \nadopted now as original text, and if the Senator from Texas wishes to \noffer an amendment, that that be in order when she arrives----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas be \nsubject to a time agreement we have already entered into, 30 minutes in \nthe usual form, subject to the restrictions contained in the time \nagreement that has already been entered into on S. 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Alaska?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous-consent \nrequest is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5382) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, but I do want to request a time agreement \nwith respect to----\n  Mr. STEVENS. We did. Subject to the consideration--30 minutes was \nallowed on any amendment in the first degree. It will not be subject to \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do now ask that we have the agreement I \nsought previously; the clerk, working with the staffs of the two \nmanagers, myself and Senator Kerry, be permitted to make technical \nchanges necessary to conform this amendment. I have sent to the desk \nthe managers' amendment with the Snowe amendment. We will now have \nanother amendment offered, which I intend to oppose, by the way, but it \nwill be offered. Should it be adopted tomorrow, then it would be \ninserted into this amendment. So it would be an amendment to this \nmanagers' amendment we offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask no further amendments be in order, other than \nthe one amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the committee \nsubstitute and of S. 39, the Sustainable Fisheries Act, as amended.\n  Before discussing some of the provisions of the bill, I wanted to \ncommend Senator Stevens for his achievement in bringing this bill to \nthe verge of Senate passage. As those of us from coastal States know, \nfisheries management issues can be extremely complex, in both the \ntechnical and political senses. And these complexities are greatly \nheightened at the present time when so many of our fisheries are either \nfully exploited or overexploited.\n  That is why the reauthorization of the Magnuson Act has been a long \nand arduous process. But Senator Stevens, working with Senator Kerry, \nhave been able to plow through the complexities and the conundrums, and \nto resolve seemingly intractable disputes, in an effort to fashion the \ncompromise legislation that we are considering today. It's truly a \nmonumental achievement. And Senator Stevens, in particular, who has \nbeen a leader on fisheries issues for decades, and a framer of the \noriginal Magnuson Act, deserves our appreciation.\n  Mr. President, as other Senators have mentioned, this bill \nstrengthens the conservation provisions of the Magnuson Act, and it \nwill lead to the elimination of overfishing and fisheries rebuilding in \nall our our marine fisheries. Consistent with the title, letter, and \nspirit of the bill, I firmly believe that our fisheries must be \nsustainably managed. And sustainable management will require \nregulation.\n  Given the state of many of our fisheries, we cannot avoid \nconservation measures. But in the course of developing these measures, \nit is also equally important that the Federal Government consider the \neconomic costs of fisheries conservation. In some cases, those costs \ncan be severe, as in the case of the New England groundfish industry, \nwhich is now facing a mandatory 80 percent fishing effort reduction in \n2 years. Yet despite the importance of economic considerations, there \nis no requirement in the Magnuson Act to require fishery management \ncouncils to try to minimize the adverse economic impacts of fisheries \nregulations on fishing communities.\n  During markup in the Commerce Committee, I offered an amendment which \nestablishes a new national standard requiring all fishery management \nplans to minimize adverse economic impacts on fishing communities. The \namendment was adopted by voice vote. This provision is retained in the \nbill on the floor today, although we have modified it to make clear \nthat these economic considerations are not designed to trump \nconservation considerations in the process of developing fishery \nmanagement plans.\n  In addition to the economic impacts language, the bill before us \ncontains other provisions that I had offered as amendments during the \ncommittee process. One directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish \nan advisory panel consisting of scientists, State officials, fishermen, \nand conservationists to study and explore ways that the National Marine \nFisheries Service can expand the application of ecosystems\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nprinciples in its fisheries research and management programs.\n  Currently, the service takes a narrow approach that focuses primarily \non individual fish populations. I, along with many scientists, believe \nthat the Government should take a more holistic approach that looks at \nfisheries in the context of the ecosystems in which they live. The \nreport required by my amendment would be completed within 2 years.\n\n  Another of my provisions from the committee bill would preserve the \nexisting ban on the sale of undersized lobsters in the United States. \nThis language insures that the ban will remain in place even after the \nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission assumes responsibility for \nlobster management in the Federal zone. Obviously, this ban protects \njuvenile lobsters that must, if we are going to conserve this resource, \nbe given an opportunity to reach sexual maturity.\n  Negotiated rulemaking was the subject of another of my amendments in \ncommittee, and the bill retains those provisions. Negotiated rulemaking \nis a form of alternative dispute resolution in which representatives of \nall of the stakeholders in a dispute hold a series of negotiations with \na professional facilitator to achieve consensus. Negotiated rulemaking \nprovides an opportunity to overcome some of the divisiveness that we \nhave seen in some fisheries controversies. My amendment would authorize \nthe Councils, as well as the Secretary, to use negotiated rulemaking \nwhen they develop fishery management plans.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to mention three amendments that I \noffered prior to floor consideration, and that have been included in \nthe manager's amendment.\n  The first directs the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an \nindependent scientific peer review of the scientific information which \nforms a basis of the northeast multispecies fishery management plan. \nThis is the plan that covers the New England groundfish industry.\n  As I noted earlier, due to serious concerns about the health of the \ngroundfish resource, the New England Council has implemented a \nmanagement plan that will reduce fishing effort by 80 percent within 2 \nyears. This science has been controversial within the industry in the \nNew England region, and before moving forward with such draconian \nregulations, I think we owe it to those most affected by the plan to \nget a second opinion on this science before it's too late. This peer \nreview amendment will give us that second opinion.\n  My other amendments allow the State of Maine to permit Maine-licensed \nlobstermen to continue to fish in four pockets of Federal water that \nare surrounded on three sides by State waters, and make transshipment \npermits available to certain Canadian transport vessels involved in the \nsardine trade between Maine and Canada.\n  Mr. President, the bill is a fair product which resolves many \ncompeting concerns. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5383\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5383.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 142, line 7, ``insert ``To the maximum extent \n     practicable'', before ``Any''.\n       On page 142, line 10, ``strike ``must'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``should''.\n       On page 148, strike lines 1 through 17.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are going to try to work to see if \nwe can get these amendments in a form that is acceptable to the others \nthat are interested in this bill. It is very important to many of the \nrecreational fishermen in my State that we try to have a level playing \nfield for the recreational fishing people. I would like to try to work \nthis out, and hopefully put off the vote until tomorrow.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Just to inquire of the Chair, under the existing \nagreement of the managers, is there time to discuss the amendment \nbefore the vote would occur tomorrow?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently there are 49 seconds left. Under the \ncurrent guidelines we are operating under, there is no time set aside \nfor debate tomorrow, the Chair is advised.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will suggest at least a couple minutes on each side, \nfor the author of the amendment and those who oppose the amendment, to \nmake comments before we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I notified the Senator from Texas it is \nmy intention, and I believe it is the intention of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, to join together to oppose this amendment in its present \nform. Should it be modified in a way that is acceptable, it would, of \ncourse, be acceptable to the Senator from Louisiana. At the present \ntime it is my understanding there is not the opportunity to debate the \namendment, but it is my understanding the Senator has offered the \namendment with the hopes that through the night that this can be \nnegotiated out to be acceptable to all concerned, including the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  I state, it would be my intention, if there is to be any discussion \nof this tomorrow, it would be by whatever agreement we make now. And if \nthe Senator wishes some time tomorrow, I do not think that is \nimpossible.\n  How much time would the Senator like tomorrow?\n  Mr. KERRY. Two minutes on each side.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think we have more than one amendment at the desk in \nits current form.\n  Mr. STEVENS. One amendment that hits the bill in two spots. The \nSenator is correct. Again, we intend to oppose this amendment, and ask \nthe Senate to oppose it in its present form. If it is modified, it will \nbe modified to meet the Senator's acceptance. It would have to take \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obviously, the purpose of the agreement \nwhich we entered into previously was to set aside time tonight for the \npurposes of debate. And it is my understanding, the majority leader \nsaid there would be no debate tomorrow, there would only be votes.\n  I think it is fair to allow both sides 2 minutes, but I would be \nadverse to opening it up to a whole process of debate tomorrow. I mean, \nif they reach agreement, then there is no need for debate. If they do \nnot reach agreement, then it is going to take a very quick explanation \nof the two sides because both managers are going to be opposing this. I \ndo not think we ought to open it up for a lengthy period.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Two minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes for each side tomorrow prior to a vote, if there is to be a \nvote, in order to explain both positions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to 4 minutes equally \ndivided?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall not object, but I want to make it \nclear in the Record, if we can, that the Senator from Texas has the \nright to modify her amendment tomorrow in any form she wishes to do so. \nWe will oppose it in its present form, and we will oppose it unless it \nmeets an agreement of the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent before the Senate is a \nrequest for 4 minutes equally divided between the two sides, with the \nSenator from Texas retaining the right to modify her amendment. Is \nthere objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition.\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know of no further business to come \nbefore the Senate on this bill. As I understand it, all of the \namendments that were to be considered by the time agreement have now \nbeen brought before the Senate, and there is no more time left--I yield \nback whatever time I have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cohen be added as \na cosponsor of the amendment of Senator Snowe, which was previously \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts yields back his \ntime. The Senator from Alaska yields back his time. All time has been \nyielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If all time is yielded back, Mr. President, I would like \nto move on now to the matter of closing. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10794-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, for my colleagues who may have missed it, \ntoday President Clinton used executive power under the 1906 Antiquities \nAct to designate nearly 2 million acres in southern Utah as a national \nmonument.\n  A national monument, as my colleagues know, effectively locks up land \nwithin its boundaries preventing any kind of responsible development \nand limiting existing rights, including water rights, in the second \ndriest State in this Union.\n  Utah is already home to five national parks, two national monuments, \ntwo national recreation areas, seven national forests, one national \nwildlife refuge, and 800,000 acres of wilderness.\n  We prize our land in Utah. We believe we ought to preserve as much of \nit as we can, and we would like to continue working on legislation to \ndesignate more wilderness in Utah.\n  But the process the President is using is flawed and inherently \nunfair. I just say, the unilateral action taken by the President today \nis out of bounds. Members from Utah's congressional delegation and our \nState Governor had to read about this proposal in the Washington Post. \nThat is the first time we heard about it. There has been no \nconsultation whatsoever in the development of the proposal. We have \nseen no maps; no boundaries; there have been no phone conversations; no \nTV or radio discussion shows; no public hearings; absolutely nothing \nfrom this President.\n  None of the procedures for review and comment that are built into our \nenvironmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act or \nFLPMA have been followed. These procedures are a part of our law \nprecisely to guard against the Federal Government from usurping State \nor local prerogatives without public knowledge or comment.\n  While the 1906 Antiquities Act may, indeed, give the President the \nliteral authority to take this action, it is quite clear to me that in \nusing this authority, President Clinton is violating the spirit of U.S. \nenvironmental laws and, indeed, of American democracy itself.\n\n  It was no doubt inconceivable before today that any President of the \nUnited States would take such dramatic action--action that so \ndramatically affects any State--without due diligence. And it is plain \nto this Senator that the White House either flunks the test of due \ndiligence or takes this action deliberately without regard to its \nnegative impact on our State.\n  What should be especially relevant, and alarming, to every Senator is \nthat this disregard for established public law requiring public input, \nlet alone the disregard of established traditions of democracy, can be \napplied elsewhere other than Utah. Today, Utah; tomorrow, your State.\n  I hope my colleagues will not brush off the precedent this Executive \naction creates. There are numerous negative consequences to this \nPresident's action today. Among the most serious is the effect on \neducation in Utah.\n  Many States in the West depend on school trust lands to help finance \ntheir educational systems. In fact, 22 States, most of the States west \nof the Mississippi River, have trust lands.\n  Utah relies heavily on the income produced by these trust lands to \nhelp finance our schools. The national monument proclaimed by President \nClinton will capture approximately 200,000 acres of Utah school trust \nlands and render them useless to Utah schoolchildren. I say to my \ncolleagues, and to President Clinton if he is listening, this is a \npotential loss of $1 billion to Utah schools, and these environmental \nextremists are already talking that it is only $36,000 a year. That is \nhow ridiculous they are.\n  There is not a single State in America that can afford to lose that \nkind of money for education--that is $1 billion worth --let alone Utah, \nwhich, because we have so much public nontaxable land, is always \nstraining to fund education.\n  What is even more appalling is the fact that the resources President \nClinton is taking away from Utah kids, in effect, is their own land. \nThese school trust lands were deeded to Utah to be held in trust for \nour children's education, and with one stroke of the pen, these 200,000 \nacres will be gone.\n  The Utah Public Education Coalition, which includes professional \neducators, State and local administrators, the PTA and school \nemployees, have come out strongly against this arbitrary action by the \nPresident.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letter to President Clinton, \nposition statement and resolution, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, another adverse ramification of the \nPresident's action today is inability to responsibly extract the high-\nquality, clean-burning, low-sulfur coal that lies in the Kaiparowits \ncoal basin. Please note, the coal is in the basin, not on the \nKaiparowits Plateau. This is not a strip mine. This is a mine right in \nthe side that will not even show.\n  The basin has been called the ``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' There are \nabout 62 billion tons of coal here, about 16 billion tons of which can \nbe mined with existing technologies. That is enough coal to fulfill \nUtah's energy needs for the next 1,000 years, and, I might add, the \nenergy needs of this country. That is environmentally sound coal that \ncould be blended with the dirty coal from the East, and it would be in \nthe best interest of the environment of this country.\n\n  I find it a little ironic that the President wants to prevent the \nmining of this clean, environmentally beneficial coal while we are \nstill paying billions of dollars to clean our dirty air from burning \nhigh-sulfur, dirty coal.\n  These coal reserves, in addition to being a financial asset to our \nState, are a critical energy resource for our entire country. We are \nbeing extremely shortsighted if we forget this fact.\n  How can we justify sending U.S. troops to keep the Middle East stable \nand to keep the oil flowing when President Clinton refuses to develop \nenergy resources right here in our own country? We have to do both. We \nhave to act in the best interest of the energy needs of this country. \nWhat the President did today is not in the best interest.\n  Mr. President, we should not forget the impact the restrictions on \nwater rights will have, not only on Utah, but also on Colorado, New \nMexico, Nevada, Arizona, and California.\n  Utah is the second driest state in the union. This action by \nPresident Clinton would deny our state the right to develop its water \nin southern Utah.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wonder how the Administration plans to pay \nfor the operations and maintenance of what would be the largest \nnational monument in the United States.\n  Already, the National Park Service is stretched to the limit. Adding \nnearly 2\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\nmillion acres to their inventory--almost the size of Yellowstone--\nraises real questions about our stewardship of this land. We want to \npreserve land in southern Utah.\n  There is no question that Utahns want to protect as much land as we \ncan. We would support a well thought out proposal for additional \nnational park or wilderness areas in southern Utah.\n  We also recognize that there are differences of opinion concerning \nthe number of acres and management prerogatives. We believe those are \nmatters for negotiation and compromise, not for making political hay \nwith important special interest groups.\n  We would like to work with President Clinton to develop a sound \npreservation plan. And, the offer is still open to work together on \nthis.\n  But, frankly, I say to my colleagues, real damage has been done \nhere--both to Utah and to the tradition of open debate. The failure \neven to consult prior to making this decision should be considered \ndevastating to representative democracy.\n  Our Utah newspapers have thus far been unanimous in their criticism \nof the President's action. But, they also represent the people of Utah. \nThey may be sympathetic to environmental concerns--just as Utahns are--\nand they may support more protected land in southern Utah--just as many \nUtahns do--but they draw the line on a Federal Government exercising \nwhat they construe as abusive power--just as Utahns do.\n\n  So permit me to quote from an editorial this morning from the San \nFrancisco Chronicle: ``The question is whether a decision of such \nmagnitude should be carried out by executive order. We think not.''\n  While acknowledging their differences with me and my colleagues on \nthe specifics of the wilderness bill proposed earlier, the Chronicle \ngoes on to suggest that:\n\n       ``In this case, Clinton is taking the wrong route--an \n     election-year shortcut--to the right goal.''\n\n  The bottom line here, Mr. President, is that any proposal that is \ngoing to have such an incredible impact on the people of Utah--or of \nany other State--ought to be vetted by our political process.\n  People ought to be able to debate it in the press, on talk radio, in \ncivic clubs, and across back fences. They ought to be able to write \ntheir Congressman. They ought to be able to support it or protest it.\n  Utahns have had little opportunity to do either. There is something \nfundamentally wrong with a Presidential action that deprives a State of \n$6.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion for education, surrounding States \nwith water resources, and the entire Nation of important energy \nresources without even a hearing or a vote.\n  One last thing: I want to put the Senate, the House, and the \nPresident on notice that this issue is not over. William Jefferson \nClinton's signature on this order isn't the end of it.\n  We cannot suffer this kind of an assault on Utah without a fight. So, \ntoday it begins.\n  Mr. President, I will just conclude with these comments. There is no \nquestion that Utahans want to protect as much lands as we can. We would \nsupport a well-thought-out proposal for additional national park or \nwilderness areas in southern Utah and even a national monument, which \nis not as good as wilderness areas or national parks.\n  We also recognize that there are differences of opinion concerning \nthe number of acres in management prerogatives. We believe those are \nmatters for negotiation and compromise, not for making political hay \nwith important special interest groups.\n  We would like to work with President Clinton, if he would, to develop \na sound preservation plan. And the offer is still open for us to still \nwork together on this. But, frankly, I say to my colleagues, real \ndamage has been done here, both to Utah and to the tradition of open \ndebate. The failure to even consult prior to making this decision is to \nbe considered devastating to representative democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Standard-Examiner, Sept. 10, 1996]\n\n               Bill Clinton Should Wait for Utah's Input\n\n       In the battle between environmentalists, the federal \n     government and Utah's congressional delegation, the battle \n     for wilderness has taken a creative turn.\n       President Clinton and his Secretary of the Interior, Bruce \n     Babbitt, have floated an unusual trial balloon: The \n     administration may invoke a 1906 statute to create a 1.8 \n     million-acre national monument encompassing Utah's \n     Kaiparowits Plateau.\n       It would be called Canyons of the Escalante National \n     Monument, and the thing that's driving Gov. Mike Leavitt and \n     Utah's congressional delegation crazy is that Clinton can \n     accomplish the task with a stroke of his pen--Congress and \n     the state be damned.\n       It's the kind of bold move Clinton might enjoy taking in an \n     election year, cuddling up to and solidifying his support \n     among environmentalists across the nation, who have been \n     pushing for designation of 5.7 million acres of wilderness in \n     Utah.\n       Such a move would surely anger the less environmentally \n     inclined of Southern Utah, though, since they've been \n     counting on the mining of Kaiparowits Plateau coal by the \n     Dutch firm Andalex Resources Inc., which plans to start a 50-\n     year coal mining operation within the next year, bringing in \n     paved roads and about 1,000 jobs.\n       The Kaiparowits is pretty much ground zero in the \n     battleground between those lobbying for 5.7 million acres of \n     wilderness and those who prefer 2 million acres. In the 5.7 \n     million-acre plan, virtually all of the Kaiparowits Plateau \n     is set aside as wilderness, whereas in the 2 million-acre \n     alternative only about 12 percent would be preserved.\n       Debate is a good thing, but this latest move by the White \n     House ought to be alarming to all sides. It means the \n     president, if he has a mind to, can bypass public comment and \n     unilaterally create de facto wilderness. As the \n     administration has said, the 1906 law permitting Clinton this \n     discretion can be used to protect objects of historical, \n     biological or archaeological importance.\n       If, indeed, that is the case with the Kaiparowits Plateau--\n     and it may well be--Clinton should use the standard means for \n     coming to that conclusion: study, debate and action. To do \n     otherwise in an election year can be seen as nothing but what \n     it is: pandering to a specific constituency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 18, 1996]\n\n                        Canyons of the Escalante\n\n       Our concern with President Clinton's intention to establish \n     the Canyons of the Escalante National Monument has nothing to \n     do with its paleontological or archeological value.\n       Indeed, there are compelling reasons to preserve a 1.8 \n     million-acre, red-rocked patch of southern Utah, with its \n     stunning buttes, steep canyons and array of artifacts from \n     tribes that once inhabited the foreboding terrain.\n       The question is whether a decision of such magnitude should \n     be carried out by executive order.\n       We think not.\n       This may well be a worthy idea, but it deserves a fair \n     hearing. It deserves to go through public deliberations--as \n     slow and messy as democracy may be--to fully air the concerns \n     about sealing off access to a potentially rich coal field.\n       There is no dispute that President Clinton has the legal \n     authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to declare the \n     national monument. President Teddy Roosevelt invoked the same \n     statute in 1908 to protect the Grand Canyon.\n       Utah's congressional delegation is understandably irate at \n     the prospect of a Clinton-decreed monument. In their view, \n     the president is rolling over their concerns--and scoffing at \n     the five electoral votes he had no chance of getting anyway--\n     to score points with the broader electorate. Polls show that \n     voters are concerned about environmental protection, and the \n     deficiency of such a sensibility in Congress.\n       We certainly would not want to defer to Utah politicians on \n     this issue. After all, their pro-development bent was clearly \n     evident in a Utah Wilderness Bill that has been languishing \n     in the U.S. Senate.\n       Still, they deserve to be heard. Some of the canyon land in \n     the new monument would have been designated as wilderness in \n     the Utah bill. Which approach would provide the proper level \n     of protection? That and other land-management issues were \n     worth exploring--in a public process.\n       By drawing a circle around a chunk of southern Utah, \n     Clinton will have headed off the exploitation of a precious \n     area.\n       In doing it by executive order, however, Clinton and the \n     environmental community are likely to encounter intensified \n     hostility in future skirmishes over development and \n     preservation. Utah may not matter on the electoral map, but \n     small Western states pack disproportionate clout on Capitol \n     Hill, particularly in the U.S. Senate, and they often band \n     together on land issues.\n       In this case, Clinton is taking the wrong route--an \n     election-year shortcut-to the right goal.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Sept. 13, 1996]\n\n                         A Monument to Rashness\n\n       The Clinton administration would be denying its own land-\n     management process if it\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\n     were to create unilaterally a huge Canyons of the Escalante \n     National Monument on federal land in southern Utah. It should \n     forgo such rash action and await results from processes \n     already in motion.\n       The concept of a Canyons of the Escalante National Monument \n     blindsided most everybody last weekend, when a Washington \n     Post story revealed that President Clinton was considering \n     such protection for 1.8 million acres in Kane and Garfield \n     counties. Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, he has the right to \n     establish national monuments, just as other presidents have \n     on Utah's public lands. But a designation of this magnitude, \n     at this time, would not be well-advised.\n       There are two intertwined developments here, and the \n     administration ought to let them run their course rather than \n     pre-empt them with a national monument designation. One is \n     the ongoing preparation of an environmental impact statement \n     (EIS) for Andalex Resources' request to develop its coal-\n     mining claims on the Kaiparowits Plateau. The other is the \n     ongoing fight over wilderness designation on Utah's Bureau of \n     Land Management lands.\n       The Interior Department is involved in both, developing an \n     EIS on Andalex that is now projected to be ready sometime \n     next year and, at the recent behest of Secretary Bruce \n     Babbitt, conducting a new inventory of BLM lands in Utah for \n     wilderness designation. Wilderness advocates, who oppose the \n     Andalex mine, have been critical of the EIS process, yet they \n     endorse the re-inventory. It is a bit disingenuous to applaud \n     the agency on one project and distrust it on a related one.\n       Of course, the Utah Wilderness Coalition, which wants 5.7 \n     million acres of wilderness designation on Utah's BLM lands \n     and hopes Babbitt's re-inventory will facilitate that, is \n     primarily looking for results--and, concurrently, for the \n     blocking of the Andalex mine. And Clinton's designation of a \n     national monument would give it more than it ever envisioned.\n       The proposed national monument would involve three \n     potential wilderness areas--the Kaiparowits Plateau, the \n     Grand Staircase and the Escalante Canyons. The UWC \n     recommended 1.27 million acres of wilderness in those three \n     areas. So, President Clinton's designation of a 1.8-million-\n     acre national monument would give environmentalists a half-\n     million more acres of protection than even they suggested. \n     Obviously, that's a stretch.\n       By the same token, little sympathy should be reserved for \n     the members of the Utah congressional delegation, who whined \n     about learning of the national monument idea through the \n     press. They already know about an unbalanced process, since \n     they were accused of conducting one last year prior to \n     unveiling their original 1.8-million-acre wilderness bill.\n       The delegation bill was inadequate on acreage and was \n     particularly short in the Escalante-Kaiparowits areas, where \n     it recommended only about 360,000 acres of wilderness. The \n     wilderness study areas that the BLM had established a decade \n     earlier covered 2 times that much in this precious region. \n     So, while a national monument providing 1.8 million acres of \n     protection may be off the scale, so too was the delegation's \n     meager 360,000 acres.\n       Other considerations that should cause the president to \n     look before he leaps include Utah's school trust lands and \n     the future of the Kaiparowits coal reserves. If a national \n     monument were designated, some sort of compensation for \n     school trust lands within the area would be necessary. But \n     the educators protest too much; their windfall from the \n     development of these lands is not a primary consideration on \n     which to base land-management decisions.\n       As for the estimated 62 billion tons of coal under the \n     Kaiparowits Plateau, that is a natural resource as well as \n     the unusual land above it. The president ought to think twice \n     before considering a designation that would inhibit the use \n     of that resource, which, if not developed now by Andalex, may \n     be needed decades from now.\n       Obviously, the process for determining how much of southern \n     Utah's public lands to protect--whether by wilderness \n     designation, national monument, conservation area, eco-region \n     or some other brand name--has not been productive so far. But \n     if the president's own Interior Department is assessing the \n     impact of the proposed Andalex mine and re-assessing \n     wilderness acreage, it makes little sense for him to obviate \n     the agency's work now by cavalierly dubbing the whole area a \n     national monument.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, September 17, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Last Saturday, we met with Secretary of \n     Interior Babbitt and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) \n     Director McGinty to discuss the possible designation to the \n     Canyons of the Escalante National Monument. We are writing to \n     strenuously voice our opposition to this action.\n       Since the proposal surfaced in a Washington Post article in \n     September 7, we have been unable to ascertain any information \n     on the specifics of this proposal now under review by the \n     White House. Repeated requests for information from both CEQ \n     and the Department of Interior have resulted in no further \n     clarification of the story. Even our meeting last Saturday \n     yielded nothing new on this subject. It has been very \n     frustrating to know that senior officials in the \n     Administration have been considering creating a new national \n     monument in Utah, and yet we are unable to learn any of the \n     details--i.e., the exact location, the specific boundaries, \n     the impact on existing rights-of-way and permits, which \n     federal agency will manage the proposed monument, the impact \n     to state school trust lands, etc. In our opinion, this is not \n     the way to go about the establishment of a new national \n     monument, let alone carrying out the public's business.\n       We have expressed our specific concerns to Secretary \n     Babbitt and Director McGinty, and we trust they will bring \n     these items to your attention prior to your making any \n     decision to proceed further on this project this week or, for \n     that matter, anytime in the coming months. However, we would \n     like to reiterate these concerns to you so there can be no \n     misunderstanding.\n       As we indicated on Saturday, we believe this proposal, as \n     indicated in the Post article, should be rejected for several \n     critical reasons:\n       The total acreage of the Monument proposal will be \n     approximately 1.8 million acres. If this acreage figure is \n     correct, this proposal would create the largest national \n     monument in the continental United States, 1\\1/2\\ times the \n     size of the Grand Canyon National Park. This land will be \n     withdrawn from multiple use without any public comment and \n     review, including congressional hearings and meetings, and \n     without consulting the land managers on the ground who must \n     deal with any conflicts that will occur. \n       The State of Utah is bound by this fiduciary responsibility \n     to show complete and undivided loyalty to the school children \n     of Utah--the sole beneficiaries of the trust created at \n     statehood--and properly manage these lands to enhance our \n     schools. That is the reason for their existence. Placing \n     these lands within the proposed Monument's boundaries will \n     create state inholdings within a national monument, which \n     severely limits the proper management of these lands by the \n     trustee, the Utah State Schools and Institutional Trust Lands \n     Board.\n       Understandably, the Board is very concerned about the \n     future of the billions of tons of clean, low sulfur coal that \n     is located on these school trust lands. The Utah Geological \n     Survey has estimated the net present value of the coal in \n     this area at over $1 billion. This revenue flow is vital to \n     Utah, as the Utah Public Education Coalition has stated. If \n     this much land is taken from the school children of Utah, the \n     state and board of education would have no choice but to file \n     a lawsuit as trustees for the beneficiaries for taking over a \n     billion dollars of school resources without fair and timely \n     compensation.\n       Those who support the Monument proposal have spoken of the \n     need to protect the land for generations to come; we would \n     argue for support of a better and more responsible proposal \n     that protects the beauty of our land while enhancing the \n     educational component of our society for these future \n     generations. As we understand the proposal, it would not \n     achieve both results.\n       Acceptance of the Monument proposal would send the message \n     to every public lands state in the nation that at anytime the \n     Executive Branch could withdraw millions of acres of lands \n     within that state from multiple use purposes without the \n     benefit of a single comment from the affected state. In fact, \n     it may occur without any notification.\n       The Monument proposal will basically withdraw from future \n     development the largest untapped energy reserve in the United \n     States, valued by the State of Utah to be more than $1 \n     trillion. The energy in the Kaiparowits Coal Basin is \n     comparable to 20 to 30 billion barrels of OPEC oil, and would \n     satisfy the energy needs of Utah for many generations to \n     come. The inclusion of this resource within the Monument \n     proposal will have an enormous fiscal impact on all taxpayers \n     of approximately $6 to $9 billion in lost federal royalties. \n     Under the Monument proposal, this resource will never be \n     available for future generations. We question whether these \n     economic and national security issues have been thoroughly \n     discussed by the administration prior to the formulation of \n     this proposal.\n        Mr. President, for these and many other compelling \n     reasons, we have very serious reservations about the Monument \n     proposal. We have been provided with no details on this \n     proposal. That is why we strongly encourage you to resist any \n     temptation or campaign advice to issue a proclamation \n     designating a new national monument in Utah this week or in \n     the coming weeks, until a complete analysis conducted through \n     a public process can be undertaken with us and the citizens \n     of our state. It is only through such an open process that \n     these and the many other issues related to the establishment \n     of a national monument can be properly addressed.\n       We would appreciate your serious consideration of these \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael O. Leavitt,\n                                                         Governor.\n     Robert F. Bennett,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n     Orrin G.

We oppose this designation as \n     currently proposed for a variety of reasons.\n       First of all, there has been so little discussion and \n     review of the proposal that it is not clear what the \n     boundaries are. Potentially 200,000 acres of school trust \n     lands granted to support our schools are within the \n     boundaries of the proposed designation. If this much land is \n     taken from the school children of Utah, the state and board \n     of education would have no choice but to file a lawsuit as \n     trustees for the beneficiaries for taking over a billion \n     dollars of school resources without fair and timely \n     compensation.\n       One of our major concerns is over the designation of the \n     Kaiparowits Coal Basin as part of this national monument. \n     This land is separate from the Kaiparowits Plateau which is \n     known for its scenic beauty and unique land formations. The \n     Kaiparowits Coal Basin is composed of considerably less \n     scenic terrain and is interlaced with many miles of country \n     roads, an airstrip, an old coal mine, drill sites, and \n     abandoned mine sites.\n       The designation would frustrate environmentally sound \n     recovery of an important national resource. The coal \n     resources in the Kaiparowits Coal Basin represent the largest \n     untapped energy reserve in the United States, and this coal \n     is among the least polluting in the world Development of this \n     underground coal will be important to our nation and will \n     return $6 to $9 billion to the national treasury in royalties \n     plus additional funds through the multiplier effect.\n       We further believe that there is no reason to declare this \n     a national monument to protect the canyons of the Escalante \n     as they are already protected. At this time, 90 percent of \n     the canyons of the Escalante are already in the Glen Canyon \n     National Recreation Area. The remaining 10 percent are near \n     the town of Escalante and are in current wilderness study \n     areas.\n       On behalf of the children and our schools, we ask that you \n     not designate any further lands in Utah as a national \n     monument without full consideration of the impacts on \n     education in Utah and full compensation for any restrictions \n     placed Utah's school trust lands.\n           Sincerely,\n         Linda M.

Utah is bound by the fiduciary duty to \n     show undivided loyalty to the schools of Utah, who are the \n     beneficiaries of the trust created by the Enabling Act. The \n     federal government is also bound, as grantor, by the terms of \n     the grant. We expect our President to show integrity in \n     abiding by its compacts with its own people.\n       Any attempt to deny the schools of Utah full fair market \n     value for the lands so granted would initiate a takings \n     procedure by the education family and the state as trustee \n     for the full value plus interest. Governor Mike Leavitt's \n     office and the Utah Geological Survey has estimated that the \n     net present value of the coal underlying the Kaiparowits Coal \n     Basin on the school lands alone is between $640 million and \n     $1.1 billion.\n       The National Education Association Legislative Platform has \n     a plank to protect land set aside to support schools. There \n     are 22 states that have trust lands (Alaska, Arizona, \n     Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, \n     Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North \n     Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, \n     Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).\n       The energy in the Kaiparowits Coal Basin represents the \n     largest untapped energy reserve in the continental United \n     States. This is not just a Utah issue; this issue is a \n     national issue, especially with the recent power outages on \n     the west coast.\n       Inclusion of the Kaiparowits Coal Basin in the proposal has \n     an enormous fiscal impact on the taxpayers of approximately \n     $6 billion to $9 billion in lost royalty.\n       Designation of 1.8 million acres is not necessarily a pro-\n     environmental position as the coal from the Kaiparowits is \n     among the cleanest coal with the lowest sulfur content. At \n     this time, 90% of the canyons of the Escalante are already in \n     the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The remaining 10% \n     are near the town of Escalante and are in current wilderness \n     study areas.\n       The coal resources are NOT located on the Kaiparowits \n     Plateau. The coal resources are located in the Kaiparowits \n     Coal Basin to the west of the plateau.\n       The Kaiparowits Coal Basin is not pristine. Within 2 miles \n     radius there are 36 miles of publicly maintained roads, an \n     air strip, drill holes, a previously mined coal site, \n     numerous other mining sites, fences and cattle watering \n     holes.\n       The Kaiparowits Plateau is composed of towering cliffs and \n     spectacular, stark scenery. On the other hand, the \n     Kaiparowits Coal Basin has been described an undulating grey \n     terrain. Parts of ``Planet of the Apes'' were filmed there.\n       There is a middle ground. Development of the coal resources \n     can occur under the ground with the mine portal occupying \n     only 40 acres of the surface, about .004% of the Kaiparowits \n     Coal Basin. Citizens can continue to enjoy the Canyons of the \n     Escalante and the Kaiparowits Plateau under the protection of \n     a National Recreation Area and wilderness study areas. \n     Improvement of the existing road would eliminate the need for \n     additional road construction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Resolution in Support of An Exchange of Utah School Trust Lands for \n      Federal Lands in the Smoky Hollow Area of Kane County, Utah\n\n                (By The Utah Public Education Coalition)\n\n       Whereas, Under the Utah Enabling Act the federal government \n     granted to the state certain sections of the public domain, \n     now known as School Trust lands, to be used exclusively for \n     generating revenue to support Utah's public education system; \n     and\n       Whereas, These School Trust lands are scattered and \n     isolated parcels which are now totally surrounded within a \n     larger matrix of federal lands, and management of the \n     surrounding federal lands by the federal government for non-\n     economic purposes is in direct conflict with the state's \n     fiduciary responsibility to create revenue from these trust \n     lands for the state's public education system, and that such \n     federal land management conflicts are in direct violation of \n     the grant made by the United States government to the State \n     of Utah; and\n       Whereas, Utah School Trust lands located within the \n     Kaiparowits and Alton coalfields of southern Utah contain \n     hundreds of millions of recoverable tons of high-grade \n     bituminous coal, enough to supply all the electrical power \n     requirements for the entire state of Utah for the next 100 \n     years at present rates of consumption; and\n       Whereas, This coal reserve constitutes one of the most \n     important sources of future revenue for Utah's School Trust \n     and shall be protected by the State now and forever in the \n     future; and\n       Whereas, Most of these School Trust coal reserves are \n     scattered throughout federally designated wilderness study \n     areas in the interior of the Kaiparowits coalfield or in \n     areas of the Alton coalfield designated by the federal \n     government as ``unsuitable for mining'' because of proximity \n     to the viewshed from Bryce Canyon National Park; and\n       Whereas, These federal non-use designations prevent the \n     development of the inheld School Trust resources for the \n     support of the schools within these areas; and\n       Whereas, The development of underground coal deposits by \n     modern underground mining methods requires large blocks of \n     contiguous acreage; and\n       Whereas, It is the responsibility of the State of Utah to \n     assure the beneficiaries of the Utah school trust that in the \n     future the federal government will be required to provide \n     just and adequate compensation for any defacto takings of any \n     and all School Trust assets within the Kaiparowits/Alton \n     coalfields resulting from any federal action or land \n     designation which effectively renders inheld trust lands \n     incapable of providing revenue to Utah's education system as \n     mandated by the Utah Enabling Act; and\n       Whereas, Present and future management conflicts between \n     the Utah School Trust and the federal government could be \n     quickly, easily and permanently resolved to the mutual \n     benefit of all parties by simply trading School Trust coal \n     resources within federal wilderness study areas/unsuitability \n     areas for federal coal resources of equal value located \n     outside of these designated areas; and\n       Whereas, Such an exchange would allow the Utah School Trust \n     to provide long term economic benefits to the state's \n     education system as required by law while allowing the \n     federal government the ability to manage its land in \n     accordance with non-economic objectives (wilderness values, \n     national park viewsheds, etc.) and thereby avoid serious, and \n     inevitable, future land use conflicts between the federal \n     government and the Utah School Trust involving the \n     Kaiparowits/Alton areas; and\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\n       Whereas, Andalex Resources is now proposing an underground \n     coal mine on existing federal and school trust leases located \n     in the Smoky Hollow area at the southern tip of the \n     Kaiparowits coalfield, and the federal government has \n     formally and officially determined that this area clearly and \n     obviously does not qualify for wilderness designation; and\n       Whereas, The state of Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining \n     has approved the Smoky Hollow Mine Permit Application Package \n     and has determined that the mine can be constructed, operated \n     and reclaimed in accordance with all necessary state and \n     federal environmental protection laws and regulations;

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nchild passenger vehicle occupant protection.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation held an oversight hearing on the safety and \neffectiveness of driver side and passenger side air bags. At the \nhearing, we learned that generally air bags are safe. They are credited \nwith saving approximately 900 lives since 1987 and with reducing the \nseverity of injury in many more instances. So it is abundantly clear \nthat air bags are an important automotive safety device.\n  Unfortunately, there is a downside to air bag use. While usually \nminor in nature, in some cases they cause injuries. In the worst cases, \nthey have caused death. This is especially true in the case of children \nwith some data showing two children die because of a passenger side air \nbag deployment for every one saved by the deployment.\n  The Committee's oversight hearing highlighted issues like this and \nalso explored actions underway at the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) to improve child passenger safety. At the \nhearing, I stressed the need to publicize the importance of putting \nchild safety seats in the back seat and not in a passenger seat \nequipped with an air bag.\n  Subsequent to our hearing, I was pleased that a coalition was formed \nto alert the public of passenger side air bag dangers to infants and \nchildren. I also have followed closely the initiatives at NHTSA to \nchange federal air bag requirements, encourage the introduction of new \nair bag technology, and improve child restraint system performance.\n  These steps are needed and they hold promise for child passenger \nsafety improvements. However, more comprehensive action is needed.\n  Yesterday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released \nthe findings of its 2-year child occupant safety study. Pointing to the \ndangers and risks to children posed by passenger-side air bags and \nimproperly used child restraint systems, the NTSB called on NHTSA, \nState Governors, and automobile manufacturers to take steps to address \ncontinuing safety problems.\n  For instance, the NTSB study found inadequacies in NHTSA's proposed \nrulemaking on smart air bags and air bag warning labels. On August 1, \n1996, NHTSA proposed changes to federal air bag requirements to \nencourage the introduction of new air bag technology. If automobile \nmanufacturers do not provide the so-called smart air bags, the NHTSA \nproposal would require manufacturers to post new and more prominent air \nbag warning labels inside the vehicle.\n  The safety study, however, concluded that the NHTSA proposal will not \naccelerate the development of more intelligent systems. As a result of \nits review of the proposed rulemaking, the NTSB called on NHTSA to do \nmore to encourage automobile manufacturers to install intelligent air \nbag systems and specifically recommended that NHTSA establish an \nimplementation timetable.\n\n  In another area, the NTSB safety study investigated air bag \ndeployment rates and recommended that NHTSA's technical air bag \ndeployment threshold standards be reevaluated. The recommendation urges \nthe consideration of technical standards for less aggressive air bag \ndeployment, particularly for those on the passenger side of motor \nvehicles.\n  Its my recollection that NHTSA has said the technology for less \naggressive air bag deployment currently is not available. However, \ntechnically it can be done. Canada, as I understand it, is on the verge \nof requiring less aggressive deployment standards for air bags in any \ncar sold in Canada. Until ``smart'' air bags are available, this may be \nthe best interim solution and NHTSA should carefully investigate this \npossibility. The NTSB recommendations make clear the lack of testing \nthat was done prior to putting passenger side air bags into the \nautomotive fleet.\n  The NTSB also asked NHTSA to revise several motor vehicle safety \nstandards governing air bags and passenger restraint systems. As \nrevisions are made, testing and performance standards that reflect an \nactual accident environment must be developed.\n  Quick action on these recommendations is required because there are \nnearly 22 million vehicles currently on the road with passenger-side \nair bags. NHTSA's proposed rulemaking will not affect these vehicles. \nAlso, an estimated 13 million additional vehicles will be sold yearly \nbefore the new standards take effect.\n  Something must be done to protect children in vehicles like these. \nChanges in air bag deployment rates and the installation of on-off \ndeployment switches are two of the options that could be evaluated.\n  The NTSB's safety study also explores in detail the difficulties \nparents and care givers have in securing a child restraint system \nproperly in vehicles. Inadequacies in the design of child restraint \nsystems themselves and the need to improve seatbelt fit for children \nwere singled out by the NTSB as an area in which safety improvements \ncan be made.\n  These problems warrant action and I encourage NHTSA to act swiftly on \nthe NTSB recommendations. I will continue to follow this safety issue \nclosely and plan on holding a hearing early in the next Congress to \nexamine the NTSB's safety study.\n  Mr. President, finally we need to get a simple message to parents. We \nmust tell parents that until less aggressive passenger side air bags or \n``smart'' air\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\nbags are available there is something they can do to protect their \nchildren. Specifically, they should consider placing all children under \n12 in the back seat of their vehicles whenever the vehicle is in \nmotion. Studies have shown the back seat to be the safest place for \nchildren in passenger vehicles. In fact, Germany already requires this \nby law.\n  I want to applaud the NTSB's call for educational campaigns \nemphasizing the importance of transporting children in the back seat of \npassenger vehicles. I know of one car manufacturer that recently \ndeveloped an advertising campaign urging this safety measure as part of \nits efforts to raise public awareness on the dangers of passenger side \nair bags to children. We must improve vehicle occupant protection and \ninitiatives like these offer significant safety benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10831-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MICHAEL ANTHONY FIGURES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Alabama State Senator Michael Anthony \nFigures, of Mobile, passed away on Friday, September 13, 1996. He was \nPresident Pro Tem of the State Senate, making him the highest-ranking \nAfrican-American in the State legislature.\n  This is the second highest-ranking position in the Alabama Senate and \none of the most powerful and visible posts in State government. Senator \nFigures was the first black to ever hold the job and was exceptionally \neffective and politically astute. He could dissect an issue and get to \nits essence very quickly and directly. He was very close to Lieutenant \nGovernor Don Siegelman, President of the Senate, and was instrumental \nin carrying out his legislative agenda.\n  Senator Figures, who was only 48 years of age, was almost universally \nadmired by the people who knew and worked with him. Both friends and \npolitical adversaries admired and appreciated his honesty, integrity, \nand work ethic.\n  Senator Figures was born on October 13, 1947, the youngest of three \nsons of Reverend Coleman and Mrs. Augusta Mitchell Figures. He attended \nStillman College and the University of Alabama Law School. He was first \nelected to the State Senate in 1978 as a Democrat, at that time only \nthe third black person to serve in the Senate. He represented District \n33, which includes part of Mobile and Prichard.\n  Over the years, he built a solid legislative record on local and \nstatewide issues. He worked long and hard to ensure minority \nrepresentation while helping to create a ``strong'' mayoral position in \nMobile's city government. Many view his finest legislative \naccomplishment the 1994 Senate passage of former Governor Jim Folsom's \n``Alabama First'' education reform plan. Although it did not pass the \nHouse, it received 32 out of 35 votes in the Senate, due largely to \nSenator Figures' tenacious leadership and persuasion.\n  Senator Figures was a founder of the Alabama New South Coalition, \nstarted in the 1980's to promote progressive causes and candidates. \nThis influential political caucus has been instrumental in bringing \nblacks and whites in Alabama together. Senator Figures's wife, Vivian \nDavis Figures, is a member of the Mobile City Council. They had four \nsons together, Jelani Anthony, Shomari Coleman, Akil Michael, and \nDerrick.\n  Senator Figures was a visionary and progressive leader who will be \nsorely missed by the people of Alabama. He had considerable ability, \nintellect, and drive. As one of the most influential politicians in \nAlabama's government, he had an unyielding desire to correct what he \nperceived as wrongs in society. He was an outstanding orator and had a \nquick mind and will be impossible to replace. He had an uncommon \nability to smooth over disagreements and build bridges. Other members \nof the Senate really listened to him and responded to his arguments.\n  Much of his success was rooted in his high degree of integrity. He \nwas a stickler for following the Senate's procedural rules, even if \nbending those rules might have helped his side prevail. He never \ncompromised his honesty or credibility as he quickly ascended to the \nheights of power and influence.\n  The sad and untimely death of State Senator Michael Figures is an \nimmeasurable loss for my State. He was an uncommon force for justice \nand progress who accomplished a great deal in a relatively short time. \nI extend my sincerest condolences to Vivian and their entire family in \nthe wake of this loss. I hope they find some solace in the fact that he \ntruly made Alabama a better state and better place to live. His many \nlasting contributions will stand as his personal legacy and as a \ntestament to his ideals and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10832-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10832-S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WHY TAMPER WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL SUCCESS STORY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that, once again, \nAmerican business has succeeded in significantly reducing the amount of \nchemicals released into the environment. According to the most recent \nreport from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Data Release of 1994, \nreleases of chemicals declined nearly nine, percent between 1993 and \n1994. Since the TRI began in 1988, overall chemical releases have \ndropped more than 44 percent. This decline is particularly impressive \nbecause it has occurred in tandem with economic growth. This is an \nenvironmental success story.\n  This successful reduction affirms that an approach to environmental \nprotection which encourages the participation of states and businesses \ncan and does work. It argues for a continuation of approaches to \nenvironmental protection that use voluntary solutions, technological \ninnovations and increased flexibility. As the report shows, we should \nhave confidence in this successful public policy strategy.\n  Unfortunately, though, these promising statistics have been ignored. \nThe TRI facts have not deterred the Clinton Administration from \nconsidering further burdens on America's society.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced that it plans \nto require businesses to file new extensive reports about how chemicals \nare used in the manufacturing process. This proposal is called \n``Materials Accounting,'' and it is flawed for several reasons.\n  First, the proposal to track materials would place a new and very \ncostly hardship on the business community. Initial estimates indicate \nthat the additional cost to our Nation's businesses in direct reporting \npaperwork costs alone could be as much as $800 million. In addition to \nbeing extremely costly, this proposal is completely at odds with the \nPresident's pledge in March 1995 to simplify and ease paperwork burdens \non American businesses.\n  I'm even reminded of the President's recent speech in Kalamazoo, MI, \nwhere he reaffirmed this goal to reduce administrative burdens. Well, \nfor me, nearly $1 billion is real money. It is a real cost for \nAmerica's business community. It is a real paperwork burden that cannot \nbe ignored.\n  Already TRI generates 80,000 reports per year. And, it takes EPA \nnearly 2 years to provide this existing information to the communities \nnearest to the facilities producing these reports. It seems very \nbasic--before EPA unilaterally increases the size of its two-inches \nthick report and further delays its publication, specific statutory \nauthority should be provided. The EPA's actions to expand it reporting \nrequirements are not authorized in law. How can EPA be responsive and \nconcerned about the risks faced by communities living near the \nreporting facilities, when it requires a 2-year detour of the data with \nits Washington bureaucrats?\n  Apart from the billion-dollar administrative cost, \nMaterials Accounting will jeopardize America's global competitiveness \nby putting our most innovative technologies at risk. Our country's \nposition in the world's economy is dependent upon the development of \nsuperior technology and the ability to protect that technology from \ncompetitors, both international and domestic. Information about the \namounts of chemicals used in and created during a production process \nwill provide competitors with access to trade secrets. This does not \nmake good business sense. In fact this seriously endangers the \nconfidentiality of proprietary business information which is essential \nin the marketplace.\n\n  Third, this approach would make sense only if substantial, tangible \nand quantified environmental benefits clearly exceeded the costs. \nHowever, I have seen no analysis which supports this premise. On the \ncontrary, I believe\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\nthe implementation of a Materials Accounting program will dilute the \nfocus of TRI by forcing businesses to commit finite resources to \ntrivial or even nonexistent risks, rather than more pressing, real \nrisks. It will also unnecessarily confuse citizens. This does not make \ngood policy sense. Chemical use is not directly related to information \na community must receive about the real risks faced from actual \nreleases from neighborhood facilities.\n  In my view, TRI should focus on telling the American public about the \nrisks directly associated with exposure to chemical releases. This was \nthe view of Congress back in 1988 when TRI was enacted. If EPA is \nlooking for a new mission, it should expand its public outreach efforts \nby the communication of risk information that is both meaningful and \nunderstandable.\n  EPA should undertake practical and timely risk communications which \nare locally based. Risk communication is the heart and soul of a \ncommunity's right-to-know. Reporting to citizens the number of pounds \nper year release of a certain chemical is neither valuable nor \nworthwhile information. It says nothing about potential risks to human \nhealth or the environment. Real risk depends on three factors: First, \ninherent toxicity of the material; second, its concentration; and \nthird, its location relative to humans. Unfortunately, this simple \nscientific formula has been ignored by EPA.\n  EPA also should stop trying to increase the number of chemicals on \nthe list without first ensuring that sound science-based criteria are \nin place. More listings without scientific criteria will not \nautomatically make a community safer. EPA must first have a clear \nunderstanding of the real exposure risk to avoid public confusion. EPA \nshould use the accepted basic risk formula.\n  Last, EPA does not have the statutory authority to collect and then \ndisseminate information about chemical use. The Emergency Planning and \nCommunity Right-to-Know Act explicitly states the types of information \nthat may be collected by EPA. While all this information bears an \nindirect relationship to potential releases and emissions, the Act does \nnot allow EPA to disperse sensitive chemical use information. This \nproposal, therefore, is well beyond the scope of the basic statute \nwhich established the TRI Program.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Congress considered the use aspect \nwhen the original program was created. And, chemical use was explicitly \nand consciously rejected.\n  ``Materials Accounting'' raises more questions than it answers.\n  Regulations are powerful, but they shift America's resources poorly. \nBecause regulations cause consumers and businesses to spend a good deal \nof their money in ways they do not freely choose, Congress must first \nconsider the consequences of this coerced spending before it becomes \nour public policy. A rule that has a $1 billion consequence is a rule \nthat deserves the attention of Congress.\n  With claims, counterclaims and even the withdrawal-of-claims that \nthere are growing risks from everything around us, it is even more \nimperative for every citizen to know where the true risks are coming \nfrom. I believe the American people want their elected officials to \nlook carefully into all aspects of environmental protection. The \nfollowing questions need to have a response in the public record:\n  (a) What benefit does the public derive from the publication of \nincomprehensible data on chemical use which has no correlation to risk \nfrom exposure?\n  (b) Would the public benefit more from a prioritization of ``worst \ncase'' emission risks to human health then use reporting?\n  (c) How will EPA protect the proprietary formulations that are a \nvaluable intellectual property?\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the administration's materials \naccounting approach has no statutory basis. It is also clear that it \nwill place an enormous burden on America's industrial communities. As a \nresult, American jobs will be sacrificed for questionable, even \nlimited, community environmental benefit.\n  It is clear to me that congressional action must precede any \nadministration action.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today, along with many of my Senate \ncolleagues who are committed to protecting and informing communities in \nour home States. We want to work on refining the policies which will \nupdate the TRI program. We want to make it truly responsive to the \ncommunities living nearest the facilities while preserving the right of \nbusinesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace.\n  I would like to pause and take a philosophical view for just a \nmoment. Let's step back from TRI and consider all regulations in \ngeneral. In the aggregate, regulatory compliance costs Americans around \n$670 billion every year--nearly 10 percent of our economy's GDP. This \nis substantial both in terms of dollars and percentage. This is why our \npublic policy must meet this challenge in a systematic, responsive and \nbalanced manner.\n  Basic fairness must be an integral part of the solution as Congress \nreviews and updates any regulation. Basic fairness should also be part \nof the equation used by the administration as it approaches new \ninitiatives. Basic fairness is the American way.\n  The focus of the issue must not be whether we need environmental \nprotection enforcement--of course we do. Rather we must look at how to \nachieve effective and appropriate environmental protection. Congress \nmust ensure that both the enforcement agencies and the regulated \ncommunity have incentives to encourage compliance. There must also be a \nmechanism for the agencies to prioritize environmental initiatives. \nAnd, of course, this process must respect our Bill of Rights.\n\n  I started today by reporting on TRI's success story, and the agency's \nresponse of adding more reports and more costs. This could undermine \nthe existing voluntary efforts of industry. I think everyone would \nagree that cooperative problem solving approaches work better than \nadversarial methods. The latter could even produce disdain and \nlawlessness.\n  I also started by saying that states deserve part of the credit for \nthe TRI success story. State governments have come a long way in terms \nof developing their own core levels of expertise. As regulations are \nupdated, Congress must recognize states as a genuine partner in \nprotecting our environment.\n  The wisdom of this is demonstrated in a separate but vital \nillustration of state ingenuity. Seventeen states, including my own \nstate of Mississippi, have developed a voluntary environmental audit \nprocess, and early indications are that the process is working. It is \nan alternative to the one-size-fits-all, Washington-expert, command-\nand-control methods mandated in the past. It is common sense, and it \nactually produces positive results for our environment at less cost. It \nrepresents basic fairness. This is what Congress ought to be \nadvocating.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by saying that Congress needs to \nturn the spotlight back to TRI's original intent. This can be achieved \nby having both Congress and the EPA answer one fundamental question: \nWhat chemical release information will be useful to people living near \nan industrial facility?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10832-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10833-S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH GABBARD\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, Kentucky and the Nation suffered a great \nloss last week with the passing of Mr. Ralph Gabbard. Ralph was a \nnationally known broadcast executive, serving as president of Gray \nCommunications. He was a leader in the television broadcast industry in \nmy State, and ultimately was a national leader as well. Ralph was at \nthe forefront of the industry's development in Kentucky for the better \npart of the last 30 years, including successful efforts to bring a \ntelevision station to the mountains of eastern Kentucky.\n  Among other things, he served as chairman of the CBS Affiliates \nAdvisory Board and the National Association of Broadcasters television \nboard. Most recently, Ralph played a significant role in industry \ndiscussions with the Clinton administration which led to the \nannouncement of steps to improve the quality of children's programming.\n  But beyond the long list of personal accomplishments, Ralph was \nprobably best known for his integrity, his honesty, and his common \ncourtesy in dealing with others. I was privileged to\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\ndeal with Ralph on more than one occasion, and had great respect and \ntrust in his abilities. He was a true asset for my State, and his \npresence will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask that two articles which recently appeared in the \nLexington Herald-Leader describing the life and accomplishments of \nRalph Gabbard be inserted into the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Nationally Known Broadcast Executive Rose From Kentucky Teen Disc \n                                 Jockey\n\n                         (By Jennifer Hewlett)\n\n       Ralph Gabbard, who rose from teen-age disc jockey to a TV \n     station executive in Lexington to a nationally known figure \n     in the broadcast industry, died while in Boston on a business \n     trip. He was 50.\n       Security workers at the Four Seasons Hotel found Mr. \n     Gabbard, president and board member of Gray Communications \n     Systems Inc., dead about 7 a.m. yesterday, apparently of a \n     heart attack, after he failed to answer a wake-up call, said \n     Bill Fielder, chief financial officer of Gray, who had dinner \n     with Mr. Gabbard Monday night.\n       Gray Communications, based in Georgia, owns several TV \n     stations, including WKYT (Channel 27) in Lexington and WYMT \n     (Channel 57) in Hazard.\n       Mr. Gabbard was perhaps best known for his affiliation with \n     the two Kentucky CBS-affiliated stations, where he spent much \n     of his career before moving up the industry ladder.\n       He was thought to have been the first person to do on-air \n     television editorials in the Lexington market. He also was \n     credited with bringing the people of the mountains of Eastern \n     Kentucky closer together through WYMT.\n       ``No one will disagree with this statement; no one can. \n     Ralph Gabbard defined and dominated this television market \n     for a quarter century. All you had to do with Ralph was \n     convince him something was necessary to be the best, to be \n     No. 1, and it was done,'' said Barry Peel, who covers state \n     government for WKYT's Frankfort bureau.\n       Peel said that Mr. Gabbard was instrumental in WKYT's \n     decision to outbid WLEX-TV (Channel 18) for the University of \n     Kentucky coaches' shows and the right to broadcast replays of \n     UK games. Some thought he was ``nuts'' because the high bid \n     initially lost money for the station. In the end, Channel \n     27's identity with UK sports has been a key to its dominance, \n     Peel said.\n       ``To be identified with UK sports is a major component of \n     image, and, let's face it, we're in the image business. He \n     knew that and time has proven him right,'' Peel said.\n       Mr. Gabbard recently stepped down as chairman of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters television board. He had \n     served as chairman of the CBS Affiliates Advisory Board, \n     which represents more than 200 CBS stations nationwide, and \n     was a member of the Network Affiliated Stations Alliance \n     Steering Committee, which represents more than 650 CBS, ABC \n     and NBC affiliates in congressional issues affecting \n     telecommunications.\n       He met with President Clinton in March to discuss \n     children's television.\n       ``Ralph was an exceptional person in so many ways. He was \n     an honest man with a real commitment to the business of \n     broadcasting and the audiences we serve,'' said Peter Lund, \n     president and chief executive officer of CBS Inc.\n       Mr. Gabbard also led the drive several years ago to \n     revitalize Renfro Valley in Rockcastle County, where many \n     country music stars had performed.\n       ``He had the vision of what Renfro Valley is today. It had \n     a special place in his heart,'' said Connie Hunt, vice \n     president of entertainment for the Renfro Valley \n     Entertainment Center.\n       Mr. Gabbard had grown up listening to country music and \n     even dabbled in writing songs, mostly lyrics. Two songs he \n     wrote or cowrote--``Lone Star Cafe'' and ``Please Play More \n     Kenny Rogers''--got on the country charts. The Rogers song \n     edged into the Top 40. He also wrote a song called ``I've \n     Always Wanted to Sing in Renfro Valley.''\n       J.P. Pennington of the musical group Exile, who had known \n     Mr. Gabbard since they were children, said that he and Mr. \n     Gabbard recently collaborated on two songs, ``Lovin' \n     Machine'' and ``Two-Heart Harmony.'' The first song they \n     wrote together at Pennington's house. Mr. Gabbard supplied \n     the title for the second song.\n       Mr. Gabbard was ``too shy'' to sing before an audience \n     himself, but ``he had definitely a keen musical sense about \n     him,'' Pennington said.\n\n\n                          broadcast executive\n\n       Mr. Gabbard had been president and general manager of \n     Kentucky Central Television Inc., which sold its holdings, \n     including the Kentucky stations, to Gray a couple of years \n     ago. Mr. Gabbard had tried to put together a group of people \n     to buy WKYT and WYMT, but they were outbid. He was named \n     president and chief executive officer of Gray Communications \n     Broadcast Group in September 1994, and president and board \n     member of Gray Communications Systems Inc. last December.\n       He was in Boston to meet with potential investors in an \n     effort to raise $150 million for Gray Communications to buy \n     John H. Phipps Inc. of Tallahassee, Fla., whose holdings \n     include TV stations in Tallahassee and Knoxville.\n       ``We've lost a very special friend, and most of us will \n     tell you that we lost a very special mentor,'' said Wayne \n     Martin, WKYT president and general manager. ``The loss is \n     significant to others beyond WKYT--he was nationally \n     recognized.''\n       Jim Jordan, a longtime friend and business associate, said: \n     ``It's a very sad day . . . he was the best broadcaster I \n     ever met, period.''\n       Jordan said that Mr. Gabbard had a great eye for spotting \n     on-air and management talent.\n       Cawood Ledford, former broadcast voice of the University of \n     Kentucky Wildcats, said: ``His word was as good as a contract \n     to me. I'll miss him tremendously as a personal friend.''\n       Ledford also said he always ``borrowed generously'' from \n     Mr. Gabbard when he was invited to give speeches. Mr. \n     Gabbard, he said, had a knack for remembering jokes, and when \n     Ledford was scheduled to give a speech, he often called Mr. \n     Gabbard to refresh his memory on jokes that Mr. Gabbard had \n     told him, then used them in his speeches.\n\n\n                             Spinning discs\n\n       Mr. Gabbard, a Berea native, was just a teenager when he \n     had his first disc jockey job. He was a disc jockey, \n     announcer and advertising salesman for WEKY-1340 AM in \n     Richmond and a disc jockey and sales manager at WRVK-AM in \n     Renfro Valley in the early to mid-1960s. He went on to become \n     an advertising salesman and announcer for Lexington's WVLK \n     radio and station manager of WEKY.\n       ``I loved being a disc jockey more than anything I ever \n     did, I guess. I got a charge out of talking to people and \n     having them respond,'' he said several years ago.\n       He said he got into broadcasting in 1963 by accident. A \n     high school teacher assigned students topics for speeches, \n     and Gabbard--who was a ``very average student''--got the \n     topic that was left over: radio.\n       He drove from Berea to a Richmond radio station to ask for \n     Associated press copy so he could practice reading.\n       The station had a young disc jockey named Ralph Hacker, who \n     told Mr. Gabbard the station was looking for an announcer. He \n     asked Mr. Gabbard to apply for the job.\n       Mr. Gabbard made an audition tape, and the station's \n     manager told him he was pretty bad, but the manager was \n     desperate for announcers and hired him anyway, he said in a \n     1987 interview.\n       He found his niche selling advertising.\n       After high school, he enrolled at Eastern Kentucky \n     University with the idea of becoming a pharmacist. But by the \n     end of his freshman year, he was making so much money selling \n     ads that he quit school.\n       After the series of radio jobs, Mr. Gabbard became general \n     sales manager of WKYT about 1970.\n       WKYT was struggling, Mr. Gabbard had said. His reaction was \n     to develop creative sales packages and market them \n     aggressively.\n       Later in the mid-1970s, he was promoted to vice president \n     and general manager of WKYT. The move made him the youngest \n     vice president and general manager of a top 100-market, \n     network-affiliated television station in the country.\n       The TV business was simple then, with just the three \n     commercial networks and Kentucky Educational Television. \n     Lexington didn't have an independent station.\n       As vice president and general manager, Mr. Gabbard hired \n     executives from outside the television industry because he \n     wanted people who would ``come in unprejudiced.'' He also put \n     more emphasis on news.\n       When Mr. Gabbard got WKYT on more solid ground, he turned \n     his attention to the mountains.\n       He was largely responsible for the opening of WYMT in \n     Hazard, a satellite station of WKYT. The purpose of the \n     Hazard station was to capture Eastern Kentucky audiences \n     previously reached by television stations in West Virginia \n     and other states, he said.\n       ``It stands for `We're your mountain television,' '' he \n     said in 1991.\n       After the first five years, the station still hadn't shown \n     a net profit but Mr. Gabbard maintained it was still a wise \n     investment.\n       ``It's good to be able to say, `There's a little crown \n     jewel sitting there that we're proud of,' '' he said.\n       He liked to say that WYMT had united Kentucky's mountain \n     communities.\n       ``Without Ralph Gabbard, there would be no 'YMT,'' said \n     Tony Turner, WYMT news director. ``It was his dream, his \n     idea. He mapped it out, and there were a lot of obstacles.''\n       Mr. Gabbard also went to Washington to urge Kentucky \n     congressmen and senators to promote legislation that would \n     discourage Eastern Kentucky cable systems from dropping KET.\n       He was a past president of the Kentucky Broadcasters \n     Association and received its most prestigious honor, the Al \n     Temple Award, in 1993.\n       He also had served on many boards, including local and \n     regional hospital boards, and the boards of the Chamber of \n     Commerce, Big Brothers, United Way and Boy Scouts. He was a \n     member of the Georgetown College board of trustees at his \n     death. He also was a member of the board of Host \n     Communications Inc. in Lexington.\n       Mr. Gabbard is survived by his wife, Jackie Upton Gabbard; \n     four sons, Joseph Marlon\n\n[[Page S10835]]\n\n     Gabbard, Jason Ralph Gabbard, James Matthew Gabbard and Jesse \n     Eden Gabbard; his mother, Maggie Eden Gabbard; and a sister, \n     Charlotte Moore, all of Lexington.\n       Services will be at 11 a.m. Friday at Calvary Baptist \n     Church in Lexington. Visitation will be from 1 to 4 p.m. and \n     from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursday at W.R. Milward Mortuary--Broadway. \n     Burial will be in Lexington Cemetery.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Ralph Gabbard Shaped and Expanded TV's Influence\n\n       Lexington broadcasting executive Ralph Gabbard was a bona \n     fide success story, rising from his Berea boyhood to a \n     position of national leadership in the television industry.\n       His untimely death this week at 50 leaves his many friends \n     and colleagues in shock, but the end of a life lived so fully \n     and energetically leaves an example worth heeding.\n       As the driving force behind WKYT-TV (Channel 27) in the \n     Lexington market, Mr. Gabbard realized early on that the \n     advent of cable TV was a threat--or perhaps an opportunity. \n     His response was typically savvy and creative.\n       Mr. Gabbard believed that his station would thrive the more \n     it stressed its local identity. Thus he built a strong news \n     team, became the TV flagship for University of Kentucky \n     sports and made sure that WKYT played a role in every \n     possible civic activity.\n       He extended this philosophy when WKYT bought and beefed up \n     its sister station in the mountains, WYMT-TV. The stations \n     enhanced each other naturally, giving each a toehold exactly \n     where needed, and extending their company's influence \n     throughout Kentucky.\n       By serving his community and region the best way he knew, \n     Mr. Gabbard also bolstered a thriving business. He had been \n     the station's president and general manager when it was part \n     of the old Garvice Kincaid empire, and when WKYT was sold to \n     Gray Communications Inc. in 1994, he was named president of \n     the new parent company.\n       By then, Mr. Gabbard was a respected national figure in the \n     TV industry, a true accomplishment for someone outside the \n     big-city markets. He served as chairman of the CBS-TV \n     affiliates and was a director of the National Association of \n     Broadcasters.\n       Mr. Gabbard played a key role in the recent compromise \n     between the TV industry and the Clinton administration to \n     improve children's programming.\n       Throughout his career, Mr. Gabbard forged ahead with \n     boldness, tenacity and innovation. He treated the Lexington \n     TV market as if it were in the big leagues, and that's where \n     he ultimately put himself.\n       That's a notable legacy and the reason that Ralph Gabbard \n     will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10833-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE SCHEPKER'S ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families \ncontribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples \nmarried today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it \nis both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the \ncommitment of till death us do part seriously, demonstrating \nsuccessfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. \nThese characteristics make our country strong. For these important \nreasons, I rise today to honor Jacob and Sophie Schepker of St. Louis, \nMO, who on August 10, 1996, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. \nMy wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a \nsimilar milestone. Jacob and Sophie's commitment to the principles and \nvalues of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10835-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTELLIGENCE REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1718, the \nintelligence reauthorization bill, with the understanding that one \ninequity contained in the bill will be corrected in conference.\n  The bill in its current form contains what I believe is an \ninappropriate encroachment on the authority of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to staff its position of Assistant Director, National \nSecurity Division.\n  The current bill requires that the FBI consult with the DCI prior to \nthis appointment. The FBI, like any other agency, should be vested with \nthe sound discretion to fill its ranks in a manner that is not burdened \nby outside Agency influence. I perceive this proposed requirement as an \ninfringement by the foreign intelligence community upon domestic law \nenforcement.\n  I recognize that, with respect to the FBI's National Security \nDivision, there is some overlap between intelligence and law \nenforcement, but that alone does not justify the necessity of this \nmeasure. Let's not place an unnecessary check upon the FBI by imposing \nthis additional requirement.\n  Remember, it was the National Security Division which, \nnotwithstanding bureaucratic hostility within the CIA, vigorously \npursued the Aldrich Ames case. How zealous will future NSD higher ups \nbe if they feel their career may turn on CIA approval?\n  I urge each of you to support language which we have negotiated with \nthe Intelligence Committee and the administration, which deletes the \nrequirement that the FBI Director consult with the DCI prior to the \nappointment of its Assistant Director, National Security Division.\n  Replacing this requirement is a provision whereby the FBI Director \nnotifies the DCI of its selection to this vital position. The DCI may \nthen, but is not required, to consult with the FBI Director concerning \nthe selection.\n  It is my belief that this provision more clearly recognizes the \nseparate and distinct missions, as well as the differing standards by \nwhich the intelligence and law enforcement communities must operate. I \nurge each of my colleagues to endorse this proposed change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10835-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MARY SINGLETARY TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my birthday wishes \nto Mrs. Mary Singletary Taylor, a native of Henry County, AL. She was \nborn 98 years ago today--September 18, 1898. I understand that with the \nexception of some hearing loss, Mrs. Taylor is in good shape and still \nreads the Dothan Eagle newspaper each morning before working on her \ntatting. She calls her tatting, which is a handmade lace and somewhat \nof a lost art, her therapy.\n  Mary's parents were W.B. and LaNora Singletary and her husband was \nJasper Taylor, a farmer. Her niece is our own LaRose Taylor Shirley, \nwho most of us know as a 16-year member of the U.S. Capitol Police \nForce. LaRose also hails from Henry County, which is located in the \nsoutheastern corner of Alabama.\n  Mary S. Taylor was a lifelong resident of Newville, AL, in Henry \nCounty, and now resides in the Henry County Nursing Home in Abbeville. \nShe attended a one-room school in Caps, AL, until she finished the \nfifth grade and then transferred to the Abbeville Normal School, where \nshe completed her education. She was an active and dedicated member of \nthe Tolbert Baptist Church for approximately 70 wonderful years.\n  Mary was a homemaker and was known far and wide as an excellent and \ntalented seamstress. She was especially known for her handmade baby \nclothes and her tatting.\n  I am pleased to congratulate Mrs. Taylor for reaching this milestone \nin her life and wish her many, many more happy birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10835-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10835-S10836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 533.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against tax for employers who provide childcare assistance for \ndependents of their employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                   the child care infrastructure act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as we reach the end of the 104th \nCongress, we can be proud of the business we have finished, and we \nshould look forward to finishing the business we have just begun. In \nthat spirit, I introduce the Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996--a \ntax credit designed to encourage employers to increase the supply of \nquality child care by providing it to their employees.\n  My bill responds to the challenges presented by the landmark welfare \nlegislation recently enacted. And it responds to the fundamental \nchanges in the American economy that have led to parents entering the \nworkforce in record numbers.\n  Already in my State of Wisconsin, 67 percent of the women with \nchildren under 6 are in the workforce, yet there is only 1 accredited \nchild care center for every 2,800 of these kids. Wisconsin has 6,500 \nchildren from 4,000 families on waiting lists for child care. What is \nmost amazing is that Wisconsin, even with this sort of supply \nbottleneck, is considered by many to be one of the best States in which \nto find quality child care.\n  With the advent of welfare reform, and the movement of more mothers \nof young children into the workforce, the shortage of good child care \nwill only get worse. Conservative estimates show that at least 8,000 \nnew, full-time child care slots will be needed in Milwaukee County \nalone to provide for the children of welfare mothers moving into work.\n  Quality child care is the answer on many levels to the challenges of \nan economy fueled more and more by working parents. Safe child care is \nthe link that makes it possible for welfare mothers to move from \ndependency to a decent job. Stimulating child care gives our youngest \nchildren a leg up on a lifetime of learning. Employer-provided child \ncare gives working parents the peace of mind to perform their jobs \nwell.\n  The Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996 creates a tax credit for \nemployers who get involved in increasing the supply of quality child \ncare. The credit goes to employers who engage in activities like: \nbuilding and subsidizing an entire child care center, reserving slots \nin a child care center for employees, or contracting with a resource \nand referral agency to provide services such as placement or the design \nof a family day care network to employees. The credit is designed so \nthat any company --small or large--has an incentive to get involved in \nthe provision of quality child care to its employees.\n  The credit is limited to 50 percent of $150,000 per year. The credit \nwill sunset after 3 years. With this legislation, I want to encourage \ncompanies to consider providing child care as an employee benefit. \nHowever, I believe, and study after study has shown, that once a \ncompany offers this benefit, they will want to continue it even without \na tax write-off. That is because companies that provide child care find \ntheir workers stay in their jobs longer (cutting training costs), have \nhigher morale, work harder, and take less sick leave.\n  I had the opportunity during the August recess to visit Quad \nGraphics, a large printing firm in Wisconsin that is known for its \nprovision of quality child care to its employees through on-site child \ncare centers. Quad Graphics is one of Working Mothers magazine's ``100 \nBest Companies''--primarily because of the quality of its on-site child \ncare centers. Talking to the parents of children at one of those \ncenters--seeing the happy and healthy children greeting their parents \non their breaks and at lunch--was all the evidence I needed to convince \nme that we ought to be encouraging this sort of corporate involvement \nnationwide. Their 24 hour facility improves the company's bottom line--\nQuad Graphics is able to attract and retain dedicated employees who \nwant a job that allows them to be near their children. And that day \ncare center improves the participating families' bottom line as well--\nmany parents I spoke with told me they would not be able to work, or to \nwork well, if they had to worry each day about whether their children \nwere cared for, safe, and happy.\n\n  The 21st century economy will be one in which more of us are working, \nand more of us are trying to balance work and family. How well we \nadjust to that balance will determine how strong we are as an economy \nand as a nation of families. My legislation is an attempt to encourage \nbusinesses to play an active role in this deeply important transition.\n  In the 1950's, Federal, State, local governments, communities and \nbusinesses banded together to build a highway system that is the most \nimpressive in the world. Those roads allowed our economy to flourish \nand our people to move safely and quickly to work. In the 1990's, we \nneed the same sort of national, comprehensive effort to build safe and \naffordable child care for our children. As more and more parents--of \nall income levels--move into the work force, they need access to \nquality child care just as much as their parents needed quality \nhighways to drive to work. And if we are successful--and I plan to be \nsuccessful--in the 21st century excellent child care--like the care \nthese kids are getting--will be as common as interstate highways.\n  Child care is an investment that is good for children, good for \nbusiness, good for our States, and good for the Nation. We need to \ninvolve every level of government--and private communities and private \nbusinesses--in building a child care infrastructure that is the best in \nthe world. My legislation is a first, essential step toward this end.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation and a section-by-section summary be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Allowance of Credit for Employer Expenses for Child Care \n                               Assistance\n\n       This section adds a new business related credit called the \n     ``employer-provided child care credit.'' The credit is set at \n     50 percent of eligible expenditures up to a limit of $150,000 \n     per taxpayer per tax year. Qualified expenditures mean \n     amounts spent to: build, rehabilitate or expand a qualified \n     child care facility for the taxpayer's employees; to \n     subsidize the operating costs of such a facility; to contract \n     with a child care facility to provide services for the \n     taxpayer's employees; and to contract with a resource and \n     referral service for the taxpayers' employees. The tax credit \n     will not be available to build, rehabilitate, or expand a \n     child care facility if that facility is also the home of the \n     taxpayer or one of the taxpayer's employees.\n       A child care facility is considered ``qualified'' if its \n     principle use is to provide dependent care assistance, and if \n     the facility meets all applicable state licensing \n     requirements and other regulations. If the facility is a \n     family day care center located in a home, i.e., if the \n     facility is the primary residence of the operator of the \n     facility, then the requirement that the facility's principle \n     use be as a dependent care center is waived.\n       A facility also will not be treated as ``qualified'' unless \n     enrollment is open to employees of the taxpayer, and unless \n     the facility does not discriminate in favor of highly \n     compensated employees. A taxpayer whose primary business is \n     the provision of dependent care assistance will not be \n     eligible for the credit unless the taxpayer's investment is \n     in a facility in which 30 percent of the enrollees are \n     dependents of employees of the taxpayer. The provision was \n     added to ensure that for-profit day care centers would not be \n     eligible for a tax credit simply for engaging in their \n     primary business by building a center. They will, however, be \n     eligible if they build a center chiefly for the children of \n     their employees.\n       Under a set of recapture rules, a taxpayer who invests in a \n     facility that ceases activity or changes ownership in less \n     than ten years will have some of his or her credit clawed \n     back. The applicable recapture percentage ranges from 100 \n     percent in years 1 through 3 of the center's operation to 10 \n     percent in years 9 and 10.\n       The credit will be in effect beginning after December 21, \n     1996 and sunset on December 31, 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 2089. A bill to transfer land administered by the Bureau of Land \nManagement to the States in which the land is located; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 Bureau of Land Management Legislation\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation that \nwould transfer the lands controlled by the Bureau of Land Management \n[BLM] to the States. This bill is similar to legislation I introduced \nin the Senate last year, but has a number of very important changes \ndesigned to improve the measure and ensure these public lands remain in \npublic hands. In addition, the measure also protects access to these \nlands after they are transferred\n\n[[Page S10840]]\n\nto ensure that multiple use activities will continue on them when they \nbecome State property.\n  After I introduced S. 1031 last year, some folks misleadingly claimed \nmy legislation would allow the States to selloff the lands that were \ntransferred to them and give them to the highest bidder. False claims \nwere also made that access to these lands for hunting, fishing, and \nrecreation would be limited. These attacks may have played well with \nthe environmental community, unfortunately they have nothing to do with \nthe truth about this effort.\n  Currently, the BLM controls nearly 270 million acres of land in the \nUnited States. The agency administers over 18 million acres of land in \nWyoming and much more in other Western States. This landownership \npattern puts a heavy burden on the people of Wyoming and throughout the \nWest and affects our economy and communities across the West. The bill \nI am introducing today would ensure that these lands remain public--\nonly administered by the States rather than the Federal Government. It \nis also important to note that this bill only deals with lands \nadministered by the BLM. This legislation would do nothing to alter the \nmanagement of our national parks, national forests, or wilderness \nareas.\n  Let me be clear, I believe strongly that the State governments can do \na much better job of managing the BLM lands in their States. \nTransferring these lands to the States is a common-sense approach to \nbring public management of these areas closer to local people. However, \nI also feel strongly that these lands should remain public and \navailable to folks for a variety of uses. The key is to allow local \npeople to make decisions regarding management of these public resources \nrather than bureaucrats in Washington, DC.\n  The principle behind my efforts to transfer the BLM lands is to give \nlocal people the opportunity to have real input into how these areas \nare managed. It has never been the intent of any supporters of this \nlegislation to privatize or restrict access to these public lands. \nAlthough the opponents of this bill use every scare tactic imaginable, \nthe real issue regarding my legislation is whether you believe land \nmanagement decisions can be made better by folks in Washington or \nCheyenne? This is not a question about making public lands private, \nthis is a question about fairness and who can do a better job of \nlistening to the concerns of local people.\n  I trust the people of Wyoming and the other States to make the proper \ndecisions for themselves. Hopefully, the legislation I introduce today \nwill allow us to begin focusing on the real questions in this matter, \nrather than the attacks and half-truths used by the opponents of my \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n\n  S. 2090. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain land in the \nState of California to the Hoopa Valley Tribe; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE HOOPA VALLEY RESERVATION SOUTH BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would allow the Hoopa Valley Tribe to obtain lands of \ndeep cultural and historical significance.\n  The Hoopa Valley Tribe has resided in Hoopa Valley, beginning at the \nmouth of the Trinity River Canyon in Humbolt County for 10,000 years. \nIn the 1950s, a settlement agreement between the Hoopa Valley Tribe and \nthe United States Government designated a 12-by-12 mile area for the \nHoopa Valley Reservation. When this land was surveyed and demarcated, a \n``dog-leg'' was created along the southern boundary which omitted \ncertain lands the Tribe has deemed culturally and religiously \nsignificant.\n  My legislation will remedy this situation by transferring 2,641 acres \nof the Six Rivers National Forest to the Hoopa Valley Tribe. I join the \nUnited States Forest Service in commending the Hoopa Valley Tribe for \nits history of natural resource management and expertise. This \nlegislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in California and in the \nHouse, where it was sponsored by Congressman Frank Riggs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, so that we can quickly \nprovide the Hoopa Valley Tribe with lands necessary to maintain their \ncultural and religious heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. HARKIN):\n  S. 2091. A bill to provide for small business and agriculture \nregulatory relief; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n  The Small Business and Farm Transportation Regulatory Relief Act of \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small \nBusiness and Farm Transportation Regulatory Relief Act of 1996. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Harkin. This legislation \nis designed to address transportation and economic concerns raised \nrecently by the agriculture community and small business owners and \noperators. These concerns stem from a U.S. Department of Transportation \n[DOT] proposal to apply Federal hazardous materials regulations to \nintrastate commerce. Let me explain.\n  Since 1987, a rulemaking has been underway at DOT to fully impose \nFederal hazardous materials regulations on intrastate commerce. The \nintent is to achieve compatibility between Federal and State hazardous \nmaterials transportation regulations. If implemented as currently \nplanned, however, farmers and agriculture retailers could face new \ncosts and regulatory burdens.\n  Mr. President, I understand the rationale behind DOT's push for \nuniformity in hazardous materials regulations. Indeed, the Congress has \na lengthy record promoting Federal and State compatibility of motor \ncarrier and hazardous materials transportation regulations. However, \nthe legitimate need for exceptions to these regulations should not be \nignored.\n  States have already achieved general compatibility with Federal \nhazardous materials regulations. In doing so, some agricultural States \nhave also provided limited regulatory exemptions in this area to \nfarmers and retailers. These exceptions are due to the seasonal nature \nof the planting and harvesting seasons associated with a farmer's work \nand the minimal risk associated with the transport of agricultural \nproduction materials.\n  For example, the very nature of a farmer's work requires the use of \nfuel, fertilizers, and pesticides. These products are transported from \nretail sites to farm and from farm to field, primarily on sparsely \ntraveled roads. Have these exceptions from stringent hazardous \nmaterials regulations jeopardized safety? No. The record is clear. \nPublic safety has not been adversely affected by farmers doing their \njobs free of regulatory burdens.\n  Mr. President, the agriculture industry has worked to explain its \nposition to DOT throughout the public comment periods. Unfortunately, \nwe cannot be sure to what extent DOT will address these concerns until \nthe rule is final. Waiting until then could be too late. Congressional \naction is necessary to prevent unnecessary regulations and economic \nburdens on our farmers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would ensure States are \nallowed to maintain existing exceptions for farmers and agribusinesses. \nIt also ensures States can continue to grant targeted exceptions for \nfarmers in the future, as long as such exceptions will not adversely \nimpact public safety.\n\n  In addition to addressing farm-related transportation concerns, this \nlegislation would also streamline regulatory requirements for small \nbusiness operators. It is based on a DOT supplemental notice of \nproposed rulemaking, Docket No. HM 200, issued March 20, 1996.\n  The DOT proposal would, in part, exempt certain quantities and types \nof hazardous materials from regulations concerning their transport. \nThese so-called materials of trade are often the types of products used \nby small businesses across our country. Because transporting these \nsmall quantities of materials pose minimal risks to public safety and \nproperty, DOT is correctly proposing to lift the stringent hazardous \nmaterials transportation regulations currently imposed on operators. In \nmy view, and the view of many others, DOT is on the right track. \nHowever, Congress should ensure DOT stays on that track.\n  According to DOT officials, the rulemaking is expected to be \ncompleted by the end of this year. But there is no firm deadline. Given \nthis issue has been part of the rulemaking under consideration for the \npast 10 years, many small\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\nbusiness owners are skeptical about DOT meeting its target date. \nIndeed, there is no legal assurance that DOT will finish what it has \nstarted. After all, Federal agencies are known to miss target dates for \ncompleting rulemakings or implementing regulations. DOT is no \nexception.\n  Small business owners have no way of knowing when or if the proposed \nmaterials of trade regulatory exceptions will be a reality. Therefore, \nwe are introducing legislation today to address this uncertainty and \nimpose a needed congressional directive. This bill would establish a \ndeadline for DOT and help ensure unnecessary regulatory burdens on \nsmall business owners are lifted in a timely manner. The deadline for \nDOT to complete the small business exception final rule would be \nDecember 31, 1996. That is the same date DOT announced as its target.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts going on in the \nother body to address the concerns I have just outlined. \nRepresentatives DeLay, Ewing, Buyer, and Poshard have been working on \nlegislative measures very similar to the proposal Senator Harkin and I \nare introducing. We share a common goal. Sound transportation and \npolicy cannot be achieved by a one-size-fits-all approach.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in sponsoring this very important and \nnecessary legislation and urge its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10838-1", "month": "09", "year":

\non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.Res. 295\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, 184,300 \n     women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, and \n     44,300 women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about 2,000,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease than a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives; and\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     of up to 2 years or more before regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination (BSE), savings as many \n     as 30 percent more lives: Now, therefore, be it.\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates October 18, 1996, as \n     ``National Mammography Day''. The Senate requests that the \n     President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the \n     United States to observe such day with appropriate programs \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I submit a resolution designating October \n18, 1996 as National Mammography Day.\n  Over the course of the past 3 years, I have submitted resolutions \nthat designate a special day to encourage women to get mammograms as \npart of the early detection process in the fight against breast cancer. \nHistorically this day has been designated as October 19, but because it \nfalls on a Saturday this year, October 18 will be National Mammography \nDay.\n  In 1992 and 1993 a joint resolution was adopted by the Congress and \nsigned into law by the President. And, last year, even though the House \nrefused to take up commemoratives, this resolution was approved by the \nSenate. I feel that the Senate should again go on record to continue to \neducate and raise the consciousness about the importance of early \ndetection and the value of mammography.\n  Mr. President, according to the American Cancer Society, national \nfigures on breast cancer indicate that, in 1996 alone, 184,300 women \nwill be diagnosed with breast cancer. Forty-four thousand three hundred \nwomen will succumb to this disease.\n  My home State of Delaware still ranks among the worst in breast \ncancer mortality among the 50 states, with an estimated 660 new breast \ncancer cases and over 160 breast cancer deaths for 1996.\n  Although a cure for breast cancer may be some time away, early \ndetection and treatment are crucial to ensure survival. Studies have \nshown and experts agree, that mammography is\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\none of the best methods to detect breast cancer in its early stages. \nMammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to 2 years \nbefore regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-examinations \n[BSE], saving as many as a third more lives of those diagnosed with the \ndisease.\n  With 50 percent of the breast cancer cases occurring in women over \nage 65, no women can be considered immune from the disease; in fact, at \nleast 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have no family \nhistory of the disease.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today sets aside 1 day \nin the midst of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month to encourage \nwomen to receive or sign up for a mammogram, as well as to bring about \ngreater awareness and understanding of one of the key components in \nfighting this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10841-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10842-S10843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            THE FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 5368\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1994) to amend \ntitle 49, United States Code, to reauthorize programs of the Federal \nAviation Administration, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 119, line 1, strike all after ``activities'', \n     through ``collections'' on line 2.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BRYAN AMENDMENT NO. 5369\n\n  Mr. BRYAN proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1994, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

For a fishery for which there \n     was a fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996 that \n     did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as of \n     that date, the authority provided by this subparagraph \n     applies only if the Council approves the delegation of \n     management of the fishery to the State by a three-quarters \n     majority vote of the voting members of the Council.\n       ``(C) The fishing vessel is not registered under the law of \n     the State of Alaska and is operating in a fishery in the \n     exclusive economic zone off Alaska for which there was no \n     fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996, and the \n     Secretary and the North Pacific Council find that there is a \n     legitimate interest of the State of Alaska in the \n     conservation and management of such fishery.

Mr. President, as a member of the Greek Orthodox \nfaith, I would like to join my colleagues and so many other Americans \nin honoring the enthronement for His Eminence Metropolitan Spyridon to \nbecome the fifth Archbishop of America since the establishment in 1922 \nof the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America. The \nChristian Orthodox faith, under the spiritual guidance of the \nEcumenical Patriarch, is one of the world's great religions. It traces \nits roots to the original Holy Apostles, and today includes over 250 \nmillion faithful worldwide.\n  Archbishop Spyridon's enthronement this Saturday, September 21, at \nthe Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York City, is an \nhistoric occasion. This event, coming after the long and venerated \nreign of Archbishop Iakovos, is a hallowed symbol of the Church's \ncontinuity in the Americas under the spiritual guidance and \njurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. At the same time, this \nsacred event demonstrates the growth and maturation of the Greek \nOrthodox Church in our hemisphere, with the enthronement of the first \nArchbishop born and raised within the Archdiocese of North and South \nAmerica.\n  Archbishop Spyridon, the son of Clara and the late Dr. Constantine \nPapageorge, was born in Warren, OH, on September 24, 1944. He attended \nschool in the United States, and graduated from high school in Tarpon \nSprings, FL.\n  Archbishop Spyridon then went on to study at the renowned Theological \nSchool of Halki in Turkey, where he graduated in 1966 with highest \nhonors. Until closed by the Turkish Government in 1971, this was the \nonly theological school maintained by the Christian Orthodox Ecumenical \nPatriarchate. The Halki Theological School, if it were still in \noperation, would last year have celebrated its 150th anniversary. \nArchbishop Spyridon undertook subsequent postgraduate studies at the \nUniversity of Geneva in Switzerland and at the Bochum University in \nGermany.\n  Since finishing his education, Archbishop Spyridon undertook high \nreligious missions in a variety of locales. Early in his career, he \nserved as secretary of the Ecumenical Patriarchate delegation to the \nWorld Council of Churches, as secretary of the Orthodox Center of the \nEcumenical Patriarchate at Chambesy in Geneva, and as dean of the Greek \nOrthodox Community of St. Andrew in Rome. In 1985 the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate selected him titular bishop of Apamea and assigned him as \nthe auxiliary bishop to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Austria and \nExarchate of Italy. In 1991 the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate elected Spyridon as the first Metropolitan for the newly \ncreated Archdiocese of Italy and Exarchate of Southern Europe.\n  Mr. President, these are just the highlights of service so far of \nthis tremendously skilled, youthful and devoted man of faith, a man who \nis fluent in Greek, French, Italian, German, and, of course, English. \nNow he will bring his energy and experiences to his new calling as \nArchbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South \nAmerica, where, in America alone, he will preside over 550 Greek \nOrthodox parishes, with over 1.5 million members.\n  I again wish to add my voice to all those honoring Archbishop \nSpyridon at the time of his enthronement. This is, of course, a time \nfor celebration and prayer. But it is also a time for welcoming the \nArchbishop home after his decades of service to the faith throughout \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10868-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10868-S10869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EVOLUTION OF A PLATFORM PLANK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few, brief \ncomments about the evolution of the welfare plank in the Democratic \nParty's national platform for the coming election.\n\n\n                          July 8: First Draft\n\n  Staff members of the Democratic National Committee wrote the initial \ndraft of the party platform. The document was dated July 8, 1996, and \ncontained the following plank on welfare:\n\n       Welfare Reform. There is no greater gap between mainstream \n     American values and modern American government than our \n     failed welfare system. When Bill Clinton became President, \n     the welfare system undermined the very values--work, family, \n     and, especially, personal responsibility--that it should \n     promote. Over the past four years, President Clinton--without \n     help from Congress--has dramatically transformed the welfare \n     system. He has freed 40 states from federal rules and \n     regulations so they can reform their welfare systems. The \n     Clinton Administration has granted [70] waivers--more than \n     twice as many waivers as granted in the Reagan-Bush years. \n     For 75 percent of all Americans on welfare, the rules have \n     changed for good, and welfare is becoming what it should be: \n     a second chance, not a way of life. Welfare rolls are finally \n     coming down--there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare \n     today than there were in 1992.\n       The President has also taken strong executive action to \n     make sure that the welfare system strengthens families and \n     demands responsibility. He ordered states to require minor \n     mothers to stay in school and turn their lives around so they \n     can get a job and get off welfare for good. He also ordered \n     states to require mothers to name the father of their \n     children before they can get welfare, so we can find those \n     fathers and make them pay the child support they owe.\n       Now we must finish the job. We should pass national welfare \n     reform to end welfare as we know it across America. \n     Unfortunately, the plan proposed by Senator Dole and Speaker \n     Gingrich was weak on work and tough on children. That's the \n     wrong approach. We should be tough on work and demand \n     responsibility, but we shouldn't punish children for their \n     parents' mistakes. A real bipartisan welfare reform plan \n     should require that anyone on welfare who can work, goes to \n     work. And we should provide child care and health care so \n     parents can work. We should impose strict time limits so that \n     no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. We should \n     require minor mothers to live with their parents or another \n     responsible adult.\n\n\n          July 26: Initial Draft Revised by Drafting Committee\n\n  The initial draft was sent to members of the drafting committee, \nchaired by Georgia Gov. Zell Miller. The 15 members of the drafting \ncommittee met on July 11 in Kansas City to revise the initial draft. On \nJuly 26, the drafting committee issued its revised draft of the \nplatform and sent it to the members of the platform committee. The \nrevised welfare plank was slightly longer, but contained essentially \nthe same language as the first version:\n\n       Welfare reform. Today's Democratic Party knows there is no \n     greater gap between mainstream American values and modern \n     American government than our failed welfare system. When Bill \n     Clinton became President, the welfare system undermined the \n     very values--work, family, and personal responsibility--that \n     it should promote. The welfare system should reflect those \n     values: we want to help people who want to help themselves \n     and their children.\n       Over the past 4 years, President Clinton--acting alone--has \n     dramatically transformed the welfare system. He has freed 41 \n     states from federal rules and regulations so they\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\n     can reform their welfare systems. The Clinton Administration \n     has granted 69 waivers--more than twice as many waivers as \n     granted in the Reagan-Bush years. For 75 percent of all \n     Americans on welfare, the rules have changed for good \n     already, and welfare is becoming what it should be: a second \n     chance, not a way of life. Welfare rolls are finally coming \n     down--there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare today \n     than there were when President Clinton took office in January \n     1993.\n       The President has also taken strong executive action to \n     make sure that the welfare system strengthens families and \n     demands responsibility. He ordered states to require minor \n     mothers to stay in school and turn their lives around so they \n     can get a job and get off welfare for good. He also directed \n     states to require mothers to help identify and find absent \n     fathers so we can make them pay the child support they owe. \n     He challenged all states to require teen mothers to live at \n     home or with a responsible adult. And the President fought to \n     make sure that poor children get health care and nutrition to \n     meet their basic needs.\n       Now we must finish the job, and pass national welfare \n     reform. Unfortunately, the plan proposed by Senator Dole and \n     Speaker Gingrich was weak on work and tough on children. That \n     is the wrong approach. We should be tough on work and demand \n     responsibility, but we should not punish children for their \n     parents' mistakes. A real bipartisan welfare reform plan \n     should require that, anyone on welfare who can work, goes to \n     work. And we should provide child care and health care so \n     parents can work. We should impose strict time limits so that \n     no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. We should \n     require minor mothers to live with their parents or another \n     responsible adult. If the Republican Party puts politics \n     aside, we can finish the job President Clinton started, and \n     end welfare as we know it across America. Passing legislation \n     is not enough; we should make sure people get the skills they \n     need to get jobs, and that there are jobs for them to go to \n     so they leave welfare and stay off. Welfare reform should put \n     more people to work and move them into the economic \n     mainstream, not take jobs away from working families.\n\n\n              July 31-August 4: DNC Staff Change Platform\n\n  The President announced on July 31 that he would sign the Dole-\nGingrich welfare plan into law--which he did on August 22. Democratic \nNational Committee staff thereupon revised the platform plank on \nwelfare to reflect the President's newly announced intentions. The \nplatform plank on welfare, which previously denounced the legislation \nCongress had passed, now endorsed it.\n\n\n                    August 5: Final Platform Issued\n\n  The full platform committee met in Pittsburgh, PA on August 5 and \napproved the changes to the Kansas City draft. The new platform plank \non welfare, as changed by DNC staff, was nearly identical to the final \nversion approved by the convention delegates in Chicago on August 27 \nwith the exception of one sentence noted below which was formally added \nas an amendment during the Pittsburgh session. The new plank reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Welfare reform. Today's Democratic Party knows there is no \n     greater gap between mainstream American values and modern \n     American government than our failed welfare system. When Bill \n     Clinton became President, the welfare system undermined the \n     very values--work, family, and personal responsibility--that \n     it should promote. The welfare system should reflect those \n     values: we want to help people who want to help themselves \n     and their children.\n       Over the past 4 years, President Clinton has dramatically \n     transformed the welfare system. He has freed 41 states from \n     federal rules and regulations so they can reform their \n     welfare systems. The Clinton Administration has granted 69 \n     waivers--more than twice as many waivers as granted in the \n     Reagan-Bush years. For 75 percent of all Americans on \n     welfare, the rules have changed for good already, and \n     welfare is becoming what it should be: a second chance, \n     not a way of life. Welfare rolls are finally coming down \n     --there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare today than \n     there were when President Clinton took office in January \n     1993.\n       Now, because of the President's leadership and with the \n     support of a majority of the Democrats in Congress, national \n     welfare reform is going to make work and responsibility the \n     law of the land. Thanks to President Clinton and the \n     Democrats, the new welfare bill includes the health care and \n     child care people need so they can go to work confident their \n     children will be cared for. Thanks to President Clinton and \n     the Democrats, the new welfare bill imposes time limits and \n     real work requirements--so anyone who can work, does work, \n     and so that no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. \n     Thanks to President Clinton and the Democrats, the new \n     welfare bill cracks down on deadbeat parents and requires \n     minor mothers to live at home with their parents or with \n     another responsible adult.\n       We are proud the President forced Congressional Republicans \n     to abandon their wrong-headed and mean-spirited efforts to \n     punish the poor. Republicans wanted to eliminate the \n     guarantee of health care for the poor, the elderly, and the \n     disabled. They were wrong, and we stopped them. Republicans \n     wanted to destroy the food stamp and school lunch programs \n     that provide basic nutrition to millions of working families \n     and poor children. They were wrong, and we stopped them. \n     Republicans wanted to gut child abuse prevention and foster \n     care. They were wrong, and we stopped them. Republicans \n     wanted to cut off young, unwed mothers--because they actually \n     thought their children would be better off living in an \n     orphanage. They were dead wrong, and we stopped them. The \n     bill Republicans in Congress passed last year was values-\n     backward--it was soft on work and tough on children, and we \n     applaud the President for stopping it.\n       We know the new bill passed by Congress is far from \n     perfect--parts of it should be fixed because they go too far \n     and have nothing to do with welfare reform. First, \n     Republicans cut too far into nutritional assistance for \n     working families with children; we are committed to \n     correcting that. Second, Republicans insisted on using \n     welfare reform as a vehicle to cut off help to legal \n     immigrants. That was wrong. Legal immigrants work hard, pay \n     their taxes, and serve America. It is wrong to single them \n     out for punishment just because they are immigrants. We \n     pledge to make sure that legal immigrant families with \n     children who fall on hard times through no fault of their own \n     can get help when they need it. And we are committed to \n     continuing the President's efforts to make it easier for \n     legal immigrants who are prepared to accept the \n     responsibilities of citizenship to do so.\n       But the new welfare plan gives America an historic chance: \n     to break the cycle of dependency for millions of Americans, \n     and give them a real chance for an independent future. It \n     reflects the principles the President has insisted upon since \n     he started the process that led to welfare reform. Our job \n     now is to make sure this welfare reform plan succeeds, \n     transforming a broken system that holds people down into a \n     working system that lifts people up and gives them a real \n     chance to build a better life.\n       States asked for this responsibility--now we have to make \n     sure they shoulder it. We must make sure as many people as \n     possible move from welfare to work. We must make sure that \n     children are protected. In addition to health care and \n     nutritional assistance, states should provide in-kind \n     vouchers to children whose parents have reached the time \n     limit. We challenge states to exempt battered women from time \n     limits and other restrictions. [We challenge states to ensure \n     that hard-earned, federal taxpayer dollars are spent \n     effectively and fraud and abuse are prevented.] (The \n     preceding sentence was added as an amendment to the platform \n     during the Pittsburgh meeting.) We challenge the business \n     community to provide more of the private sector jobs people \n     on welfare need to build good lives and strong families. We \n     know that passing legislation is not enough; we must make \n     sure people get the skills they need to get jobs, and that \n     there are jobs for them to go to so they leave welfare and \n     stay off. We want to make sure welfare reform will put more \n     people to work and move them into the economic mainstream, \n     not take jobs away from working families.\n       We call on all Americans to make the most of this \n     opportunity--never to use welfare reform as an excuse to \n     demonize or demean people, but rather as a chance to bring \n     all our people fully into the economic mainstream, to have a \n     chance to share in the prosperity and the promise of American \n     life.\n\n  Following the Pittsburgh meeting, in an August 6 Washington Post \narticle by Kevin Merida entitled ``Democrats Play Down Platform \nDifferences,'' White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes was \nquoted as characterizing disputes over platform planks as ``some fusses \naround the edges,'' and as stating, ``I can't think of any changes of \nconsequence since the drafting'' of the platform in Kansas City.\n  In an August 29 Washington Post column entitled ``Bathos and \nNothingness,'' columnist Robert D. Novak wrote, ``The platform's \ndenunciation of Republican welfare reform was obediently reversed, with \nneither protest nor debate, once Clinton signed the bill. Nor was the \nchange mentioned on the convention floor in the non-debate preceding \nvoice-vote approval of the platform. Far from being debated, the \ndeclaration of party principles was not even explained.'' \nIndeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10868-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10869-S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE VERMONT EXPOS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to \nVermont's only professional sports team, the Vermont Expos, who won the \nNew York Penn League baseball championship last week.\n  In 1994, the Vermont Expos arrived in Burlington thanks to my good \nfriend Ray Pecor, who worked exhaustively with State and local \nofficials to bring professional baseball back to Vermont. He wanted the \nExpos to be a team the entire State could be proud of. Now,\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\nafter just 3 years in Vermont, the Expos are champions.\n  This year, the Expos played with a never say die style. They came \nfrom behind regularly to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In the \nchampionship series, the Expos came from behind to win in three of \ntheir four playoff victories. This never say die attitude not only made \nbaseball extremely exciting in Vermont this summer, but helped the \nExpos develop a mystique that many teams take years to build.\n  The gritty style of play the Expos showed throughout the year \nreflects the attitude of their manager, Kevin Higgins, who had the \nresponsibility of molding a team of rookies into a championship ball \nclub. After the Expos beat the St. Catharines Stompers, 4 to 3, on \nWednesday to win the championship, Higgins acknowledged that ``these \nare the best fans in the league and I think they know it.''\n  The workmanlike efforts of the Expos also reflect the hard work of \ntheir General Manager, Kyle Bostwick of St. Albans, and his \npredecessor, the late Tom Racine of Burlington. These two men were \nmajor factors in bringing a championship ball club to Burlington.\n  Never before have I seen a community become so attached to a team so \nquickly. Take John Douglas of Colchester, who housed Expos teammates \nJamey Carroll and Shannon Swaino for the season. Douglas said he treats \nthe two young men as if they were his own.\n  But the bond between the team and their fans goes beyond the cool \nsummer nights at Centennial Field. It stretches into the very culture \nof our State. In Vermont, we take pride in our work ethic. We believe \nthat hard work will be rewarded. In all my years of following \nprofessional sports, I have never seen a team that so typified the \nculture around them.

Mr. President, a new chapter commences in the \nlife of the Greek Orthodox Church of America this Saturday with the \nenthronement in New York of new Archbishop Spyridon at the Holy Trinity \nCathedral in New York City. Archbishop Spyridon, the first American-\nborn hierarch to hold this position, assumes this important \nresponsibility at a time when the Orthodox Church in America faces \ngreat challenges and opportunities. All Americans of Greek Orthodox \nfaith have great hope that this new spiritual leader will continue the \nGreek Orthodox Church's positive role in the religious life of our \ncountry.\n  In pursuing this mission, the new Archbishop will build on a firm \nfoundation established by his predecessors--Archbishop Iakovos, who did \nso much to advance Orthodoxy in the Americas, Archbishop Michael, and \nthe late Patriarch Athenagoras, who led the church during its early and \ndifficult period in America.\n  Archbishop Spyridon was born in Warren, OH, the son of Clara and the \nlate Dr. Constantine Papageorge, and spent most of his youth in Tarpon \nSprings, FL where, as a teenager, he divided his summers between \nFlorida and the Island of Rhodes, the home of his father. The \nArchbishop graduated high school in Tarpon Springs and then enrolled in \nthe Theological School of Halki near Istanbul, Turkey, where he was \ngraduated with honors. He pursued graduate studies in Switzerland and \nGermany and is fluent in English, French, Greek, German, and Italian. \nHe eventually was assigned to the permanent delegation of the \nEcumenical Patriarchate to the World Council of Churches in Geneva, \nSwitzerland, and later served as Secretary of the Orthodox Center of \nthe Ecumenical Patriarchate located in Chambesy, Switzerland. In 1976 \nhe was assigned to duties as Dean of the Greek Orthodox community of \nSt. Andrew's in Rome and later assumed added responsibilities as \nOrthodox Executive Secretary of the International Joint Commission for \nTheological Dialogue Between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. \nHe was elected a Bishop on November 5, 1985; and in 1991 he became the \nfirst person ever elevated to Metropolitan of Venice, Italy.\n  The new Archbishop's responsibility includes serving as the direct \nrepresentative in the United States of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in \nIstanbul, the spiritual center of world Orthodox Christianity. His \npersonal and ecclesiastical experience combine a rich grounding in \nOrthodox spirituality, a meaningful involvement in interfaith-\necumenical activities, and an understanding of the American tradition \nof religious freedom and separation of church and state.\n  I join with Orthodox throughout our country and all Americans of good \nfaith who wish His Eminence a long life, a productive ministry, and the \nstrength and wisdom to meet the many challenges which await \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10870-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SWISS AGREEMENT TO INVESTIGATE JEWISH FUNDS IN SWISS BANKS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the recent \nagreement of the Swiss to investigate the issue of Jewish money, as \nwell as looted assets that were deposited in Swiss banks before and \nduring the war.\n  The Swiss, in responding to overwhelming international pressure have \nagreed to yet another commission to investigate the issue. I must state \nthat we have heard this before. We were told at the end of the WWII \nthat the Swiss would look for Jewish assets and they responded by \nsaying that they found nothing. Yet in 1949, the Swiss concluded an \nagreement with the Polish Government to turn over the assets of \nheirless, largely meaning Jewish assets. The problem was that they made \nthis agreement with the Communist-run Polish Government and not the \nJewish people to whom the assets belonged. According to their own \nsources, the Swiss had no laws on the books providing for this. \nNevertheless, they did the same thing the following year with the \nCommunist-run Hungarian and Czech Governments. While saying all along \nthey had no Jewish assets in Switzerland, the Swiss nevertheless found \nenough to conclude agreements with other governments to turn over funds \nthat did not belong to them. Clearly they have not been forthcoming \nwith the world.\n  The Swiss again investigated the subject in the early 1960's. Again, \nthey found money, some $2 million. Yet, all along there were public \nstatements to the effect that little money would be found.\n  In 1995, another search was made and some $32 million in dormant \naccounts were found. Again, Swiss banks and Swiss Government officials \nsaid this proves that there was not a lot of money left over.\n  One must ask oneself, however, if the Swiss keep saying that there is \nno Jewish money in Switzerland from the 1930's and 1940's, why then do \nthey keep finding money? Clearly the answer must be that they are in \nfact sitting on great sums of money and are letting it come out in \ndrips and drabs, only in response to immense international pressure. \nThey seem to think that they can outlast us. Well, they are wrong.\n  They can create commission after commission to study the issue, but \nthe only way to solve the issue once and for all is to open their \nbooks, entirely, and put this all to rest. Stonewalling will not work, \nwe understand what they are trying to do. Enough is enough. Open the \nbooks now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10870-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10870-S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REV STEVEN D.

Mr. President, last Wednesday evening, with a 6-4, \n11th-inning victory over the Kinston Indians, the Wilmington Blue Rocks \ncaptured the Carolina League championship for the second time in their \n4-year history. I would like to take this opportunity to join all \nDelawareans in congratulating Manager John Mizerock, his players and \ncoaches, and the entire Blue Rocks' organization for their oustanding \nseason, and--again on behalf of all Delawareans--I'd like to thank them \nfor providing us with yet another summer of enjoyable family \nentertainment.\n  For 40 years, up until the spring of 1993, Wilmington was without \nprofessional baseball until our late Mayor Dan Frawley, former State \nRepresentative Steve Taylor, and dozens of other public officials, \nbusinesspersons, and community leaders made a commitment to build a \nstadium and lure a minor league franchise to the city. Now, ``The Boys \nof Summer'' have returned each spring, averaging more than 300,000 fans \nannually as the Blue Rocks have captured the Northern Division title in \neach of their 4 years, winning the League Championship in 1994 and \nagain this year.\n  But for all of their success on the field, the Blue Rocks' real \ncontribution has been the sense of community pride which they have \nbrought to the Wilmington area. The people of Wilmington have welcomed \nthese young men from around the country and from as far away as Latin \nAmerica into their homes and their hearts, and in droves have brought \ntheir families out to Frawley Stadium on spring and summer afternoons \nand evenings to share a few hours of family fun watching their boys in \naction. In return, the Blue Rocks players and management have involved \nthemselves in the community, visiting schools and conducting baseball \nclinics, providing our youngsters with fine role models. What's more, \nthe construction of Frawley Stadium and the activity at the stadium has \nled to the revitalization of an old neighborhood, with the South \nMadison Street corridor becoming a prime location for restaurants and \ncommunity events.\n  Matt Minker and his partners, including my good friends Frank and \nFran Long, have given the club ownership with a local flavor, ensuring \nthat the franchise is more than just a business, but an integral part \nof community life in Wilmington. Ken Shepard, the vice president of \nbaseball operations, and his fine staff have run a first-rate operation \nwhere excellent baseball is played in a stadium that is fan-friendly--\nand especially kid-friendly--and always immaculately clean. A friend of \nmine remembers hearing Ken Shepard tell his staff just minutes after \nthe Blue Rocks concluded their championship season of 1994, that even \nthough there wouldn't be another game for more than 6 months, he wanted \nthe stadium cleaned up ``as if there was going to be a game here \ntomorrow night''--and it was. That commitment to excellence has led to \nnational recognition of the Wilmington Blue Rocks' as one of the \npremier minor-league organizations in the Nation.\n\n  Blue Rocks' fans will remember another season of first-rate baseball \non the diamond at Frawley Stadium; the dramatic win last Wednesday \nnight on Matt Smith's 11th-inning home run; Sean McNally's ninth-inning \nscamper around the bases to score all the way from first-base on \nMichael Evans' hit to right-center field clinching the Northern \nDivision title on Labor Day night; Jimmy Byington playing all nine \npositions in a single game in June; and countless other late-inning \nrallies, dramatic home runs, and superb pitching performances.\n  But they've taken home a lot of other memories this summer as well. \nMemories of clear blue-sky afternoons when the yard work took a back \nseat to a couple of hours with the kids in the sun at Frawley Stadium; \nand of summer evenings with the sun setting beyond the stands down the \nleft-field line as a crowd of 5 or 6,000 stood and cheered as the Blue \nRocks' pitcher fired a strike to open the game. There'll be memories of \nlegions of kids trailing along behind Rocky Bluewinkle, the blue moose \nwho is the team's mascot; and memories of the mad scrambles to catch \nthe souvenir frisbees that Rocky threw into the stands; of the \nhilarious Dizzy Bat Races which every evening left several volunteers \nfrom the audience sprawled on the green grass, disoriented, and having \nthe time of their lives; and of The Macarena dance at the end of the \nfifth inning and thousands of fans moving in unison to ``YMCA'' during \nthe seventh-inning stretch each evening.\n  Nor will fans forget some of the characters who highlighted their \nafternoons and evenings at our ``Field of Dreams''; Blue Rocks employee \nChris ``The Dancing Machine'' Parise standing on the third-base dugout \nand leading the fans in ``The Chicken Dance''; stadium organist Mike \nMixon playing ``McNamara's Band'' whenever third-baseman Sean McNally \ncame to bat; Jimmy, the soft-pretzel vendor in the stands whose energy \nand charisma probably doubled the sale of soft pretzels at the stadium; \nthe ``Balloon Man'' enchanting the younger children with hats and \nanimals made out of balloons; and countless other players, employees, \nand fans who made each trip to the ballpark a memorable one.\n  For most fans, however, the Blue Rocks memories of summer 1996 will \nrevolve around the family and friends who shared those good times with \nthem. It is the sharing of good times like that that binds families and \nfriends together, and as we congratulate the Blue Rocks on their \nCarolina League championship, we thank them for allowing us to share \ntheir success with one another. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10871-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10871-S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ``COUNTDOWN TO A MELTDOWN''\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Sunday, September 15, \n1996, the Outlook section of the Washington Post contained an excellent \narticle, ``Countdown to a Meltdown,'' by Lanny J. Davis, an attorney \nwith the firm of Patton Boggs, L.L.P. The article concerns the Y2K \nproblem, as the computer literate refer to it. What happens to the \ninternal clocks and software of the Nation's--indeed, the world's--\ngovernment, business, and personal computers at 12:01 a.m. on January \n1, 2000, when they need date code space for four digits, rather than \ntwo? Will the computers crash? Will they assume the year is 1900? Mr. \nDavis quotes one industry expert as calling the Y2K defect ``the most \ndevastating virus ever to infect the world's business and information \ntechnology systems.'' Estimates of the cost of fixing this defect range \nas high as $75 billion--if we act expeditiously. The longer we delay, \nthe more costly the solution.\n  On July 31, I wrote to the President concerning this problem. I \noffered the following suggestion:\n\n       A presidential aide should be appointed to take \n     responsibility for assuring that all Federal agencies \n     including the military be Y2K date compliant by January 1, \n     1999 and that all commercial and industrial firms doing \n     business with the Federal government also be compliant by \n     that date. I am advised that the Pentagon is further ahead on \n     the curve here than any of the Federal agencies. You may wish \n     to turn to the military to take command of dealing with the \n     problem.\n\n  A general--given the national security implications--to take charge, \nto determine what the Federal government must do to respond to this \nlooming menace, and how it ought to go about doing it. I put a copy of \nthis letter, along with the summary of a Congressional Research Service \n(CRS) report I requested on the subject, in the September 5 \nCongressional Record.\n  I will introduce legislation shortly to establish a commission to \ninvestigate the problem and suggest remedies. There is not much time \nleft to resolve it. The consequences of procrastination, as the \nattached article indicates, are grave indeed.\n  I ask that the article, ``Countdown to a Meltdown,'' appear in the \nRecord at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n                 [The Washington Post, Sept. 15, 1996]\n\n                        Countdown to a Meltdown\n\n\n Before the Year 2000, We Have to Spend Billions to Fix a Very Strange \n                                 Glitch\n\n                          (By Lanny J. Davis)\n\n       In the classic '50s science fiction film ``The Day the \n     Earth Stood Still,'' an alien lands his flying saucer in \n     front of the Washington Monument and demands that the \n     earthlings destroy their nuclear weapons. When they doubt his \n     powers, the alien gives them a demonstration. At noon on a \n     designated day, he eliminates all sources of energy on the \n     planet, from electricity to water power to gasoline. Cars \n     stop. Trains stop. Telephones stop. The lights go out.\n       At 12:01 a.m., Jan. 1, year 2000--or the ``Y2K,'' as \n     computer aficionados refer to it--the world won't exactly \n     ``stand still.'' But it could come close unless the world's \n     major governments and businesses start to fix their computer \n     systems right away.\n       The general public knows Y2K (for Year Two Kilo--the Greek \n     prefix kilo meaning 1,000) as the ``Year 200 Problem.'' \n     Although it's finally beginning to get some attention, there \n     is still little sense of urgency because it is seen as three \n     years away. But the fact is that for some institutions, \n     including parts of the federal government, it will very soon \n     be too late. We could end up with a real catastrophe that \n     could affect many people's lives around the globe in annoying \n     and profound ways.\n       The reason is simple: Virtually all computers used by \n     business and government won't know what to do when their \n     internal clocks try to switch from 1999 to 2000. They'll go \n     haywire. (Most newer personal computers for home use will be \n     unaffected.)\n       The problem is that computers (and the software inside that \n     tells them what to do) are programmed with only the last two \n     digits in the year being variable, i.e., 19XX. But when the \n     clock moves to 12:01 a.m. on Jan 1, 2000, the computer's \n     program will need code space for four digits. One of two \n     things will happen: The computer will cease functioning \n     (``crash''); or more likely, it will change the last two \n     digits from ``99'' to ``00,'' thus causing the computer's \n     internal calendar to register as if the current date is Jan. \n     1, 1900.\n       There is a solution, but it is time consuming and costly.\n       Current estimates for business and government range from \n     $50 billion to $75 billion--and will only increase as 2000 \n     draws closer. Unfortunately, the alternative is unthinkable. \n     One industry expert has called the Y2K defect ``the most \n     devastating virus ever to infect the world's business and \n     information technology systems.'' If the problem isn't fixed, \n     here are just some of the things that will happen:\n       Vital military and defense systems will shut down.\n       Taxpayers will receive notices from the IRS saying that \n     they owe millions of dollars in back taxes.\n       Banks will shut off credit and send foreclosure notices to \n     millions.\n       Social Security, Medicare and other government benefit \n     programs based on age will not function, as the computer \n     determines, for instance, that retirees are minus 35 years \n     old, instead of 65 (take the year 1900 and subtract their \n     birth year of 1935). Millions of workers will not receive \n     their pension checks.\n       Thousands of airplanes all over the world will be grounded \n     when records show that maintenance has not been done for 100 \n     years.\n       For the same reason, prison records will show criminals \n     overdue for release.\n       The economic and political ramifications of this issue are \n     immense. Kevin Shick, research director of the Gartner Group, \n     a consulting firm that developed early expertise on this \n     issue, told the House Information and Technology subcommittee \n     in April that it is highly probable that 90 percent of all \n     computer program applications in the world are dependent on \n     the correct date being recorded.\n       The questions are: How'd we get into this mess? Who's to \n     blame? What do we do about it? Who's going to pay to fix it?\n       A major sub-industry has arisen in the last few years to \n     correct the problems. There are many small software houses \n     and consulting companies that have developed ``software \n     for the calendrically challenged'' and other ``tools'' to \n     address the problem. And such giants as Oracle, Computer \n     Associates, IBM and Arthur Anderson have shown interest in \n     assisting companies to solve the Y2K problems, often at \n     costs in the tens of millions of dollars or more.\n       Experts differ on the extent of corporate America's state \n     of readiness for the Y2K: The computer magazine Datamation \n     estimated that, as of last year, more than two-thirds of the \n     companies that use mainframe computers at least has a team in \n     place to consider how to deal with the problem. However the \n     Gartner Group's Schick says that only 17 percent of the \n     companies have sought the necessary outside help.\n       Governments are waking up, but slowly. At a recent Y2K \n     conference in Austin, an industry expert warned that fewer \n     than 25 percent of state government systems will be ready. \n     One of the first public officials to take notice of the \n     problem, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), is just now \n     planning to ask President Clinton to appoint a blue ribbon \n     commission to study and make recommendations on this issue. \n     They're going to need to work fast. Recently, the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission announced that it may promulgate \n     rules requiring public companies to detail their readiness \n     for the Y2K.\n       One reason for the urgency is that this is not a simple \n     problem to fix. There are three options: replace all old \n     software, which would likely be prohibitively expensive; \n     modify the software's two-digit year code to a four-digit \n     code, with instructions that 2000 follows 1999, which would \n     require the location and correction of every ``time field'' \n     in millions of lines of code in every software and hardware \n     system; or program the computer so that, when faced with two \n     double-zero dates, it chooses the more logical of them. \n     For example, a computer can be told that a 1996 driver's \n     license with a five-year term has expired in the year \n     2001, even though the internal clock reads 1901. This last \n     solution seems on its face the simplest, and cheapest. \n     Unfortunately, it doesn't do the job in most instances. \n     For example, if the issue is knowing the person's age, the \n     computer has no way of knowing whether someone born in the \n     year 2002 is 2 years old or 102 years old.\n       Finding a solution that identifies and corrects all Y2K \n     defects may well prove impossible. Certain programs were \n     deliberately written in obscure programming languages. In the \n     Pentagon, for example, many of the codes were uniquely \n     written by one or two individuals using top-secret technology \n     and cannot be addressed by off-the-shelf software.\n       Even for the best technicians, the nightmare is finding all \n     the Y2K defects in a computer system. For instance, the dates \n     themselves have been expressed in a variety of ways by \n     programmers--December 12, 1945, 12 December 1945, 12-12-45, \n     etc. All conceivable methods of expressing those date fields \n     must be located and corrections made. If only a few have been \n     missed, it can cause a ripple effect through a computer \n     network, leading to a crash.\n       The solution is time and money.\n       But why should those who bought computer products be left \n     with the tab for cleaning this mess up? Wasn't it obvious \n     when software was being written that at some point the year \n     2000 would come? Why didn't programmers anticipate the \n     problem and deal with it?\n       As one leading Y2K commentator, Warren Reid, notes: ``The \n     Year 2000 problem was caused by shortsightedness and human \n     error.'' One thing is certain--there is plenty of blame to go \n     around.\n       Programmers and software houses say the main reason was \n     cost. George Munoz, chief financial officer of the Treasury \n     Department, testified recently that in the early 1980s, when \n     most of these systems were being developed, memory was \n     expensive and the cost of adding another two digits to every \n     date field would have been considerable. Thus, he and other \n     industry experts explain, programmers decided to save the \n     money and make the fix when 2000 got closer.\n       For this reason, many in the industry suggest that \n     responsibility for the Y2K problem is not assignable. As \n     Munoz testified in April: ``Did this problem arise because of \n     someone's negligence? To this, we emphatically respond: No.''\n       But if that is the ``no fault'' explanation, why weren't \n     the purchasers and licensees of these software programs and \n     computer systems at least informed about the coming problem? \n     Why weren't they allowed to decide for themselves whether \n     they wanted to pay then or pay later? And what about hardware \n     and software sold in the recent years, when memory is much \n     less of a problem (with today's PCs having more storage space \n     and processing capacity than many mainframes 30 years ago)?\n       These questions may get answered in court as businesses go \n     looking to recover their costs from the vendors who sold them \n     these products, though no major Y2K lawsuits have yet been \n     filed.\n       On the other hand, vendors (and their attorneys) are likely \n     to remind any customers pressing these theories that they \n     should have known that when the year 2000 tolled, the problem \n     would arise. For the most part, the buyers of these big \n     systems are sophisticated information managers.\n       Ultimately, the verdict is likely to be that everyone \n     shares a piece of the blame--both vendors who failed to \n     inform and buyers who chose to ignore, figuring someone else \n     would fix it. Perhaps it's human nature: Governments, and \n     people, are more likely to respond to a crisis than \n     anticipate it.\n       Though costs are hard to estimate, they can be \n     approximated, based on the amount of computer code within a \n     particular company or government agency.

All software must be \n     searched line by line; for every million lines of code, nine \n     to 16 staff years will be needed to correct the problem.\n       It costs about $1-$2 per line of code, most industry \n     analysts say. The Information Technology Association of \n     America, representing the software and information services \n     industry, estimates the total U.S. cost in the range of \n     $50 billion to $75 billion. The Social Security \n     Administration says it will take between $30 million and \n     $60 million to fix its programs, the Defense Department \n     over $1 billion. For the state of Maryland, current \n     estimates for the fix exceed $25 million. Recent hearings \n     by the House Information Technology Subcommittee found \n     that when state and local government costs are taken into \n     account, as well as the various indirect costs of lost \n     productivity and diversion of personnel and resources, the \n     public\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n     sector costs of the Y2K crisis reaches tens of billions of \n     dollars in the United States alone.\n       Private sector costs are likely to be as high. The Gartner \n     Group estimates that a mid-sized company with 8,000 computer \n     programs will spend between $3.6 million and $4.2 million to \n     repair ``date challenged'' software.\n       Who's left paying the bill? Surprise: first and foremost, \n     the taxpayer. Then, either in the courts or by negotiation, \n     the rest of the pain of solving the problem is likely to be \n     shared by vendors, users and consumers. And the longer a \n     company or an agency waits, the more it will cost. At the \n     start of 1999, the cost will be three times that of starting \n     today, because the supply of trained programmers able to fix \n     the problem will not keep up with demand.\n       Once the alien in the movie made the Earth stand still, he \n     convened the leaders of the world to a meeting in front of \n     his space ship.

But as soon as the alien \n     left, they went back to their old habits of building more.\n       The real-life inhabitants of a planet that is so dependent \n     on computers might take a lesson from that.

Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nReclamation Recycling and Water Conservation Act, S. 1901, and its \ncompanion bill, H.R. 3660, that promotes the desalination and water \nreclamation projects in the arid West. I have long supported water \nreclamation and desalination as a means of conserving water which is a \nprecious commodity in Nevada and other Western States.\n  In the past, with the senior Senator from Illinois [Senator Simon], I \nhave advocated legislation that would authorize desalination technology \nresearch on a national scale. Public investment in desalination \ntechnology is vital to the future of fresh water supply of the Nation. \nNevertheless, I support this regional legislation because of the \nspecial water needs of NV, Utah, California, and New Mexico. I \nparticularly note that this bill will provide for Clark County, NV, the \nfastest growing county in the Nation, to reduce its dependence on fresh \nwater from the Colorado River and rely on desalination and wastewater \nrecycling to meet the needs of the expanding community. This approach \nby Clark County and other Western communities to their water problems \nappears to be insightful recognition of the limited fresh water \nresources of the West.\n  This legislation is good common sense and I commend my colleague from \nUtah [Senator Bennett], for his sponsorship. Not only does reclamation \nand reuse make good conservation policy but will also prove cost \neffective because it will cost less for municipalities to provide for \nrecycling than to build new reservoirs and conduits. Consequently, \nthere should not be any opposition to a bill that encourages \nconservation initiatives as well as fiscal responsibility of \nmunicipalities and Federal assistance.\n  I recommend this authorizing bill to my colleagues for unanimous \nconsent so that the Secretary of the Interior can initiate such \nplanning, designing, and construction of the projects that are itemized \nwithin the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10873-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL PAYROLL WEEK\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today during National \nPayroll Week to recognize the contributions to American businesses and \nworkers that are regularly made by payroll professionals. I am proud to \nparticipate in National Payroll Week by paying tribute to the \nprofessionals who pay the wages, report the earnings, and withhold the \ntaxes of over 124 million American workers annually.\n  Payroll departments collectively withhold, report, and deposit nearly \n$880 billion in taxes on behalf of the Federal Government alone. They \nspend more than $15 billion each year just to comply with the huge web \nof Federal, State, and local wage and tax laws and an additional $6 \nbillion annually complying with Federal, State, and local, unemployment \ninsurance laws.\n  More importantly, however, payroll professionals routinely protect \nAmerican workers by helping to enforce fair labor practices by ensuring \nthat workers receive overtime pay that they are due. Payroll \ndepartments also ensure through wage reporting that retirees' Social \nSecurity benefits accurately reflect their career earnings.\n  The work of payroll departments transcends office matters, though. \nPayroll professionals help identify deadbeat parents by filing new hire \nreports to child support enforcement agencies in more than two dozen \nStates. This action helps identify noncustodial parents and ensures \nthat child support payments can be withheld from a parent's pay, if \nappropriate. In fact, payroll departments collect from noncustodial \nparents more than half of all child support payments--more than $8.1 \nbillion over the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, payroll professionals clearly play an essential role \nbenefiting millions of Americans across our Nation. I am indeed glad to \ntake this opportunity to express my appreciation and that of the people \nof Virginia for the fine work of America's payroll \nprofessionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10873-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10873-S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE IMPORTANCE OF DIET IN CANCER PREVENTION\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, very few cancer researchers have \nstressed the importance of diet in the prevention of cancer. Dr. Daniel \nNixon of Charleston, SC is a pioneer in this field. I ask that there be \nprinted in the Record an article from the Post and Courier profiling \nDr. Nixon's professional accomplishments in preventative medicine.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Daniel Nixon--He Fights Cancer with Strawberries\n\n                           (By Dottie Ashley)\n\n       Some people dream of having a lavish home in the Bahamas or \n     owning a private jet.\n       Dr. Daniel Nixon dreams of a super strawberry springing \n     from the soil in South Carolina.\n       If Nixon's dream comes true, the results could prolong the \n     lives of thousands of cancer patients so that they, too, may \n     dream once more.\n       ``South Carolina is a perfect place for cancer research \n     because here we have both tumors of affluence and tumors of \n     poverty, a large population of the very rich and of the very \n     poor,'' say Nixon.\n       In the war against cancer, Nixon, associate director for \n     Cancer Prevention and Control of the Hollings Cancer Center \n     at the Medical University of South Carolina, is in charge of \n     special weapons and tactics.\n       As the Folk Professor of Experimental Oncology at MUSC, \n     Nixon has mounted his attack on cancer with an arsenal of \n     cancer-preventing compounds that block the formation of \n     cancer cells.\n\n\n                         volunteers are tested\n\n       A former associate director for the Cancer Prevention \n     Research Program of the National Cancer Institute, Nixon has \n     formed a networking arrangement between MUSC and other state \n     agencies.\n       To conduct his research, which is funded largely by grants \n     from the Washington State Raspberry Commission, Nixon has \n     called on the services of the General Clinical Research \n     Center at MUSC to monitor the concentrations of ellagic acid \n     in the blood and urine of 12 healthy volunteers who are fed \n     bowls of raspberries.\n       His research has been recognized by the Society for \n     Nutritional Oncology Adjuvant Therapy, and Nixon will receive \n     the Green Ribbon Award at a ceremony Sept. 18 in \n     Philadelphia. The award is given by the society to recognize \n     outstanding clinical research contributions to nutritional \n     oncology in the areas of prevention, supportive nutrition and \n     adjunctive therapy.\n       Nixon has seen both sides of the cancer-treatment coin.\n       ``For 13 years, I administered chemotherapy to cancer \n     patients, and finally I had to convince myself that we were \n     not going to get rid of cancer by treatment only, that we had \n     to have prevention as well,'' says Nixon, who also is the \n     former head of medical oncology at Emory University's Winship \n     Oncology clinic.\n\n\n                          TREATED MISS LILLIAN\n\n       At Emory, Nixon was oncologist for Lillian Carter, mother \n     of President Jimmy Carter.\n       ``Dan Nixon is the most dedicated doctor I know. No matter \n     how bad the news may be, he exudes hope,'' says Carter's \n     sister-in-law, Sybil Carter, reached at her home in Plains, \n     Ga. ``He's Jimmy Carter's favorite physician.''\n       Nixon recalls, ``Miss Lillian was wonderful. She gave me a \n     baseball that Fernando Valenzuela had signed and I still have \n     it.''\n       Prevention research is designed not only for those who do \n     not have cancer, but also for those who have received, or are \n     receiving treatment for cancer. Nixon believes that where \n     cancer cells are already growing, in many cases, they may \n     retreat when bombarded with raspberries and strawberries--\n     more specifically, ellagic acid.\n       Raspberries and strawberries are extremely high in ellagic \n     acid, a nutrient Nixon believes will prevent both the \n     formation and advance of certain cancers, even in\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\n     people considered to be at high risk for the disease.\n       ``Ellagic acid is an effective cancer prevention agent in \n     animals. It stops the development of several types of cancer \n     tumors, and there's reason to believe it can do the same for \n     humans,'' says Nixon.\n       His research efforts include gathering information linking \n     the connection between diet and cancer in the body by using a \n     whole-body calorimeter, a $80,000 machine that he had brought \n     to MUSC which monitors fluctuations in whole-body temperature \n     over a 90 to 120-minute period.\n\n\n                           MEASURES HEAT LOSS\n\n       ``This is the newest calorimeter in the United States. The \n     calorimeter measures heat loss, which is calories expended. \n     If a person is obese, he is calorically thrifty and suffers a \n     greater cancer risk. The calorimeter helps us determine why \n     that is.''\n       Still retaining his soft-spoken Southern accent, despite \n     time spent at Harvard and in Washington, D.C., Nixon has a \n     calm demeanor that's reassuring to patients.\n       ``The most important thing is to really take time and \n     listen to your patients,'' he says. ``They help you make the \n     diagnosis and teach you so much about cancer treatment.''\n       Born in Brunswick, Nixon moved with his family to Ware \n     County and later to Bacon County, Ga., when his father, who \n     was a forester, took a job in the Okefenokee Swamp.\n       After enrolling at the University of Georgia, Nixon double-\n     majored in chemistry and zoology and went on to attend the \n     Medical College of Georgia in Augusta.\n       He did his internship in Augusta, then served as a Clinical \n     Fellow in Medicine (Oncology) at Massachusetts General \n     Hospital and as a Research Fellow in The Huntington \n     Laboratories at Harvard Medical School.\n       In spite of his gentle manner, Nixon is all business.\n       ``I want people to realize that this work we are doing in \n     science, not home economics,'' he says, as he points out that \n     at work in his experiments are thousands of phytochemicals \n     which have been manufactured by plants to protect themselves \n     against insects and other predators.\n\n\n                         fruits and vegetables\n\n       ``These are not the usual vitamins and minerals that we are \n     studying. We've known that fruits and vegetables are good for \n     us. Now we want to know why.''\n       As Nixon has investigated the connection between cancer and \n     diet over the years, he has concluded that often the feeding \n     of a normal American high-fat diet to a cancer patient may \n     actually feed the tumor and encourage its growth.\n       ``When I did a metabolic balance study, I found the cancer \n     patients gained fat weight, not lean weight,'' he says. \n     ``People must learn to view eating food such as high-fiber \n     cereal as the same as taking a drug to battle cancer. We need \n     to learn how to feed our cancer patients without feeding \n     their cancers.''\n       For the past year, Nixon has worked in collaboration with \n     scientific investigators at Clemson University who test the \n     ellagic acid-laden blood which he sends them to find out what \n     it does to tumor cells.\n       ``We've found that the ellagic acid is readily absorbed and \n     a lot of it gets into the blood stream. This is an effective \n     delivery system to cells throughout the body.\n       ``In animals it seems to protect genes against carcinogens, \n     maybe even against tobacco carcinogens. Diets heavy in fats \n     are the worst, as it appears that cancer thrives on fat \n     calories.''\n       He advises limiting fat intake to 20 to 25 percent of the \n     total calories consumed daily.\n\n\n                           women's nutrition\n\n       Nixon's work with cancer prevention ranges from Emory's \n     Winship clinic for Neoplastic Disease to working with the \n     National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he \n     participated in a National Health Institute-funded Women's \n     Intervention Nutrition Study designed to determine if reduced \n     caloric intake contributes to a more favorable outcome in \n     cancer therapy and reducing the chance of relapse.\n       After living in Bethesda for 2\\1/2\\ years, the Nixons \n     returned to Atlanta, where Nixon served as vice president for \n     cancer detection and treatment for the American Cancer \n     Society.\n       In 1994, Nixon was asked to come to MUSC. He is \n     enthusiastic concerning the support he has received from MUSC \n     president Dr. James B. Edwards and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings.\n       ``They have been wonderful about getting things going here \n     in cancer prevention. For the past two years, we have been \n     putting together a statewide network involving Clemson, the \n     USC School of Public Health, oncologists in Spartanburg and \n     Greenville as well as the S.C. Primary Research Consortium, \n     based here at MUSC.\n       ``We are working with a grant from the Centers for Disease \n     Control which is funding volunteers in intervention control \n     groups. People can be subjects in the groups or they can be \n     counselors, whom we will train, to work with the cancer \n     patients.\n       ``We now know that about 70 percent of malignancies are \n     either caused by tobacco or are in some way related to what \n     we eat.\n       ``If we can get rid of 70 percent of cancer, then we can \n     turn our time and money to heart disease, diabetes, \n     osteoporosis and toward antiaging research. There's no reason \n     that humans can't live to be 120 years old.''\n\n\n                              weight loss\n\n       One of the cancer patients who volunteered in a clinical \n     trial is Clare Howard, 64, who was the first patient to have \n     her metabolic activity measured in the calorimeter.\n       Required to keep a record of what she has eaten each day, \n     she has lost 26 pounds in the past year.\n       ``I'm glad to take part in these cancer trials,'' she says. \n     ``And most of all, it's been wonderful to work with a doctor \n     who is as compassionate as Dr. Nixon. I feel like he really \n     cares.''\n       Nixon's work is greatly admired by Dr. David Gangemi, \n     director of Greenville Hospital System/Clemson University \n     Biomedical Cooperative. ``Dr. Nixon is a true star in the \n     field of cancer prevention. And, going beyond that, this \n     cooperation between Clemson and MUSC could change the economy \n     of this state. If we are able to develop a strawberry with \n     even more ellagic acid, then some farmers who grow tobacco \n     could simply switch to strawberries.\n       ``Also, this national grant we have will bring preventive \n     medicine to the forefront, and this is greatly needed because \n     there are some people in the medical community, such as some \n     surgeons, who don't fully appreciate the preventive approach \n     to cancer.''\n       Dr. Dwight Camper of Clemson's Plant Pathology and \n     Physiology Department, says of the MUSC partnership, ``We are \n     elated because this project gives us an opportunity to team \n     the plant scientists with the medical professionals--the \n     first time this has been done in South Carolina.\n\n\n                         naval reserve captain\n\n       Nixon doesn't restrict his research to institutions of \n     higher learning. About six years ago, Nixon, who holds the \n     rank of captain in the Naval Reserve, worked with the Navy on \n     a nutrition experiment that involved two destroyers which \n     spent six months at sea.\n       ``We worked with the chef on one of the destroyers to \n     prepare food that followed the National Cancer Institute \n     Dietary Guidelines and on the other ship they served regular \n     Navy food,'' says Nixon.\n       ``On the ship using the Dietary Guidelines, those who were \n     obese lost weight. Also, the sailors seemed to like this food \n     better,'' says Nixon.\n       Also, he has established a relationship with Johnson & \n     Wales University to train future chefs to cook high-fiber, \n     low-fat dishes.\n       ``I tell them that chefs are the pharmacists of the \n     future,'' says Nixon. ``And I truly believe that.\n       ``This year we have started to go into the schools systems \n     to teach nutrition and we've opened a teaching center on St. \n     Helena Island at the Beaufort-Jasper Comprehensive Health \n     Agency clinic, near the Penn Center. There, we have teaching \n     kitchens to demonstrate good nutrition because lots of \n     diabetes and cancer can be found among the people there.''\n       People can, in fact, alter their taste buds, Nixon says. \n     ``I grew up eating traditional, good Southern food, like \n     fried chicken and vegetables cooked with fat. But I no longer \n     enjoy fatty foods. Now, with all the no-fat and low-fat foods \n     on the market, you don't really have to sacrifice \n     enjoyment.''\n       And to experience an impromptu dinner with the Nixons, \n     indeed is proof.\n       It's a rainy summer evening and Nixon and his wife, Gayle, \n     who is a cardiology research nurse, are in the middle of \n     packing up their Sullivan's Island home to move into town for \n     several months, while their new home is being built.\n       ``We are donating this house to the United Methodist Relief \n     Center, which is part of the Hibben Street United Methodist \n     Church in Mount Pleasant,'' explains Mrs. Nixon, who points \n     out after the house is moved, they plan to build their new \n     home on the beachfront site.\n       For dinner, Mrs. Nixon serves boiled shrimp, along with \n     carrots, grapes, blueberries, nonfat potato chips, as well as \n     iced tea.\n       A careful shopper, she was glad when the National Labeling \n     Education Act was implemented in 1993.\n       ``When the amount of fat a food contains is listed on the \n     bottle or box, they you know for sure whether you want to buy \n     it,'' she says.\n       The Nixons met when she was a nurse in training at the \n     Medical College of Georgia and he was in medical school.\n       ``Gayle kind of pushed me into getting interested in \n     nutrition,'' says Nixon. ``She was also very interested in \n     public health work and in the way that the food in people's \n     diets had an impact on their well being.''\n       This shared interest led to their book ``The Cancer \n     Recovery Eating Plan: The Right Foods to Help Fuel Your \n     Recovery,'' published by Random House in 1994 and released in \n     paperback last spring.\n       The Nixons say they don't miss the bustle of Atlanta.\n       ``I was the `stadium doc' at the home Atlanta Braves games, \n     which meant if somebody got hit in the head with a foul ball \n     that I would go and put an ice pack on it,'' Nixon says. \n     ``That was fun, but I don't really miss Atlanta at all.''\n       Nixon feels he has found his dream job.\n       ``Now I can really talk to patients; whereas, when I was \n     doing chemotherapy, sometimes I would have as many as 60 \n     patients a day, and I really had no time to talk.''\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10873-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10875-S10878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, FOR TRAVEL FROM APR. 1 TO JUNE 30, 1996                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Ernest F.

This increased use has led to devastating effects \n     on individuals and the community, including--\n       (A) a dramatic increase in deaths associated with \n     methamphetamine ingestion;\n       (B) an increase in the number of violent crimes associated \n     with methamphetamine ingestion; and\n       (C) an increase in criminal activity associated with the \n     illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor \n     compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in \n     the United States.\n       (3) Illegal methamphetamine manufacture and abuse presents \n     an imminent public health threat that warrants aggressive law \n     enforcement action, increased research on methamphetamine and \n     other substance abuse, increased coordinated efforts to \n     prevent methamphetamine abuse, and increased monitoring of \n     the public health threat methamphetamine presents to the \n     communities of the United States.\n    TITLE I--IMPORTATION OF METHAMPHETAMINE AND PRECURSOR CHEMICALS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate has passed \nthe eonomic espionage bill. This is an important measure that I believe \nwill save American business significant amounts of money. The theft of \nconfidential information from American businesses is a serious problem, \nand this bill takes important steps in the right direction.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate has accepted the amendment \nI offered with Senator Kyl. This amendment commissions the first-ever \nstudy on the criminal misuse of encryption technologies. Under the \nGrassley-Kyl amendment, court officers who prepare pre-sentencing \nreports will include information on the use of encryption to conceal \ncriminal conduct, obstruct investigations, and commit crimes. The \nsentencing commission will then collect and collate this information \nand include it in its annual report to congress.\n  In this way, I am hopeful that Congress and executive branch will \nhave reliable data on whether the criminal misuse of encryption is \nactually a problem and, if so, what response to this problem would be \nappropriate.\n  As chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, \nI did an informal survey of state-level law enforcement concerning the \ncriminal misuse of encryption. This informal survey, while not \nscientific, provides valuable insights into the actions of the criminal \nelement in our society.\n  Here are just some of the responses my subcommittee received.\n  In one case involving John Lucich of the New Jersey attorney \ngeneral's office was involved, a computer was seized pursuant to a \nwarrant in a serious assault case. Examination revealed that \napproximately 20 percent of the hard drive files were encrypted. \nInvestigators sought the assistance of two different Federal agencies. \nBoth of these agencies were unsuccessful in decrypting the files. \nFinally, a third Federal agency was successful in decrypting the files \nafter expending considerable resources. The Decrypted files did not \ncontain evidence of the assault but rather contained evidence of child \npornography. The encryption type likely used was ``DES.''\n\n  And Officer Tim O'Neill of the Roseville, California Police \nDepartment reported to the subcommittee that he participated in a \nsearch involving a complaint against a subject who was on probation for \nsolicitation/annoyance of minors. The subject had a hidden encrypted \nfile on his personal computer. In the ``slack'' area at the end of the \nfile the officer found names, addresses, school, grade, and phone \nnumbers of 4-5 young teen girls. The encryption type used was known as \n``pincrypt.''\n  Officer Mike Menz of the same department advised the subcommittee \nthat he was working on a joint State/Federal major check fraud case \nwhere part of the potential evidence was encrypted.\n  Ivan Ortman, a senior prosecutor in Seattle, Washington, encountered \nsome encrypted files and password protection in a cellular phone fraud \ninvestigation. For a number of files the popular and inexpensive \n``PGP'' type of encryption was used. Orton indicated that no effort was \neven made to examine the files as the police could not locate any \nmethod for ``cracking that encryption.''\n  In other words, why try since such an effort is certain to be futile. \nSurely a rational society should look long and hard at this situation.\n  Agent Chuck Davis of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation reported to \nthe subcommittee that he has encountered encryption as well as password \nprotection problems. In one embezzlement case, a computer system has \nseized. Examination revealed that files on the hard disk were \nencrypted. The software manufacturers were contacted and the technical \npersonnel who wrote the program advised that, ``they had left no `back \ndoor' access to the product as this would adversely impact sales. The \nhallmark of the program's appeal is that it cannot be broken, even by \nthose who created it.'' Agent Davis advised that his investigation was \n``halted'' due to the time and expense of a ``brute force attack''. The \nencryption program used was entitled ``watchdog.''\n  Agent Davis also advised the subcommittee that password protection \nalso presents problems for other types of investigators. In cases \ninvolving theft of drugs from an emergency room by a doctor, bribery/\nextortion by a police officer, and the suicide by an 11 year-old boy \nafter telling friends that he had been molested by a family friend, \ninvestigators encountered password protection. The first two cases were \nsuccessfully resolved through assistance from the manufacturer of the \nsoftware.\n  The third case, however, especially illustrates the seriousness of \ndecryption problems--determining the unique key or in this case, \npassword from a large number of possibilities. According to Agent \nDavis, a mere 4 character password has 1.9 million possibilities due to \nthe number of keyboard characters. Can you imagine how difficult it \nmust be to figure a short, 4 character password. What if the password \nwere 10 characters or 20 or more? It's easy to see why criminals are \nmoving toward password protection for their records.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what the Grassley-Kyl amendment's study \nwill show. But at least anecdotally, there seems to be a serious and \ngrowing problem with criminals using encryption to commit crimes or \nconceal criminal conduct. I hope we can figure out what to do about the \nproblem in a fair and balanced way. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the economic espionage \nbill introduced by Senators specter and Kohl. I was pleased that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee passed this bill, which will strengthen \ncurrent public law on crimes against our industries. It will protect \nour businesses by punishing those who steal vital proprietary \ninformation for the benefit of a foreign government or a corporation.\n  Economic espionage is not a new crime. The success of many U.S. firms \nhas made them a large target for the theft of trade secrets. It is much \neasier for a foreign firm to steal American trade secrets, with little \nor no penalty, than it is for a firm to spend a large amount of capital \non research and development. Economic espionage may be the future of \nintelligence.\n  Only recently have American firms begun to recognize the economic \nimpact espionage has on U.S. firms. In 1992, a survey by the American \nsociety for Industrial Security discovered that American firms lost \nroughly $597 million in product development and specification data and \n$110 million in manufacturing process information, due to espionage. \nThese losses are likely to continue. I am pleased that the Chairman and \nranking member have produced a bill that will for the first time\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\npenalize those who try to steal ideas that Americans have worked hard \nto develop.\n  One problem not yet adequately addressed is how to collect necessary \nintelligence in an age when encryption protects computer communication. \nIn order to maintain our national security interests, I support some \nmeasure of constitutional authority to collect intelligence even in \nsituations where communications have been encrypted. To that end, Mr. \nPresident, I am hopeful that my colleagues will adopt an amendment to \nthis bill that Senator grassley and I have sponsored. It will amend the \nfederal sentencing guidelines to require that the Federal Sentencing \nCommission collect, compile, and report annually on information \ncollected from pretrial sentence reports and other relevant documents \nindicating the use of encryption to further or conceal criminal \nconduct.\n  Whatever one's view of export policy, it is clear that law \nenforcement must have better records of criminals who use encryption \ntechnology. This amendment will accomplish that.\n  Mr. President, passing an economic espionage law will deter criminals \nfrom stealing trade secrets from American businesses. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt our amendment and pass the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5385) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased that the amendment I offered with my good \nfriend Senator Kyl has been accepted. This amendment requires the \nSentencing Commission to report to Congress every year on the criminal \nmisuse of encryption technologies, including to obstruct or impede the \nadministration of justice. I think that this will help Congress obtain \nreliable data on the question of whether encryption is actually being \nused by criminals to commit crimes.\n  The Grassley-Kyl amendment also provides the Attorney General and \nSecretary of the Treasury with the authority to enter into an agreement \nproviding the United States Secret Service with concurrent jurisdiction \nto investigate certain types of wire fraud offenses. I considered \namending 18 U.S.C. 1343 to specifically encompass computer frauds, but \nafter reviewing the case law (see, E.G., U.S. v. Riggs, 967 F.2d 561 \n(11th Cir. 1992)) and consulting with the Justice Department, I have \ndecided that this is not necessary. My hope is that Federal law \nenforcement and the Justice Department will make more use of section \n1343 to prosecute computer crimes. Specifically, I would like this \ninterpretation to be committed to writing and distributed to Federal \nprosecutors in the field.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I concur in the view of the Senator from Iowa that \namending section 1343 as he originally considered is not necessary. \nSection 1343 already encompasses frauds effected by the interstate or \nforeign transmission of wire communications involving, among other \nthings, writings, signs, or signals and, consequently, would encompass \nfrauds effected by means of computers in interstate or foreign \ncommerce. I know the Justice Department already interprets 1343 in this \nway. I too would urge the Justice Department to ensure that Federal \nprosecutors in the field are familiar with the scope of criminal \nconduct, including fraud effected by means of computers, encompassed by \nthe wire fraud statute.\n  Regarding the new requirement that the Sentencing Commission report \non the criminal misuse of encryption technologies. I caution that the \nresults of this report--whatever they may be--will be necessarily \nincomplete and should not be viewed out of context. Instances in which \nencryption technologies have been used to thwart the theft of valuable \ncomputerized data, which has been encrypted, and to prevent crimes, \nsuch as economic espionage, do not usually draw the attention of law \nenforcement and therefore will not be included in the report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wonder whether the chairman and ranking member of the \nTechnology Subcommittee agree with this analysis of section 1343.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have listened to your exchange with Senator Leahy and \nI fully agree that section 1343 already encompasses computer fraud and \nthat amending it is not necessary.\n  Mr. KOHL. I too listened to your exchange with Senator Leahy, and I \nam also of the view that section 1343 covers some computer crimes and \nthat no amendment was necessary.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5386\n\n  (Purpose: To improve the treatment and security of certain persons \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5387) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third \ntime, and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee substitute amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3723), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has taken \nup and passed H.R. 3723. We are sending that bill back to the House \nwith substitute. This language, which I drafted with Senator Specter, \nis based on our companion measures, S. 1556 (``The Economic Espionage \nAct'') and S.1557 (``The Economic Security Act'').\n  I would like to take this opportunity to point out several provisions \nof our legislation and explain their purpose and meaning.\n  This legislation includes a provision penalizing the theft of \nproprietary economic information and a second provision penalizing that \ntheft when it is done on behalf of or to benefit a foreign government, \ninstrumentality, or agent. The principle purpose of this second \n(foreign government) provision is not to punish conventional commercial \ntheft and misappropriation of trade secrets (which is covered by the \nfirst provision). Thus, to make out an offense under this section, the \nprosecution must show in each instance that the perpetrator intended \nto, or had reason to believe that his or her actions would aid a \nforeign government, instrumentality, or agent. Enforcement agencies \nshould administer this section with its principle purpose in mind and \ntherefore should not apply section 572 to foreign corporations when \nthere is no evidence of foreign government sponsored or coordinated \nintelligence activity. This particular concern is borne out in our \nunderstanding of the definition of ``foreign instrumentality,'' which \nindicates that a foreign organization must be ``substantially owned, \ncontrolled, sponsored, commanded, managed, or dominated by a foreign \ngovernment or subdivision thereof.'' We do not mean for the test of \nsubstantial control to be mechanistic or mathematical. The simple fact \nthat the majority of the stock of a company is owned by a foreign \ngovernment will not suffice under this definition, nor for that matter \nwill the fact that a foreign government only owns 10 percent of a \ncompany exempt it from scrutiny. Rather the pertinent inquiry is \nwhether the activities of the company are, from a practical and \nsubstantive standpoint, foreign government directed.\n  To make out a case under these two provisions (sections 1832 and \n572), the prosecution would have to show that the accused knew or had \nreason to know that a trade secret had been stolen or appropriated \nwithout authorization. This threshold separates conduct that is \ncriminal from that which is innocent. Thus, for example, these sections \nwould not give rise to prosecution for legitimate economic collection \nor reporting by personnel of foreign governments or international \nfinancial institutions, such as the World Bank, because such legitimate \ncollection or reporting would not include the collection or reporting \nof trade secrets that had been stolen, misappropriated or converted \nwithout authorization.\n  In the section dealing with foreign government sponsored espionage, \nand derived from S. 1557, the definition of proprietary economic \ninformation is different from the definition of proprietary economic \ninformation in section 2. In particular, the definition contained in \nsection 1831(2) indicates that ``general knowledge'' is not included in \nthe term, while the definition in section 571(4) does not. We do not \nintend\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nto imply by this difference that general knowledge can or should be the \nsubject of a prosecution under section 572. Of course, someone can use \ntheir general experience and skills and work for a foreign government. \nThey cannot, however, steal a piece of proprietary economic information \nfor an owner and thereby violate section 572 of this provision. Our \npoint is simply that when a person is working on behalf of a foreign \ngovernment, instrumentality or agency, that person has to be \nparticularly careful to ensure that the information being used is not \nproprietary economic information.\n\n  Some people have asked whether a piece of proprietary economic \ninformation has to be novel or inventive. Unlike patented material, \nsomething does not have to be novel, in the patent law sense, in order \nto be a piece of proprietary economic information. Of course, often it \nwill be because an owner will have a patented invention that he or she \nhas chosen to maintain the material as a piece of proprietary economic \ninformation rather than reveal it through the patent process. Even if \nthe material is not novel in the patent law sense, some form of novelty \nis probably inevitable since ``that which does not possess novelty is \nusually known; secrecy, in the context of trade secrets implies at \nleast minimal novelty.'' Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, \n476 (1974). While we do not strictly impose a novelty or inventiveness \nrequirement in order for material to be considered proprietary economic \ninformation, looking at the novelty or uniqueness of a piece of \ninformation or knowledge should inform courts in determining whether \nsomething is a matter of general knowledge, skill or experience.\n  Although we do not require novelty or inventiveness, the definition \nof proprietary economic information includes the provision that an \nowner have taken reasonable measures under the circumstances to keep \nthe information confidential. We do not with this definition impose any \nrequirements on companies or owners. Each owner must assess the value \nof the material it seeks to protect, the extent of a threat of theft, \nand the ease of theft in determining how extensive their protective \nmeasures should be. We anticipate that what constitutes reasonable \nmeasures in one particular field of knowledge or industry may vary \nsignificantly from what is reasonable in another field or industry. \nHowever, some common sense measures are likely to be common across the \nboard. For example, it is only natural that an owner would restrict \naccess to proprietary economic information to the people who actually \nneed to use the information. It is only natural also that an owner \nclearly indicate in some form or another that the information is \nproprietary. However, owners need not take heroic or extreme protective \nmeasures in order for their efforts to be reasonable.\n  Some people have asked how this legislation might affect reverse \nengineering. Reverse engineering is a broad term that encompasses a \nvariety of actions. The important thing is to focus on whether the \naccused has committed one of the prohibited acts of this statute rather \nthan whether he or she has ``reverse engineered.'' If someone has \nlawfully gained access to a trade secret or a piece or proprietary \neconomic information, and can replicate it without violating copyright, \npatent or this law, then that form of ``reverse engineering'' should be \nfine. For example, if a person can drink Coca-Cola and, because he \nhappens to have highly refined taste buds, can figure out what the \nformula is, then this legislation cannot be used against him. Likewise, \nif a person can look at a product and, by using their own general \nskills and expertise, dissect the necessary attributes of the product, \nthen that person should be free from any threat of prosecution.\n\n  We have been deeply concerned about the efforts taken by courts to \nprotect the confidentiality of proprietary economic information. It is \nimportant that in the early stages of a prosecution the issue whether \nmaterial is proprietary economic information not be litigated. Rather, \ncourts should, when entering these orders, always assume that the \nmaterial at issue is in fact proprietary economic information.\n  We are also concerned that victims of economic espionage receive \ncompensation for their losses. This legislation incorporates through \nreference existing law to provide procedures to be used in the \ndetention, seizure, forfeiture, and ultimate disposition of property \nforfeited under the section. Under these procedures, the Attorney \nGeneral is authorized to grant petitions for mitigation or remission of \nforfeiture and for the restoration of forfeited property to the victims \nof an offense. The Attorney General may also take any other necessary \nor proper action to protect the rights of innocent people in the \ninterest of justice. In practice, under the forfeiture laws, victims \nare afforded priority in the disposition of forfeited property since it \nis the policy of the Department of Justice to provide restitution to \nthe victims of criminal acts whenever permitted to do so by the law. \nProcedures for victims to obtain restitution may be found at Section 9 \nof Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.\n  In addition to requesting redress from the Attorney General, any \nperson--including a victim--asserting an interest in property ordered \nforfeited may petition for a judicial hearings to adjudicate the \nvalidity of the alleged interest and to revise the order of forfeiture. \nAdditionally, forfeitures are subject to a requirement of \nproportionality under the Eight Amendment; that is, the value of the \nproperty forfeited must not be excessively disproportionate to the \ncrimes in question.\n  Finally, we have required that the Attorney General report back to us \non victim restitution two and four years after the enactment of this \nlegislation. We have heard from some companies that they only rarely \nobtain restitution awards despite their eligibility. We wish to \ncarefully monitor restitution to ensure that the current system is \nworking well and make any changes that may be necessary.\n  Mr. President, we have worked closely in cooperation with the \nAdministration in drafting this legislation. It is a bipartisan \nmeasure, broadly supported, and necessary for our country's future \nindustrial vitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/18/senate-section/article/S10882-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10886-S10891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President. I rise to comment on S. 982, the National \nInformation Infrastructure Protection Act. I was pleased that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the bill that Senator \nLeahy and I introduced, which will strengthen current public law on \ncomputer crime and protect the national information infrastructure. It \nwill protect banks, hospitals, and other information-intensive \nbusinesses which maintain sensitive computer files from those who \nimproperly enter into computer systems.\n  Although there has never been an accurate nationwide reporting system \nfor computer crime, it is clear that computer crime is rising. For \nexample, the Computer Emergency and Response Team [CERT] at Carnegie-\nMellon University reports that computer intrusions have increased from \n132 in 1989 to 2,341 last year. A recent Rand Corporation study \nreported 1,172 hacking incidents during the first 6 months of 1994. \nClearly there is a need to reform the current criminal statutes \ncovering computer abuse.\n  The law needs to keep pace with technology. Crime is increasingly \nbeing perpetrated electronically, and we need to amend our laws to stop \nit. We, therefore, introduced the National Information Infrastructure \nProtection Act last year. Why is this bill important? First, it will \nprotect against the interstate or foreign theft of information by \ncomputer. The provision is necessary because the court held, in the \ncase of United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991), \nthat purely intangible intellectual property, such as computer \nprograms, do not count as goods, wares, merchandise, securities, or \nmoneys which have been stolen, converted, or taken within the meaning \nof 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314, the Interstate Transportation of Stolen \nProperty. There are no Federal penalties for theft of computer \ninformation across state lines or internationally. In most cases, the \nDepartment of Justice attempts to use other statutes to prosecute these \ncriminals.\n  Second, the provision adds a new section to the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act to provide penalties for the interstate or international \ntransmission of threats against computers, computer networks, and their \ndata and programs. Unlawful threats would include interference in any \nway with the normal operation of the computer or system in question, \nsuch as denying access to authorized users, erasing or corrupting data \nor programs, slowing down the operation of the computer or system, or \nencrypting data and then demanding money for the key. The provision is \nimportant because there have been cases where hackers have threatened \nto demolish a computer information system unless they were granted free \naccess to accounts. It is sophisticated extortion.\n  Finally, S. 982 amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(4) to ensure that \nfelony-level sanctions apply when unauthorized use, or use in excess of \nauthorization, is significant. Hackers, for example, have broken into \ncomputers only for the purpose of using their processing programs, \nsometimes amassing computer time worth far more than $5,000. The bill \nwould penalize those whose trespassing, in which only computer use is \nobtained, amounts to greater than $5,000 during any 1-year period. \nCompanies should not be stuck with the bill for electronic joyriders. \nAlthough they may not damage or steal information, hackers who browse \nthrough computer systems are a significant liability to businesses who \nmust pay for a new security system, and the expensive time the hacker \nused.\n\n  There is widespread support for changes to the statute. For example, \nAttorney General Reno, in connection with the June 27, 1995 oversight \nhearing of the Department of Justice, said that S. 982 would ``address \nmany of the concerns that have been identified by computer security \nexperts with respect to the need for greater protection of networks.''\n  As FBI Director Louis Freeh responded, when asked during the February \n28, 1996 joint hearing with the Select Committee on Intelligence on \nEconomic Espionage, if he would appreciate the Senate acting on S. 982, \n``[S. 982] does fill a gap. It's very important.''\n  On October 11, 1995 the Deputy Assistant Director of Investigations \nof the United States Secret Service, speaking before the House \nCommittee on Banking and Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic \nand International Monetary Policy, listed S. 982 as one of the bills \nthat ``enhance our ability to investigate and prosecute violations \ndomestically, while offering guidelines for foreign government \nauthorities.''\n  This bill is timely because of the recent incident concerning the \nDepartment of Justice's homepage. Hackers penetrated the DOJ's \ncomputers, leaving pictures of swastikas and Adolph Hitler for the \nworld to view. The damage caused by these criminals should not be \nprosecuted by relying on common law criminal mischief statutes. If our \nbill had been law, Federal prosecutors could have charged the hackers \nwith violating more than trespassing statutes.\n  Mr. President, the Kyl-Leahy National Information Infrastructure \nProtection Act of 1995 will deter criminal\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\nactivity and protect our Nation's infrastructure. I urge my colleagues \nto pass the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has today \ntaken the important step of passing the National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act of 1996, NII Protection Act, which I have \nsponsored with Senators Kyl and Grassley.\n  This legislation will help safeguard the privacy, security, and \nreliability of our national computer systems and networks and the \ninformation stored in, and carried on, those networks. Those systems \nand networks are vulnerable to the threat of attack by hackers, high-\ntechnology criminals and spies. The NII Protection Act will increase \nprotection for both government and private computers, and the \ninformation on those computers, from the growing threat of computer \ncrime.\n  Our dependency on computers and the growth of the Internet are both \nintegrally linked to people's confidence in the privacy, security, and \nreliability of computer networks. That is why I have worked over the \npast decade to make sure the laws we have in place foster both privacy \nand security, and provide a sound foundation for new communications \ntechnologies to flourish.\n  Every technological advance provides new opportunities for legitimate \nuses and the potential for criminal exploitation. Existing criminal \nstatutes provide a good framework for prosecuting most types of \ncomputer-related criminal conduct. But as technology changes and high-\ntechnology criminals devise new ways to use technology to commit \noffenses we have yet to anticipate, we must be ready to readjust and \nupdate our criminal code.\n  The NII Protection Act closes a number of gaps in the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse statute, which was originally enacted in 1984. This \nlegislation would strengthen law enforcement's hands in fighting crimes \ntargeted at computers, networks, and computerized information by, among \nother things, designating new computer crimes, and by extending \nprotection to computer systems used in foreign or interstate commerce \nor communications.\n  We need to protect both government and private computers, and the \ninformation on those computers, from the very real and growing threat \nof computer crime. The facts speak for themselves--computer crime is on \nthe rise. On September 12, a computer hacker attack, which shut down an \nNew York Internet access provider with thousands of business and \nindividual customers, made front page news, and revealed the \nvulnerability of every network service provider to such an attack. The \nComputer Emergency and Response Team [CERT] at Carnegie-Mellon \nUniversity reports that over 12,000 Internet computers were attacked in \n2,412 incidents in 1995 alone. A 1996 survey conducted jointly by the \nComputer Security Institute and the FBI showed that 42 percent of the \nrespondents sustained an unauthorized use or intrusion into their \ncomputer systems in the past 12 months.\n\n  Nevertheless, while our current statute, in section 1030(a)(2), \nprohibits misuse of a computer to obtain information from a financial \ninstitution, it falls short of protecting the privacy and \nconfidentiality of information on computers used in interstate or \nforeign commerce and communications. This gap in the law has become \nonly more glaring as more Americans have connected their home and \nbusiness computers to the global Internet.\n  This is not just a law enforcement issue, but an economic one. \nBreaches of computer security result in direct financial losses to \nAmerican companies from the theft of trade secrets and proprietary \ninformation. A December 1995 report by the Computer Systems Policy \nProject, comprised of the CEO's from 13 major computer companies, \nestimates that financial losses in 1995 from breaches of computer \nsecurity systems ranged from $2 to $4 billion. The report predicts that \nthese numbers could rise in the year 2000 to $40 to $80 billion \nworldwide. The estimated amount of these losses is staggering.\n  The NII Protection Act would extend the protection already given to \nthe computerized information of financial institutions and consumer \nreporting agencies, to computerized information held on computers used \nin interstate or foreign commerce on communications, if the conduct \ninvolved interstate or foreign communications. The provision is \ndesigned to protect against the interstate or foreign theft of \ninformation by computer.\n  Computer hackers have accessed sensitive government data regarding \nOperation Desert Storm, penetrated NASA computers, and broken into \nFederal courthouse computer systems containing confidential records. \nThese outside hackers are subject to criminal prosecution under section \n1030(a)(3) of the computer fraud and abuse statute. Yet, this statute \ncontains no prohibition against malicious insiders: Those Government \nemployees who abuse their computer access privileges by snooping \nthrough confidential tax returns, or selling confidential criminal \nhistory information from the National Crime Information Center [NCIC]. \nThe NCIC is currently the Nation's most extensive computerized criminal \njustice information system, containing criminal history information, \nfiles on wanted persons, and information on stolen vehicles and missing \npersons.\n  I am very concerned about continuing reports of unauthorized access \nto highly personal and sensitive government information about \nindividual Americans, such as NCIC data. For example, a ``Dear Abby'' \ncolumn that appeared on June 20, 1996 in newspapers across the country \ncarried a letter by a woman who claimed her in-laws ``ran her name \nthrough the FBI computer'' and, apparently, used access to the NCIC for \npersonal purposes.\n  This published complaint comes on the heels of a General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] report presented on July 28, 1993, before the House \nGovernment Operations Committee, Subcommittee on Information, Justice, \nAgriculture, and Transportation, on the abuse of NCIC information. \nFollowing an investigation, GAO determined that NCIC information had \nbeen misused by insiders--individuals with authorized access--some of \nwhom had sold NCIC information to outsiders and determined whether \nfriends and relatives had criminal records. The GAO found that some of \nthe misuse jeopardized the safety of citizens and potentially \njeopardized law enforcement personnel. Yet, no Federal or State laws \nare specifically directed at NCIC misuse and most abusers of NCIC were \nnot criminally prosecuted. GAO concluded that Congress should enact \nlegislation with strong criminal sanctions for the misuse of NCIC data.\n\n  This bill would criminalize these activities by amending the privacy \nprotection provision in section 1030(a)(2) and extending its coverage \nto Federal Government computers. If the information obtained is of \nminimal value, the penalty is only a misdemeanor. If, on the other \nhand, the offense is committed for purposes of commercial advantage or \nprivate financial gain, for the purpose of committing any criminal or \ntortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United \nStates or of any State, or if the value of the information obtained \nexceeds $5,000, the penalty is a felony.\n  The current statute, in section 1030(a)(5), protects computers and \ncomputer systems from damage caused by either outside hackers or \nmalicious insiders ``through means of a computer used in interstate \ncommerce or communications.'' It does not, however, expressly prohibit \nthe transmission of harmful computer viruses or programs from abroad, \neven though, a criminal armed with a modem and a computer can wreak \nhavoc on computers located in the United States from virtually anywhere \nin the world. This is a significant challenge in fighting cybercrime: \nThere are no borders or passport checkpoints in cyberspace. \nCommunications flow seamlessly through cyberspace across datelines and \nthe reach of local law enforcement.\n  Indeed, we have seen a number of examples of computer crimes directed \nfrom abroad, including the 1994 intrusion into the Rome Laboratory at \nGrifess Air Force Base in New York from the United Kingdom and the 1996 \nintrusion into Harvard University's computers from Buenos Aires, \nArgentina.\n  Additionally, the statute falls short of protecting our Government \nand financial institution computers from intrusive codes, such as \ncomputer viruses or worms. Generally, hacker intrusions that inject \nworms or viruses into a government or financial institution computer \nsystem, which is not used in \n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\ninterstate communications, are not federal offenses. The legislation \nwould change that limitation and extend federal protection from \nintentionally damaging viruses to government and financial institution \ncomputers, even if they are not used in interstate communications.\n\n  The NII Protection Act would close these loopholes. Under the \nlegislation, outside hackers--including those using foreign \ncommunications--and malicious insiders face criminal liability for \nintentionally damaging a computer. Outside hackers who break into a \ncomputer could also be punished for any reckless or other damage they \ncause by their trespass.\n  The current statute protects against computer abuses that cause \ncomputer ``damage'', a term that is defined to require either \nsignificant financial losses or potential impact on medical treatment. \nYet, the NII and other computer systems are used for access to critical \nservices such as emergency response systems, air traffic control, and \nthe electrical power systems. These infrastructures are heavily \ndependent on computers. A computer attack that damages those computers \ncould have significant repercussions for our public safety and our \nnational security. The definition of ``damage'' in the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse statute should be sufficiently broad to encompass these types \nof harm against which people should be protected. The NII Protection \nAct addresses this concern and broadens the definition of ``damage'' to \ninclude causing physical injury to any person and threatening the \npublic health or safety.\n  Finally, this legislation address a new and emerging problem of \ncomputer-age blackmail. This is a high-technology variation on old \nfashioned extortion. One case has been brought to my attention in which \na person threatened to crash a computer system unless he was given free \naccess to the system and an account. One can imagine situations in \nwhich hackers penetrate a system, encrypt a database and then demand \nmoney for the decoding key. This new provision would ensure law \nenforcement's ability to prosecute modern-day blackmailers, who \nthreaten to harm or shut down computer networks unless their extortion \ndemands are met.\n  Confronting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws, coupled with \ntough law enforcement, are critical for safeguarding the privacy, \nconfidentiality and reliability of our critical computer systems and \nnetworks. I commend the Attorney General and the prosecutors within the \nDepartment of Justice who have worked diligently on this legislation \nand for their continuing efforts to address this critical area of our \ncriminal law.\n  In sum, the NII Protection Act will provide much needed protection \nfor our Nation's critical information infrastructure by penalizing \nthose who abuse computers to damage computer networks, steal classified \nand valuable computer information, and commit other crimes on-line.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Carjacking \nCorrection Act of 1996, a bill I introduced earlier this year in the \nSenate, the companion of which, H.R. 3676, has now come over from the \nHouse. This bill adds an important clarification to the Federal \ncarjacking statute, to provide that a rape committed during a \ncarjacking should be considered a serious bodily injury.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Biden. He has long been a leader in \naddressing the threat of violence against women, and demonstrates that \nagain today.\n  I also want to thank Representative John Conyers, the ranking member \nof the House Judiciary Committee, who brought this matter to my \nattention, and has led the effort in the House for passage of this \nlegislation.\n  This correction to the law is necessitated by the fact that at least \none court has held that under the Federal carjacking statute, rape \nwould not constitute a serious bodily injury. Few crimes are as brutal, \nvicious, and harmful to the victim than rape by an armed thug. Yet, \nunder this interpretation, the sentencing enhancement for such injury \nmay not be applied to a carjacker who brutally rapes his victim.\n  In my view, Congress should act now to clarify the law in this \nregard. The bill I introduced this year, S. 2006, and its companion \nHouse bill, H.R. 3676, would do this by specifically including rape as \nserious bodily injury under the statute.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and anticipate its swift \npassage.\n  The bill (H.R. 3676) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                                S. 2006\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that this bill will soon \nbecome law. I commend my cosponsor, Senator Hatch, and I also commend \nRepresentative Conyers, who championed this bill over in the House, and \nwith whom I was proud to work on it.\n  A few months ago, the first circuit court of appeals made a mistake. \nIt made, in my view, a very big mistake: It said that the term \n``serious bodily injury'' in one of our Federal statutes does not \ninclude rape.\n  Let me tell you about the case. One night near midnight, a woman went \nto her car after work. While she was getting something out of the back \nseat, a man with a knife came up from behind and forced her back into \nthe car. He drove her to a remote beach, ordered her to take off her \nclothes, and made her squat down on her hands and knees.\n  Then he raped her. After the rape, he drove off in her car, leaving \nher alone on the side of the road.\n  The man was convicted under the Federal carjacking statute. That \nstatute provides for an enhanced sentence of up to 25 years if the \ndefendant inflicts ``serious bodily injury'' in the course of a \ncarjacking.\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\n  When it got time to sentence the defendant, the prosecutor asked the \ncourt to enhance the sentence because of the rape. Mind you, there was \nno dispute that the defendant had, in fact, raped the victim.\n  The trial judge agreed with the prosecutor, and gave the defendant \nthe statutory 25 years maximum, finding that the rape constituted \n``serious bodily injury.''\n  But when the case went up to the first circuit, that court said \n``no''--rape is not serious bodily injury. To support its ruling, and \nI'm now quoting the opinion, the court said that ``There was no \nevidence of any cuts or bruises in her vaginal area.''\n  That, in my view, is absolutely outrageous--and Senator Hatch and I \nproposed this bill to set matters straight.\n  Under the code, ``serious bodily injury'' has several definitions. It \nincludes: a substantial risk of death; protracted and obvious \ndisfigurement; protracted loss or impairment of a bodily part or mental \nfaculty; and it also includes extreme physical pain.\n  It takes no great leap of logic to see that a rape involves extreme \nphysical pain. and I would go so far as to say that only a panel of \nmale judges could fail to make that leap and even think--let alone \nrule--that rape does not involve extreme pain.\n  Rape is one of the most brutal and serious crimes any woman can \nexperience. It is a violation of the first order, but it has all too \noften been treated like a second class crime. According to a report I \nissued a few years ago, a robber is 30 percent more likely to be \nconvicted than a rapist; a rape prosecution is more than twice as \nlikely as a murder prosecution to be dismissed; a convicted rapist is \n50 percent more likely to receive probation than a convicted robber.\n  No crime carries a perfect record of arrest, prosecution, and \nincarceration--but the record for rape is especially wanting.\n  And this first circuit decision helps explain why: too often, our \ncriminal justice system just doesn't get it.\n  If the first circuit decision were allowed to stand, it would mean \nthat a criminal would spend more time behind bars for breaking a man's \narm than for raping a woman.\n  For 5 long years, I worked to pass a piece of legislation that I have \ncared about like no other: The Violence Against Women Act. The act does \na great many practical things:\n  It funds more police and prosecutors specially trained and devoted to \ncombating rape and family violence;\n  It trains police, prosecutors, and judges in the ways of rape and \nfamily violence--so they can better understand and respond to the \nproblem;\n  It provides shelters for more than 60,000 battered women and their \nchildren;\n  It provides extra lighting and emergency phones in subways, bus \nstops, and parks;\n  It provides for more rape crises centers;\n  It set up a national hotline that battered women can call around the \nclock--to get advice and counseling when they are in the throes of a \ncrisis;\n  And we're getting rape education efforts going with our young \npeople--so we can break the cycle of violence before it gets started.\n  But the Violence Against Women Act also meant to do something else, \nbeyond these concrete measures: it also sent a clarion call across our \nland that crimes against women will no longer be treated as second \nclass crimes.\n  For too long, the victims of these crimes have been seen not as \ninnocent targets of brutality, but as participants who somehow bear \nshame or even some responsibility for the violence.\n  This is especially true when it comes to victims who know their \nassailants. For too long, we have been quick to call theirs a private \nmisfortune rather than a public disgrace. We have viewed the crime as \nless than criminal, the abuser less than culpable, and the victim less \nthan worthy of justice.\n  We must remain ever vigilant in our efforts to make our streets and \nour neighborhoods and our homes safe for women.\n  And we need to make sure--right now--that no judge ever misreads the \ncarjacking statute again. With this bill, we are telling them that we \nintend, that we always intended, for those words ``serious bodily \ninjury'' to mean rape--no if's, and's or but's.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  The bill (S. 2007) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed; as follows:\n\n                                S. 2007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3802, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3802) to amend section 552 of title 5, United \n     States Code, popularly known as the Freedom of Information \n     Act, to provide public access to information in an electronic \n     format, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that we have today reached \nfinal passage of important amendments to the Freedom of Information Act \nthat will bring the FOIA into the electronic age. Sending these \namendments to the President for enactment is a tremendous way to mark \nthe 30th anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act.\n  The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the right of \nAmericans to know what their government is doing--or not doing. As \nPresident Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of \nInformation Act into law:\n\n       This legislation springs from one of our most essential \n     principles: A democracy works best when the people have all \n     the information that the security of the Nation permits.\n\n  Just over the past few months, records released under the FOIA have \nrevealed FAA actions against Valujet before the May 11 crash in the \nEverglades, the government's treatment of South Vietnamese commandos \nwho fought in a CIA-sponsored army in the early 1960's, the high \nsalaries paid to independent counsels, the unsafe lead content of D.C. \ntap water, and the types of tax cases that the IRS recommends for \ncriminal prosecution.\n  In the 30 years since the Freedom of Information Act became law, \ntechnology has dramatically altered the way government handles and \nstores information. Gone are the days when agency records were solely \non paper stuffed into file cabinets. Instead, agencies depend on \npersonal computers, computer databases and electronic storage media, \nsuch as CD--ROM's, to carry out their mission.\n  The time is long overdue to update this law to address new issues \nrelated to the increased use of computers by Federal agencies. \nComputers are just as ubiquitous in Federal agency offices as in the \nprivate sector. We need to make clear that the FOIA is not just a right \nto know what's on paper law, but that it applies equally to electronic \nrecords.\n  That is why Senator Brown, Senator Kerry and I, with the strong \nsupport of many library, press, civil liberties, consumer and research \ngroups, have pushed for passage of the Electronic FOIA bill. The Senate \nrecognized the need to update the FOIA in the last Congress by passing \nan earlier version of this bill.\n  This legislation takes steps so that agencies use technology to make \ngovernment more accessible and accountable to its citizens. Storing \ngovernment information on computers should actually make it easier to \nprovide public access to information in more meaningful formats. For \nexample, people with sight or hearing impairments can use special \ncomputer programs to translate electronic information into braille or \nlarge print or synthetic speech output.\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\n  Electronic records also make it possible to provide dial-up access to \nany citizen who can use computer networks, such as the Internet. Those \nAmericans living in the remotest rural area in Vermont, or in a distant \nState far from Federal agencies' public reading rooms here in \nWashington, DC, should be able to use computer networks to get direct \naccess to the warehouse of unclassified information stored in \ngovernment computer banks. The explosion of the Internet adds \nenormously to the need for clarification of the status of electronic \ngovernment records under the FOIA and the significance of this \nlegislation for citizen access. These amendments to the FOIA will \nencourage Federal agencies to use the Internet to increase access to \nGovernment records for all Americans.\n  Ensuring public access to electronic government records is not just \nimportant for broader citizen access. Information is a valuable \ncommodity and the Federal Government is probably the largest single \nproducer and repository of accurate information. This Government \ninformation is a national resource that commercial companies pay for \nunder the FOIA, add value to, and then sell--creating jobs and \ngenerating revenue in the process. It is important for our economy and \nfor American competitiveness that fast, easy access to that resource in \nelectronic form be available. The electronic FOIA bill would contribute \nto our information economy.\n  I would like to highlight some of what this bill would accomplish. \nFirst, it would require agencies to provide records in a requested \nformat whenever possible. Second, the bill would encourage agencies to \nincrease on-line access to government records that agencies currently \nput in their public reading rooms. These records would include copies \nof records that are the subject of repeated FOIA requests.\n  Finally, the bill would address the biggest single complaint of \npeople making FOIA requests: delays in getting a response. I understand \nthat at the FBI, the delays can stretch to over 4 years. Because of \nthese delays, writers, students and teachers and others working under \ntime deadlines, have been frustrated in using FOIA to meet their \nresearch needs. Long delays in access can mean no access at all.\n  The current time limits in the FOIA are a joke. Few agencies actually \nrespond to FOIA requests within the 10-day limit required in the law. \nSuch routine failure to comply with the statutory time limits is bad \nfor morale in the agencies and breeds contempt by citizens who expect \ngovernment officials to abide by, not routinely break, the law.\n\n  I appreciate the budget and resource constraints under which agencies \nare operating. We have made every effort in this bill to make sure it \nworks for both agencies and requestors. Some agencies, particularly \nthose with huge backlogs of FOIA requests resulting in delays of up to \nfour years for an agency response, are concerned that the bill removes \nbacklogs as an automatic excuse to ignore the time limits. But we \nshould not give agencies an incentive to create backlogs. Agencies will \nhave to show that they are taking steps to reduce their backlogs before \nthey qualify for additional time to respond to a FOIA request.\n  While increased computer access to government records may necessitate \nan initial outlay of money and effort, as more information is made \navailable on-line, the labor intensive task of physically searching and \nproducing documents should be reduced. The net result should be \nincreased efficiency in satisfying agency FOIA obligations, reduced \npaperwork burdens, reduced errors and better service to the public.\n  The Electronic FOIA bill should help agencies comply with the law's \ntime limits by doubling the ten-day time limit to give agencies a more \nrealistic time period for responding to FOIA requests, making more \ninformation available on-line, requiring the use of better record \nmanagement techniques, such as multi-track processing, and providing \nexpedited access to requestors who demonstrate a compelling need for a \nspeedy response.\n  All these steps, and others in the bill, may not provide a total cure \nbut should help reduce the endemic delay problems.\n  This legislation has had a lengthy germination. Senator Brown and I \nfirst introduced the bill in the 102d Congress, when I chaired \nextensive hearings on the bill. We introduced the legislation again in \nthe 103d Congress, and saw the bill pass through the Judiciary Commitee \nand then the Senate only to falter in the House of Representatives. In \nthis Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee again considered this \nlegislation, reported it favorably, and the Senate has passed it for \nthe second time, bringing us to final passage of the legislation.\n  I commend members of the House Government Reform and Oversight \nSubcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology, and, \nin particular, Chairman Horn, Ranking Member Maloney, and \nRepresentatives Tate and Peterson, for taking up the challenge and \nmoving this legislation this year. They saw this bill for what it is: a \ngood government issue, not a partisan one.\n  We have worked diligently to sort out any differences in the House \nand Senate bills, and we can all be proud of the final product \nreflected in the final legislation passed today. I want to specially \nthank Chairman Hatch and Chairman Specter for their cooperation in \nmoving this bill through Committee and the staffs from the House and \nSenate. In particular, Mark Uncafer, Janie Kong and David McMillan from \nthe House, and David Miller, Richard Hertling, Manus Cooney, and \nElizabeth Kessler from the Senate, as well as my own Judiciary \nCommittee staff, should be applauded for their hard work on this \nlegislation and making sure the process worked.\n\n  I also want to commend the following organizations because without \ntheir support over the years, it would have been much more difficult to \npass this legislation: the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the \nNewspaper Association of America, the National Newspaper Association, \nthe Association of American Publishers, Radio and TV News Directors \nAssociation, the Society of Professional Journalists, the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters, Public Citizen, OMB Watch, American \nLibrary Association, the National Security Archive, the Federation of \nAmerican Scientists, the ACLU, the Fund for Constitutional Government, \nthe Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Electronic Frontier \nFoundation, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology, and Americans for Tax Reform.\n  Finally, I want to thank Sally Katzen, the Administrator of the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB, for the time and \neffort she committed to working through the many concerns of Federal \nagencies who institutionally resist change in this area.\n  Even as we have worked on this legislation, new issues about the \ncoverage of the FOIA have surfaced. I refer specifically to the recent \nD.C. Court of Appeals case that decided that the National Security \nCouncil is not an ``agency'' subject to the FOIA, despite the fact that \nthe NSC has complied with the FOIA for years under both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents. Litigation on this matter continues and the case \nmay now go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Clarification of the offices \nwithin the White House that are subject to the FOIA may be a matter \nrequiring congressional attention in the next Congress.\n  As the Federal government increasingly maintains its records in \nelectronic form, we need to make sure that this information is \navailable to citizens on the same basis as information in paper files. \nEnactment of the Electronic Freedom of Information amendments of 1996 \nwill fulfill the promise first made thirty years ago in the FOIA that \ncitizens have a right to know and a right to see the records the \ngovernment collects with their tax dollars.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read for a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 503, S. 1831.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1831) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and \n     1999 for the National Transportation Safety Board, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate S. \n1831, the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments of 1996. This \nbill is sponsored by myself, along with Senators Hollings, Lott, Ford, \nand Stevens. As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I urge swift passage of this bipartisan reauthorization \nbill.\n  Mr. President, the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] is one \nof our government's most important independent agencies. Its statutory \nmission is to determine the probable cause of transportation accidents \nand to promote transportation safety. The NTSB is world renown for its \ntimely and expert determinations of accident causation and for issuing \nrealistic and feasible safety recommendations.\n  The NTSB investigates all types of transportation accidents and \nincidents. It also conducts transportation safety studies and evaluates \nthe effectiveness of other government agencies' programs for preventing \ntransportation accidents. Indeed, its work product is critical.\n  As my colleagues are acutely aware, the NTSB is faced with an \nextremely heavy workload. In addition to investigating the two most \nrecent major aviation accidents, TWA flight 800 and ValuJet flight 592, \nthe NTSB continues its work on several other major on-going \ninvestigations, including the USAir accident near Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania, the school bus/train collision in Fox River Grove, \nIllinois, and the MARC commuter Train/Amtrak collision near Silver \nSpring, MD. Many other investigations also are underway.\n  Mr. President, the NTSB's authorization expires at the end of fiscal \nyear 1996--the end of this month. Earlier this year, the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on \nissues relating to reauthorization of the NTSB. On June 4, 1996, S. \n1831 was introduced. It was ordered reported by a unanimous vote of the \nCommerce Committee on June 6, 1996.\n  S. 1831 provides a three year authorization of appropriations for \nfiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999 at a level of 370 FTEs. It establishes \nsufficient funding levels to enable the NTSB to carry out its immense \nworkload, yet does so in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  The bill also includes a few minor statutory changes as requested by \nthe NTSB. First, the bill provides a temporary deferral of Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA) requests regarding the release of foreign \naviation accident or incident information for 2 years or until the \nforeign government leading the investigation approves the release of \nthe information. This would apply to NTSB participation in foreign \naccident investigations only. Additionally, the NTSB would not be \nrestricted from utilizing foreign accident investigation information in \nmaking safety recommendations.\n  Mr. President, the December 1995 American Airlines accident in \nColombia is a good example of the kind of problem this provision seeks \nto remedy. Because of the location of the accident, the Colombian \ngovernment is leading the investigation and the NTSB is participating. \nAs a participant, NTSB has complete access to accident information, but \nthe Government of Colombia--as lead investigator--determines when any \ninformation can be released. Since NTSB is covered by FOIA, any \ninformation in the Board's possession could be requested under FOIA. To \navoid releasing information prior to the Colombian government's \napproval, I am told the NTSB avoids bringing any accident information \ninto its actual possession and control. This hampers NTSB's ability to \neffectively assist in the investigation of this type of accident.\n\n  Second, the legislation creates a statutory exemption from FOIA for \naviation data voluntarily supplied to the NTSB. The aviation industry \ncurrently generates a wealth of information not required to be \ncollected by the government. While this data could be extremely useful \nto the NTSB, the industry is reluctant to share it because of concerns \nit will be released to the public through FOIA requests. This provision \nis designed to encourage the aviation industry to more freely share \nsignificant safety-related data with the Board.\n  Finally, S. 1831 grants authority to the Board to charge non-NTSB \npersonnel attending its training courses for the costs associated with \ntheir attendance.\n  The NTSB carries out an enormously important public service. They do \nadmirable work and deserve our full support. This legislation will \nensure the NTSB can continue its essential work in an efficient manner.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering to S. 1831 is almost \nidentical to S. 1957, the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation \nAmendments Act of 1996, which I introduced on July 16, 1996. It is \ndesigned to give motor carriers the information necessary to prevent \nthe carriage of overweight intermodal containers. S. 1957, cosponsored \nby Senators Lott, Inouye and Breaux, is a bipartisan technical \ncorrections bill to the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of \n1992.\n\n  To address legitimate concerns raised by shippers and carriers about \nimplementation of the 1992 Act, including timely compliance and the \nneed for world-wide education, this amendment would help streamline the \nimplementation process. It would reduce unnecessary paperwork \nrequirements that otherwise would be imposed and allow greater use of \nelectronic interchange technology to expedite the transfer of \ninformation. It also would eliminate needless compliance burdens on \nsmaller shipments, yet ensure the intent of the 1992 Act is not \njeopardized.\n  Mr. President, overweight vehicles impair safety and cause severe \ndamage to our nation's highway infrastructure. The purpose of the 1992 \nAct was to help prevent the operation of overweight vehicles on our \nnation's roads and highways. This amendment would help ensure the \npurpose of the 1992 Act is carried out by allowing the law to be \nimplemented in a reasonable manner.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is critical to the future of intermodal \ntransportation. I urge its adoption and passage of S. 1831.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the passage of S. 1831, which reauthorizes \nthe National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] is a very important \nmatter.\n  One cannot watch television lately without seeing the NTSB in action. \nEveryone knows that the NTSB is the primary agency responsible for \ninvestigating each accident. When an accident occurs, it is the NTSB's \njob to secure the scene, and coordinate all activities. The Board has \nspent and is still spending countless hours trying to figure out the \nTWA crash off of Long Island, the ValuJet crash in Florida, the USAir \ncrash in Pittsburgh, the American crash in Cali, Colombia, and the \ncrash of Ron Brown's plane in Croatia, to name but a few. No matter \nwhat the circumstances of any accident, the NTSB is always there to \nfulfill their vital role. The Board's work in other transportation \nareas also continues. Rail, highway, and maritime accidents continue to \nreceive the care and attention of the NTSB needed to make our \ntransportation system safer.\n  I would like to commend all the NTSB staff and its Board members for \ntheir fine work and dedication. While we often recognize the Chairman \nof the Board, Jim Hall, and the Vice Chairman, Bob Francis, they know \nthe quality of the NTSB employees. The staff's efforts are really an \nexample of public service at its very best.\n  The President has also given the NTSB a new role. The NTSB has been \ndesignated as the lead agency for providing information and \ncoordinating services for the families of victims of aviation \ndisasters. This is a key role. The NTSB may require additional \nresources, and we may need to revisit the issue next year.\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\n  The bill before us today ensures that the NTSB will be able to \ncontinue carrying out its mandate. The bill provides $42.4 million for \nfiscal year 1997, $44.4 million for fiscal year 1998, and $46.6 million \nfor fiscal year 1999. The bill authorizes 370 FTE's, an additional 20 \nFTE's from the original request submitted by the administration. It is \nclear from seeing the demands placed on the NTSB that the additional \nstaff are needed.\n  As a cosponsor of the bill, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1831 which is \nsimilar to H.R. 3152 which the Senate will pass tonight. Title I of \nthis bill reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB]. \nThe NTSB plays an integral role in the transportation life of this \nnation and it deserves our continued support and respect. The NTSB has \nover many years acquitted itself in determining the cause of \ntransportation accidents and recommending actions to prevent \nrepetitions of these accidents. Particularly over the last several \nmonths NTSB has shown the World its professionalism. I wish to note my \nfirm support for the agency its members and its personnel and assure \nthem and this body of my continued support for an appropriation that \nallows it to accomplish its mission. Safety is the highest mission any \nagency can have and the NTSB clearly is a lead agency in ensuring the \nsafety of the travelling public.\n  I also support title II of S. 1831, which contains the Intermodal \nSafe Container Transportation Amendments Act of 1996. These amendments \nmodify the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992, Public \nLaw 102-548 in an effort to strengthen that legislation. These \namendments have been crafted in a true bipartisan manner. The Commerce \nCommittee staff has crafted these amendments with industry \nrepresentatives and in consultation with the Department of \nTransportation. In fact, these amendments are supported by a wide range \nof transportation and shipper interests. Carriers of every \ntransportation mode have written in support of these amendments. In \naddition, the Nation's largest shipper associations and the nation's \nports also support this effort.\n\n  These amendments will prevent cargo at the Nation's ports from simply \nlying at those ports and ensure rather that cargo speeds to its \ndestination. Under the original legislation, cargo in containers \nweighing over 10,000 pounds would have to be certified, in writing, by \nthe shipper before the container could leave the port for its next \ndestination. The truck driver or the rail carrier taking the container \nto its next destination would be required to carry that certification \nand subject to a fine if he or she is caught without this piece of \npaper. Potentially, the certification could be delayed, or in the case \nof international cargo there could be delayed, or in the case of \ninternational cargo there could be confusion as to the requirement for \na certificate. Should a container not have a certificate it would be \nrequired to stay at the port or at the point of shipment clogging the \nport and delaying delivery of critical time sensitive cargo.\n  These amendments clarify and simplify the procedures for \ncertification. One provision of these amendments prevents delay and \nconfusion by the simple expedient of raising the certification \nrequirement to 29,000 pounds. Certification as to the weight of the \ncontainer will be required if its weight is in excess of that amount. \nWith this provision fewer containers will be required to remain at port \nor point of shipment awaiting certification.\n  Another provision dispenses with the requirement that the \ncertification be carried with the container. Instead, the information \non the certification will be required to be made available on request. \nThus, police officers or state officials requesting the certification \ninformation could access it by fax or other electronic means. The \ninformation would be provided without the unnecessarily delaying \ntransport.\n  It is important to note what these amendments do not do. They do not \nin anyway alter any State or Federal law limiting the amount of weight \na motor carrier or rail carrier may carry. Likewise, the amendments do \nnot change current limits concerning the amount of hazardous materials \na carrier may transport. These limits are left intact. It bears \nrepeating: These amendments do not change any law respecting the \ntransportation of hazardous materials or place any additional burden on \nthe Nation's highway and bridges.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering \nS. 1831, a bill which reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety \nBoard [NTSB].\n  As we know, all too well I might add, the NTSB is required to \ninvestigate transportation accidents. It is called upon immediately \nfollowing a transportation catastrophe to send out the right people to \ncarry out a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding each event. We can see evidence of NTSB investigators \ncarrying out this mandate every day on the news as they continue the \ngrim task of investigating the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of \nLong Island. This inquiry is being conducted simultaneously with the \nValuJet Flight 592 investigation in the Everglades. The NTSB is asked \nrepeatedly to assist in investigations overseas such as the one a few \nmonths ago in Croatia where my good friend Ron Brown was killed in a \nmilitary plane crash. When a barge hits a railroad bridge, or a train \ncollides with another train, the NTSB is called upon to figure out what \nhappened, and more importantly, to figure out how to prevent tragedies \nfrom recurring.\n  Concerning TWA Flight 800, the NTSB is working with local and State \nofficials, the FBI, the Navy, and most importantly, with the families. \nThe investigation is a painstaking, detailed process--literally \nrequiring divers to pick up by hand the wreckage 110 feet below the \nsurface. The divers, working in teams, have done an extraordinary job \nto facilitate the NTSB's investigation. Teamwork is essential and the \nefforts of all involved are very much appreciated.\n  The NTSB does excellent work. I would especially like to commend its \nChairman Jim Hall and Vice Chairman Robert Francis for all their hard \nwork and dedication. Their service on the NTSB could not have come at a \nmore critical time, and I appreciate their great efforts as well as \nthose of the other members of the Board and all the NTSB staff.\n  As I have said before, if this were a perfect world, we would not \nneed the NTSB. But as we have seen all too well in the last few months, \nwe need the NTSB now more than ever. Ensuring the safety of our \ntransportation system is of primary importance, and I believe passage \nof this bill is vital to that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill that \nreauthorizes the operations of the National Transportation Safety Board \n[NTSB]. The NTSB is an extremely important Federal agency, as evidenced \nby their professionalism in the investigation of the recent Valujet and \nTWA airplane disasters. Safety should be one of the paramount \ntransportations issues confronting the Federal Government, and the \nFederal Government's paramount transportation safety agency is the \nNTSB. The NTSB deserves our support.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that the NTSB reauthorization has \nbeen amended to include a new Title II, which would add the provisions \nof S. 1957, the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act Amendments \nAct. The Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Amendments Act is a \nbill which would address some of the problems which were created with \nthe 1992 enactment of the original Intermodal Safe Container \nTransportation Act.\n  The purpose for enacting the original Intermodal Safe Container \nTransportation Act was to ensure that intermodal shipping containers \nwere not exceeding certain weight limitations. Overweight shipping \ncontainers constitute a significant threat to the safety of our Nations \ninfrastructure. The principals of the original enactment were sound. \nUnfortunately, the implementation of that original Intermodal Safe \nContainer Act has the potential to unnecessarily create a number of \nproblems that could impede the transfer of intermodal containers and \naffect our international and domestic intermodal trade.\n  A coalition of ocean shipping companies, trucking companies, railroad\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\ncompanies, ports and shippings have worked hard to develop a \nlegislative proposal to address the problems that could be caused \nthrough the implementation of the original law. Senate Commerce \nCommittee staff has worked to further refine the industry proposal. I \nbelieve that the provisions embodies in S. 1957, balance the interests \nof all segments of the transportation community, while at the same time \npreserving the original bill's intent to protect our infrastructure \nfrom overweight containers. This bill in no way impedes the application \nof current laws governing the safe transportation of hazardous \nmaterials\n  As a Senator from the State of Louisiana, who represents the Port of \nthe New Orleans, I understand the special importance of continuing to \nfacilitate international and domestic trade in as safe a manner as \npossible. I urge my colleagues to support the NTSB reauthorization \nbill, and to help facilitate the implementation of the Intermodal Safe \nContained Transportation Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5390\n\n(Purpose: To amend chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, relating \n              to intermodal safe container transportation)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Pressler has an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Pressler, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5390.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
