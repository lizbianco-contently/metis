Mr. President, for a number of days I have been \nsharing with my colleagues my observations on the opening of the Arctic \noil reserve, or ANWR. Briefly, for those Members who are not familiar \nwith this, let me just do a quick review. In the Congress and in the \nreconciliation package in both the House and the Senate is the \nauthority to initiate a lease-sale in ANWR. There are many \nmisconceptions relative to the proposal because a number of people \nbelieve that the entire area is at risk.\n  This area in green, including the yellow area, consists of about 19 \nmillion acres. That is an area the size of the State of South Carolina. \nIn 1980, Congress withdrew and set in permanent status the green area, \nconsisting of 8 million acres of wilderness, which is shown in green \nand black here, and another 9\\1/2\\ million acres of refuge, leaving the \ncoastal plain for disposition by the Congress.\n  This area in red is the area retained by the Eskimo people of the \nvillage of Kaktovic. You will notice that they have no access out of \nthat area other than into the coastal plain which is Federal land. The \nlease-sale we are talking about is a proposal to lease 300,000 acres \nout of this million and a half acres because the other 17 million acres \nhas already been withdrawn. So we are talking about a very small area.\n  To suggest that the entire area is at risk clearly is a \nmisinterpretation of the facts. We log our telephone calls in our \noffice, as do most Members of the Senate, because it is important that \nwe have public reaction. It is kind of interesting to note that, as \ncalls come in relative to my speaking on this issue, there is a \nperception that we in Alaska are initiating an activity that somehow is \nirregular or a departure from what is happening in other States. I can \nonly respond to that by suggesting that our State has only been a State \nfor 36 years.\n\n[[Page S 16714]]\n\n  As a consequence, we are today establishing our land patterns in this \nhuge area of Alaska, which is one-fifth the size of the United States. \nIt has 33,000 miles of coastline. Other States were established--such \nas the State of Virginia, nearly 200 years ago, and Washington, Oregon, \nCalifornia, 100 years ago. So as a ``new kid on the block,'' so to \nspeak, as we attempt to develop resources, whether it be timber, fish, \noil and gas, or mining, we are trying to take advantage of the science \nand technology that is available today and learn from the mistakes of \nothers and balance and develop an economy.\n  I do not think many people have a total understanding or an \nappreciation of that. They think that the limited development in Alaska \nis somehow not in keeping with the times. The reality is that we have \nto have natural resources, develop those natural resources. We have a \njob base, and those jobs are high-paying jobs in construction, timber, \nmining, oil and gas. If we do not develop those resources, we simply \nget the materials from other countries, export our jobs overseas and \nexport our dollars.\n  The significance of developing this area is that geologists tell us \nthis is where a major discovery might be made. Because Prudhoe Bay is \nin decline--this area has been producing 25 percent of the total crude \noil produced in the United States in the last 18 years. As this area \ndeclines, the question is: Can we, or should we, replace it by bringing \non line this area, the small footprint here in the coastal plain known \nas ANWR?\n  Clearly, we can do it safely. We have been able to develop Prudhoe \nBay. We have developed an 800-mile pipeline. We had a bad accident with \nthe Exxon Valdez vessel, but that is something that had nothing to do \nwith a pipeline. It was one of those human failures. The ship went \naground in a 10\\1/2\\-mile channel.\n  The point I want to make here this morning, Mr. President, is that we \ndeveloped a small field adjacent to Prudhoe Bay 10 years ago. That was \nthe 10th largest producing field. History tells us that if the oil is \nhere, they can develop it in about 2,000 acres. To get back to some of \nthe comments which I think have prompted me to try and give a little \nmore explanation as to why Alaska should be attempting to develop its \nenergy resources, there are suggestions that somehow we are beholden to \nan oil lobby as a delegation, that we should be giving more concern to \nthe environment, that they think we have financial ties to the oil \ncompanies.\n\n  One woman indicated she felt so strongly about it that she had worked \nto get a moratorium on elephants in Africa and she was going to go to \nwork to make sure we got a moratorium not to develop oil in Alaska.\n  I would like to think that these people who are obviously very \ninterested would have a full understanding of the implications and an \nargument relative to the pros and cons of responsible development.\n  With that background, let me just proceed briefly, because I think \nthat there is need for some reflection on what Congress intended in \n1980. The name of Senator Scoop Jackson of Washington is familiar to \nall Members of the Congress. He was a beloved and long-time Member of \nthis body. It was at his insistence that this area, the 1002 area, be \nleft out of the wilderness area and the refuge withdrawals to be setup \nspecifically for Congress to address the prospects of oil and gas. That \nwas done in 1980, Mr. President.\n  As a consequence of that, now is the time for the decision to be \nmade, and since it is in the reconciliation package, we look forward to \ndiscussing the merits.\n  One of the most significant considerations is the reality that this \nNation is now 51 percent dependent on imported oil. That oil comes in \nfrom the Mideast, and of course we send the dollars and the jobs to the \nMideast.\n  In the last few days we have seen a crisis in the Mideast, a very \nunfortunate situation, but, nevertheless, it proves the frailty of that \npart of the world, and our increased dependence on oil eventually will \nresult in some kind of a crisis occurring as we look at Iran, Iraq, \nLibya and their moves toward nationalism.\n  It is kind of interesting to reflect on the attitude of some of the \nopinion-makers that have had a responsibility with regard to our \nincreasing dependence on imported oil.\n  Former President Carter's Energy Secretary Schlesinger has testified \nin support of developing this area, stating that we can develop it \nsafely, that we should reduce our dependence on imported oil.\n  Some of the Orthodox Jewish organizations in the United States are \nthe biggest supporters. They see increased dependence on the Arab \nStates as a threat to Israel's security interests. Union support--the \nsignificance of what this activity would generate for America unions; \nit would be the largest concentration of construction in North America. \nThe Teamsters, the laborers, the IBEW, the maritime unions all support \nthis. This is a significant job issue.\n  It is estimated that the lease sale would bring about $2.6 billion in \nrevenue. That revenue, half of which would go to the Federal \nGovernment, the other half to the State of Alaska, would be raised in \nthe private sector of the United States without one cent of Government \nfunding.\n  Now, there is a suggestion that some Alaskans do not support ANWR, \nsome of the Native people in Alaska do not support opening.\n  Mr. President, I want to take that fiction and state it factually. \nThe Alaska Federation of Natives, which is the native organization in \nour State, voted two to one in favor of opening the area. I think it is \nunfortunate that the Secretary of the Interior, as he represents and \nhas an obligation to represent all the Native people of our State, has \nchosen to represent a very small segment, the Gwich'ins, representing \nabout 1 percent of the Native people in Alaska. The Gwich'ins are \nfearful that the Porcupine caribou will somehow be at stake. The \njustification for that is not supported by any evidence as I will show \nin the next chart.\n  This happens to be a picture taken of Prudhoe Bay which shows the oil \npipeline, shows a well being drilled, and it shows a number of caribou, \npointing out the reality that the caribou are very adaptable.\n  To suggest that the porcupine caribou cannot be managed by a joint \nmanagement team of the Gwich'ins, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nand the State department of fish and game is not based on any factual \nevidence by any means.\n  That herd is about 165,000. Most of the animals, about 4,000, are \ntaken by the Canadian Gwich'ins on the Canadian side and 400 by the \nAlaskan Gwich'ins.\n  The point is, as we look at the development of this area, there are \nhuge areas of wilderness and refuge that will be protected forever, and \nthat the Alaska delegation stands behind them. Again, the footprint is \n.1 of 1 percent of the area, about 2,000 to 3,000 acres at the maximum.\n  Let me just talk a little bit more about the caribou because it has a \nwarm and cuddly aspect to it, as it should. The caribou range over vast \nareas and their range is dependent on basically three factors. One is \npredators. If there are a number of predators, or the predators are at \nan all-time high, like the wolf, obviously it will have an effect on \nthe young caribou. The winter kill is a consequence of a tough winter, \nresulting in a decline of the herd. There is overgrazing, which will \nalso cause a decline in the herd.\n  As a consequence, it is fair to say of the approximately 34 herds in \nAlaska, two-thirds of them are on an increase, about 10 percent are on \na decline, and the rest of them are stagnant but cyclical, as many of \nthe ranging land animals in the wild.\n  Now, we also have a presumption by the Secretary of the Interior that \nhe is protecting our future by blocking access to opening up this area. \nI suggest the Secretary of Interior is actually gambling with our \nfuture.\n  We sent troops to the Persian Gulf. We recall the gas lines in the \n1970's. We are exporting our dollars and jobs. We are making less \nenvironmentally conscious nations produce oil.\n  Another fiction is this is a battle between rich and greedy oil \ncompanies and poor and saintly environmental groups. I want to talk \nabout some of the environmental groups tomorrow, Mr. President. \nEnvironmentalism in the United States is big business. There is nothing \nwrong with it. We \n\n[[Page S 16715]]\nshould recognize it simply for what it is.\n  Now, the oil industry is big business in the United States. It \nprovides jobs. It provides our Nation with energy security, as well.\n  We should not kid ourselves. The battle here is in many aspects \nbetween the very rich national environmental lobbyists and some of our \npoor Alaska Native people who want alternative lifestyles. They want to \nhave running water. They want to have sewage disposal rather than honey \nbuckets. They want to have jobs. They want to relieve themselves of the \ndependence on welfare. They are being deprived of these opportunities \nby the suggestion that we cannot open up this area safely.\n  Sometimes we see a double standard, a standard that suggests that \nthis idealistic election of not allowing responsible development--there \nis no consideration of the human element, there is no consideration of \nthe people that live in the area of what they feel they should have is \na right to a job, a right to a good education, a right to have a future \nfor their children, other than welfare.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, there is one overwhelming fact in \nthis debate. All Americans stand to benefit from ANWR \nexploration. Those benefits are: Jobs, as I have already outlined; \nsecurity, by eliminating the necessity of our increased dependence on \nimported oil, which is already 51 percent. We can do it without any \nsignificant harm to the environment, using our technology, our \nengineering skills, our can-do capability. And one other item that this \nbody spends a lot of time and effort on, and that is the concern over \nthe deficit, balance of payments. In other words, the fact we are \nbuying more overseas than people are buying from us.\n\n  What is that deficit made up of? Nearly $56 billion, half of it, is \nthe price of imported oil. The other half is our trade imbalance with \nJapan. So, here we have, in this particular issue, responsibly opening \nup this area in our State with a very small footprint, utilizing our \ntechnological capability, an opportunity to address some concerns that \nwe all have--jobs, national security, the ability to develop this in \nharmony with the environment, and an opportunity to balance the budget.\n  I was also considering the merits of two articles that appeared in \nthe Wall Street Journal and New York Times on October 27. They both \nconcern themselves with the increase in the price of oil, to show you \nhow fragile the world of oil is relative to any crisis that exists \nthroughout the world. We have seen crises in the Mideast in the last \nfew days, but we are also seeing one in Russia. ``Concerns About \nYeltsin's Health Help To Push Oil Prices Higher.'' ``Prices of Oil \nFutures Jump on Report of Yeltsin Having Health Problems.'' Clearly, \nthe former Soviet Union has a tremendous capability to produce oil. On \nthe other hand, their infrastructure is such it is not a very \nattractive market.\n  Finally, let me just comment on one point relative to the people of \nthe area, because the people of the area are so often left out of any \nequation that affects the environment or the ecology.\n  The people of Kaktovik, the people of Point Barrow, the Eskimo \npeople, these are people working their way out of Federal dependency. \nBecause of our success, we are now opposed, seemingly at every turn, \nby, among others, a Secretary for Indian Affairs, Ada Deer. She now has \ngone on record as opposing successful Native corporations and \norganizations that are developing the resources in our State. She wants \nus to go back, and our people to go back, and be dependent on the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. But, as we have seen, dependency brings \ndespondence, it brings a dependence, it kills self-initiative, it \nbreeds a welfare society. Alaska's Native and Eskimo people want to \nfollow the American way, the way of independence, the way of self-help, \nindividual responsibility, family values, a sense of community. Yet we \nare seeing spokespersons, including the Secretary of the Interior and \nAda Deer, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, actively opposing \nthis development in the area where these people live.\n  This is a tragic day, in a sense, for the nearly 8,000 Eskimo people, \nbecause this is the first time any Secretary of the Interior has \nrejected his trust responsibility to pursue the naked political \nobjectives of those opposed to the interests of Native Americans. It \nseems like the Secretary is almost penalizing hard work and success. On \none hand they champion dependency, welfare and allegiance to an \nincompetent Bureau of Indian Affairs. Then, on the other, they put \ncommercial fundraising interests of environmental organization over \nthose of the Eskimo people who need help, who need this opportunity.\n  So, we see an administration, now, that opposes opening the coastal \nplain. Yet they are actively selling OCS oil and gas leases in the \nArctic Ocean adjacent to the coastal plain. They say that is OK, that \nis all right. Secretary Babbitt and the others have their priorities \nbackwards. Oil development on the land is safe. Oil development in the \nisolated wind-driven reaches of the ocean is risky; it can be \nhazardous.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. I thank the Chair. I appreciate \nthe indulgence of my colleagues. Tomorrow, or the first opportunity I \ncan get time in morning business, I intend to comment at some length on \nthe issue of environmentalism as big business in the United States, \nwhat it consists of, who it involves, what salaries are being paid, and \na list of the assets of the various organizations so the public can \nunderstand the other side of the issue. On one side we have big \nbusiness and oil. On the other side we have big business and the \nenvironmental community.\n  I thank the Chair and wish the Chair a good day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16713-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16715-S16716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to extend my deepest personal \nsympathies and condolences to Mrs. Rabin, Mr. Rabin's children and \ngrandchildren, to the people of Israel, and to the Jewish community of \nMissouri and the United States.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was a warrior. As a young man, he left behind boyhood \ndreams and assumed the mantle of a soldier for a country that was still \na dream to him and many others. He helped liberate 200 of his brothers \nin a heroic and legendary raid. He fought in the siege of Jerusalem and \nkept open the vital lines of supply. In 1967, it was General Rabin who \nwas the architect of the determined fury of an Israeli Army that was \nvictorious over three substantial enemies in what would become known as \nthe Six Day War.\n  Nevertheless, his prowess as a warrior was exceeded only by his \ncourage as a peacemaker. He was an Ambassador to the United States. He \nmade the first visit ever by an Israeli Prime Minister to West Germany. \nHe tried to open peace negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan in the \nlate 1970's. And, in a move that would ultimately cost him his life, he \nmade peace with some of Israel's most substantial enemies.\n  He need not have been a peacemaker. He could have gone quietly into \nthe annals of history as a warrior, a Prime Minister, a father, and a \ngrandfather. But Yitzhak Rabin was, from his earliest days, a Zionist. \nHis goal, both in war and in peace, was the preservation of a land that \nGod had promised. In the end, he saw in peace and through diplomacy \nwhat military victory might never bring--security for his home, for his \nland, for his nation.\n  Unfortunately, it was not a journey which he was able to see through \nto completion. In his life, Yitzhak Rabin defined courage--the courage \nto fight in war and the courage to fight for peace. His legacy will be \njudged finally not only by what he started, but also by what Israel and \nher neighbors will eventually accomplish and achieve.\n  That is a task which they must pursue and that they must complete. It \nis a task for which we will all be held accountable. So, when the \nmourning is completed--and mourn we must and should--may we resolve to \ndo what he started and may the resolve linger in all of us to complete \nthat which he began.\n  As a boy, Yitzhak Rabin wanted to learn how to make the fertile soil \nof his land produce crops more abundantly. As a man and as a leader, \nPrime Minister Rabin plowed and harrowed the rocky ground of peace. It \nwas both his hope and his vision that out of that ground would grow a \ntree bearing the unknown fruit of peace in a \n\n[[Page S 16716]]\nland and for a people that had seen so little of it.\n  In his finest hour, 2 years ago, at the White House, Prime Minister \nRabin acknowledged this aspiration, as he said:\n\n       Let me say to you, the Palestinians, we are destined to \n     live together on the same soil in the same land. . . . We \n     have no desire for revenge. We harbor no hatred towards \n     you. We, like you, are people--people who want to build a \n     home. To plant a tree. To love--live side by side with \n     you. In dignity. In empathy. As human beings. As free men.\n\n  It is all of our prayers that his dream will live on.\n  Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if you had been in New Hampshire on \nThursday, January 9, 1992, and had been near a television, you might \nhave seen the premiere of a new political advertisement--the first, \nearly ad of the presidential campaign for a candidate who was not yet a \nfamiliar face.\n  The setting is an office. Piano music plays gently in the background, \nand the candidate speaks to the camera with an American flag as his \nbackdrop.\n  ``In the 80's,'' he begins, ``the rich got richer, the middle class \ndeclined, poverty exploded, politicians in Washington raised their pay \nand pointed fingers, but no one took responsibility.''\n  The candidate promises a tax cut for the middle class, even offers \nviewers a copy of his ``Plan for America's Future'' if they call the \nnumber on their television screen.\n  ``I hope you'll join us in this crusade for change,'' he says \nearnestly.\n\n       Together we can put government back on the side of the \n     forgotten middle class and restore the American dream.\n       I'm Bill Clinton, and I believe you deserve more than 30-\n     second ads or vague promises.\n\n  Mr. President, Bill Clinton evoked the image of the forgotten middle \nclass throughout his campaign for the White House, tantalizing the \nvoters--while separating himself from the rest of his Democratic \nopponents--by promising he would cut taxes for working-class Americans.\n  ``I am not in this thing to pander,'' he told Business Week in a June \n1992 interview.\n\n       The way I came to the across-the-board, middle-class tax \n     cut didn't have a relationship to the polls. . . . I came \n     back to the middle-class tax cut as a down payment on \n     fairness.\n\n  As that ``down payment on fairness'' took shape, Bill Clinton reached \nout to the overtaxed middle class by focusing his tax cut plan on \nfamilies, advocating ideas that seemed more in line with the Republican \nvision than the Democrat policies of the past. ``It is very much harder \nto raise a child for a middle-class family today than it was 40 years \nago,'' said candidate Clinton. ``Our country used to take the position \nthat the way to build strong families was to enable the working people \nto have enough money to raise their families.''\n  ``We're still getting a disproportionate amount of taxes from the \nmiddle class,'' he emphasized.\n  During the Presidential campaign, candidate Clinton promised to \nreduce the taxes paid by families and shield them from future tax \nincreases.\n  ``Virtually every industrialized nation recognizes the importance of \nstrong families in its tax code; we should too,'' he wrote in ``Putting \nPeople First,'' his campaign's economic outline for the country.\n  ``We will lower the tax burden on middle-class Americans.''\n  Mr. Clinton's plan began to take shape with a focus on tax relief for \nfamilies with children. ``The main portion of the middle-class tax cut \nfor me in its present form is the children's tax credit,'' he said back \nin 1992.\n  He promised that he would cut taxes for average, middle-class \nfamilies by 10 percent, giving them a choice between a phased-in, $800 \nper-child tax credit or a ``significant reduction in their income tax \nrate.''\n  Those election-year promises helped turn candidate Bill Clinton into \nPresident Bill Clinton when frustrated Americans went to the polls that \nNovember.\n  But like so many promises made in the political heat of an election \nyear, Mr. Clinton's tax-cut intentions of 1992 melted like summer snow \nin 1993.\n  By then, Republicans in Congress were rallying around the $500 per-\nchild tax credit I had authored as a Member of the House, making it the \ncenterpiece of our budget alternatives in both the House and Senate.\n  But the Democrats, led by the President, pushed through a package of \ntax hikes on the middle class--a historic tax increase that affected \nevery segment of American society.\n  Promises made, promises broken.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, this Congress has not forgotten our promise \nto the middle class.\n  We have passed a budget that recognizes, just as President Clinton \ndid in 1992, that working-class Americans have paid more than their \nfair share of taxes over the last 40 years.\n  Families in 1950 sent just $1 of every $50 they earned to Washington, \nbut families today are turning over $1 out of every $4.\n  That is money they could have spent for a child's education, health \ninsurance, groceries for an elderly parent, or something as simple as \nbirthday presents and Christmas gifts.\n  But instead, they are handing it over to the Washington bureaucrats, \nwho spend it for them--often recklessly--in ways that often have no \nbenefit at all to the folks who foot the Government's bills.\n  For more than 40 years, the only economic and fiscal discipline \nexercised by Congress has come at the expense of the American \ntaxpayers.\n  The budget plan we will soon be sending to the President is based on \nour deeply held belief that the weekly paycheck is not the Government's \nmoney--that families can spend their own money better than a Government \nthat demands those dollars to spend on their behalf.\n  We are certain that 250 million Americans, empowered to make their \nown spending decisions, will make better choices than Congress and the \nPresident could ever make for them.\n  With our budget, Congress is dedicating $245 billion to tax relief, \nthe vast majority of which will go to working-class American families \nthrough the $500-per-child tax credit.\n  The child tax credit means Minnesota families would get to keep $477 \nmillion of their own dollars every year, to spend wherever they needed \nhelp the most.\n  The $500-per-child tax credit would return $150 million annually to \nfamilies in President Clinton's own State of Arkansas. And it would \ncompletely erase the tax liability for 38,411 Arkansas residents.\n  Well, it has been nearly 4 years since that first campaign commercial \nin New Hampshire promised tax relief for the beleaguered middle class. \nAn election is on the horizon, and once again, like the swallows \nreturning to Capistrano, candidate Clinton is talking about cutting \ntaxes.\n  He laid out the framework in his most recent State of the Union \naddress. He said: ``I have proposed the middle-class bill of rights * * \n* It will give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short \nrun and the long run, in a way that benefits all of us.''\n  We say ``welcome back aboard'' to the President. We need President \nClinton with us as the budget process continues. He has a critical role \nas we move forward.\n  We cannot enact our groundbreaking legislation without his signature. \nWe cannot carry out the people's agenda without the people's President \nbehind us.\n  And President Clinton needs us, too. So we have prepared a budget \nthat meets the objectives outlined at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nYes, Congress and the President may disagree about some of the \nspecifics, but not our goals.\n  The budget must balance. It must protect and preserve Medicare. It \nmust restore hope to those who have been trapped in the welfare system. \nAnd it must cut taxes for the middle-class, with the same child tax \ncredit President Clinton promised in 1992, and again this year.\n  President Clinton considered family tax relief such a fundamental \nconcept that he outlined it as a priority in that very first television \nad of his Presidential campaign. ``Together we can put government back \non the side of the \n\n[[Page S 16717]]\nforgotten middle class and restore the American dream,'' he told New \nHampshire television viewers.\n  The time for vague promises is long past. If he still believes in the \nwords he delivered with such conviction in 1992--and in the child tax \ncredit that will turn those words into action--then the President must \nsign the budget bill we send him in 1995.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Friday of last week, November 3, I \nbegan a series of remarks about America's Medicaid Program. I plan to \ncontinue that series throughout this week.\n  In my opening remarks on Friday, I debunked the myth that Medicaid \nhas been a failure. In fact, Medicaid, the Federal-State partnership \nfor health care for poor children and their mothers, for the disabled \nand for the elderly, has been an American success story. The Senate \nshould be building upon that success story, not retreating from it.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, the Nation's infant mortality rate dropped 21 \npercent during the period 1984 to 1992. In 1985, the infant mortality \nrate in the United States was 10.6 per thousand live births. In 1992, \nthat had dropped to 8.5. The number of babies who were alive in 1992 \nwho would not have been alive had we continued at the 1985 rate of \ninfant mortality--8,000. That is an American success story.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, 18 million children have access to hospital, \nphysician care, and to prescriptions as well as immunization and other \npreventive programs.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, senior citizens can live in dignity in a nursing \nhome when their own private resources are no longer there and there is \nno family member to care for them.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, nearly 5 million low-income Americans receive \nhelp through the qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program which pays \nthings like their part B, physician's Medicare monthly premiums, \ncopayments, and deductibles as well as paying for prescription \nmedication for the Medicare population, which is also medically \nindigent. For these qualified Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid means \nthe difference between a visit to the doctor's office instead of the \nuse of the emergency room.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, this Nation has decreased its population of \nseverely handicapped residents living in large State institutions from \n194,000 to today's less than 70,000. Today, 6 million disabled \nAmericans are covered under Medicaid.\n  Thanks to Medicaid, children with catastrophic health problems or \nother special needs get treatment and care. In Florida alone, $284 \nmillion is spent a year through Children's Medical Service, a Medicaid \npublic-private partnership of national renown which last year served \n128,000 Florida children. This Federal-State partnership, serving 37 \nmillion Americans, has been an American success story.\n  I have strained my ears to hear the justification, the policy basis, \nthe rationale for the $176 billion that is being cut from the projected \nneeds of the Medicaid Program which, until $11 billion was added back \nat the last minute, had been a $187 billion cut.\n  Today I wish to examine why Federal spending on Medicaid has \nincreased. In addition, I wish to look at the basis for the projected \nneeds of those served under Medicaid as America enters the 21st \ncentury. Why has Medicaid grown? Why is Medicaid expected to continue \nto grow? Such an examination will debunk yet another myth. That myth is \nthat you can cut $176 billion from Medicaid without risking the deaths \nof infants or the neglect of the elderly or the unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of the disabled.\n  Wednesday and Thursday I wish to discuss how the Senate proposes to \nreward bad, manipulative behavior in the Medicaid Program and how the \ninappropriate plan to raid Social Security will be used as a means of \npaying for the reward in the plan that we sent to Congress. And, \nfinally, I wish to suggest a better alternative, an alternative of \ngenuine reform.\n  The key argument against Medicaid is that they say Medicaid needs to \nrein in spending because it is growing out of control. That is the \nprincipal argument of the critics. Let us look at the overall figures.\n  In 1988, Medicaid cost $51.3 billion in Federal and State funds. We \nknow the Medicaid Program is a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, each contributing to the total cost. In \n1993, Medicaid costs had grown to $125.2 billion. That sounds alarming, \nand virtually everyone agrees we must restrain the rate of growth of \nMedicaid. But no one has done a very credible job of explaining the \npolicy basis for cutting $176 billion.\n  Today I wish to examine why Medicaid has grown. There are two main \nfactors that drive the cost of the health care system. First, how many \npeople are served, and, second, the cost of serving each one of those \npeople. In the case of Medicaid, we should put the second factor, that \nis, the cost of providing services to individual Americans who are \ncovered under Medicaid, in perspective.\n  In the private sector, the growth rate and the cost per person served \nis estimated to be 7.1 percent per year. That is projected from the \nyears 1996 \n\n[[Page S 16718]]\nthrough the year 2002. The source of this projection is the \nCongressional Budget Office. This is higher than the projected growth \nrate for Medicaid, says the same Congressional Budget Office, which \ncalculates that the Medicaid annual growth rate is 7 percent.\n  What is, therefore, causing this alarming growth in Medicaid? The \nrate of growth per person is commensurate with, even less than, the \naverage of all Americans' health care cost increases, that in spite of \nthe fact that Medicaid is serving one of the most vulnerable \npopulations--the frail elderly, the disabled, poor children, and their \nmothers.\n  There are several key factors that explain why Medicaid has grown so \nrapidly. First, a fundamental reason why Medicaid has grown is because \nAmericans are living longer. This is a positive trend for America. \nGreater longevity means that more people are not only living longer and \nmore qualitative lives, but it also means that more people are relying \non Medicaid for longer periods.\n  In 1970, life expectancy at birth in the United States was just over \n70 years. By the year 2010, the projected life expectancy in the United \nStates will be almost 80 years. In a period of 40 years, the average \nlife expectancy of an American will grow from 70 to 80. The segment of \nour population 65 years and older is also living longer, much longer. \nIf you had reached age 65 at the beginning of this century, you could \nhave expected to have lived another 11 years.\n  Those who reached 65 in 1990 could expect to live an average of an \nadditional 17.2 years, according to the U.S. census. Millions of \nAmericans are living longer, and a higher proportion of our population \nis reaching senior status.\n  In 1900, about 40 percent of the population could expect to reach the \nage of 65. By 1990, 8 out of 10 Americans lived to be 65 years or \nolder.\n  Why is this relevant? It is relevant because Medicaid pays for half \nof the total nursing home care in the United States. Nationally, \nMedicaid pays 35 percent of all long-term care services. In Florida, 70 \npercent of our Medicaid spending goes to benefits for seniors and \ndisabled.\n  Mr. President, let me just insert one more set of statistics to \nunderscore the fact that a principal reason why Medicaid is expanding \nin its expenditures is because Americans are extending their life \nexpectancy.\n  In 1980, 15 years ago, there were 15,000 Americans over the age of \n100. By 1990, that population had nearly doubled. Today, in 1995, there \nare 56,000 Americans of the age of 100 or older. No one can deny this \nlongevity trend, not Democrats, not Republicans. So when we hear claims \nabout the growth of Medicaid, let us remember one of the fundamental \nreasons for that growth, thankfully, is as a people we are enjoying the \nbenefits of longer life.\n  In addition to the aging of our population, there is a second main \nreason for the growth in Medicaid spending, and that is we have asked \nthe Medicaid system to do more. As an example, we have tackled the \ninfant mortality rate, which was unacceptably high. In my State of \nFlorida in 1991, at the urging of Gov. Lawton Chiles, the Florida \nLegislature enacted Healthy Start to improve access to prenatal and \ninfant care. As I mentioned in my floor statement on Friday, Healthy \nStart is an example of a Medicaid success story. In 5 years, Florida \nwent from being above the national average in infant mortality, with an \ninfant mortality rate of 9.6 per thousand live births, to below the \nnational average, at a rate of 8.1 per thousand live births, and the \nmost recent Florida statistic shows that rate continues to fall and is \nnow 7.6 infant deaths per thousand live births. Nationally, the infant \nmortality rate has declined from 10.6 per thousand live births in 1985 \nto 8.5 in 1992.\n  By providing prenatal and postnatal care, we are saving lives, and we \nare confident that costly medical services will be prevented in later \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to recall one of \nthe giants of this institution who represented senior citizens across \nAmerica, the late Hon. Claude Pepper, a Member of the U.S. Senate from \n1937 to 1951 and later served a distinguished career in the U.S. House \nof Representatives.\n  When I was elected Governor of Florida in 1978, Senator Pepper, then \nserving in the U.S. House of Representatives, made one request of me. \nHe asked me to expand the Medicaid program in Florida to cover an \noptional two services: eyeglasses and artificial limbs.\n  I am proud that one of my first acts as Governor was to sign \nlegislation, inspired by Senator Pepper, to achieve these goals. \nSenator Pepper said there were too many poor seniors without vision and \nwithout limbs. So, yes, Senator Pepper, we have expanded Medicaid so \nfrail seniors can read and walk.\n  I challenge those who would cut $176 billion to tell us if they are \nready to dismantle this legacy of Senator Claude Pepper, if they are \nready to take away the eyeglasses of poor seniors, if they are ready to \ndeny coverage of artificial limbs or return to the infant mortality \nrates of yesterday.\n  There is a third reason, in addition to the aging of the population \nand the additional demands that we have asked of the Medicaid program, \nand that is that there have been expansions that we have made \nlegislatively. There are, in addition, more and more children who used \nto get health coverage through their parents' jobs who have now lost \ntheir private sector insurance.\n  Consider this trend line, Mr. President. In 1977, the Census Bureau \nsays that the proportion of children with private health insurance \ncoverage was 71 percent; 71 percent of American children had health \ninsurance coverage through private coverage primarily through their \nparents' place of employment. By 1987, that percentage had dropped to \n63 percent; by 1993, to 57 percent; and the projection for the year \n2002, which happens to be the seventh year of the budget plan upon \nwhich we are currently deliberating, is that it will be 47.6 percent. \nLess than half of the American children will be covered by insurance at \nthe point of their parents' employment.\n  The cumulative result of these factors--the aging of the population, \nthe increased expectations of Medicaid and the decline of the \npercentage of children covered by private insurance plans and, \ntherefore, who are now eligible for and are being covered by Medicaid--\nhas contributed to the expansion of the Medicaid program.\n  In my State of Florida, as an example, in 1970, shortly after \nMedicaid was available, 4.3 percent of Florida's population received \nMedicaid, those recipients who are eligible for Medicaid based on those \nwho were eligible for aid to families with dependent children or \nsupplemental security income. You had to be at one of those two classes \nin order to be eligible for Medicaid. The percentage of Floridians \nreceiving Medicaid was fairly constant, in the range of 4 to 6 percent, \nfrom its inception in 1970 until the program began its expansion in the \nmid-1980's.\n  By the 1993 fiscal year, 11.6 percent of Floridians were eligible for \nMedicaid. Today, that has grown to 12 percent, compared to the national \nfigure of 14 percent of Americans being covered by the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  In sum, the percentage of Floridians eligible for Medicaid has nearly \ntripled since the program started a quarter of a century ago. It has \ntripled primarily because of the aging of the population, because of \npolicy decisions, such as the decision to attack infant mortality, and \nby the dramatic decline in children covered by private insurance \nprograms and, therefore, becoming eligible for Medicaid and receiving \nbenefits through that program.\n  Before I move on to my next point, I want to underscore that there \nare also some adverse reasons why Medicaid is growing. First, we must \ndo a better job of suppressing fraud. Our colleague from Maine, Senator \nCohen, estimates that Medicare and Medicaid suffer a combined loss of \n$33 billion a year due to fraud and abuse. At last week's hearing \nbefore the Senate Select Committee on Aging, the senior Senator from \nMaine said something that we all know is true. Senator Cohen said: ``It \nis appallingly easy to commit health care fraud.''\n  In Florida, the Florida Supreme Court has just impaneled a grand jury \nfor a year as part of our attack on Medicaid fraud.\n  In addition to fraud and abuse, there is another adverse reason why \nMedicaid is expanding. There has been abuse \n\n[[Page S 16719]]\nin the provision known as disproportionate share hospitals, sometimes \nreferred to by the acronym DSH. Today, one out of seven Medicaid \ndollars is spent on disproportionate share hospitals. The proposal that \nthis Senate adopted 11 days ago will make those payments virtually \npermanent within our Medicaid system. I will talk more about this \nphenomenon on Wednesday.\n\n  Mr. President, having discussed some of the principal reasons why the \nMedicaid Program has grown dramatically over the last few years, let us \nnow talk about the basis of projections for Medicaid. We are being \nasked to cut $176 billion from Medicaid's projection over the next 7 \nyears. What is the medical rationale for the $176 billion cut? What is \nthe policy rationale?\n  Mr. President, I have been seeking a good answer to those questions, \nand until I get one, I will have to assume that there is no sound \nrationale for $176 billion of cuts in Medicaid. I will have to assume \nthat there are other reasons and that those reasons are to fund huge \ntax breaks, which will go, disproportionately, to the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, we are not at a loss because our experts, the \nCongressional Budget Office, has looked ahead. It has projected an \nannual rate of increase for Medicaid spending at 10.2 percent through \nthe year 2002.\n  How did CBO arrive at that figure? The key factors driving the CBO \nprojections were these:\n  About 45 percent of the CBO-projected increases over the 7-year \nperiod are due to additional caseload; 45 percent of the reason why \nMedicaid is supposed to grow is because it will serve an increasing \nnumber of Americans--basically, the same Americans that have led to its \ngrowth in the last 10 years, the increasingly elderly population in \nneed of nursing home care, the number of poor children who no longer \nhave health insurance at the point of their parent's employment, and \nthrough policy directions to attack the issue of infant mortality.\n  Do those who want to cut $176 billion from the Medicaid dispute this \nprojection? Do they claim that we will be serving fewer people? If so, \nwho will we not be serving? Shall we say to that frail senior citizen \nwith poor eyesight who needs glasses that their glasses should be taken \naway? Will their neighbor who needs an artificial limb be denied? Will \nthe preschooler who needs to be immunized tell us who will not be \ncovered so that we can pay for the tax breaks?\n  Medicaid serves multiple clienteles. One of the most costly groups \nserved by Medicaid is the disabled. The chronically ill cost at least \nseven times what it costs to provide for nondisabled children per year. \nIt costs the Medicaid Program seven times per person to serve a \ndisabled person than it does the poor child.\n  CBO says the projected rate of growth in the number of disabled \nchildren to be served is expected to rise 4.1 percent a year, which is \nhigher than the growth rate for all other Medicaid categories. The most \nexpensive category of Medicaid service is the category that is growing \nthe most rapidly. Do those who want to cut $176 billion for Medicaid \nsuggest that the needs of the numbers of the disabled will not grow at \nthis rate? If they have some basis for that, we look forward to them \npresenting that to us.\n  A second reason for the projection of Medicaid increase is that some \n30 percent of the projected increase in Medicaid outlays would be \ncaused by increased costs, including national medical inflation--a \nfactor that no individual State can control.\n  Mr. President, one of the independent expert groups that has explored \nthese tough questions of the future of Medicaid is the Kaiser \nCommission on the future of Medicaid. The Kaiser Commission issued a \nreport in May 1995 based on Congressional Budget Office data that \nindicates what Medicaid will look like in the year 2002. The report \nassumes that States would first do the following things in order to \nachieve savings: They would enroll individuals in managed care plans; \nthey would reduce provider payment rates; they would cut optional \nservices. The States would do all of those before they would take the \nnext step, which is to reduce enrollment in the program.\n  Based on these assumptions--enrolling individuals in managed care, \nreducing provider payment rates, and cutting optional services--Kaiser \nhas projected the changes in covered beneficiaries. Under the most \noptimistic scenario, States would somehow reduce growth in spending per \nbeneficiary to the rate of overall inflation.\n  Under another slightly less optimistic scenario, States would reduce \nreal spending to the rate of inflation plus 1.9 percent per year per \nbeneficiary. That number happens to be half the historical rate of \ngrowth for Medicaid. Either way, cost control would be more successful \nthan that achieved by the private sector or by any public program, Mr. \nPresident, including the program that we have adopted for Federal \nemployees. We are asking Medicaid, under these two scenarios, to be \nsignificantly more efficient than either the private sector or the \npublic sector, including the judgment that we have made about our own \nhealth insurance program.\n  Even with such a faith in State government's ability to cut health \ncare costs, let us look at what we can expect in just one State--\nCalifornia. What will the Medicaid landscape look like in the year 2002 \nin the largest of America's States? California is currently projected \nto receive $95.7 billion in Medicaid funds from the Federal Government \nbetween the years 1996 and the year 2002.\n  The Senate reconciliation bill would limit California to $77.7 \nbillion, which is an $18 billion reduction over that 7-year period. In \nthe year 2002 alone, California would have been expected to have \nreceived $18 billion. The Senate bill would limit California to $13.1 \nbillion, a $4.9 billion reduction from current projections of need in \nthe 1 year of 2002.\n  Now, let us make some assumptions. Assume that California holds \nexpenditure growth to inflation--a remarkable achievement. Having done \nso, and having also met the other assumptions, including moving all of \nthose potentially into managed care and reducing the rates to \nproviders, California would have to remove 320,548 people from the \nexpected 6\\1/2\\ million Medicaid beneficiaries; 320,000 people would be \nremoved from the Medicaid rolls.\n  Suppose California was not quite as successful, and instead of being \nable to hold health care costs to the rate of inflation, California was \nable to hold health care costs to the rate of inflation plus 1.9 \npercent. In that event, California would have to remove 1,065,823 of \nits 6\\1/2\\ million Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Are we saying that in the year 2002, assuming that California has \ndone a better job of reducing costs than the private sector, the public \nsector, including the Federal Government, that we are willing to allow \nbetween a third of a million to over 1 million people to lose their \nhealth care coverage in the year 2002 in the State of California? What \nhappens if California is not able to reduce its costs? Is the Governor \nof California ready to accept responsibility for allowing perhaps \nmillions of our country's most needy people to go without health care \ncoverage?\n  Mr. President, my comments this morning boil down to some simple \nmathematics. Take the projected need in the Medicaid Program to the \nyear 2002, which is $954 billion, and then subtract the amount of the \nproposed cuts, $176 billion; that amount of money that is left, $778 \nbillion is now going to pay for $954 billion in projected needs.\n  Mr. President, the simple math tells us that the block grants will \ncome up short, that they do not add up, that States will not have a \nsufficient amount of resources in order to meet the projected needs of \nthe frail elderly, the disabled, poor children, and their mothers.\n  This brings me, perhaps, to the most repugnant feature of the \nMedicaid block grant proposal--the  unmitigated cowardice of Congress \nfor failing to admit, on the record, that these cuts will mean real \nsuffering in the lives of real Americans.\n\n  It is as if the U.S. Senate has adopted a policy of ``Don't ask, \ndon't care.''\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the designers of these massive \nMedicaid cuts do not want to know who is really going to have to pay \nfor the tax breaks that this $176 billion will, in part, fund. Leave \nthose messy details to the States. Take the high road. Take the cake \nand ice cream of doling out $245 billion in tax breaks.\n  The truth is that the price for these tax breaks for the wealthy will \nbe paid \n\n[[Page S 16720]]\nfor in the currency of suffering, preventable illness, inadequate or \nunavailable care, and, yes, even the death of infants.\n  What we saw orchestrated on the Senate floor 11 days ago was an \nelaborate ritual of plausible deniability. No hearings or debate on how \nmany infants could die because of slackened prenatal care efforts. No \nhearings or debate on how many elderly will languish in nursing home \nwarehouses because of deregulation and lower provider payments.\n  Mr. President, that is precisely what happened when the 20 hours of \ndebate ran out on a 1,500-page bill with no discussion, no \naccountability, no honest admission that cutting $176 billion from the \nprojected needs of human beings that millions of Americans would \nsuffer.\n  In effect, the Senate sent to the States and county governments the \ndirty work, the painful decisions. That is what we do when we embrace \nthe don't-ask, don't-care standard for the formulation of public \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the standard for formulation of public \npolicy seems to be ``let the States and counties figure out who gets \ncare and who does not. Their fingerprints will be on those decisions, \nnot ours.''\n  Make no mistake about it, these Medicaid cuts will cost infants and \nfrail elderly and the disabled. Congress cannot wash its hands so \neasily with the pathetic refrain that ``We didn't know.'' Congress did \nnot know because it did not ask. It did not ask because it did not want \nto know. That is cowardice.\n  I never cease to be amazed how quickly the hands of Congress reach \nout to give tax breaks and favors and how quickly the same hands hide \nwhen it comes time to assume responsibility.\n  The record, Mr. President, is clear. The majority of both Houses of \nCongress, with callous aforethought, siphoned $176 billion in health \nand long-term care of needy Americans without even a cursory concern \nfor the human consequences.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that no Member wants to leave that kind of \nmark on America. There is still time to reform Medicaid without hurting \npeople. There is still time to deliberate the actual effects of cutting \n$176 billion in health and long-term care services for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Such a deliberation will bring us face to face with the families, \nwith the children, with the frail elderly, and with the disabled who \nwill pay the price of this tax break.\n  Up to this point, Mr. President, the Senate has denied accountability \nand responsibility. That denial is not plausible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, under the order, \nwill have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed after \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order the Senator from North Dakota \nfollows the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After the Senator from North Dakota, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16717-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16720-S16721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEDICATION TO THE PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I \n     want to talk about my grandfather.\n       You always awake from a nightmare, but since yesterday I \n     was continually awakening to a nightmare.

Now they will talk about you \n     for quite some time, but I feel that they really don't know \n     just how great the pain is, how great the tragedy is; \n     something has been destroyed.\n       Grandfather, you were and still are our hero. I wanted you \n     to know that every time I did anything, I saw you in front of \n     me.\n       Your appreciation and your love accompanied us every step \n     down the road, and our lives were always shaped after your \n     values. You, who never abandoned anything, are now abandoned. \n     And here you are, my ever-present hero, cold, alone, and I \n     cannot do anything to save you. You are missed so much.\n       Others greater than I have already eulogized you, but none \n     of them ever had the pleasure I had to feel the caresses of \n     your warm, soft hands, to merit your warm embrace that was \n     reserved only for us, to see your half-smile that always told \n     me so much, that same smile which is no longer, frozen in the \n     grave with you.\n       I have no feelings of revenge because my pain and feelings \n     of loss are so large, too large. The ground has been swept \n     out from below us, and we are groping now, trying to wander \n     about in this empty void, without any success so far.\n       I am not able to finish this; left with no alternative. I \n     say goodbye to you, hero, and ask you to rest in peace, and \n     think about us, and miss us, as down here we love you so very \n     much. I imagine angels are accompanying you now and I ask \n     them to take care of you, because you deserve their \n     protection.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I said to my wife, Sheila, this morning \nthat there is nowhere on Earth I would have rather been than in \nJerusalem yesterday for this service to honor a very courageous man, \nYitzhak Rabin.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget the long lines of the people in \nJerusalem in Israel as we drove to the service, as I drove to the \nservice with my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to look out of \nthe window and to see the sadness of the people, to see the sadness of \nthe people.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget the words at the service, the \nwords of our President, President Clinton, the words of the Prime \nMinister's granddaughter. Her words were heard and felt by people all \nover the world. Nor will I forget the words of King Hussein of Jordan \nwho said, ``I remember my grandfather being assassinated''--the King as \na little boy was next to his grandfather--``and now my brother''--my \nbrother; he called Prime Minister Rabin his brother. He said, ``I am \nnot afraid. I am not afraid. If I have to meet that fate,'' the King \nsaid, ``so be it, but I am committed to this peace process.''\n  Mr. President, I just would like to say on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate that I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to my State of \nMinnesota for giving me an opportunity to be a U.S. Senator and giving \nme an opportunity to be invited to be able to go and to be at that \nservice.\n  I believe that the way that I can honor Prime Minister Rabin--I \nbelieve the way that all of us can honor Prime Minister Rabin--whether \nwe are Democrats or Republicans, as leaders in the U.S. Congress, is to \ndedicate our services to this peace process. \n\n[[Page S 16721]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Prime Minister knew that the status quo was \nunacceptable. He knew that the status quo extended to the future would \nonly mean that Israeli children and Palestinian children would be \nkilling each other for generations to come.\n  He gave his life for peace. He was a general. He defended his \ncountry. He was a military hero. But in the last analysis, at the very \nend, he gave his life for security for his country and for peace for \nthe peoples of the Middle East.\n  His loss is not only the loss of Israel, his loss is the loss of the \npeoples of the Middle East, and his loss is the loss to all of us--all \nof us--who live in this world.\n  So, colleagues, I think that the way that we honor this man, Prime \nMinister Rabin, is by dedicating ourselves to the peace process. \nWhenever our country can facilitate negotiations, we should do so. \nWhenever our country can continue the work of Dennis Roth and others \nwho have been so skillful in helping to mediate and keep these \nnegotiations going, we should do so.\n  When there are terms of the agreement that we are asked to follow \nthrough on such as financial aid, economic development, aid to \nPalestinian people, that the Prime Minister was so much for, we should \nsupport that.\n  Mr. President, I hope this does not lead to a period of darkness. \nCertainly, it feels that way now. This is a nightmare of the world. Let \nus dedicate ourselves to the peace process. Let us do as public \nservants what the Prime Minister was able to do. He took the moral \nposition. He did not know how the elections would turn out, but he did \nwhat he thought was the right thing.\n  His example of leadership was an example of leadership not just for \nIsrael but for all us that are in public service in all countries \nthroughout the world.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, as the son of a Jewish immigrant from \nthe Ukraine and Russia, Leon Wellstone, as the son of a daughter of \nUkrainian immigrants, Mincha Daneshevsky, as a father, grandfather, a \nSenator from Minnesota, and an American Jew, I was so proud to be there \nyesterday.\n  I hope I can live my life, with my family and in my community, and as \na Senator, in such a way that I honor this man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in these days of government spending \ncutbacks there is one notable exception: public housing programs for \nmiddle-aged rich owners of professional sports teams.\n  Yesterday's announcement that the Cleveland Browns will move to \nBaltimore demonstrates once again that these rich folks who play \nmonopoly games with their football, baseball, and basketball team \nfranchises can play city off against city to hammerlock officials and \nfans to pay for expensive, new taxpayer financed sports stadiums in \nwhich they can house their privately owned teams.\n  There is insufficient money for public housing for poor people in \nAmerica, but the sky is the limit for public housing for those rich \nfolks who own professional sports teams and who insist the taxpayers \nbuild them a place to play.\n  No owner of a professional football, baseball, basketball, or hockey \nteam will ever be homeless. Governments--local, State, and Federal--\nwill see to it that there are enough public resources available to \nbuild stadiums worth hundreds of millions of dollars with sky boxes for \nthe affluent. Governments will virtually guarantee that money from \nparking, concessions, and sky boxes will make rich owners richer and \noverpaid athletes financially fat and happy.\n  The thing about this that irritates me is that taxpayers in our part \nof the country: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming--help \nin both direct and indirect ways to pay for this housing program for \nrich sports owners.\n  But there will never be a press conference in which a major sports \nteam owner announces he is moving his team to Bismarck or Cheyenne or \nHelena.\n  This little monopoly game that bestows enormous economic awards on \ncertain regions of the country is a private domain played between the \nwealthy sports owners and the largest cities of America. The rest of us \nare required, through lost tax revenue, to help pay the bills.\n  Yesterday's announcement about the Cleveland Browns moving to \nBaltimore is apparently a result of a promise of a new $200 million \nstadium in Baltimore to be used rent-free for 7 years by the Browns' \nowner. Skybox, parking, and concession revenues go to the owner as \nwell. In addition, the owner apparently received $75 million as a bonus \nfor moving the team.\n  I do not know the owner of the Cleveland Browns from a cord of wood \nso I am not judging him. And he is not alone in moving a sports team in \nsearch of more money. And team owners are no different than athletes: \nthey are two peas in a pod. They jump ship and leave town in search of \nmore money. It is all about money--money for the owners and money for \nthe athletes.\n  Fans are the pawns who end up paying the bills through ticket prices \nand taxes. Fans are reduced to rooting for uniforms rather than people. \nThe star athlete in one city one week may well end up playing against \nthat city the next week as a result of trades or moves by athletes and \nowners in search of the highest dollar.\n  In circumstances where monopolies rule the day--and they do in \nprofessional sports--you cannot start an NBA team in Bismarck, or you \ncannot start an NFL team in Sioux Falls. Money and control replace the \nbenefits of competition, and everyone pays except the owners and the \nathletes.\n  I would not take the time to comment on this issue, except that what \nis happening in professional sports is a perversion. This is about big \nguys and big money, and the little guy be damned. And guess who ends up \npaying for the sports stadiums and who ends up paying for those \nlucrative salaries for the athletes and handsome profits for the \nowners? The little guy. The fact is, professional sports is sticking \nits finger in the fan's eye.\n  A story last week pointed out the cost of taking a family of four to \na National Basketball Association professional game this season has \nrisen to $192, up 10 percent from last year. It costs about $130 for \nfour tickets, an average of $32 per ticket, and you have to add some \nhot dogs, a program and a cap so the cost for four people adds up to \nnearly $200 to attend a game. Something is wrong; something is terribly \nwrong in professional sports when we have come to that. And ticket \nprices for hockey and football are even higher.\n  I think that Congress ought to hold some hearings on the subject of \nprofessional sports: where it has been; where it is going; who profits, \nby how much, and at whose expense.\n  Why is it in 1995 that the only healthy public housing program is one \nto build sports stadiums for rich, middle-aged sports owners? Why, when \nso many cities would like to host a professional sports team, do the \nleagues restrict expansion unreasonably, so that existing teams can \nextract outrageous ticket prices from citizens who have no \nalternatives?\n  I think it is reasonable for our country to ask whether these \nmonopolies, \n\n[[Page S 16722]]\nwhere a few rich owners can make judgments about where to bestow \nhundreds of millions of dollars of economic benefits to one region or \nanother or one city or another, are in concert with the interests of \nour economy and our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will take a moment to bid farewell to \nmy friend Yitzhak Rabin. I was unable to attend the funeral due to some \nfamily responsibilities, but had an opportunity to get to know the \nPrime Minister well in his visits to the United States. And to speak to \nhim three or four times a year about the foreign aid program for Israel \nand other issues related to the Middle East.\n  Not only has Israel lost a great statesman but the world has lost one \nof the premier figures of this century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16721-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16722-S16723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I noted with interest last week the \ntestimony of the Speaker of the House before the House Oversight \nCommittee on the subject of campaign finance reform and the reaction to \nthe Speaker's speech here in the Senate last Friday by two of our \ncolleagues.\n  Let me say, we are back into it again. The biennial assault on the \nfirst amendment has begun anew.\n  The Speaker of the House last week, in addressing this issue in some \nof the most skillful and brilliant testimony I have seen or been \nprivileged to hear, pointed out that this debate is about the first \namendment. We are talking about free speech and the doling out of the \nability to communicate in a free society.\n  Some of my colleagues here on Friday ridiculed the Speaker for \nstating what is perfectly obvious--that we do not spend enough on \ncampaigns in this country, not nearly enough.\n  As a matter of fact, it is interesting to note that in the 1993-94 \ncycle, the most recent 2-year cycle of congressional elections, \ncongressional campaigns spent about what the American public spent in 1 \nyear on bubble gum. I repeat, Mr. President, in the last congressional \ncycle, we spent on congressional campaigns what Americans spend in 1 \nyear on bubble gum. And about half of what they spend on yogurt, and \nabout half what they spend on potato chips.\n  So where did this notion get going that we were spending too much in \ncampaigns? Compared to what? Compared to what? When you look at any \nsensible comparison, we are spending a pittance communicating with \nvoters and expressing ourselves in the American political system.\n  Commercial advertising in 1992 was $44 billion. The cost of \ndemocracy, if you will, in the 1993-94 cycle was $724 million--as I \nsaid, roughly what Americans spent on bubble gum that year. Another way \nof looking at it, Mr. President, per eligible voter spending was about \n$3.74. That would get you an extra-value meal at McDonald's. The \nequivalent of a burger, fries, and a Coke is not too much to spend to \ncommunicate with the American voter.\n  Prof. Bradley Smith, in a work released by the Cato Institute, \nrecently observed that Sony is spending more to promote Michael \nJackson's latest album than the 1994 Republican Senate nominee in \nCalifornia spent. That is a race that a lot of people like to focus on, \neven though on a per capita basis there was less spending in California \nthan in a number of other States.\n  Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson noted in an August 1995 column \nthat campaign spending is tiny--five or six one-hundredths of 1 percent \nof the gross domestic product. This is up from three one-hundredths of \none percent in the 1960's. As Samuelson put it, it hardly seems a high \nprice to pay for democracy.\n  David Broder in the Washington Post in June of 1993 said:\n\n       Communication is the heart of campaign politics, and \n     candidates are competing, not just with each other, but with \n     all the other messages being beamed at the American public. \n     The added cost of the 1992 campaign was the direct byproduct \n     of a very desirable change--a marked increase in competition. \n     There were 1,200 more congressional candidates in 1992 than \n     in 1990--a 63 percent increase.\n\n  So Broder pointed out that:\n\n       It is illogical to welcome the infusion of energy and ideas \n     represented by the largest freshman class in 44 years and \n     condemn the cost of their campaigns.\n\n  He is talking about the 1992 class.\n  Broder concluded in that article:\n\n       Few politicians in today's cynical climate want to tell the \n     voters the truth. If you want competitive politics, make up \n     your mind that it is going to be relatively expensive. \n     Democracy, like other good things, is not cost-free.\n\n  But expensive compared to what? It is said time after time on the \nfloor of the Senate that campaign spending is out of control. It is \njust not true. There is no basis for that. And it is repeated as if it \nwere fact.\n  We spend a pittance on politics in this country. And, as the Speaker \npointed out last week, we really ought to be spending more. To the \nextent that our speech is restrained by some artificial Government-\nimposed effort to restrict it, others will fill the void. As the \nSpeaker pointed out, the void left by the limits--if we had limits on \nour speech--would be further filled by the media, in addition to other \npowerful entities.\n  A Member of this body on this floor last Friday blasted as \n``ludicrous'' the Speaker's observation that over half the money he \nraises is to offset the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. The Senator \nfurther noted that his opponent is not the newspaper. Maybe this \ncolleague of ours who was lambasting the Speaker enjoys a great \nrelationship with his newspaper, but he ought to try to be on this side \nof the aisle doing battle with the liberal newspapers across America. \nTo conservatives, the undeniably and repeatedly proven liberal slant of \nthe media is an opponent. Of course, all those newspapers would love to \nrestrain our speech so their speech would be enhanced.\n  I have ruminated at some length on this over the years, including a \n1994 piece for the New York Times entitled ``The Press as Power \nBroker,'' and another for USA Today, also last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both of those articles be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 1994]\n\n                       The Press as Power Broker\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       Washington.--In political campaigns, paid advertisements \n     are speech amplifiers--the only practical way for candidates \n     to speak directly to large numbers of voters. That is why the \n     Supreme Court ruled, in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), that \n     involuntary spending limits are an unconstitutional \n     infringement of free speech.\n       Now, in the name of campaign reform, the Senate and House \n     have both passed ``voluntary'' spending limits for \n     Congressional campaigns. But while they aim to equalize \n     spending between candidates, these limits would distort the \n     political process, creating a whole new set of power \n     brokers--including, perhaps not coincidentally, some of the \n     loudest cheerleaders for the new spending limits: America's \n     largest newspapers.\n       To get around the Supreme Court ruling, the bills would not \n     explicitly require spending limits. Instead, candidates would \n     be bludgeoned into compliance by a panoply of heavy \n     penalties. These schemes, which have the enthusiastic support \n     of the New York Times, among other papers, are voluntary in \n     name only.\n       Under the Senate bill, candidates who refused to abide by \n     the limits would have their campaign receipts taxed at the \n     full corporate rate, currently 35 percent. They would be \n     required to include self-incriminating disclaimers in their \n     ads and their campaigns would be saddled with extra reporting \n     requirements. That is just for starters.\n       When noncomplying candidates went even a penny over the \n     ``voluntary'' limit, their opponents would receive a \n     Government grant equal to one-third of the limit. The more \n     that noncomplying candidates spent above the limit, the more \n     tax dollars their complying opponents would get.\n       The Senate bill also provides for Government grants to \n     counteract independent expenditures by private citizens or \n     groups for or against any complying candidate. If David Duke \n     decided to run for the Senate and the N.A.A.C.P. or B'nai \n     B'rith decided to spend money in opposition to his candidacy, \n     he would be eligible for dollar-for-dollar matching funds to \n     fight back. And ask yourself this: if an independently \n     financed ad urged people to ``Support Senator X--she voted 50 \n     times to raise your taxes,'' which candidate would get the \n     money to counteract it?\n       The more a candidate's campaign was hamstrung by a limit on \n     spending (and speech), the more powerful other players would \n     become--labor unions, religious groups, anyone with an agenda \n     to promote. In particular, newspapers would emerge unscathed \n     from this ``reform,'' perfectly situated to fill the \n     communications void created by the spending limits. Their \n     power to make or break \n\n[[Page S 16723]]\n     candidates would increase as the candidates' ability to communicate \n     through paid advertisements was severely limited.\n       Most campaign spending goes toward getting an unfiltered \n     message to voters. This requires expensive television, mail \n     and newspaper advertisements. Simply speaking from the \n     courthouse steps, as in days gone by, would be cheaper; but \n     it is impossible to reach most voters that way.\n       The ``reform'' effort based on spending limits is obviously \n     unconstitutional, yet the nation's largest newspapers proceed \n     full steam ahead in their promotion of it. Perhaps they do \n     not fully appreciate that newspapers could be but a loophole \n     away from having their election-related editorials regarded \n     as ``independent expenditures'' under Federal election law. \n     Or perhaps their true campaign finance goal is to tilt the \n     political playing field in their own favor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Oct. 24, 1994]\n\n                          Don't Limit Spending\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       In 1992, congressional campaigns spent about $3.63 per \n     eligible voter--comparable to a McDonald's ``extra value \n     meal.'' The truth is campaign spending is paltry compared to \n     expenditures for commercial advertising. Yet advertising is \n     the only practical--and most cost-efficient--means of \n     communicating to large electorates. That is why the Supreme \n     Court has said that in political campaigns, spending is \n     speech, and therefore involuntary spending limits are \n     unconstitutional.\n       Had the Senate not mercifully killed it, this year's \n     version of USA TODAY's beloved ``reform'' scheme would have \n     self-destructed in the courts. It was a blatantly \n     unconstitutional attack on citizens' freedom to participate \n     in elections. And, its spending/speech limits were not \n     ``voluntary.''\n       For example, if the NAACP had the audacity to oppose a \n     Senate candidacy by David Duke, this ``reform'' would direct \n     tax dollars to Duke to ``counteract'' the NAACP! Candidates \n     who didn't ``voluntarily'' limit spending would have their \n     campaign funds taxed, lose broadcast and mail discounts, be \n     forced to run self-incriminating ad disclaimers, be choked \n     with extra red tape and trigger matching funds for their \n     opponents if they exceeded the speech/spending limits. That's \n     why the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill.\n       The National Taxpayers Union opposed what amounted to an \n     entitlement program for politicians, providing communication \n     vouchers (``food stamps for politicians'') to House \n     candidates and a host of benefits to Senate candidates. \n     Political scientists opposed the spending/speech limits \n     because they advantage incumbents over challengers, \n     celebrities over unknowns--the political haves over the have-\n     nots.\n       Republicans opposed the scheme for all these reasons and \n     more. USA TODAY misdiagnoses the problem and prescribes a \n     constitutionally toxic cure. Perhaps USA TODAY would consider \n     a dose of its own medicine: tax dollars to candidates to \n     ``counteract'' hostile newspaper editorials and an aggregate \n     word limit for articles. This would help ``level the playing \n     field,'' alleviate the political ``headline chase'' and \n     lessen the annoying din of media coverage.\n       The premier political reform is the First Amendment. If \n     those freedoms were protected only for the press, newspapers \n     would be omnipotent. Perhaps that is why USA TODAY so \n     casually dismisses the First Amendment concerns of others.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the New York Times piece I referred \nto the fact that the media factor is codified in law in which they are \nspecifically exempted from the definition of campaign expenditure. The \nreason that they need to be exempted is because the assumption is that \nmedia activities would be a political expenditure. Right here in the \nFederal election campaign laws compiled by the Federal Election \nCommission on page 6, it is pointed out that the term ``expenditure'' \ndoes not include any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed \nthrough the facilities of any broadcasting station, and so on.\n  The point this makes is that you could assume that is an expenditure \nin a campaign. So there is a need to specifically exempt it. The \nSpeaker is absolutely correct. To the extent that the speech of an \nindividual campaign is artificially restrained by some Government-\nimposed speech limit, the speech of others will be enhanced. Most \nparticularly the liberal media of this country who love to limit \nanybody else's speech so their speech will be louder and more \npenetrating.\n  An objective observer unconcerned or unfamiliar with the Constitution \nmight call that media exemption a loophole. But the point \nfundamentally, Mr. President, is that we are not, as the Speaker \nindicated, spending too much on politics in this country. We ought to \nbe spending more. Any effort to restrain the speech of campaigns, to \nshut up the campaigns, will enhance the speech of others. To rearrange \nspeech in this democracy is not a desirable goal.\n  So we begin again the seemingly endless debate that has certainly \ndominated the Senate during my period here about the desirability of \nclamping down on American campaigns and shutting up candidates so they \nwill not speak too much and providing some kind of subsidy--a bribe, if \nyou will--to get them to shut up.\n  The Supreme Court has said that spending is speech and cannot be \nlimited. But it did say that you could offer a public subsidy to \ncandidates if you wanted to sort of pay them to shut up. That is the \nPresidential system, and the reason even candidates like Ronald Reagan, \nwho stated that he would take taxpayer funding and said, ``I will take \nit. I cannot afford not to. The subsidy is so generous.''\n  The various schemes we discussed here in the Congress do not have as \ngenerous a subsidy. It has been proposed that we have the broadcasters \npay for our campaigns, or that we have the Post Office customers pay \nfor our campaigns through broadcast discounts and postal subsidies, as \nif this somehow was not real money. Well, it is real money. And make no \nmistake about it, the goal of all of these schemes is to clamp down on \npolitical speech, which, of course, will in turn limit the \nparticipation of Americans in the political system. There is much more \nto be said, and I expect we will have an opportunity next year to say \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I was very pleased to learn of the release \ntoday of two American prisoners in Vietnam. They are Mr. Nguyen Tan Tri \nand Mr. Tran Quang Liem. Both Mr. Tri and Mr. Liem will arrive in the \nUnited States today.\n  The American citizens were detained 2 years ago, along with Steven \nYoung, a constituent of mine and a well-known promoter of democracy in \nVietnam. The three Americans were in Vietnam organizing a conference on \ndemocracy with Vietnamese activists.\n  Unfortunately, the right to free speech is not yet recognized in \nVietnam, and the three Americans were detained without charge. Steve \nYoung was released within a few days, but Tri and Liem languished in \npoor health in a Vietnamese prison for nearly 2 years before they were \ncharged, tried, and convicted of treason in mid-August. Sentences of 7 \nyears for Tri and 4 years for Liem were then issued.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Eastern Asia and \nPacific Affairs, I made this matter a top priority. On September 19, I \npassed Senate Resolution 174, which was cosponsored by my colleagues \nMr. Dole, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Thomas. The resolution called for U.S. \nGovernment intervention at the highest levels to secure freedom for \nthese Americans. At the time it did not appear that Secretary-level \ncontact had been made in this matter, something that I believed was \nessential after the normalization with Vietnam. Suitable contacts were \nsubsequently made, allowing us to communicate how important the release \nof these two Americans was to our Government and to the relationship \nbetween our two countries.\n  On October 12, I met with family members of Mr. Tri and Mr. Liem, who \nhad traveled to Washington from Texas and California to urge the \nGovernment to give this matter the same priority that it gave to the \nrelease of Harry Wu. The families were concerned about the health of \nthe American prisoners, as well as the poor prison conditions to which \nthey were subjected. They were informed by the State Department \nofficials that release had become a top priority for the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, shortly after this meeting, it appeared that the \nVietnamese were becoming more interested in resolving this matter. The \nrumors out of Vietnam were rampant. Several times we heard that there \nwould be a retrial. We heard that there would be a release about the \nsame time of President Le's visit to the United States to attend the \nU.N. anniversary celebration. We then heard the retrial would \n\n[[Page S 16724]]\noccur the weekend of October 28, followed by conviction and expulsion \nfrom the country. Finally, a commitment was made that the release would \noccur this past weekend in Vietnam.\n  While all of this goes to show that freedom of speech and due process \nare still scarce in Vietnam, I am pleased that normalization has \napparently given us more tools to pursue issues of dispute with the \nVietnamese Government. The two Americans have now been released, but \nmany political prisoners, whose only crime has been to address issues \nof religious and political freedom, remain locked away in Vietnamese \nprisons.\n  I am encouraged as well that the Vietnamese have been more \nforthcoming with the release of information about MIA's and POW's after \nnormalization. We must continue our efforts with Vietnam to pursue a \nfull accounting, as my resolution also has requested.\n  Again, I applaud the personal intervention of Secretary Warren \nChristopher and Secretary Lord on this important matter, and I also \nlook forward to working with them to pursue our mutual goals now that \nwe have normalized our relationships with Vietnam.\n  To Mr. Tri and to Mr. Liem I say, Welcome home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, recently I received a letter from a \nconstituent named Sue Magruder, who lives in Snohomish, WA. This is \nwhat she wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Gorton: Hold the line. If the President \n     decides to veto and the Government shuts down, so be it. We \n     don't need all this Government, and compromise is out of the \n     question.\n       Please pass this sentiment on to the rest of your \n     colleagues. We want you to hold the line. Don't compromise \n     with my tax dollars because there is no more to give.\n\n  Mrs. Magruder and her husband are small business people in the town \nof Snohomish, WA. They feel--and I think they feel justly--that they \nare overburdened with regulation and with taxes, with attempting to \nsupport themselves, with attempting to make both their own family and \ntheir community a better place in which to live. And they, together \nwith millions of other Americans like them, want us to continue on the \ncourse that we set out at the beginning of this year--the course that \nwill bring the budget into balance, a course that will remove at least \nsome of the duplicative and unnecessary regulations from their backs, a \ncourse which will lessen the burden of taxation, which governments at \nall levels impose on them.\n  They, unlike many Members of Congress, believe that the money that \nthey earn is their own, and that they can be asked to give some of that \nto support common purposes. They disagree, however, that somehow or \nanother everything they earn belongs to the Government, which, in its \ngenerosity, will allow them to keep some of it. That is a fundamental \ndisagreement that they have with many Members of this body and many \nothers who live and work in this Capital of the United States. They \nknow that every penny the Government gets comes out of the pocket of \nsome hard-working American citizen or some other person who lives and \nworks at some point or another in this country.\n  Sue Magruder wrote that there is no more to give. In that line, she \nwas concentrating on herself and her family and her community. But at \nleast an equally undesirable--no, immoral element in the way in which \nthis Government has been run during the course of the last 20, 30, or \n40 years is that we spend money by the hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat we are not taking directly from our citizens in the form of taxes, \nbut are borrowing, at interest, and sending the bill not to the \ncitizens who live and work in the United States now, but to their \nchildren and our children and grandchildren. That, Mr. President, is a \ngreater imposition, a greater wrong done to them than can possibly be \ndone by any control over the increase in spending policies, by the \ncancellation of any marginal Government spending program.\n  We simply do not have the right to spend the money on consumption \ntoday and ask our children and their children and their children to pay \nthe bill. That is the central issue; that is the central question which \nseparates us from a White House that believes in the status quo and \nbelieves that there really is nothing wrong with the continuation of \nmultibillion-dollar deficits year after year, as far as the eye can \nsee. And it is on that proposition, Mr. President, that I do not \nbelieve that constructive compromise is possible. Once the White House, \nonce the administration realizes the depth of our feeling on this \nissue, once it comes to its senses and is willing to join us in the \ngoal of balancing the budget in 7 long years, on the basis of realistic \nprojections, then, Mr. President, I think many things are said to be \ncompromised. Many elements of the spending program can go up while \nothers go down. I do not believe that there is any absolute bottom line \nafter we have reached that conclusion. Under those circumstances, \ncompromise will be a constructive activity. But to compromise away the \nproposition that we must stop spending more than we take in would be \nessentially wrong, would be a repudiation of the commitments that those \nin the majority made to our voters last year. Mr. President, I am \nconvinced it cannot and will not be done.\n  So, if I may, I will end these comments by repeating one part of Sue \nMagruder's letter:\n\n       We want you to hold the line. Don't compromise with my tax \n     dollars because there is no more to give.\n\n  Mr. President, that is correct and that is the line that we are going \nto continue to hold.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I offer a few \nfinal words today on behalf of Yitzhak Rabin--statesman, military war \nhero, peacemaker, and friend.\n  His burial in Jerusalem on Monday casts a pall over Israel and the \nMiddle East. The resilient people of Israel will overcome this tragedy, \nbut his assassination reminds us of the extremist poisons that continue \nto threaten Yitzhak Rabin's dream--peace between Israel and the Arab \nworld.\n  I first met Yitzhak Rabin when he served as Ambassador to the United \nStates beginning in 1968. It was one of many leadership posts he held \nin a long and distinguished career. From brigade commander in the 1948 \nwar of independence to Army Chief of Staff during the historic 6-day \nsuccess in the 1967 war to Ambassador and then Prime Minister on two \ndifferent occasions, Yitzhak Rabin embodied the fighting, and now \npeacemaking, Jewish spirit.\n  I had the good fortune of visiting with him many times over a period \nof three decades. Following the raid on Entebbe, he honored my mother-\nin-law, my wife, and me with a state dinner in Jerusalem in 1973. \nDuring visits to Israel since then, and on his trips to Washington, I \ncontinued to learn from Yitzhak Rabin's political wisdom and insights, \nas well as appreciate the difficulty of living in a world surrounded by \ndeclared adversaries. His was a \n\n[[Page S 16725]]\nvoice of reason, forged by the fires of war and tempered these last few \nyears by yearnings for peace.\n  Because of my own military background, Yitzhak Rabin shared \nadditional insights with me on the strength and force of Israeli \ndefense forces and difficult combat environment they faced. I respected \nhim enormously for the military prowess he demonstrated during his \nyears of service and afterwards. His fighting skills in 1948 and 1967 \nearned him accolades as an authentic war hero. Most would agree that \nhis military leadership was invaluable in securing the birth, and \ncontinuing security, of the Jewish State.\n  But Yitzhak Rabin left the battlefield for the political trenches in \nthe 1970's, initially implementing iron fist policies during his first \nterm as Prime Minister that brooked no dissent from the enemies of \nIsrael. Hostile states, terrorist organizations committed to the \ndestruction of the Jewish State, and other inimical forces would not \npush Israel into the sea.\n  After a stint as Defense Minister in the 1980's and then a Labor-\nLikud powersharing arrangement, Yitzhak Rabin returned to the Prime \nMinister's Office and began to lay the groundwork for comprehensive \npeace with the Palestinians and Arab Nations. It was not an easy \ndecision to make, trading land for peace, but no one was more respected \nor qualified to lead Israel away from the bloodshed of its past to a \nmore secure future.\n  The 1993 Declaration of Principles has started us down that road. I \nwill not forget the Prime Minister's words that sunny September morning \n2 years ago on the White House lawn when the accord was signed. ``The \ntime for peace has come,'' he said. ``We, the soldiers who have \nreturned from battles stained with blood * * * say in a loud and clear \nvoice: Enough of blood and tears. Enough.''\n  King Hussein appropriately eulogized Yitzhak Rabin as one who ``died \nas a soldier of peace.'' We can only hope that his assassination imbues \nthe peace process, pushing implementation of the Oslo II agreement \nforward. In earlier times Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin espoused \ndifferent views and styles within the same Labor Party tent, but in an \nironic twist the two forged a personal alliance these last few years in \nthe name of peace. I have high hopes for the Acting Prime Minister \ncarrying forward with Rabin's good work.\n  For if he were with us today, I think Yitzhak Rabin would urge us to \nfinish the job he has begun. It only saddens me that this courageous \nleader did not live to enjoy the fruits of his own labor to create a \nbetter future for Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16724-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE DEATH OF YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President I, rise today to express my profound grief \nover the death of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin--a man who was \nbrave in the conduct of war and courageous in the pursuit of peace.\n  Yitzhak Rabin's life embodied the very concept of leadership. He was \na warrior of great skill, an accomplished diplomat, and, in the fullest \nsense of the term, a statesman. His leadership was a catalyst of \nreconciliation and peace in a region long torn by animosity and war. \nThe dramatic progress we have witnessed over the last 2 years in the \nMiddle East peace process would not have occurred without the \nleadership of Yitzhak Rabin.\n  One of his key strengths as a leader was his ability to bond realism \nwith optimism. It is a trait that is all too rare and all too necessary \nin regions beset by conflict.\n  Rabin combined his acute understanding of the obstacles to peace in \nthe Middle East with his recognition that peace was essential to \nsecurity of his nation. The product is the historic roadmap in the \nMiddle East we must now follow. It has not, nor will not, be an easy \npath. It will be all the more difficult in his absence.\n  In such endeavors, leaders matter. Rabin's tenure as Prime Minister \ndemonstrated this clearly. Despite setbacks and ever present dangers, \nRabin never allowed himself to become disillusioned with prospects for \npeace. He forged ahead. He marshalled support for what were initially \nunpopular, but nonetheless necessary, steps toward Arab-Israeli \nreconciliation. Rabin kept the process on track.\n  The death of Yitzhak Rabin is clearly a blow to the peace process. \nHowever, Mr. President, his assassination is not a reflection of the \nfragility of peace he has helped bring to the Middle East. It is a \nreflection of the urgency with which we must work to consolidate that \npeace.\n  We must remember that while leaders matter, it is their visions that \nare enduring. Yitzhak Rabin left to Israel and the Middle East, indeed \nto the world, a vision of reconciliation that will be his lasting \nlegacy. Our greatest contribution to the memory of Yitzhak Rabin must \nnot be our grief over his departure, but determination to ensure that \nhis vision of peace and reconciliation becomes an enduring reality in \nthe Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16725-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16725-S16726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING YITZHAK RABIN: WARRIOR FOR PEACE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nremember one of America's greatest friends--my friend Yitzhak Rabin--\nwho was tragically murdered Saturday in Israel. His sudden death is \neven more shocking because he was assassinated just after making an \nimpassioned speech for peace in the Mideast.\n  Mr. President, Yitzhak Rabin was the strongest leader in today's \nworld. Period. As he guided the ship of Israel through a sea of \nhostility, he forcefully led the troubled Mideast toward peace. We can \nonly hope that we continue to seek the Prime Minister's goal--peace \namong Moslem, Christian, and Jew--and continue to turn away from the \nviolence that always bubbles just under the surface in that part of the \nworld.\n  Yitzhak Rabin trained to be a farmer. Like one of our greatest \nPresidents, Harry S. Truman, Prime Minister Rabin had the plain-\nspeaking, straightforward, blunt common sense of farmers. But also like \nTruman, Rabin's destiny led him to the army and to becoming a world \nleader whose strategic intellect was respected all over.\n  Just 6 years ago, Senators Daniel Inouye, Jake Garn, and I spent \nseveral hours with Rabin when he was Israel's Defense Minister. To this \nday, I will not forget the time that Mr. Rabin spent showing us the \nintricate desert defense preparations made by Israel. His courtesy, \ncombined with his intense attention to detail, made our mission a \nlearning success.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing that I have realized in recent \nyears, it is that Yitzhak Rabin was a warrior for peace in the Mideast. \nWhen Israel's security was in grave danger, he fought and led military \nbattles, notably the Six-Day War in 1967. But over time, he came to \nembrace peace as the only way for Mideast stability.\n  Just 90 minutes before he was gunned down in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister \nRabin stood before more than 100,000 people at a rally to implore them \nto harvest the fruits of peace. He said, ``I waged war as long as there \nwas no chance for peace. I believe there is now a chance for peace, a \ngreat chance, and we must take advantage of it for those standing here, \nand for those who are not here.'' A few moments later, he added, ``The \npeople truly want peace and oppose violence. Violence erodes the basis \nof Israeli democracy.''\n  Mr. President, today, in our grief, as we remember our friend Yitzhak \nRabin, let us all look to his last words for the guidance to achieve \nthe greatest legacy we can give our friend--a lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, an editorial in today's edition of the State of \nColumbia is a fitting tribute to Prime Minister Rabin. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Rabin: ``Best in War, But * * * Greatest in Peace''\n\n       Among the thousands who will experience the funeral of \n     Yitzhak Rabin in front of an international audience today, \n     the thoughts should be on the peace process the Israeli prime \n     minister was setting up when an assassin struck him.\n       As Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said, Mr. Rabin was ``at \n     his best in war, but at his greatest in peace.''\n       There was more truth than hyperbole in this. The man was a \n     warrior who served as chief of staff of the Israel Defense \n     Forces, overseeing the dramatic victory over Arab armies in \n     the Six-Day War of 1967. He had risen to this position after \n     more than 20 years as a soldier, a career that began in the \n     Jewish underground before independence, as a commando in \n     Haganah.\n\n[[Page S 16726]]\n\n       That victory gave Israel territory in the Sinai that was \n     released when Egypt's Anwar Sadat made peace with the Jewish \n     state. And it also brought Israel captured land that his \n     country is giving back now in negotiations with the once-\n     hated Palestinians.\n       Mr. Rabin's superb marks as a warrior helped position him \n     as a man of steel, one who could be depended upon to hold the \n     security of Israel foremost as he slipped into his role as \n     statesman.\n       He became ambassador to the United States after the Six-Day \n     War. By 1973 he was back in Israel as a Labor Party member, \n     becoming prime minister in 1974 in the wake of the difficult \n     Yom Kippur War. He became the first sabra--native-born \n     Israeli--to serve as prime minister.\n       A minor scandal helped send Mr. Rabin packing in 1977 when \n     the Likud conservative party took over for some years. Then \n     in 1984, he returned to government as defense minister in a \n     coalition regime headed by Likud leaders. His political \n     rehabilitation was kindled by the Palestinian intifada \n     (uprising) that began in 1987 and caused the defense minister \n     to order the breaking of limbs instead of shooting. \n     Ultimately, he lost faith in that policy, and came to believe \n     that territorial concessions to the Palestinians were a \n     requirement for peace.\n       The election of 1992 restored Labor and made Mr. Rabin \n     prime minister again. An old Labor rival, Mr. Peres, became \n     foreign minister and soon started the Olso talks that set up \n     the first meeting between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and the \n     Rabin-Peres team at the White House. That was the beginning \n     of the current West Bank talks.\n       Those discussions enraged the Israeli right. Right-wing \n     Israelis paraded effigies of Mr. Rabin as a Nazi officer or \n     portrayed him wearing a kafflyeh (Arab head dress). And so it \n     was that on Saturday, after a peace rally with 100,000 \n     Israelis, a Jew broke a commandant never to shoot a Jew. Like \n     Egypt's Anwar Sadat, Yitzhak Rabin was killed by one of his \n     own people. In the assassin-filled Mideast, he is the first \n     Israeli prime minister to die at a terrorist's hand.\n       Despite a seven-day period of mourning, the Labor Party has \n     already reestablished itself under Mr. Peres. Likud leader \n     Benjamin Netanyahu has lamented, ``We debate, we shout, we \n     don't shoot.'' But it does not appear that Netanyahu will \n     seek another election soon, although about half the populance \n     seems to be on his side. Among them are the zealots who must \n     be restrained.\n       As the architect of peace, Mr. Peres knows the process and \n     the principal players. He can lead if he's not considered too \n     dovish. Maybe a Rabin is necessary to act firmly. Let's hope \n     not.\n       Let peace, not war, be Yitzhak Rabin's legacy. His own \n     countrymen, more so than the 40 heads of state at his funeral \n     today, hold the key to this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16725-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GORDON ELDREDGE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The club, which has about 1,000 \nmembers, has built its soccer program into one of the premier youth \nsports activities in Billings. The inviting new building serves not \nonly club members, but any child who cares to participate.\n  This is all due to the vision and compassion of one man, the man I am \nso proud to recognize today.

Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now slightly \nin excess of $15 billion shy of $5 trillion, has been fueled for a \ngeneration by bureaucratic hot air--sort of like a hot air balloon \nwhirling out of control--which everybody has talked about, but almost \nnobody even tried to fix. That attitude began to change, however, \nimmediately after the November 1994 elections.\n  The 104th Congress promised to hold true to the Founding Fathers' \ndecree that the executive branch of the U.S. Government should never be \nable to spend a dime unless and until it had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  So, when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the House \nof Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but 1 of the 54 Republican \nSenators supported the balanced budget amendment.\n  That was the good news. The bad news was that only 13 Democrat \nSenators supported it, and that killed the balanced budget amendment \nfor the time being. Since a two-thirds vote--67 Senators, if all \nSenators are present--is necessary to approve a constitutional \namendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one vote. There will \nbe another vote during the 104th Congress.\n  Here's today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Monday, November 7, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,984,737,460,958.92.\n  That amounts to $18,922.15--on a per capita basis--for every man, \nwoman, and child in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16726-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16726-S16727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRAGEDY FOR ISRAEL AND THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the death of Yitzhak Rabin was many things--\nthe loss of a hero, a blow to the momentum of the peace process, a vile \nact of political terror. Israel, whose people are accustomed to tragedy \nand unspeakable inhumanity, has been confronted with something \nunexpectedly sinister. An attack from within. While Israel has taught \nthe rest of the free world to bear the burden of terrorism and fight \nback, it has never had to cope with the assassination of a leader by a \nfellow citizen. Something has changed forever with the death of Yitzhak \nRabin. But much more remains the same.\n  In the aftermath of the tragedy, Israelis poured out into the \nstreets, lighting candles and keeping an all night vigil of prayer. The \nnext day, as Yitzhak Rabin lay in state at the Knesset, a million \nmourners--a quarter of Israel's population--paid their respects. \nIsraelis of all political viewpoints united to mourn their prime \nminister. In a unique and historic tribute, leaders of Arab countries, \nincluding King Hussein of Jordan and President Mubarak of Egypt, and a \nPalestinian delegation, attended the funeral alongside mourners from \nall over the world. Finally, Israel's leader in war and peace was laid \nto rest at Mount Herzl, Jerusalem's military cemetery, near graves of \nother soldiers who died defending Israel.\n  Just before the funeral began, a siren sounded across Israel, \nsignaling Israelis everywhere to observe a moment of silence. Every \nyear, on Israel's Memorial Day, this siren signals Israelis to stop \nwhatever they are doing to honor the nation's fallen soldiers. On \nMonday, heads of state and royalty from all over the world paid tribute \nto Yitzhak Rabin. Yet it is the image of Israel's people, making \npilgrimages to his home in Jerusalem, lining the route of the funeral \nprocession, and standing silently during the siren that epitomizes for \nme the death of a hero.\n  Time and time again, Israel has endured crises and tragedies. Time \nand time again the Israeli people have grown stronger and more \ncommitted to their Zionist mission. The people of Israel have, in a \nshort time, accomplished many dramatic successes. They have farmed the \ndesert. They have welcomed hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants \nfrom diverse backgrounds, not to mention refugees from Vietnam, and \nBosnia. They have fought wars, and repelled terrorist attacks, while \nestablishing a democratic Jewish state, based on the rule of law. I \nhave been to Israel and met with its leaders and ordinary citizens. \nNow, as Israel faces yet another difficult challenge, I have faith that \nthe Israeli people will come together in their grief to carry on \nIsrael's role as the strongest democracy and United States ally in the \nMiddle East. \n\n[[Page S 16727]]\n\n  It is very difficult to imagine Israel without Yitzhak Rabin. His \nlife and career tracked the dramatic events of Israel's founding. He \noversaw the development of its army, commanding it at one of its most \nperilous moments, the 1967 Six-Day War, and overseeing Israel's defense \nduring the difficult period of the Intifada. He worked to strengthen \nthe United States-Israel alliance as Israel's Ambassador to Washington. \nAs Prime Minister, he worked for peace while safeguarding Israel's \nsecurity. Finally, let no one forget, he gave his life for peace. There \nis a Hebrew saying invoked in times of mourning, ``May his memory be a \nblessing.'' Yitzhak Rabin's life was a blessing to Israel, and to the \nworld. His memory will serve as an inspiration to all of us in the \ndifficult days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16726-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OSCAR DYSON, A FRIEND OF FISHERIES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to note with great regret \nthe passing of one of Alaska's most prominent citizens, Oscar Dyson, on \nSaturday, October 28.\n  Oscar Dyson was a true pioneer and an authentic Alaskan sourdough who \nepitomized the can-do spirit of the Last Frontier.\n  Born in Rhode Island, he first came to Alaska in 1940, after working \nhis way across the country. When World War II began, he went to work \nbuilding airstrips for the Army Corps of Engineers. When Japanese \nairplanes attacked Dutch Harbor and invaded the Aleutian Islands, Oscar \nDyson was there.\n  After the war, Oscar truly came into his own. He started commercial \nfishing in 1946, beginning a career that would span generations and \nwould make him one of the most well-known and admired figures in the \nU.S. fishing industry.\n  Over the years, Oscar pioneered fishery after fishery. Starting as a \nsalmon and halibut fisherman after the war, he branched out into \nshrimp, king crab, and ultimately, in groundfish. In 1971, he made the \nfirst-ever delivery of Alaska pollock to a shore-based U.S. processor, \nstarting an industry that now has an annual harvest of over 3 billion \npounds--the largest single fishery in the United States and the fourth \nin value--which now represents a full 30 percent of the United States \ncommercial harvest.\n  In the 1970's, while remaining an active fisherman, Oscar also \ndiversified, joining with several other fishermen to purchase what \nbecame a highly successful and innovative seafood processing company.\n  Oscar thought of himself--first, last, and always--as a fisherman. \nBut to those of us who knew him, he was far more. He knew that good \ncitizens must be ready to give something back to this great Republic, \nand he was as good as his word. He served 13 years on Alaska's Board of \nFisheries, and three terms on the Federal North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council. He also served his country as an advisory and \nrepresentative in international fishery negotiations with Japan and \nRussia.\n  He did not stop there. He was a founding member of the United \nFishermen's Marketing Association and the Alaska Draggers Association. \nHe gave his time to the Kodiak City Council, the Kodiak Community \nCollege, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, and the Alaska \nGovernor's Fishery Task Force, to name a few of many. And he worked \ntirelessly toward the goals of the Alaska Fisheries Development \nFoundation, and Kodiak's Fishery Industrial Technology Center. Always, \nhe helped lead his fellow fishermen toward a stronger, sustainable \nfuture.\n  In 1985, Oscar was chosen by National Fisherman magazine to receive \nits prestigious Highliner of the Year awards. And this year, just days \nbefore the fatal accident that took his life, he was made the National \nFisheries Institute's Person of the Year, the institute's highest \nhonor.\n  Finally, Oscar believed strongly in our Nation's youth. Both by \nexample and by application, his kindness, humor, understanding, and \nsage advice guided generations of young people. He helped them ``learn \nthe ropes,'' and they gained the confidence to go out into the world \nand--like Oscar himself--to make it better. There can be no greater \nmemorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16727-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late \nYitzhak Rabin who served his people in war and in peace and did both \nwith great bravery. The Government of Israel and the people of Israel \nhave suffered a deep wound that will take a great deal of time to heal.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I along with many of my colleagues, stood with him \nin the rotunda of the Capitol to present to him, a copy of the bill \nwhich would move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to \nJerusalem, the Holy City. I was most proud then and most proud now to \nhave been there. One could not, of course, guess that only 2 weeks \nlater, this horrible, cowardly act would occur.\n  The Prime Minister's goal of peace for Israel, after so very many \nyears of blood and tears, is one that cannot be abandoned. I am sure \nthat Israel will find the strength to move forward. Peace, like \nIsrael's security, is of vital importance to Israel and the United \nStates alike. Yet, one cannot argue the point that Israel will not be \nthe same without him. He was a hero and a towering figure of his time.\n  My heart goes out to the Rabin family at this most unfortunate time. \nThey can take solace in the fact that Yitzhak Rabin will forever be \nremembered as a peacemaker for his people--a peacemaker for Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16727-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16727-S16728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAREWELL TO PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects to a man who \nwill be remembered as one of history's giants.\n  I know that all of us in the Senate--indeed, throughout the Nation--\nwere shocked and saddened by the news of the assassination of Israeli \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Having just returned from accompanying \nPresident Clinton to the Prime Minister's funeral, I can also bear \nwitness to the devastating, emotional impact of the assassination on \nthe fabric--indeed, on every fiber--of Israel's society.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to Prime \nMinister Rabin's legacy and expressing support for the people of Israel \nand the government of acting-Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Those are \nfine and appropriate sentiments, and I was pleased to cosponsor the \nresolution. It is indeed proper for the Senate to act quickly to \nreaffirm its unique and unwavering commitment to the State of Israel.\n  Yet in a certain sense, the words in the resolution we passed \nyesterday could never do justice to the rich, complicated, and \nultimately heroic life of Yitzhak Rabin.\n  Prime Minister Rabin did not inspire love as much as confidence. Even \nif they disagreed with him, his countrymen could be assured of his \ncommitment to their safety and security. To me, the grieving Israelis, \nwhose pictures we have seen on television and in the papers, are \nprobably not moved entirely by sentiments and emotions--although that \nis surely part of it. But I think the real reason they seem so fragile \nis because they have lost their anchor, and as a result are uncertain \nof their world. It is a measure of Rabin's greatness that his passing \ncould have so profound an impact.\n  Prime Minister Rabin was the quintessential soldier--his thinking \nstrategic, his analysis solid and calculating, his style terse, and his \nauthority unquestioned. These qualities, which served him so well on \nthe battlefield, were also the distinguishing characteristics of his \npolitical career. Although the ends he pursued seemed contradictory--\ndecisive military victory on the one hand, peaceful coexistence on the \nother--the means by which he pursued them never changed. He brought to \nthe peace table the same dogged determination, the same self-confidence \nthat he possessed in the war room.\n  One of the quirks of world politics is that revolutionary change \noften springs from the most unexpected sources. The political pundits \nof the 1970's, for instance, would never have guessed that President \nNixon would be the first to visit China. A decade later, \n\n[[Page S 16728]]\nno one could have predicted that President Reagan would be the one to \nsign far-reaching arms control agreements with the Evil Empire, the \nSoviet Union. By the same token, it was equally improbable that Rabin, \nwho arguably was more concerned with the security of Israel than many \nof his compatriots, would take such unprecedented risks for peace. It \ndefies expectation even more that this gruff soldier-turned-statesman \ncould speak so ardently and passionately in defense of his decisions.\n  I think that many amongst us will always associate Prime Minister \nRabin with his historic appearance on the White House lawn in September \n1993, when he shook Yasir Arafat's hand in full view of the world. I \nwell remember that sun-spilled morning, a day full of hope and promise. \nSome moments in history are so dramatic, so full of vitality, that they \nwill never fade. Such was that day. For me, the defining moment came \nwhen Prime Minister Rabin uttered the unforgettable words I now shall \nquote:\n\n       We are destined to live together on the same soil in the \n     same land. We, the soldiers who have returned from battles \n     stained with blood; we who have seen our relatives and \n     friends killed before our eyes; we who have attended their \n     funerals and cannot look into the eyes of their parents; we \n     who have come from a land where parents bury their children; \n     we who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to \n     you today in a loud and a clear voice: Enough of blood and \n     tears. Enough!\n\n  Those, Mr. President, are not the words of a warrior, but of a poet. \nI do not know if there is more unlikely an author for such stirring \nprose than Prime Minister Rabin, but it serves to remind us of the \ndepth of his character, the multifaceted nature of his personality.\n\n  The complexities that so were evident in Rabin go to the very heart \nof leadership. In every democracy, there often emerges a struggle \nbetween the will of the people and the best instincts of their \nrepresentatives. Prime Minister Rabin's decisions on the peace process \nwere not always popular or well-received, but he was able to move his \ncountry in a new direction because of the strength and courage of his \nconvictions. He came to believe as relentlessly in peace as he did in \nmilitary strength, and brought a reluctant nation along with him. That, \nMr. President, is the essence of leadership.\n  The United States has lost a trusted and valued friend, and Israel \nhas lost one of its fiercest, and most noble lions. While nothing has \nchanged that is fundamental between us, our two countries will never \nlook at each other quite the same. That will be the result of having \nlost, in such a sudden and unthinkable way, one such as Prime Minister \nRabin. Our Nation mourns his loss, and grieves with his family and \nfriends.\n  Soldier, diplomat, leader, a peacemaker, Nobel laureate--to be \nsuccessful at any one of these is more than enough for a rich and \nfulfilling life. Prime Minister Rabin excelled at all of them, and for \nthat, history will forever remember and revere him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16727-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEATH OF MARTHA MOLONEY\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on a matter that \nbrings me great personal sadness. A loyal and trusted member of my \nstaff, Martha Moloney, passed away over the weekend, after a long \nbattle with cancer.\n  I know that many of my colleagues will understand when I say that my \nstaff is like a second family to me. And perhaps, it is even more \npronounced for me, because of the length of time my staff has continued \nto serve me with such loyalty and dedication. Martha was one of those \nstaffers, working with me for 18 years, nearly my entire service in the \nSenate.\n  Over the years, I had the privilege to see her develop her \nlegislative acumen, having a hand in numerous historic legislative \nachievements and working on airport projects all across my State.\n  I depended immensely on her political sense and her knowledge of \naviation and telecommunications issues. Her work certainly did not go \nunnoticed in Kentucky. Because of her commitment of time and energy, \nofficials at one of our largest airports named a street after her. I \nwill be forever grateful for the countless times that her advice and \ncounsel helped me make the best decisions for Kentucky and the Nation. \nI know that many Kentuckians will share my belief that she will be \nimpossible to replace.\n  I also saw her confront a terrible illness and turn it into a series \na personal triumphs. Because of her bravery and commitment, last year's \nNational Race for the Cure on behalf of breast cancer, had over 200 \nparticipants who ran, walked, and said, ``Doing it for Martha.'' As a \nresult of the personal outpouring of support on her behalf, the entire \nrace will be dedicated in Martha's honor next year. It is the largest 5 \nkilometer race in the world.\n  If you look simply at her 25 years of public service, first in her \nnative Kentucky and then in Washington, you cannot help but be \nimpressed by her commitment to a State and its people. But, that really \ndoes not begin to define a woman whose gifts and talents were many.\n  I know my fellow Kentuckians will agree when I say she was a true \nsouthern woman in the best of that tradition. She was intelligent and \narticulate, not a bit afraid to speak her mind, a gracious hostess and \ntalented artist creating beautiful quilts and needlework, and to the \nend, compassionate and giving.\n  She was the accomplished cook who was as proud of the meal she cooked \nat Christ House or Carpenter's homeless shelter as she was of the \ngourmet spread you were guaranteed when invited to dinner.\n  She was the woman who faced death much too early, yet was determined \nin the last months of needlepoint the Christmas ornaments her friends \nand colleagues had come to expect each year, before it was too late.\n  Not long ago, I read the words of a pastor who said that ``If you \nlook hard enough, you can see God's image even in someone whose life is \nforeign to yours, and you can have compassion for him.''

Mr. President, the hills of Jerusalem were quiet \nyesterday as world leaders gathered to pay tribute to Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin, a man who served and led Israel for more than 50 years \nboth in war and in peace. Yitzhak Rabin was a true leader in every \nsense of the word. A man who, after having led his nation in war \nbattling for freedom, turned to his own countrymen to seek peace for \nthe long-term security of Israel.\n  In the days since his tragic death, much has been said of Yitzhak \nRabin's unique role in brokering peace in the Middle East. Friends and \nformer foes agree Mr. Rabin achieved progress where perhaps no other \nIsraeli leader was capable. Because of his strong military record, \nYitzhak Rabin brought legitimacy to his quest to stop the bloodshed of \nIsraelis. Only a man who led his country to great victories in war \ncould argue effectively against concerns that Israel was giving up its \nsecurity in negotiating peace with her neighbors.\n   From Yitzhak Rabin's early days as a young soldier in the Palmach, \nto his meteoric rise to Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army, he was \ncredited worldwide as having one of the most insightful military minds \nof his time. He was primarily responsible for creating the army which \nled Israel to victory over Egypt, Jordan, and Syria and included the \ncapture of the Old City of Jerusalem in the Six-Day war. Yet it may \nhave been his close contact with war that led him to eventually realize \nthat the only true prospect to ending the Palestinian question was \nnegotiation, and not a military solution.\n  One of the most tangible examples of what his efforts for peace have \ngarnered was the presence of King Hussein and President Hosni Mubarak \nat the funeral services at Mount Herzl Cemetery. These men, once \nenemies, joined over 30 other world leaders to honor a man they had \nfaced on the battlefield and then again at the equally difficult peace \ntable.\n  Yitzhak Rabin inspired in most Israeli citizens a sense of confidence \nthat in these troubled times he was acting in the interest of Israel's \nlong-term \n\n[[Page S 16729]]\nprosperity. He viewed peace negotiation as a necessity to secure \nIsrael's future in the Middle East, putting aside whatever personal \nremembrances he may have carried from his days as a soldier. The \npinnacle of his career was witnessed by millions of people on September \n13, 1993, when he and Yasir Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn \nafter the signing of the Declaration of Principles. On that day, he \nspoke words meant for Israel's Arab enemies but now tragically apply to \nfellow Israelis, ``We are today giving peace a chance--and saying to \nyou and saying again to you: enough. Let us pray that a day will come \nwhen we all will say farewell to the arms.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16728-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, like so many of my colleagues, I want to \nrise today and pay tribute to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak \nRabin, who lost his life in the name of peace this past Saturday in Tel \nAviv.\n  Many of us have spent the last several days mourning the loss of a \ngreat man--not only for Israel but also for the world. On Monday, \nKings, Presidents and Princes gathered in Jerusalem to pay tribute to \nthis finest of leaders--the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. \nBut as I listened to the statements of praise and honor, I was struck \nmost by the words of his granddaughter, who spoke of his place in \nHeaven more than his place in history. ``Grandfather,'' she said, ``may \nthe God of Israel that keeps over all of us keep you in Heaven, as you \nmerit.''\n  Heaven now cradles the man who spent his life fighting wars and \nwaging peace on behalf of the great nation of Israel. And so it is left \nto those of us still living to carry his torch--that ``pillar of fire'' \ndescribed by his granddaughter, that lit a path toward peace few \nthought possible. Yitzhak Rabin, we will miss your vision and courage. \nBut we will not let the message of your life be lost. Today it falls to \neach of us, citizens and leaders of all nations, to guarantee that your \nlegacy of peace is fully realized.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was trusted by Israelis first for his military \nknowledge, and later for his political leadership. He has been a \ncentral actor in his nation's history since its founding in 1948, \nleading his country through times of war and peace. His was truly a \nremarkable life, held together by a singular, unwavering commitment to \nthe security of Israel.\n  Yitzhak Rabin once said that he worked to end the hostilities in the \nregion so that his children and his children's children would no longer \n``experience the painful cost of war.'' Today, on behalf of Yitzhak \nRabin's granddaughter and all the children of Israel, we must not ask \nif the Middle East peace process can survive, but rather, how. We must \ndevote ourselves to that goal with unity and courage.\n  For my part, my commitment to ensuring a strong and secure Israel \nremains steadfast. As always, Israel has a true and lasting friend in \nthe United States. Since its founding, the American people have stood \nby Israel in the search for peace and stability. Today, as Israeli \ncitizens mourn, we stand by our friend. In the months ahead, we will \nstand by Israel's side as that nation heals, and as it finds the \ncourage to take the next step toward peace.\n  Shalom, Yitzhak Rabin. We praise your life and the gifts you gave to \nIsrael and the world community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16729-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONDOLENCES TO ISRAEL\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to add my \nvoice to those that have been raised all over the world to say how sad \nwe are today to have lost a great leader in the peace process in the \nMiddle East. I, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, have met \nwith Prime Minister Rabin, and I, like so many others who have spoken \nfor the last few days, had great respect for him.\n  I want to say at a time like this, you look to your friendships for \nsupport and comfort. Clearly, America is there for the support and \ncomfort of our friend, our ally, and our strong, strong compatriot, the \nState of Israel. We are there to make sure that we get through this \ntesting period strong in body together.\n  Mr. President, I think as I look back on the events of the last few \ndays, what struck me the most is how far the leadership of Prime \nMinister Rabin, along with his predecessors, brought us. The funeral \nitself would never have happened in our dreams. We would never have \nseen the President of Egypt, the King of Jordan, and even the good \nwishes of the PLO chief, coming together to say we are able to speak in \none voice that this should not have happened, that we want to seek \npeace. I think now everyone believes that peace is achievable in the \nMiddle East. That could not have happened 10 years ago.\n  Just seeing what we saw at the funeral yesterday makes us realize how \nfar we have come. It makes us miss all the more the leadership that \nPrime Minister Rabin has given in this country for so long, first as a \nmilitary spokesman, a military strategist, a hard-liner, if you will.\n  The Prime Minister saw how the strength of Israel was one and how the \nstrength of Israel could be made to continue and endure into the future \ngenerations. I think he saw that peace was the answer that they had \ncome to where they were by sheer grit and sheer determination. But he \nsaw that it took more to have a lasting place in the Middle East, and \nhe was coming around to bringing the people of Israel with him.\n  So I add my voice and say that my condolences go to the people of \nIsrael, to Prime Minister Rabin's widow, and just say that the comfort \nthat is there in seeing the funeral for the fallen leader of Israel and \nthe diversity of people from around the world, leaders of country, who \ncame to pay their respects, said more than anything else, that we are \nat the cusp of a time when we will see peace in the Middle East.\n  I just want to reiterate this Senator's strong position, that America \nwill be there, hand-in-hand with our friends, to make sure that Prime \nMinister Rabin's dreams will not die. They will be carried on by his \nsuccessors in office and by the future generations of leaders of \nIsrael.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair will inform the Senator we are scheduled, under previous \nconsent, to be in recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 5 \nminutes or a short period of time thereafter, and under that unanimous-\nconsent request the 12:30 hour for recess be set aside temporarily, so \nthat I might finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16729-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16729-S16730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER RABIN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the shocking \nloss to the world caused by the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin, \nthe beloved Prime Minister of our friend, the State of Israel. I have \nheard several of my colleagues' remarks on the sadness of this moment, \nthe terrible loss that we feel here in the United States and the \nterrible situation that is going on inside the State of Israel today; \npeople obviously in dismay and disbelief. This is a very, very sad \nevent.\n  I have listened with great interest this morning to my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Minnesota. I simply say he said everything \nso well, I think it will suffice to say that I wish to associate myself \nwith the remarks by Senator Wellstone on the floor of the Senate \nearlier today. He summed it up so very, very well that I cannot add to \nit.\n  Those of us who had our lives touched by Prime Minister Rabin, those \nof us who knew him, those of us who were with him, those of us who \nlistened to his sound advice with regard to world leadership for peace \nover the years, feel a terrible loss. Our hearts go out to his family, \nto his constituents in the State of Israel, where he led so \ncourageously and so bravely.\n  A true warrior of peace has been struck down. We all should recognize \n\n\n[[Page S 16730]]\nand realize this is a time, possibly, to have this terrible loss \nsolidify the drive for peace in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16729-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there is a great deal of rhetoric going on \ntoday about where the Nation is going with regard to the balanced \nbudget that this Senator supported for a long, long time. I remind the \nSenate it was this Senator who voted with the near majority to reach \nthe required number of votes for setting a constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget. I have been known as a conservative Democrat for a \nlong, long time, who has been against the wild-eyed spending that has \nengulfed our Nation for far too long. I stand ready with Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to march forward if we can, in a bipartisan \nfashion, not dictated by the budget resolution that was passed in the \nSenate.\n  The first thing I would like to do is address some of the talk that \nis going on today, talk I am very fearful is impinging upon the basic \ntenets of our Government. It seems to me the majority of Republicans in \nthe Senate and the majority of Republicans in the House, at least their \nleadership, are now, unfortunately, working their way to try and thwart \nthe rightful duties guaranteed under the Constitution to the President \nwith regard to the veto process.\n  This is all centered now around the extension of the debt ceiling. I \nthink it is time, now, we strip aside the facade that the Republicans \nhave fashioned about their objections to raising the debt limit.\n  If you examine the Republican bill and reasonably add up the numbers, \nyou discover the necessity by the Republicans to raise the debt ceiling \nby $1.8 trillion, from its present $4.9 trillion to $6.7 trillion by \nthe year 2002. This is the best kept secret in Washington.\n  It is necessary for them to raise the debt ceiling to help \naccommodate their $245 billion tax break for the wealthy and cover the \never-increasing interest costs resulting therefrom. It is significant \nto note that in the Republican bill, they are increasing in the short \nterm the National debt by $600 billion in the years 1996 to 1997.\n  Since this is the Republican's clearly needed goal, why do they \nrefuse to do it now--to avert the threat of a train wreck? Such action, \nif it were taken by the Republicans, would avert playing Russian \nroulette with the economy and would avert the cloud on the economy that \nwould be caused. Clearly, if we do not raise the debt ceiling, it would \nresult possibly in closing down Government and defaulting on Uncle \nSam's obligations for the first time in its history in not issuing \nSocial Security checks.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. The process that the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate are on right now in this regard is \nwrong from every standpoint, as I see it.\n  I am sure that the Republican majorities in both the House and the \nSenate will pass the conference report. I am just as sure that \nPresident Clinton will veto that bill, and he would be right to do so.\n  The Republicans do not have the votes to override a Presidential \nveto. And I am glad they do not. We will eventually have to sit down \nand start crafting a workable budget together.\n  I pledge cooperation, but not capitulation. To that end, all should \nknow where this Senator stands and where many other Senators stand who \nwant a balanced budget. Playing games with the debt ceiling is not a \nyearly casino night at the local men's club. The Republicans should not \nbe gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  These budget negotiations are delicate, and they will take time. At \nthe very least, we should extend the debt ceiling into early next year.\n  The same is true with the next continuing resolution. We should not \nbe taking hostages in these negotiations.\n  Second, we cannot, and will not, accept the Republican's current \nlevel of reductions in projected Medicare and Medicaid requirements. \nThese are extreme, and they are excessive. They must be pared back if \nthere is any hope of winning Democratic approval.\n  The same is true with tax breaks for the rich and the tax increases \nfor working families eligible for the earned-income tax credit. Deny it \nas much as you want, but there is a relationship between the size of \nthe tax breaks for the wealthy and the Medicare expenditures. The tax \nbreaks have to be scaled back and targeted more toward middle-income \nAmericans.\n  There are, of course, many others areas that will be on my list, \nparticularly with regard to rural America which has been mauled in this \nbudget. But I wanted to give you at least what I believe is the \nstarting point for a balanced budget that will win bipartisan \ncongressional support and the signature of the President of the United \nStates.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, instead of trying to see \nwho will blink first, why do not we try to see eye to eye on a few of \nthese issues? That is what the American people want. That is what they \ndeserve.\n  I stand ready to be of assistance to anyone on either side of the \naisle in coming together where both sides are going to have to give, \nand give on issues that they feel very strongly about. It is in the \ninterest of the United States of America, though, to get away from this \nRussian roulette that we are now headed toward, obviously with regard \nto the debt ceiling extension.\n  Mr. President, I say again, come, let us reason together.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16730-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have agreed to take this bill up at 2 \no'clock to accommodate a lot of our colleagues who were on a plane all \nnight. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for not objecting to that \nprocess.\n  We are going to take up H.R. 1833, which is a bill to ban partial-\nbirth abortions, and I think it is worth noting this bill passed by an \noverwhelming majority in the House. I know there will be efforts to \namend the House bill and refer the bill to committee. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject those efforts, because it is a straightforward \nbill. This isolates one procedure, one used up to the ninth month of \npregnancy, and one procedure alone. It is not calling into question \nsome of the larger abortion issues that so often divide us.\n  The American Medical Association's Council on Legislation voted \nunanimously to enforce H.R. 1833. A member of that council described it \nas not ``a recognized medical technique.''\n  The overwhelming majority vote in the House--including both those who \nconsider themselves pro-choice and pro-life--underscores that this bill \ndeserves immediate passage. After hearings and committee work in the \nHouse, nothing will be served by further delay. Those who seek to amend \nit are in effect trying to deprive this bill of any real meaning or \nsignificance.\n  The only people in America trying to defeat this bill are abortion \nextremists who believe that no compassion, no common sense, should ever \nget in the way of an anything-goes approach. I do not think reasonable \npeople, whatever their views on abortion, agree with that position.\n  Opponents of this bill know that. As a result, we will instead hear \nsoothing claims that opponents only want to amend the bill. There are \nthose, for example, who argue that this bill needs to be amended to \nprovide for an exception in cases where the life of the mother is at \nstake.\n\n[[Page S 16731]]\n\n  However, the bill already provides an affirmative defense in such \ncases. More to the point is the fact that arguments about life \nor health of the mother are designed to scare people and ignore the \nfacts. The facts are these: This procedure is a 3-day procedure--that \nis right, 3 days. This is not something where a quick medical decision \nis called for in a life-and-death situation and opponents know it.\n\n  Doctor Pamela Smith, director of medical education in the department \nof obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, IL, \nput it best:\n  Doctor Smith states unequivocally:\n\n       There are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered \n     in this country which require a partially delivered human \n     fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of the mother.\n\n  This is a straightforward and balanced bill that allows the Congress \nto do something it rarely has a chance to do: Step past divisive \nabortion arguments of the past, stand up for those who cannot defend \nthemselves and do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I urge my colleagues not to allow those who have a very different \nagenda to defeat or delay this bill's passage.\n  I hope as we get into the debate that we can debate this bill and not \nget into unrelated matters that have no possible reference to this \nbill. This is an important issue.\n  So, hopefully, we can complete action on it or do whatever the \nopponents wish to do, if they are going to send it back to committee. I \nthink there are a couple Members absent who support that approach and a \ncouple absent who support another approach. Perhaps we can have that \nvote tomorrow. This is worthy of debate, and I thank my colleagues for \nletting us proceed to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1833) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to ban partial-birth abortion.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to support very strongly \nH.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. I might also \npoint out that this is identical legislation to legislation I \nintroduced on the Senate side. It was originally cosponsored by Senator \nGramm of Texas and had some dozen or so cosponsors, including the \ndistinguished majority leader. But I decided that it would be just as \neasy to take the bill from the House side rather than to encumber the \nprocess with another piece of legislation.\n  So I am delighted to be here, frankly, on behalf of small children \nwho really do not have the opportunity to be here to speak for \nthemselves.\n  Last Wednesday, Madam President, was an extraordinary day in the \nhistory of the Nation's ongoing debate about abortion. There was a \ncoalition of Members of the House from both political parties, from all \nacross the philosophical spectrum. They were pro-choice. They were pro-\nlife. They had different degrees of what their pro-choice or pro-life \npositions were--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, pro-\nchoice, pro-life. But they came together to form a supermajority, a \ntwo-thirds majority to pass this bill in the House, H.R. 1833.\n  Two of the highest ranking Members of the House minority leadership, \nCongressman Gephardt and Congressman Bonior, joined together with the \ntwo highest ranking leaders of the majority leadership, Newt Gingrich \nand Dick Armey, in voting to pass this bill. I point this out, Madam \nPresident, because this is quite different from the debates that we \nhave had here in the past on the issue of abortion. I think it goes \nright to the heart of how different this particular bill is to some of \nthe other debates. Perhaps even more significant, the House's two-\nthirds majority for this bill, again, transcended the usual voting \npatterns of abortion-related issues.\n  It is interesting some of the names that came out of this debate: \nPro-choice Democrats Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Jim Moran of \nVirginia joined with pro-choice Republicans like Susan Molinari of New \nYork and Charlie Bass and Bill Zeliff of my own State of New Hampshire \nto pass this bill to ban partial-birth abortions.\n  This does not mean that anybody compromises their views to do that. \nWhat it means is people looked at this issue very carefully with an \nopen mind and realized what a bad, disgusting process this really is \nand decided that America, in no way, should be a participant or in any \nway add the weight of this great country in this issue to this \nhorrible, horrible process and procedure.\n  So, Madam President, this great coalition, this supermajority--\nDemocrats, Republicans, pro-choice, pro-life, liberal, conservative--\ncame together. That does not very often happen around this place, and I \nthink that says something about this issue and the seriousness of it.\n  They came together because they came to see this bill as presenting a \nfundamental question, a very fundamental question, and that question is \na question of human rights.\n  The question of whether the very youngest, tiniest, most innocent of \nAmericans, those babies whose living, moving bodies have been brought \ninto the birth canal--into the birth canal--who, indeed are in the very \nprocess--the very process--of being born are deserving of the \nprotection of the law of the United States of America, because that is \nthe fundamental question we are going to face today when we vote on \nthis issue: Is this baby, moving 90 percent through the birth canal, \nexcept for the head, is this little baby in the birth canal 3 inches \nfrom full birth--3 inches from full birth--is this baby deserving of \nthe protection of the law as depicted in the Constitution of the United \nStates? That is the issue we face today. No other issue. No other \nissue. No other issue do we face today other than that one.\n  The House of Representatives, to their great credit, Madam President, \nanswered that fundamental question, and they answered it with a very \nresounding yes, by a supermajority of 288 to 139. When you look at the \nnumbers, you know that was not all Democrats on one side or all \nRepublicans on one side or all pro-life people on one side or all pro-\nchoice people on one side, it was a mix. They answered \nemphatically yes, yes, yes. These little children deserve the \nprotection of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  I was never prouder, in the 11 years I have spent here in Congress \nbetween the House and the Senate, than I was that day when people on \nboth sides of that issue came together. It was a magnificent day for \nthe House and a great day for this Nation. It was a great victory for \nthe cause of human rights, a great victory for the protection of an \ninnocent child in the birth canal, three inches away from birth.\n  It is hard for me to believe that it is necessary for me, or anyone \nelse, to stand here on the floor of the Senate today and have to fight \nfor that protection. It is hard for me to believe that. It has always \nbeen hard for me to believe that, but it is difficult for me to accept \nthe fact that is necessary, that there are those who would deny that \nprotection, as if somehow this was some generic process that did not \nimpact young children.\n  But beginning today, Madam President, the U.S. Senate, too, is going \nto face that same question. They are going to face the same question \nthat the House faced: Will we vote to extend the protection of the law \nto the youngest of our fellow Americans, those whose little bodies have \nemerged from womb into the birth canal and are in the process of being \nborn? That is the question we have to ask ourselves, and that is the \nquestion we are going to have to answer today.\n  As we start this debate, I just want to say a word to my pro-choice \ncolleagues. I do not agree with their positions on some matters of \nabortion, but I respect their right to have that position. This is \nAmerica. This is not a pro-choice/pro-life debate as we know it under \nthe other circumstances of the debate. It is certainly a life or death \ndebate.\n  As you listen to this debate, I say to my pro-choice colleagues, ask \nyourselves, why did Dick Gephardt, Patrick Kennedy, Susan Molinari, or \nany others, vote for this bill? You all know them. You are their pro-\nchoice colleagues. You know them and respect them, and you understand \ntheir views. Why did they do this? Why did 73 House \n\n[[Page S 16732]]\nDemocrats vote for this bill? I believe that if my pro-choice friends \nwill keep an open mind and try to listen to this debate, as I try to \nhonestly lay that debate out before you today, they will come to \nunderstand how and why that magnificent supermajority in the House came \ntogether to pass this bill.\n  Madam President, the one and only purpose of H.R. 1833 is to ban a \nsingle method of abortion that is first performed--not last, but \nfirst--at 19 to 20 weeks of gestation. That is a 5-month-old baby in \nthe womb. That is the beginning. It then goes beyond that. It goes to \nthe 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, right on up to birth, right on up to 9 \nmonths--any particular time in this period. It is often later than 19 \nor 20 weeks that this process can be performed. These are late-term \nbabies, the youngest of whom may have a fighting chance to live on \ntheir own outside of the womb, and the older of whom unquestionably \ncould live outside womb.\n  Those of you who are parents, or have been parents, have gone through \nthe process of feeling the heartbeat of your child--if you are a woman, \ninside your womb, and if you are a man, feeling that heartbeat inside \nwomb of your wife.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \njust a moment?\n  Mr. SMITH. I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. First of all, this is not a question; it is a statement of \nfact for the Record. I admire my friend from New Hampshire for taking \nthis responsibility on the Senate floor. I have been here many times on \nthe abortion issue along with others, and I am very, very proud of Bob \nSmith. I hope the people of New Hampshire understand that he is making \na gallant fight.\n  Now, my question: Has the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nseen the Chicago Tribune editorial of November 5?\n  Mr. SMITH. I answer that yes, and I have it right here.\n  Mr. HELMS. I wonder if he would read the first paragraph for me.\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, this is the Chicago Tribune editorial of November 5 \nof this year, entitled ``Method and Madness on Abortion.'' It starts:\n\n       In the national debate on abortion, the activists on both \n     sides invariably stake out absolutist positions. In so doing, \n     they often harm their respective causes by distancing \n     themselves from the people who make up the vast, ambivalent \n     middle ground of America.\n       Those who champion the pro-choice position fell into that \n     trap last week.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will hesitate a moment, now we get to the \nmeat of the coconut. When the subject of abortion comes up and \nquestions are asked of me, I have a ready question of my own to ask \nbefore we begin the discussion. I have asked it of young people, \nindividuals who border on militancy on the abortion issue, and many \nothers. It is a rather compelling question and it is this: What is an \nabortion?\n  Now, I hope the people of America understand the question, and I hope \nthey understand the answer. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire to \nanswer that question.\n  Mr. SMITH. Well, the answer to that question, from the perspective of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, is, I say to the Senator from North \nCarolina, that it is the process which interrupts the life of an unborn \nchild.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the Senator, it does not just interrupt the life, it \nconcludes the life, does it not?\n  Mr. SMITH. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Would it be fair to say that an abortion is a deliberate \nintent to destroy the most innocent, most helpless of human life? Is \nthat reasonably correct?\n  Mr. SMITH. That is certainly my position. I think that if there were \nnot to be any life there, there would not be any need to perform the \naction of abortion because there would not be anything to abort. So I \ndraw from that conclusion that it is a life and, therefore, somebody \nhad to take action to terminate that life.\n  Mr. HELMS. I wonder if the Senator is familiar with the quotation so \noften attributed to the late Douglas MacArthur. General MacArthur said: \n``In all of recorded history, there is no nation that survived in \nprosperity that lost its moral and spiritual motivation.''\n  Is the Senator familiar with that statement by Douglas MacArthur?\n  Mr. SMITH. I have heard that statement, yes, sir.\n  Mr. HELMS. The point is--and I ask the Senator further--Douglas \nMacArthur was talking about a whole range of things, was he not?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. MacArthur was speaking in terms of how a nation can self-\ndestruct by losing its sense of personal responsibility, its diligence, \nits willingness to work and to be constructive. I think the Senator is \ndoing a great job on this issue, and I am not going to take up much \nmore of his time.\n  Again I ask the Senator to please read the fourth paragraph of the \nChicago Tribune editorial, if he will.\n  Mr. SMITH. ``One can support abortion rights and still be horrified \nat such a procedure. The argument that this particular method could be \nessential to save the woman's life was unconvincing.''\n  Mr. HELMS. Now move back to the immediately preceding paragraph.\n  Mr. SMITH. ``The House, by more than a 2-1 ratio, voted to outlaw a \ngruesome form of late-term abortion. It involves the pulling the fetus, \nfeet first, through the birth canal and suctioning out the brains so \nthe skull collapses and the entire fetus is more easily removed.''\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator read the sentence again beginning with \n``It involves''? Read it slowly so that everybody watching on \ntelevision or sitting in this Chamber can understand exactly what is \nbeing discussed here today.\n  Mr. SMITH. It involves the pulling of the fetus feet first through \nthe birth canal and suctioning out the brain so the skull collapses and \nthe entire fetus is more easily removed.\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, let me clarify one more point with the Senator, and \nthen I will conclude this particular line of questioning.\n  One person said this procedure, in addition to being gruesome and \ncruel, is just 3 inches away from being totally unlawful.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. What does the Senator think he meant by that?\n  Mr. SMITH. I think that my interpretation, were it 3 inches further, \nif it were 3 inches further, the head would be delivered through the \nbirth canal and it would be a living child under the full protection of \nthe law.\n  Mr. HELMS. And the law, until fairly recently, took one position with \nrespect to the deliberate, intentional destruction of innocent human \nlife.\n  What did the law say the penalty was to a doctor who did that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Well----\n  Mr. HELMS. It was murder. And why murder? Because it was intentional?\n  Mr. SMITH. If it was intentional, that is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will be back with some more questions but I want to \ncompliment the Senator, and I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his comments \nand remarks. He has been a long-time supporter of the right to life.\n  Since the Senator from North Carolina brought up the Chicago Tribune \neditorial, I will read a couple of other lines from it because I think \nit makes the point very, very well. ``While the majority in the Nation \nmay support a woman's right to choose an abortion, most of the people \nwho make up that majority do not take an absolutist view. Reasonable \nrestrictions, such as parental notification requirements in the case of \nteen pregnancy, have significant national support. Public support for \nabortion also becomes much more tenuous in the case of fetuses that are \nnear the point of viability outside of the womb.''\n  These are not my positions, but I believe a life is a life. I also \nbelieve that there are many in America who do not go to the extreme \nthat this particular procedure does.\n  In conclusion, the editorial writer says, ``Indeed this may cause \nmoderates who generally support abortion rights to rethink their \ncomfort level with other forms of late-term abortion, particularly when \nthey see in this last week's debate there was a method to the \nmadness.''\n  Madam President, a few weeks ago I took to the floor of the Senate \nand I used a series of medical drawings and a photograph of a child \nthat was prematurely delivered. That is all I showed in terms of charts \nor graphs. \n\n[[Page S 16733]]\n\n  From that particular presentation that I made I was amazed at the \nirresponsibility of the press in terms of how they reported that. Now, \nI assume that the media that reported on it either watched the tape \nfrom C-SPAN, saw the debate from the galleries, or took somebody else's \nword for it.\n  Unfortunately, those who took somebody else's word for it did not get \nthe truth. It was reported that I had shown graphic photographs of \naborted fetuses--wrong. It was reported that I had somehow violated a \nwoman's right to privacy by showing photographs of a woman with a child \nin the birth canal--wrong. Also photographs of an aborted child. It \nwent on and on and on to the point of the ridiculous.\n  Today I am going to try again to see if the press can get it right. I \nhope they can.\n  These are medical drawings, medical drawings accepted by the American \nMedical Association. They are not photographs of women. They are \nmedical drawings. They are straightforward depictions of the procedure \nas described in an 8-page paper written in 1992 by Dr. Martin Haskell \nwho has performed over 1,000 of these abortions. In a tape recorded \ninterview with the American Medical News on July 5, 1993, Haskell \nhimself said ``The drawings were accurate from a technical point of \nview.''\n  During a June 15, 1995, public hearing before the House Judiciary \nConstitution subcommittee, Prof. J. Courtland Robinson, M.D., \ntestifying on behalf of the National Abortion Federation, was \nquestioned by Congressman Kennedy about the same line drawings \ndisplayed in poster size next to the witness table. Dr. Robinson agreed \nthey were technologically accurate, and also added ``This is exactly \nprobably what is occurring at the hands of the two physicians \ninvolved,'' just as we see this.\n  Also Prof. Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill, who is an internationally recognized authority on fetal and \nmaternal medicine, coeditor of the obstetrical and gynecological survey \nwrote a letter to Senator Kennedy: ``Having read Dr. Haskell's paper, I \ncan assure you these drawings accurately represent the procedure \ndescribed therein.''\n  I hope the media this time would get it right so I do not have to \nread editorials about me showing photographs of aborted fetuses and \nphotographs of women in the birth position and all this other nonsense \nthat people have been reporting. Get it right this time, please, those \nof you in the media.\n  I will show my colleague with these charts what is done to these \nlate-term babies in the partial birth abortion procedure, because you \nneed to know. You are going to be voting on whether or not to stop this \npractice, so therefore you should know what you are voting on.\n  Many, if not most of you, have already seen the illustrations. They \nhave appeared in advertisements in Roll Call, Congressional Quarterly, \nthe Hill, and other publications as well as medical journals all over \nthe country.\n  Now, some have tried to say that they are inaccurate and you will \nprobably hear that, but they have been published in the American \nMedical Association's own publication, which did not question their \nmedical accuracy.\n  Moreover, medical witnesses before the House Judiciary Committee \nhearing on this bill, even those who opposed the bill, conceded the \nillustrations are accurate from a technical point of view. So remember \nthat.\n  Now, in this first chart, with the aid of ultrasound, the abortion \ndoctor or the abortionist, the aid of ultrasound, finds out what the \nposition of the baby is. Then using forceps--remember now, these \nchildren, these babies, this is 20-week minimum, 19 to 20 week, 5-month \nfetus and beyond; it could be 6 months, 7 months, 8 months; that is the \nbeginning--reaches into the womb with the forceps, takes the child by \nthe foot, as you can see in this picture here and pulls the leg around.\n  Why do they do that? To turn the baby around so that the baby is \ndelivered by the feet first. Why? Because if the child comes through \nthe birth canal feet first, the child is not breathing. If it is head \nfirst, that is a birth--a live birth, my colleagues, and we have a \nliving baby under the protection of the law.\n  So we have to turn it around and do it feet first. That is what the \nabortionist does. Put the forceps on the tiny leg of this little child, \nturn it around in the womb so that it can be delivered feet first.\n  In the third chart, Madam President, we see that the abortionist here \nis pulling the child all the way out of the womb and into the birth \ncanal with the exception of the child's head. That is what is happening \nin this particular chart.\n\n  Now, I want to pause for a moment. I hope that everyone will think \nvery seriously. I want everyone to think very seriously about what is \nhappening here.\n  I have witnessed the birth of my three children. It was the most \nbeautiful thing I have ever witnessed in my life, and I am proud to say \nI was there. I am glad I was and I will never forget it; three children \nborn into the world. It happens every day. Many will be born while I am \nspeaking. Many will be aborted while I am speaking.\n  But here we have the hand of what could be a doctor but it is not a \ndoctor. It is a doctor, but his goal or her goal is not to save a life; \nit is to take one. Picture, if you can, those of you who have witnessed \na birth or can imagine what it might be like, these hands taking this \nchild--little feet, little legs, little torso, little behind--the arms, \nthe fingers moving as they do move. Oh, yes, there are fingers and toes \nat 5 months and beyond. You bet. And there is a heartbeat. It is a \nliving, breathing child. That little body 90 percent through the birth \ncanal, everything but the head, is 3 inches from the protection of the \nConstitution of the United States, in the hands of this doctor or \nabortionist; totally at their mercy.\n  Were it to be a doctor who was trying to deliver this child, it would \nbe a beautiful thing. If it were a premature baby, we would rush that \nbaby to what is called the preemie ward, hook it up to whatever tubes \nand essentials were necessary for life support to try to bring that \nchild to where they can come home with their mother.\n  But that is not the case here. That is not the case here. You see \nthere is a different objective. The next part is the worst part. It is \nvery difficult for me, frankly, to talk about it. That I have to stand \nhere on the floor of the Senate and talk about it is necessary because \nby standing here on the floor of the Senate and talking about it, I \nmight save one or more of these children from this horrible procedure. \nLet us look at what happens, my fellow Americans. Let us look at what \nhappens.\n  In the hands of the abortionist, the feet, the legs, the torso, the \narms right to the neck--in the hands of the abortionist--moving feet, \nmoving hands, beating heart--you can feel it. The abortionist takes a \npair of scissors, no anesthetic--takes a pair of scissors, inserts the \nscissors into the back of the skull, pulls the scissors apart, opens up \na hole in the back of the skull, inserts a catheter and sucks out the \nbrains of the child so that the skull compresses and then he removes \nthis dangling lifeless form from the womb. Think about it.\n  Yes, I have to stand here and defend this life, and I am proud to do \nit. I am proud to do it, because this child cannot do it. We can get \noff into the generic concept of abortion and talk about the \ngeneralities of abortion, a woman's right to choose and all that. That \nis not the issue here, folks. That is not the issue here. This is not \nthe way to do it--a lifeless form.\n  I had occasion, a couple of occasions, frankly--many of you have--to \ntake a pet that was old--it was very difficult. I had a dog one time, \nmost recently, that I had to do this to, named Muffin; 12 years old. \nYou know how close you get to pets. They are like--only they are not--\nchildren. But they are like children. I took that dog, who was so old \nthat she could not get around anymore, to the vet and I said, ``I have \nto do this. I don't know if I can handle it.''\n  He said, ``You know, you ought to come in and watch me do it rather \nthan leave her here, because you will feel better when you see it \nbecause it is peaceful. It is not painful. We give this dog a needle \nand she goes to sleep. No pain.''\n  So I did. I am glad I did, really, because I feel better about it.\n  Can you imagine--could you possibly imagine the pain of this child, \nwithout any anesthetic, having scissors put in the back of its neck and \nhaving its brains sucked out? Can you imagine \n\n[[Page S 16734]]\nthe pain? This is the United States of America. Why are we doing this \nto our children? Could somebody please tell me why we are doing this? \nWhy are we doing this? Give me a reason. I cannot wait until I hear the \nother side. For what? Why are we doing this?\n  At the beginning of this process we had an unborn child, an unborn \nchild safe in her mother's womb. And yes, it could be a her, I say to \nmy colleagues, pro-choice women of the Senate, it could be a her. We \ntend to use the word ``him'' but it could be her. We had an unborn \nchild safe in her mother's womb.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I just want to ask a \nparliamentary question.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am not going to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would inquire if the Senator is going to finish his \nstatement or answer in debate?\n  Mr. SMITH. I am not going to yield. I want to finish my remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If he will answer, could the Senator give me a sense of \nhow long that will be? I need to know so I can plan my response.\n  Mr. SMITH. I do not know. I honestly do not know.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could be an hour?\n  Mr. SMITH. I do not know.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator can expect me to take an equal time.\n  Mr. SMITH. We had an unborn child safe in the womb of her mother, in \nthat little protected area. A watery mass, if you will--safe. Safe.\n  You know, late-term babies have sleep cycles and wake cycles. They \nhear their parents. They hear their mother. You can feel them kick when \nthey are excited, when they are awake. Any expectant mother knows that. \nThey are moving. They are kicking. They are happy. They suck their \nthumb. Their little hearts are beating. Their little brains are \nworking. It is a living thing.\n  Many experts will testify that newborn babies hear their mother's \nvoice. Not only do they hear it, they recognize it. It soothes them. It \ncalms them down.\n  Suddenly, however, Madam President--suddenly the baby's safe, warm, \nwatery world is invaded by the forceps of an abortionist.\n  The journey from the womb through the birth canal to birth, the \nmiraculous journey, the so beautiful journey which so many of us have \nwitnessed--especially women who give birth to those children, and those \nof us husbands who have been lucky enough to witness it--this \nmiraculous journey that every one of us, every single one of us, we \nhave all taken this journey on our birthday.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Indiana, in the chair, took that journey. \nThe Senator from California took that journey. We all took that journey \ndown that birth canal. And in most cases we needed a little help, we \nneeded a little help.\n  But, when I look at that fourth picture--I am 54 years old. Maybe I \ndo not look it but I am. I have seen a lot of rough things. I served in \nthe Vietnam war. I have seen people die. I have seen people in agony, \nin near-death situations, with horrible diseases. I have seen quite a \nlot.\n  But I cannot imagine a country as great as this one is where a people \nwould sanction--I do not care what you call yourselves, pro-choice or \npro-life. I do not care. How could you sanction this? How could you \nsanction that? Did those of us who are veterans fight to defend that? I \ndid not.\n  Mr. President, if this baby, if the head of this little baby, comes \nthrough the uterus, the child would slide right out of the mother's \nbody and straight into the protection of law, just so easy--not so easy \nfor the woman. But that little child comes out and is born kicking, \nhands and fingers and feet moving--you can picture that little baby--\nstraight into the protection of law.\n  But, you know, that is a problem in this procedure for the \nabortionist. Do you know what they call it when the baby manages to \ncome out? The dreaded complication. That is what they call it. That is \nthe term that the abortionists use, the ``dreaded complication.'' That \nis a live birth, a live birth--the dreaded complication. That is the \nlast thing an abortionist wants. So what do they have to do? They stop \nthe child's head from coming through the birth canal. They have to. \nOtherwise it is a live birth and then they have a problem--the dreaded \ncomplication.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues that when this procedure is \ntaking place with the scissors and with the catheter, this child is \nalive. This is a child that moments before was happily kicking, moving \nits fingers and hands, listening to the sounds in the womb.\n  In the final illustration, Mr. President, the scissors are then \nremoved from the baby's head, and the abortionist inserts the suction \ncatheter, completing the partial-birth abortion procedure--sucks the \nchild's brains out, the skull compresses, collapses, and the baby's \nsmall lifeless body is then removed from the birth canal, and it is \nover. The work is done. Is it not interesting--the contrast? Is it not \ninteresting?\n  What could have been, but for somebody's decision? God knows it was \nnot the baby's decision. It could have been a beautiful birth. We could \nhave had nurses scrambling running to get the baby into the incubator, \ninto the preemie ward. No. That was not to be. What we have seen that \ncould have been a beautiful birth is now an unspeakable, brutal, ugly \ndeath, more brutal and more ugly than the way you would put any pet. \nEven livestock today that we eat are killed more humanely than that.\n  A doctor who took the Hippocratic oath to do no harm--to do no harm--\nhas done the worst possible harm to the most innocent and defenseless \nlittle person, little patient, that he could possibly have. Here in \nAmerica--700, 400, 500 times a year. Who knows? It happens.\n  Mr. President, we know all about the partial-birth abortion procedure \nin all of its sickening and grotesque detail because two doctors who \nhave performed it hundreds of times, Dr. Martin Haskell and Dr. James \nMcMahon, have spoken and written frankly about it in the past several \nmonths. But the most moving testimony of all comes from a registered \nnurse, a beautiful lady. Her name is Brenda Pratt Shafer. This is her \npicture. She is here today for this debate, and I had the privilege of \nmeeting her just an hour or so ago. She assisted Dr. Haskell in \nperforming a partial-birth abortion. She was a nurse, pro-choice, and \nassisted Haskell in performing a partial-birth abortion.\n  Brenda Shafer described what she saw in a letter to her Congressman, \nRepresentative Tony Hall, Democrat of Ohio. This is what she said. I \nhope the cameras can pick this up. Listen. These are not my words. \nThese are the words of a nurse who took basically the same pledge to \nsave lives as doctors to. But this is what she said:\n\n        The doctor kept the baby's head just inside the uterus. \n     The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors \n     through the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out \n     in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does when he \n     thinks that he might fall.\n\n  If you can think of your child in that situation.\n  That is what she described the procedure as. She further states that:\n\n       I am a registered nurse with 13 years of experience. But \n     one day in September 1993 my nursing agency assigned me to \n     work at a Dayton, Ohio, abortion clinic, and I had often \n     expressed strong pro-choice views to my two teenage \n     daughters. So I thought this assignment would be no problem \n     for me.\n       But I was wrong. I stood at a doctor's side as he performed \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure--and what I saw is \n     branded forever in my mind. The mother was 6 months pregnant. \n     The baby's heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound \n     screen. The doctor went in with the forceps and grabbed the \n     baby's legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then \n     he delivered the baby's body and the arms--everything but the \n     head. The doctor kept the baby's head just inside the uterus.\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping. And \n     his feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors \n     through the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out \n     in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does when he \n     thinks he might fall.\n       The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening and sucked the baby's brains \n     out. Now the baby was completely limp. I never went back to \n     that clinic. But I am still haunted by the face of that \n     little boy--it was the most perfect, angelic face I have ever \n     seen.\n\n  America, Mr. President, America this is happening in--6 month child.\n  God bless Brenda Pratt Shafer for having the courage to come forward \n\n[[Page S 16735]]\n  with her testimony and her story because, without people like her, we \nwould not know it happened.\n  I have been in the Congress for 11 years, Mr. President, and until \njust a few months ago--I must confess my ignorance--I did not know that \nthis procedure was performed in America.\n  A registered nurse, very moving testimony, self-described pro-choice, \nwho witnessed this procedure at the hands of Dr. Haskell. Thankfully, \nNurse Shafer did tell Congressman Hall what she saw.\n\n  I might just say to my colleagues, Nurse Shafer is here today. If you \nwould like to talk with her, she is off the floor. You can talk with \nher. I think my colleagues now may have some understanding as to why \nthe House voted to ban this barbaric, brutal, gruesome, inhumane \nprocedure.\n  By the 19th or 20th week of gestation, the point at which this \nunspeakably brutal method of abortion is used, the child is clearly \ncapable of feeling what is happening to her. This is a living human \nbeing, one who, as I said before, if it had been born alive, would be \ncalled a preemie. If you read the commentary from neurologists, they \nwould tell you that premature babies born at this stage of pregnancy \nactually may be more sensitive to pain stimulation than others.\n  Earlier this year, I attended a press conference at which a \nneurologist spoke to that effect. He later so testified before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee's hearings on this bill. He does surgery on \nbabies all the time, and he indicated there is really no doubt--no \ndoubt, he said--that the unborn child who is attacked and killed in the \npartial-birth procedure suffers not just pain but horrible, intense, \nexcruciating pain.\n  I would ask you, all of us, as human beings, a few seconds, a few \ninches, and you are a living being, human being protected not only from \npain but protected by the Constitution of the United States, and yet \nfor a few inches, a few moments, you are the victim of the abortionist \nprocedure, how could you not be appalled at this procedure? How could \nyou possibly justify this procedure?\n  As I said, I did not even know this took place 6 months ago, but I \nknow it now. And if it takes the last breath in my body, I am going to \nstop it. I am going to stop it.\n  Do you know why I am going to stop it, Mr. President? Because I \nbelieve in my heart that the American people will no longer tolerate \nthis. I believe in my heart that people of good faith who differ on \nthis issue, who listen to this debate, listen to this procedure, are \ngoing to make a decision. They are going to take the heat from the \nmilitant pro-choice people, and they are going to vote with us. We are \ngoing to stop this horrible procedure, as the House did. We are going \nto put it on the President's desk.\n  President Clinton, I hope that you will pick up that pen and put your \nsignature on that bill to stop it.\n  It is very interesting; President Clinton was at one time an unborn \nchild, like the rest of us, and his mother was in a very difficult \nsituation, and his mother chose life. It is very interesting.\n  I just say to my colleagues, this is the greatest country in the \nworld, founded with a Declaration of Independence that speaks of a God-\ngiven and ``unalienable'' right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. What happened to the right to life of this child? What \nhappened to it? Why cannot she be given the opportunity to enjoy the \nblessings of liberty? Why cannot she be given the chance to laugh, to \ncry, to get married, to have children, to go to college, to be in a \nhigh school play? Why? Why does she not have that right?\n  The tragedy of accidents in life are bad enough. You lose a child to \nan accident because of alcohol; some alcoholic runs over a child. Those \nkinds of things happen every day in America, and they are terrible. But \nthis is a deliberate act that stops this child from ever having the \nopportunity to do these things.\n  This is the land of the free and the home of the brave. If freedom \nhas come to this, if freedom has come to meaning the freedom of \nabortionists to execute children--because that is exactly what they are \ndoing. Let us call it exactly what it is. That is exactly what they are \ndoing in this case. They are executing little children just as they \nemerge in the birth canal, inches away from birth. If that is what \nfreedom means, then we ought to be brave enough to do what the House of \nRepresentatives did last Wednesday and pass this bill and stop this \nhorrible, horrible procedure.\n  Defenders of this partial-birth abortion, whom you will hear from \nshortly, have a big job to do. They really do. It is almost an \nimpossible job in trying to rationalize how you can be in favor of this \nprocess, because you will hear it all: We are getting in the way \nbetween a woman and a doctor. They will do everything they can to talk \nabout something else other than this. They are not going to talk about \nthis because they cannot talk about it. So they have to go use some \nother issue. They try to get you on to something else. As you listen to \nthe debate, they will be off on something else because they cannot be \non this.\n  One of the ways is to say partial-birth abortions are rare; they are \nobscure; they are almost never used. Well, Dr. Martin Haskell, the \nabortionist whose brutal handiwork Nurse Shafer witnessed, had claimed \npersonally that he did 700 of them as of 1993. So I do not know what \n``rare'' means--700 babies by one doctor.\n  As I look at that depiction of that little baby in the womb, hanging \nthere limp, you know what I say to myself? How many U.S. Senators are \nin that 700? How many doctors, lawyers, Nobel Peace Prize winners, \nteachers? How many? I do not know. We will never know. We will never \nknow. The first black President, is he or she in there? We will never \nknow. First Hispanic President? We will never know. First woman \nPresident? We will never know. Cure for cancer? It may be 1 of those \n700. We will never know. They will never have had a chance to be that \nlittle human being, to develop from that little human being to the \nultimate that they are allowed under the Constitution of the United \nStates. We will never know that that little life could have been a life \nlike this. We all grow up to be our own personal beings. We are all \ndifferent--a lot of life but very different little personalities. We \nwill never know. We will never know.\n  They are gone. Gone. Not by accident, not in an automobile accident, \nnot in war. No. Stabbed in the back of the neck with a pair of scissors \nwith their brains sucked out by a catheter.\n  There was another abortionist by the name of James McMahon who died a \nfew days ago. He made late-term abortions his specialty. He was \nprofiled in a 1990 article in the Los Angeles Times. In that article, \nMcMahon coldly claimed credit for having developed the partial-birth \nmethod, and this is very interesting. He did not call it partial-birth \nabortion. He called it ``intrauterine cranial decompression.'' In \nEnglish, that means crushing the skull while it is inside of the womb. \nThat is a nice clinical description, is it not? But you see, we have to \nuse terms like that because we cannot talk about this, because this is \nso obnoxious and so sickening and so disgusting and so outrageous that \nwe have to talk about something else. So we use terms like \n``intrauterine cranial decompression.'' I like plain English. Killing a \nchild in the womb that is 90 percent born, that is what it is.\n  Dr. McMahon continued, saying ``I want to deal with the head last \nbecause that's the biggest problem.''\n  That is what he said. Those are the feelings he had. When I read \nthat, I thought to myself, ``That little baby in the womb who happens \nto have Dr. McMahon, if it had been Dr. Frist or Dr. anybody else, they \nwould have been allowed to be born, they would have been allowed to \ngrow, to become a President, to become a lawyer, to become a father, a \nmother, but through no choice of their own, it was Dr. McMahon who was \nthere, not with gentle loving caring hands but with the hands of \ndestruction,'' this physician who took the Hippocratic oath to do no \nharm.\n  Sadly and perversely, he came to see it as his role as a doctor to \ndeal with the problem of the head of a little baby in the manner that I \ndescribed here today--a problem. According to the American Medical \nNews, Dr. McMahon performed abortions through all 40 weeks of \npregnancy. Think about that. It made no difference to him--8\\1/2\\ \n\n[[Page S 16736]]\nmonths, 9 months, a couple days overdue, call Dr. McMahon, he will take \ncare of it. He said he would only do elective abortions through the \nfirst 26 weeks. How thoughtful of him.\n  Mr. President, you see, when you hear this discussion, and my \ncolleagues, about how rare this is, it is not rare. It is not rare. It \nis rare if you want to compare it to the number of births in America. A \nfew hundred versus several million who are born in America. That I \nsuppose you could call rare, but it is not rare to the 700 or so babies \nwho have had that procedure, is it?\n  After last week's House vote, an article in the New York Times, \nrelying on data from the pro-choice National Abortion Federation, among \nothers, estimated that the partial-birth abortion procedure is \nperformed more than 400 times a year. In other words, on the average, \nmore than once a day, and that is a conservative number. Those are the \nones we know about. That is 400, more than 1 a day. I do not think that \nis rare. That is 400 babies. It is certainly not insignificant.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times ran another article that indicates that \nthe number of partial-birth abortions performed each year may, in fact, \nbe much higher. The New York Times quotes a physician who it identifies \nas a gynecologist at a New York teaching hospital who spoke on the \ncondition of anonymity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis article from the New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n       Wider Impact Is Foreseen for Bill To Ban Type of Abortion\n\n                            (By Tamar Lewin)\n\n       Public health officials and doctors who perform abortions \n     say the bill passed by the House of Representatives last week \n     that would ban a type of later-term abortion is so broadly \n     written and ill defined that it could affect many more \n     doctors than originally thought.\n       Indeed, they say, it could criminalize almost any doctor \n     who performs abortions in the second trimester, or after 12 \n     weeks of gestation, and might force doctors to turn to less-\n     safe methods to avoid the possibility of prosecution. Some \n     also say that it would shrink the pool of doctors who perform \n     second-trimester abortions.\n       The sponsors of the bill, and the anti-abortion groups they \n     worked with, said their goal was to ban what they call \n     ``partial-birth abortions,'' in which a fetus at 20 weeks of \n     gestation or more is partly delivered, feet first, and then \n     to make it easier for the fetus to pass through the birth \n     canal, the skull is collapsed.\n       But the House bill approved on Wednesday, the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act, provides a far looser definition, with no \n     reference to fetal age or to the specifics of inserting \n     scissors into the neck to create a hole through which the \n     brains can be suctioned out to collapse the skull.\n       The legislation, which will be considered in the Senate \n     this week, says only that ``the term `partial-birth abortion' \n     means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \n     partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing \n     the fetus and completing the delivery.''\n       That language is so broad--and the term ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' so unfamiliar in the medical community--that many \n     doctors who perform only earlier abortions, by the most \n     common methods, say they have done procedures that would \n     probably be prosecutable under the law.\n       ``I'm sure I've had a situation, with a 14- or 16-week \n     pregnancy, when the fetus presented feet first, where I did \n     something that a Federal prosecutor might take to court under \n     this language,'' said Dr. Lewis Koplik, who performs \n     abortions up to 20 weeks in Albuquerque, N.M., and El Paso. \n     ``The decision about what method to use is made in an \n     individual setting based on an individual woman's situation. \n     It's not one-size-fits-all, and it shouldn't be. I don't want \n     to make medical decisions based on Congressional language. I \n     don't want to be that vulnerable. And it's not what I want \n     for my patients.''\n       Those who drafted the legislation said they did not believe \n     it would interfere with second-trimester abortions performed \n     by the standard method of dilation and evacuation, or D\n       ``An element of the crime is that the prosecution has to \n     prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the baby was living,'' \n     said an assistant counsel to the Constitution subcommittee of \n     the House Judiciary Committee, Keri Harrison, who helped \n     draft the bill. ``In a D, there's not a living fetus being \n     delivered. They're in there suctioning and cutting, and what \n     they deliver is body parts. This would not cover that.''\n       Ms. Harrison said that in drafting the legislation, she and \n     others had rejected specifying the gestational age or \n     abortion technique it would cover. ``This isn't about a \n     viable baby or a nonviable one,'' she said. ``And we did not \n     want anything about inserting scissors into the base of the \n     skull, because we didn't want them to come up with a slightly \n     different technique and avoid the statute. What we want to \n     make a crime is the abortionist starting to deliver a baby \n     and then killing it.''\n       About 13,000 of the nation's 1.5 million abortions a year \n     are performed after 20 weeks' gestation. And only two \n     doctors, who perform a total of about 450 of these abortions \n     a year, have said publicly that this method is the safest and \n     best. So most discussion of the proposed ban has been based \n     on the assumption that the method is rarely used, and only by \n     a small number of doctors.\n       But the National Abortion Federation, which represents \n     several hundred abortion providers, says that more doctors \n     have recently reported that they sometimes use the method, \n     which they call ``intact D'' And since the House vote, \n     some gynecologists at prominent hospitals have acknowledged \n     that they often use the method in late-term abortions.\n       ``Of course I use it, and I've taught it for the last 10 \n     years,'' said a gynecologist at a New York teaching hospital, \n     who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``So do doctors in \n     other cities. At around 20 weeks, the fetus is usually in a \n     breech position. If you don't have to insert sharp \n     instruments blindly into the uterus, that's better and safer.\n       ``Even in earlier abortions,'' the doctor continued, ``it \n     can happen that after you prepare the patient by dilating the \n     cervix, the feet move down, and the procedure might be \n     covered by this law.''\n       ``This legislation would be a disaster for women's \n     health,'' the doctor said.\n       Most of the doctors interviewed said they saw no moral \n     difference between dismembering the fetus within the uterus \n     or partially delivering it, intact, before killing it.\n       Several said they saw the bill as an opening wedge to \n     outlawing all second-trimester abortions--and conceded that \n     anti-abortion groups had won an important public-relations \n     victory by focusing so much attention on late-term abortions, \n     which are the least common but most emotionally fraught \n     procedures.\n       According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private group \n     that studies reproductive health issues, almost nine out of \n     10 abortions are performed in the first trimester, when the \n     procedure is relatively simple. About 164,000 abortions a \n     year are performed during the second trimester, that is, at \n     13 to 26 weeks of gestation, but more than 9 out of 10 of \n     these are before the 20th week.\n       Although second-trimester abortions are legal throughout \n     the nation for any reason, few doctors perform abortions \n     after 20 weeks, and while third-trimester abortions are legal \n     in some states only a few hundred take place each year. \n     Third-trimester abortions are performed almost exclusively by \n     a handful of doctors who get referrals from obstetricians \n     whose patients have serious health problems or are carrying \n     fetuses with profound abnormalities.\n       Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Columbia University \n     School of Public Health and a professor of obstetrics, said \n     that he and a group of other doctors discussing the \n     legislation had been unable to agree on what the law would \n     cover--but did agree that it posed a threat to anyone who did \n     second-trimester abortions.\n       ``In a standard D, the fetus generally doesn't come out \n     intact,'' Dr. Rosenfield said. ``But you might very well \n     bring down a leg at the start of the procedure, and if the \n     definition is a beating heart, potentially any second-\n     trimester abortion could fit this bill. My big worry is that \n     if this becomes law, doctors will feel they have to go back \n     to the less-safe second-trimester abortion methods we did \n     until the 1980's, the installation procedures, in which the \n     uterus is flooded with saline or urea.''\n       Many of the doctors interviewed expressed concern that the \n     legislation would shrink the pool of doctors willing to \n     perform late-term abortions, especially since many of these \n     doctors already face demonstrations and threats, and may not \n     be willing to take on an additional worry about criminal \n     prosecution.\n       ``It really is such nonspecific and bizarre legislation \n     that it's hard to tell what exactly they're trying to ban,'' \n     and Dr. Mary Campbell, medical director of Planned Parenthood \n     of Metro Washington. ``Clearly they're anxious to prosecute \n     anybody who's doing second- or third-trimester abortions. I \n     know people who have said that this would be the end of their \n     third-trimester practice, and probably their second.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, here is what this doctor said on the \ncondition of anonymity: ``Of course I use it''--partial-birth abortion \nprocedure--``and I've taught it for the last 10 years.''\n\n       ``I've taught it,'' said a gynecologist at a New York \n     teaching hospital who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n       ``So do doctors in other cities. At around 20 weeks, the \n     fetus is usually in a breech position. If you don't have to \n     insert sharp instruments blindly into the uterus, that's \n     better and safer.\n       ``Even in earlier abortions,'' the doctor continued, ``it \n     can happen that after you prepare the patient by dilating the \n     cervix, the feet move down, and the procedure might be \n     covered by this law. This legislation would be a disaster for \n     women's health. . . .''\n\n[[Page S 16737]]\n\n  Not a word about the baby. And by the way, we cannot find much \nevidence of any concern at all about women's health in this particular \nissue.\n  It is clear that the doctors that we referred to, McMahon and \nHaskell, respectively, are not the only abortionists who employ the \npartial-birth abortion procedure. You see, we do not know. People are \nnot going to come out and admit this. So we do not know how prevalent \nit really is. In fact, given that Times story yesterday, we may be \nsitting on the tip of an iceberg we do not even know about.\n  Besides trying to rationalize the opposition to this bill by claiming \nthat partial-birth abortions are rare and insignificant, although I \nfind it difficult to understand how insignificant that would be for the \nchild, you are also going to hear on the floor of this Senate opponents \nthat are going to try to rationalize their position by saying that the \nbill interferes with the doctor's professional discretion and invades \nthe doctor-patient relationship. You are going to hear that because, \nagain, we have to talk about things like that because we cannot talk \nabout this. That is why I am talking about it.\n  Mr. President, the American Medical Association's council on \nlegislation did not see it that way. They voted not once but twice to \nendorse this bill, to stop this practice. Twelve doctors on that board, \npracticing physicians, AMA members all, leaders of their profession \nvoted unanimously to endorse H.R. 1833--unanimously.\n  A member of the AMA council later publicly commented that the \npartial-birth abortion procedure used by Drs. Haskell and McMahon is \nsimply not even recognized as a medical procedure. Think about that, it \nis not recognized as a medical procedure. They got it right. You know \nwhy? Do you know why it is right? Because medicine is supposed to heal \npeople, that is why they got it right. Thank God they had the courage \nto vote the way they did. Even though they could not get the rest of \nthe AMA to do it, the council did. They got it right. A doctor is \nsupposed to heal. A doctor who does a partial-birth abortion is not \npracticing medicine. Can any reasonable person take the floor of the \nSenate and tell me this doctor who does this is practicing medicine, \nhealing? He is playing executioner, that is what he is doing.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the AMA legislative council's action in \nmind as the opponents of this bill try to argue, and they will, that \nthis bill interferes with the practice of medicine. You are going to \nhear it. The American Medical Association council on legislation \ncarefully and thoughtfully considered it and they said it does not. \nThey endorse this bill, because they recognize that partial-birth \nabortions simply do not constitute the practice of medicine. It is not \na medical procedure that they do not agree with, they do not even think \nit is medicine at all. And yet you are going to hear all about it, how \nthis interferes with the doctor and his patient and this is a medical \nprocess. They will tell you it is not even necessary.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation try to rationalize \ntheir opposition by claiming that the grotesque and inhumane partial-\nbirth abortion procedure is only used in the most extreme \ncircumstances. This is where we get right down to the nitty-gritty and \nhear a lot about this, such as when the mother's life is in danger or \nher health is at serious risk or when the unborn child has what they \ncall ``severe congenital abnormalities incompatible with life.'' I do \nnot know what that means. We will talk about that in a few minutes.\n  Once again, the facts belie their claims. McMahon and Haskell, \ndoctors--I hesitate to use that term--are the only two abortionists \nwith the brazen temerity to go public. They went public because they \nwere proud of it. That is why they went public. They had no problem \nwith it. They were not trying to hide it. They went public about their \nuse of this procedure and to identify themselves personally with it. \nThey advocate this partial-birth abortion method as the ``preferred \nmethod for elected late-term abortions.''\n  Haskell advocates the partial-birth abortion method for 20 to 26 \nweeks of pregnancy and Haskell told the American Medical News that most \nof the partial-birth abortions he performs are, in fact, elective. \nSpeaking with what I would call chilling candor, Haskell told the AMA \nNews, ``I'll be quite frank, most of my abortions are elective in that \n20- to 24-week range and probably 20 percent are for genetic reasons \nand the other 80 percent are purely elective.''\n  For genetic, 20 percent and the other 80 percent are purely elective.\n  So there you have it, I say to my colleagues. You will hear it all. \nYou will hear some of our colleagues claim this hideous and cruel \nprocedure is only reserved for the hard cases, the tough cases.\n  Now we know the truth. Now we know that is not true. So when you hear \nit, I just gave you the facts. You have it straight from the horses \nmouth, from the people who do it. We heard from Martin Haskell--the \nproud practitioner of partial-birth abortions, the one Nurse Shafer \nwitnessed in his grisly work--who told the American Medical \nAssociation's own newspaper that 80 percent of the partial-birth \nabortions that he performs are ``purely elective.'' He does them. It \nwould be interesting to see where the other facts come from when we \nhear the other side of the argument.\n  The National Abortion Federation--the official national organization \nof the Nation's abortion industry--has publicly acknowledged that \npartial-birth abortions are routinely done for purely elective reasons. \nHere is what they say. They told their members this in this memorandum. \nIn anticipation of this debate, this was sent out to their members:\n\n       Don't apologize. There are many reasons why women have late \n     abortions . . . lack of money or health insurance, social \n     [or] psychological crisis, lack of knowledge of human \n     reproduction . . .''\n\n  That does not sound like dire emergency to me, Mr. President. Maybe I \nam missing something. What is the emergency about that? I told you what \na partial-birth abortion is. I have read you Nurse Shafer's haunting \neyewitness account. I have told you what the abortionists who have done \npartial-birth abortions have said about them. I have given you all \nthat.\n  Let me tell you what H.R. 1833--the bill in question--actually does \nbecause you are going to hear that distorted, too. They are going to \nhave all kinds of lines on what this bill does and does not do. What it \ndoes do: The barbaric and brutal partial-birth abortion procedure that \nI have described and illustrated on the floor of the Senate today can, \nshould, must and will be outlawed. It will be because I am not going to \nleave this Senate until it is outlawed. If we lose the vote today, it \nis going to come back. I am going to bring it back until we win it.\n  Simply stated, H.R. 1833 does that. It outlaws that procedure. If you \ndid not like what you saw on those charts, that is your vote. There is \nnothing else. Do not be swayed by the other arguments because they are \nnot relevant. If you think what we saw in the charts is appropriate, \nthen you should vote against me and this bill. If you think that \nprocess is OK, vote against me. I would not want you to vote otherwise. \nIf you agree with me that this is wrong, then vote with me for H.R. \n1833.\n  It amends title VIII of the United States Code and provides that \n``whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly \nperforms a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall \nbe fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or \nboth.'' The abortionist, not the woman. The abortionist is fined. That \nis the punishment for killing the child in this manner.\n  You will probably hear that the woman is going to be punished. Not \ntrue. Read the law.\n  H.R. 1833 defines a ``partial-birth abortion'' as ``an abortion in \nwhich the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a \nliving fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''\n  That is what they do. Can anybody who sat here and listened to this \ndebate honestly tell me that inserting scissors in the back of the head \nand sucking the brains out of a living, breathing child is not killing \nit? Beats me. But you will probably hear that it is not.\n  H.R. 1833 would ban not only the brain suction, partial-birth \nabortion that I have described, but any other abortion that involves \nthe partial delivery of the child into the birth canal \n\n[[Page S 16738]]\nbefore he or she is killed. So the abortionist who commits this \nhorrible act will not be able to escape culpability under the law by \npulling the baby into the birth canal and stabbing her through the \nheart rather than sucking her brains out through a hole. There are any \nnumber of ways. Would that be any more barbaric? They could have \nstabbed her in the heart with the scissors.\n  Let me say it again. H.R. 1833 authorizes the prosecution only of the \nabortionist. When you hear otherwise, not true. Not the mother of the \nchild upon whom the partial-birth abortion is performed. That woman is \nthe innocent victim because she was advised to do something that was \nbarbaric or to agree to do something that was barbaric. This bill is \naimed at the abortionists; it is aimed at the brutality of this act; it \nis aimed at the gross violation of just basic human rights that are \nprotected under the Constitution of the United States of America, for \neverybody, including a baby who comes out of that birth canal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, even though you are going to hear otherwise, \nH.R. 1833 provides a life of the mother exception. Absolutely, it \nprovides a life of the mother exception.\n  Frankly, my jaw has dropped every time I heard one of the opponents \nof this bill try to say with a straight face that there is no life of \nthe mother exception in this bill. They are going to say there is no \nlife of the mother exception, and they will say it with a straight \nface, and they will give you all kinds of documentary evidence. There \nhas always been such an exception since the day the bill was first \nintroduced. I introduced it on this side. I know what it says, and it \nis in there.\n  The life of the mother exception is in the form of what we would call \nan ``affirmative defense.'' You will find it in section ``e'' of H.R. \n1833. Look at it. You will see it. So when you are told it is not in \nthere, read it, and it is there. Look it up. The next time somebody \nsays it is not there, read it. It is right there.\n  That is the way this situation is dealt with in the United States \nCode. There are 31 affirmative defenses in the United States Code. \nUnder H.R. 1833, if a doctor reasonably believes a mother's life is in \ndanger and that a partial-birth abortion is the only procedure he can \nemploy to save her life, he has an affirmative defense--written right \ninto the statute. In other words, if what the doctor faced truly was a \nlife-of-the-mother circumstance, he cannot be convicted of violating \nthe law.\n  I might also say there are very few, if any, opportunities where the \nlife of the mother would be threatened here. Let me say it again. No \ndoctor who reasonably believes that a mother's life is in danger and a \npartial-birth procedure is the only way to save it can be convicted of \na crime, period.\n  The key word in subsection ``e,'' Mr. President, is ``reasonably.'' \nNo doctor who reasonably believes that the mother's life is in danger \nand that no other procedure could have saved her life can be \nsuccessfully prosecuted under this bill. The word ``reasonably'' \nprovides protection against an abortionists like Dr. Haskell or Dr. \nMcMahon, who may otherwise try to abuse the life of the mother \nexception by claiming that every partial-birth abortion they do \ninvolves a threat to the life of the mother. We are not going to let \nthem get away with that.\n  Doctors have a way of projecting themselves as absolute. The doctor \nsays it, so it must be true. The doctor says you have to have an \nabortion this way; it must be true. No. Doctors are human like \neverybody else. They are not God, and they are wrong sometimes. They \nare wrong when they say this is necessary procedure to save the life of \nthe mother in all cases. A doctor against whom charges were brought \nunder the new law would be required to demonstrate that his judgments \nwere ``reasonable.'' He can have other medical doctors who are in the \narea, who are there, who can testify to that effect, that it was an \nemergency that had to be done.\n  A doctor who abused the life of the mother exception in this bill \nobviously could not meet that burden. By the same token, a doctor \nacting in good faith to save the life of the mother obviously could and \nwould meet that burden.\n  To those who try to argue that this specific, carefully drafted life \nof the mother exception--in the form of an affirmative defense--somehow \ndoes not adequately protect doctors who act to save the life of the \nmother, I say that the American Medical Association's Council on \nLegislation formally voted on whether to endorse this bill twice. They \nendorsed it, flat out, with the affirmative defense as it is written in \nthe bill before us, H.R. 1833. They did not qualify their endorsement \nby saying that the life of the mother provision should be changed or \nmodified. They endorsed it. The life of the mother affirmative defense \nwas fine with them.\n  Again, all 12 doctors, the AMA legislative panel, voted unanimously, \nvoted twice to endorse H.R. 1833--every last word. Every last \nprovision. No exceptions.\n  Why would they endorse the bill if they thought the life of the \nmother--affirmative defense does not adequately protect doctors who try \nto save the life of the mother? Why would they do it? They are in the \nbusiness of protecting doctors. They did not do it. They said the bill \nwas OK.\n  This is a historic piece of legislation Mr. President, that \noriginated, was voted on in the people's House, from Representative \nCanady. It is the most representative body of our Nation's democracy, \nand as the House considered this bill as I indicated in my earlier \nremarks, a magnificent majority, a supermajority, a two-thirds \nsupermajority came together--liberals, conservatives, Democrats, \nRepublicans, pro-choice, pro-life--many voted for this bill. Susan \nMolinari to Patrick Kennedy to Dick Armey and Newt Gingrich.\n  We can do the same here in the Senate, Mr. President. We can look at \nthis for the brutal act that it is and end it--never mind getting off \ninto the generic discussion of abortion.\n  Look at the facts--a baby about to enter from the birth canal into \nthe world, denied that opportunity. Put aside the other differences; \nput aside where a life begins. I happen to believe it begins at \nconception. Others of my colleagues do not agree with me. That is not \nthe issue today. Or whether there are fetal brain waves at such-and-\nsuch a month. That is not the issue today.\n  Some say abortion should be legal for sex selection. That is not the \nissue today. They may think a couple who have a girl unborn child and \nprefer a boy can go ahead and abort the girl. That is not the issue \ntoday.\n  The partial birth ban will protect girl and boy babies alike. That is \nthe issue today. We can all agree that a 19- or 20-week fetus in \ngestation at the onset of viability outside the womb is a human being. \nI would be interested to hear why it is not. I would like to know what \nit is if it is not a human being.\n  We should put aside the other differences. I had debates here with \nthe Senator from California and others on the abortion issue. That is \nnot the issue here today. The issue is this process. The bill is about \nabortion in the late second and into the third trimester of pregnancy--\na brutal, horrible way.\n  Poll after poll consistently shows that the divisions among Americans \nover a abortion narrow and narrow as the pregnancy progresses into the \nsecond and third trimester. Even the most pro-choice Americans become \npro-life at some point in the process. That is not the issue today.\n  This bill is about basic human rights, fundamental human rights, Mr. \nPresident. The right of a little baby to be born, grow up, to have a \nlife. They do not depend on the polls. Do we really have to take a poll \nto find out whether a little baby should have the right to proceed and \ndevelop his little personality? They do not depend on politics. What do \nthey know about politics? What do they know about polls?\n  Do you know what they know? They know that they hear sounds outside \ntheir mother's womb and they have sensed that protection. They are in \nthat little fluid sac where they have protection, but they invade that. \nThe abortionist invades that--pulls them feet first to their death.\n  Even the Supreme Court in the Roe versus Wade decision recognized \nthat a born child--a born child--is a person entitled to the equal \nprotection of the laws under our Constitution.\n  Now we are starting to talk a little bit differently. Now we have a \nproblem \n\n[[Page S 16739]]\nwith the semantics. What is a partially-born child? Feet out? Nothing \nelse? Feet-knees? Feet-knees-behind? Torso? All the way to the neck? \nWhat is a partially born child? What is it?\n  What makes it a nonchild while it is inside, while its inside is \ninside the womb or its shoulders or its torso? A few inches? A few \nmoments. Does that make it something else?\n  Is not a partially born child one whose entire body, except for her \nlittle head, is already in the birth canal, just as much a human being? \nIs she no less a human being? Is the line of a baby a nonentity who can \nbe brutally slaughtered really just a matter of a few inches? A few \nmoments?\n  This is the world's greatest deliberative body, Mr. President. I am \nproud to be a Member. I hope and I believe that because we are the \nworld's greatest deliberative body that we will rise to the challenge \nthat the House has given us.\n  That is the reason why I did not touch that bill. I did not use my \nown. I wanted that bill to come right over here and bring it right up \nwithout amendment. I want to pass it today if I can, tomorrow if \nnecessary, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, I want to pass it \nand I want to put it on the President's desk.\n  Once it gets there, I hope that President Clinton will sign it into \nlaw. I hope that he will look at this brutal act and put an end to it \nbecause after all, his pen, William Jefferson Clinton--will stop the \nprocess. One signature, done. No more partial-birth abortions. Hundreds \nof innocent children saved.\n  President Clinton, you were an unborn child once. The President's \nfather died, you know, while his mother was pregnant. Is that not \ninteresting? She faced a very tough decision. Do I raise a child alone \nwithout a father? Bill Clinton's mother chose life.\n  Regardless of party, regardless of ideology, I think we could say we \nare thankful. He became a President of the United States. He could have \nbeen a victim. Bill Clinton could have been a partial-birth abortion. \nWe never would have known. We never would have known.\n  Think about it, my colleagues, because this is a very personal \nmatter. Each and every one of us--each and every one of us--started out \nin life as an unborn child. Just like the one depicted in the first \nillustration that I showed earlier today.\n  When you were born as you came through that birth canal your little \nfingers moved, your little feet moved, you kicked your legs, you moved \nyour arms, and when you finally came into the world with a little slap \non the behind, you started to cry.\n  Every one of us came down that birth canal the same way--little bit \ndifferently sometimes but we came down the birth canal. We slept, we \nwoke, we felt pain, we were happy, we were sad, our quarters were \nclose, but we always heard our mother's voice. Our mother's voice was \nalways there to soothe us.\n  As I close, I am reminded of a great maxim. Do unto others as you \nwould have them do unto you. Do unto others as you would have them do \nunto you.\n  You and I deserved to be protected by law from a partial-birth \nabortion when you and I lived in our mother's womb.\n  There are two reasons why we are here today. Either/or: one, because \nour mothers chose life and had no concern about aborting us; second, \nbecause there was no abortionist there to end our lives. We had value. \nWe had worth. We had rights. We became U.S. Senators. And those little \nbabies have the same rights that we have under the Constitution.\n\n  As the Old Testament tells us, Almighty God knew us even then, and He \nloved us. Our fellow human beings, these youngest of Americans, deserve \nno less.\n  My colleagues, I implore you for the sake of God, for the sake of \nlife, for the sake of innocent children, pass this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for agreeing to begin this debate at a little later hour than \noriginally scheduled. Many of us, who are on both sides of this debate, \nwent to the Middle East with the President and a bipartisan delegation, \nand we literally have not had any rest for many hours. So, it really \ngave us a chance this morning to get that first bit of rest. This is a \ndifficult debate and I think we all needed to have that rest. I thank \nmy colleague from New Hampshire and I thank the majority leader and \nminority leader for agreeing to bring this up at 2 o'clock rather than \n11 a.m.\n  I stand here in favor of committing H.R. 1833 to the Judiciary \nCommittee for at least one hearing on this bill, and to report back \nwith any amendments, if they so deem, within a 45-day period.\n  There are many reasons that I believe are quite rational for doing \nthis, which I will get into in the course of the debate. But I want to \nsay the motion that will be made to send this bill to committee will be \na Republican motion offered by Senator Specter and supported by six \nother Republicans.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. This is the first time, in my knowledge, \nthat a particular procedure has been criminalized. And I agree with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire when he says--and he has said it many \ntimes--the Senate is the greatest deliberative body. Therefore, let us \nmake sure before we do this for the first time in history that we have \nheld a hearing that brings all sides to the table where there can be a \ndiscussion with medical experts.\n  We have one physician in the U.S. Senate. He was never an OB/GYN. We \ndo not have anyone in the U.S. Senate who truly can understand the \nramifications of criminalizing what has been a life-saving procedure. \nSo I think the course of sending this bill to Judiciary is the proper \ncourse.\n  I will cover a lot of ground. My colleague took almost a couple of \nhours. I do not think I will take as much time, but my presentations \nare usually quite brief. This will not be as brief because I think we \nhave heard my colleague without possibility to, if you will, correct \nthe Record or insert differing opinions. We have not had that chance. I \nwould like to take this time to cover a good deal of ground.\n  I think it is important to debate this bill, every word of this bill, \nthe ramifications of this bill, the justifications for this bill and \nthe tragedy that is addressed by this bill. But the one thing I hope I \ndo not have to be lectured about is the joys of childbirth. Unlike my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, I have had it. I have had it. I have had \nthe joy of childbirth. I have had the joy of bringing two of the most \nwonderful people into this world, and now I have the joy of \ngrandparenting. So I really do not need to be lectured about the joys \nof the travel down the birth canal because I have experienced it in my \nown body.\n  I had two premature babies who were not safe in my womb. They were \nnot safe in my womb toward the end of the pregnancy, and they had to \nstruggle for their lives, and we won that struggle. They were difficult \nbirths, and very unpredictable as to what would happen.\n  Now I am a grandmother, and we had complications in that one. This \nbaby is our joy--my joy, his other grandmother's joy, his grandpa's \njoy, his uncle's and aunt's. So I know about the joy of children very \npersonally, the joy of grandparenting.\n  But do talk to me about the bill. Do talk to me about, for the first \ntime that we can find in history, why we at the national level should \noutlaw a particular procedure that is sometimes the only way to save a \nwoman's life or to avoid the most serious, long-lasting consequences to \nher health. Talk to me about that. Talk to me about that.\n  Do not tell me that you speak for all the little children who cannot \nspeak for themselves when you talk about this bill, because I want to \ntalk to you about little children. Let us take a little child that is \nhappy and alive, living in a wonderful family environment, and his mom \ngets pregnant and everything is wonderful and everything is joyful and \nthey have a name picked out for the baby--if it a girl or a boy--and \nthey think everything is right, and suddenly they learn that it is not \nright. I would tell you if that little child could talk--let us say he \nis just 2 or 3--he would say, ``Don't let my mommy die.'' So don't tell \nme you are talking for all children. We cannot speak for all children.\n  I am going to give you a few cases. Viki Wilson, a registered nurse, \na practicing Catholic, and her husband Bill, a \n\n[[Page S 16740]]\nphysician, they were the parents of two children and planning for a \nthird. In the 8th month of pregnancy, an ultrasound showed the baby's \nbrain was growing outside of the baby's skull. The brain was twice the \nsize of her actual head and lodged in Viki's pelvis, causing pressure \non what little brain the baby had.\n  This was a wanted baby. They picked out a name for the baby. If Viki \nhad carried the baby to term, Viki's cervix could not have expelled the \nbaby. Viki's cervix would likely have torn or ruptured, causing massive \nhemorrhage and infection.\n  I do not have a chart that shows what it looks like when there is a \nmassive hemorrhage. I do not have a chart to show you what it looks \nlike when the cervix is torn and ruptured. I do not have a chart that \nshows you what your wife would look like if she had to go through this \ncircumstance, or your daughter. I do not have a chart that shows what \nthe baby's skull would have looked like as it was crushed by passage \nthrough the birth canal. I do not have a chart that shows that. But we \ndo know this. If the baby had survived somehow, at most she would have \nlived a few short agonizing moments gasping for air. Most likely she \nwould have suffocated the moment the umbilical cord was cut, unable to \nbreathe through her mouth.\n\n  I do not have a chart. Viki Wilson is a practicing Catholic. If you \nwant to meet her, you can meet her. If you want to talk to her, you can \ntalk to her. She came forward in her grief because she could not stand \nto see what was happening here. She said, ``My daughter's death was \nwith dignity instead of subjecting her to a process that would have \ntaken away all her dignity.''\n  I have other stories. I am going to share them with my colleagues. \nBut let me tell you of a little child who thought his mother was going \nthrough that. He would say, ``Save my mother and do not allow my sister \nto go through this agonizing procedure.''\n  The Senator from New Hampshire said, ``Do not listen to what \nopponents say. They will distort this bill.''\n  I have a copy of the bill. I have read this bill over and over again. \nIn every case when we have voted to restrict a woman's right to choose, \nthere have been exceptions in the bill for the life of the mother, at \nleast in every single case. Not here, not here. Oh, yes. When the \ndoctor is thrown in jail, he can say in his defense, ``I had to do \nit.'' That is not the same as making exceptions to the life and the \nhealth of the mother.\n  My colleague said, Look at the numbers of votes in the House. Well, \nthe far-right forces in the House will not allow a vote on a moderating \namendment for the life of the mother, for the health of the mother. \nThey will not allow a vote on any of this. So there was no choice for \npeople.\n  I am so pleased that in the Senate we have the ability to get a vote, \nto stop the extremism, to stop the danger. We have a chance to do that. \nNo. The House did not allow an amendment. That is why you had the vote \nthat you had. I know because I did speak to some of the people over \nthere. They said, ``Barbara, we did not have a chance to vote on any \nmoderating language we wanted so desperately. We tried to, and the \nRules Committee shut us down.''\n  So we know what this is about. It is about politics. It is about \npolitics because if it was about substance they would have allowed a \nvote.\n  I have to say that I am not a doctor--and I am not God--and there are \nnone in the Senate, except for one doctor who is not an OB-GYN, nor is \nanyone else. And no one is God.\n  And people invoke the name of God. And I am glad that they do that \nbecause they feel it deeply, and I feel it deeply. And if one believes \nin God, one believes that God has made sure that there are medical \nprocedures in place to help save lives.\n  There were so many misstatements made on this Senate floor regarding \nthis issue, and I am not going to take them on here because I am not a \ndoctor. But I know about giving birth, and when babies are born, except \nin rare cases, the head comes first. The way this is described is it is \ndescribed as if the woman is having a baby, and suddenly people say, \n``We do not want this baby.'' The mother is given anesthetic, large \ndoses of it--this is a serious, complicated situation--large doses that \ngo right to the fetus.\n  That is just one example of the misstatement here. That is why we \nneed hearings on this--to find out the facts.\n  Even the name of this, ``partial-birth abortion''--there is no such \nterminology. That is not a medical term. And, yet, it is outlawing \n``partial-birth abortion'' when there is no such medical term. It is a \nterm being used for political reasons, in my view. There is not a birth \nhere. This is a late-term abortion, and it is tragic. It is tragic. And \nthat is what we are talking about.\n  There is talk here on the floor by men who never had the experience \nabout what it is like for the baby to flow in the water, as it was \nsaid. That is the ambiotic fluid. Sometimes something happens in a \nwoman, and the baby is not safe in the womb. And the ambiotic fluid is \nnot there. We hope everything goes just right. We want everything to be \njust right. When we get to that stage of our pregnancy--I never got to \nthose stages; I had two preemie babies. By then we were so excited \nabout this event.\n  And to make it sound like women are brutal, that doctors who take a \nHippocratic oath are brutal, and that is their goal in life--is to be \nbrutal. And they wake up every day saying, ``I am going to wait until \nthe end of my pregnancy, and I am not going to have it, and I am going \nto be brutal.'' If you listen to this, calling doctors abortionists--\nabortion is a legal procedure in this country. They are not without \nlaws. They try to change it on the floor of the Senate all the time. \nThey do not have the votes to do that. Do not call a doctor an \nabortionist. And do not try to be a doctor. You cannot be a doctor. You \nare not a doctor. You do not know the truth.\n  We need a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. We have people on both \nsides of this issue on the Judiciary Committee. And, therefore, it will \nhave a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and both sides will be \nbrought out. And they will have panels on one side and another.\n  And when the word ``elective'' is used, let us straighten that out \nright here and now. Elective means anything but for the life. It can be \nthe health. It can be the most severe health consequence which is given \nthe term ``elective.''\n  Let me talk about the organizations that are cited. The AMA my \ncolleague from New Hampshire cited. The council he talked about--12 or \n13 people are on the council--voted to endorse the bill. There was not \none OB-GYN on the council. The only testimony heard in the AMA was of \nthe staff of the person who wrote the bill, and the AMA Board of \nTrustees unanimously rejected the recommendation of the committee. And \nthey did not take it. So let us get that straight.\n\n  The AMA does not support this bill. There are some organizations that \noppose it--that oppose it: the American Medical Women's Association, \nthe California Medical Association, which is the largest State \norganization in the country, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists. They oppose this legislation.\n  Now, we believe, those of us who believe we should commit this to the \nJudiciary Committee for a report back in 45 days on the bill, that \nbefore Senators are asked to cast a vote on a measure that would \ncriminalize a legal medical procedure, which is used under rare and \ntragic circumstances, the Judiciary Committee should have an \nopportunity to review it.\n  I have raised some of the questions here today, and I am going to \nraise them again. This is what I think the committee ought to look at, \nwhatever your view on this issue. They ought to look at the fact that \nthere is no such term as partial-birth abortion, in any medical text, \nand that it was invented by the authors. And let us get down to what we \nare talking about here. They should also look at the fact that a doctor \nis threatened with criminal prosecution for trying to save a woman's \nlife. They should look at that.\n  What kind of chilling effect would it have on a physician? Oh, sure, \nthere is an affirmative defense. That is like saying, ``I will arrest \nyou if you disagree with me, but once you are in court you can have \nyour chance to explain why you disagree with me.'' It is an affirmative \ndefense. You put it in \n\n[[Page S 16741]]\nthe bill. You have a right to go to court and affirmatively say, ``Save \nthe life of a mother.'' Let us look at what that means: Doctors \nthreatened with criminal prosecution for trying to save the life of a \nwoman. Let us look at that.\n  Let us look at the fact that there are medical problems that compel \nwomen to seek late-term abortions that range from the extremely serious \nto the potentially fatal, including severe heart disease, kidney \nfailure, and cancer in need of immediate treatment. Let us have those \nwomen who have had this tragedy befall them and their husbands and \ntheir families and their children, who some here said they speak for, \ncome forward and say how they felt when they heard unless their mother \ncould go through an emergency medical procedure, they would lose that \nmother forever. Let us hear from those people. The greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, my colleague from New Hampshire says--\nand I agree--let us deliberate.\n  The procedure that this bill would outlaw is often considered \nconsiderably safer than other alternatives. Let us look at that from a \ndoctor's perspective. I think it is inappropriate that the Senate vote \non this bill without fully exploring these questions and others.\n  I also have to address another issue, the issue of late-term \nabortion. The author of this bill--and there is a similar bill in the \nSenate--now the proponent of this House bill, in many ways by \nimplication says that horrific things are going on in the country; let \nus stop it now; it is immediate; it is a crisis; does not tell you that \nunder Roe versus Wade, which is the law of the land, the landmark \ndecision in 1973, which has not been overturned by this Court, which \nhas not been overturned by this Congress, says that in the late term of \na pregnancy the States have the full and absolute right to make the \nrules governing these abortions. Now we have for colleagues to see the \nrules and regulations in every single State, and I urge my colleagues \nto look at that.\n  What you will see is that in all States of the Union there are \ncontrols. In many States of the Union, there are stringent controls \nwhich require not only the attending physician but other physicians to \nsign on, and this is not considered likely in the States.\n  What really interests me is that the party that controls this \nCongress--and, in particular, the people offering this legislation--\nalways are on this floor saying let the States decide. They are closer \nto the problem. They are closer to the people. Let them decide. And yet \nthey would overstep all the States, outlaw a specific procedure which \nwe believe is the first time in the history of the country it has ever \nbeen done, and trample on all the States that have very serious \nregulations on this. And we will go into what some of those regulations \nare.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record a number of \neditorials.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Outlawing an Abortion Method\n\n       The House of Representatives succumbed to emotional \n     blackmail this week when it approved a bill that would ban a \n     specific abortion procedure and impose criminal penalties on \n     doctors who use it. The House action would undermine a \n     woman's constitutionally protected right to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy and a doctor's right to determine what \n     is best for his patient. The Senate would be wise to exercise \n     more restraint.\n       The procedure to be banned, known as intact dilation and \n     evacuation, is used only in late-term abortions, after 20 \n     weeks of gestation, and even then its use appears modest. \n     About 13,000 of the nation's 1.5 million abortions each year \n     take place after 20 weeks, usually because of special \n     circumstances, such as a threat to the mother's health or \n     severe fetal abnormalities.\n       While there are no reliable statistics, most late-term \n     abortions involve a procedure that breaks the fetus apart \n     before it is suctioned out of the uterus. But some doctors, \n     those who would be affected by the House bill, use a \n     procedure that involves partially extracting the fetus into \n     the birth canal and collapsing the skull in order to let it \n     be extracted. Anti-abortion groups call this a ``partial \n     birth'' abortion. They circulated graphic drawings in their \n     inflammatory campaign to impose a ban.\n       The House majority allowed its distaste for the particular \n     procedure to start it down a course that could undermine the \n     constitutional right to abortion as outlined in Roe v. Wade. \n     Roe recognized a woman's right to end a pregnancy, in \n     consultation with her doctor, during the first trimester. I \n     also recognized the state's interest in imposing some \n     restrictions on abortions as a pregnancy progresses through \n     the second and third trimesters. But it did not try to \n     dictate the methods that could be used.\n       The House bill would erode the judgment in Roe and \n     subsequent cases that while abortion's after fetal viability \n     can be forbidden, exceptions must be allowed to preserve the \n     mother's life or health. True, the bill would allow a doctor, \n     if criminally charged, to argue that the procedure was needed \n     to save the life of the mother and that no other procedure \n     would suffice. But that leaves scant room for a doctor to \n     exercise sound medical judgment as to the safest procedure in \n     a particular abortion.\n       The House bill is harsh and intrusive. The Senate should \n     have more respect for women, and responsible doctors and for \n     Roe.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 3, 1995]\n\n                    A Gruesome Piece of Legislation\n\n\n   the house--shown bloody photos--votes to outlaw a form of abortion\n\n       There is no question that the ``partial-birth abortion'' \n     procedure that the House voted Wednesday to outlaw is \n     gruesome. No woman undergoes this late-in pregnancy procedure \n     without great psychological and physical pain. Few physicians \n     perform it, and those who do may experience deeply \n     conflicting emotions.\n       The procedure is done typically only to avert an outcome as \n     gruesome as the operation itself--the death of the woman--or \n     to remove a severely deformed fetus that would not survive \n     after birth.\n       One measure of the pain and conflict surrounding the \n     partial-birth abortion is its extreme rarity. It accounts for \n     only about 200 of the 1.5 million abortions done annually in \n     this country.\n       The nature of the procedure should have been beside the \n     point; many medical procedures are bloody and hard to \n     witness. Nevertheless, supporters of the bill displayed \n     photographs of partial-birth abortions in the House chamber \n     to manipulate the emotions of Congress members.\n       In banning this form of abortion, the House has set a \n     precedent with dangerous ramifications.\n       Wednesday's vote is the first time a house of Congress has \n     asserted federal authority to ban a specific, established \n     medical procedure. As such, the action represents an \n     important legal and political step for anti-abortion forces.\n       Under the House bill, doctors who perform this abortion \n     could face up to two years in prison or monetary fines or \n     both. A doctor must prove that no other procedure would have \n     sufficed. In effect, Congress is telling physicians that the \n     government will now supersede the medical judgment of a \n     woman's physician.\n       Will Congress members, few of whom are physicians, now \n     outlaw other lifesaving procedures because they are difficult \n     to watch? Will this Congress, despite its promise to reduce \n     the intrusion of government into private life, increasingly \n     assert its authority at the medical bedside?\n       The Senate should stop this perilous slide when the \n     legislation comes its way.

About 13,000 of \n     1.5 million abortions performed in the United States are at \n     20 weeks or later. The bill puts an absurd burden on the \n     doctor being prosecuted to prove that this particular method \n     was necessary to save the life of the woman and that ``no \n     other procedure would suffice for that purpose.''\n       It is meaningless because the legislation does not address \n     alternative ways of terminating a pregnancy at late stages, \n     among them Caesarean section and induced labor.\n       The method the House would criminalize is intact dilation \n     and evacuation. The doctor pulls the fetus from the womb feet \n     first, through the birth canal, leaving only its head inside. \n     Surgical scissors pierce the skull, and the brain is \n     suctioned out, the skull collapses, and the fetus is taken \n     out.\n       It is hideous. It may also be the best procedure under \n     certain circumstances. The New York Times reported that \n     Colorado physician Warren Hern, author of the standard \n     textbook on abortion practice, said: ``The medical community \n     has not determined the very best way to do late-term \n     abortions, which are uncommon anyway. This method is a minor \n     variation on what I've done for 20 years and could be \n     absolutely necessary under some medical circumstances. But \n     what's important is that the decision be left to the \n     doctor.''\n       Certainly, it should not be left to Congress, with medical \n     issues so complex and personal issues so wrenching, when a \n     mother's health is in danger or the fetus is severely \n     damaged.\n       Of course, when the mother is well and the fetus is \n     potentially viable but merely unwanted, a late-term abortion \n     is unacceptable by any method.\n\n[[Page S 16742]]\n\n       ``Yet this Congress is determined to interfere unthinkingly \n     in any way it can, regardless of circumstances. This is the \n     first time since Roe vs. Wade that it has acted to ban a \n     specific abortion method, but numerous other efforts to stop \n     abortion are under way, such as keeping funding from \n     international groups involved in abortion overseas. The \n     Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision said states could not \n     limit the right to abortion in the first trimester of \n     pregnancy, but could regulate it in the second trimester to \n     protect a woman's health, and could limit or prohibit it in \n     the third trimester when the fetus is potentially viable. \n     Today, 41 states, including Iowa, have laws prohibiting late \n     abortions under most circumstances.\n       The House vote Wednesday to ban one method of late-term \n     abortion, and a similar bill introduced in the Senate, mark \n     the determination of politicians to pander to anti-abortion \n     forces.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From USA Today, Nov. 3, 1995]\n\n            Attack on Rare Abortion Procedure Invites Misery\n\n\nOur View: These cases are tragic, These cases are personal, Legislation \n                    is a clumsy and painful response\n\n       Abortion is a wrenching decision under any circumstance. In \n     the later stages of a pregnancy, it's a nightmare.\n       So it doubly painful to find the House of Representatives \n     voting to make the nightmare worse. It did so Wednesday, \n     voting to outlaw a last-report procedure to terminate some \n     late-term pregnancies.\n       The procedure is one that would make anyone cringe. The \n     fetus dies from an overdoes of anesthesia given to its \n     mother. Sometimes, its skull is then drained so the fetus can \n     be aborted intact without risk to the mother (not to cause \n     death as critics of the procedure often claim).\n       It's a process undertaken in desperate circumstances. Just \n     ask Viki Wilson, a 39-year-old registered nurse, doctor's \n     wife, and mother of two in Frenso, Calif. She was eagerly \n     awaiting the birth of her baby when the bad news arrived. \n     Just four weeks before her delivery date, she learned what \n     previous tests had failed to detect: two-thirds of her unborn \n     daughter's brain was in a sac outside the skull. The fetus \n     was suffering seizures and Viki Wilson's life was in danger. \n     The baby was doomed to die outside the womb no matter what \n     was done.\n       After consulting with specialists, the Wilsons opted for \n     ``intact dilation and evacuation,'' the procedure banned by \n     the House. The anesthesia was administered and a needle used \n     to draw fluid from the baby's enlarged head so it could pass \n     through the birth canal without damaging her mother.\n       ``This wasn't about choice, this was about medical \n     necessity,'' Wilson says.\n       That's the case for most late-term abortions. A mother's \n     pregnancy is complicated by health problems such as cancer or \n     heart disease, so that continuing the pregnancy endangers her \n     life. Or an unborn baby is found to have unthinkable \n     deformities.\n       If the Senate agrees with the House, other families won't \n     get the option available to the Wilsons. Or other choices. \n     The House language is so vague it can be read as outlawing \n     all late-term abortions. It bans ``partial-birth abortions,'' \n     a term not found in medical dictionaries. Doctors, facing \n     jail terms, may refuse to perform any late-term pregnancy \n     terminations.\n       And that is the real story of this legislation. Its backers \n     say it is a wedge to challenge abortion rights broadly.\n       The idea of aborting a healthy, late-term fetus for mere \n     convenience is reprehensible to all sides. And rare is the \n     doctor who would participate in such an abortion. Only a \n     handful will even perform late-term abortions for the more \n     compelling reasons.\n       The legislation just isn't needed. And the broader assault \n     will do nothing to alter the national division on abortion.\n       After 20-plus years of debate, there's no sign of national \n     consensus to ban abortion. And absent such social agreement, \n     the choice must be a personal one.\n       Abortion's dilemmas are indeed painful. But they are best \n     resolved by appeals to hearts and minds, not dictates of law \n     like this one.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. One is from the Los Angeles Times. It \nsays in part:\n\n       In banning this form of an abortion, the House has set a \n     precedent with dangerous ramifications. Wednesday's vote is \n     the first time a House of Congress has asserted Federal \n     authority to ban a specific established medical procedure. \n     Under the House bill, doctors who perform this abortion could \n     face up to 2 years in prison or monetary fines, or both. A \n     doctor must prove that no other procedure would have \n     sufficed. In effect, Congress is telling physicians that the \n     Government will now supersede the medical judgment of a \n     woman's physician.\n\n  ``Government will supersede the medical judgment of a woman's \nphysician.''\n  Wonderful, just what we were elected to do, decide what medical \nprocedures should be used under what circumstances. We have never done \nthat in history as far as I can tell. And this is a procedure that is \nused in most tragic, rare circumstances involving a woman's very life, \nand we are going to decide, without a hearing, unless we support the \nSpecter amendment for a hearing--and I hope we do--this should be \nbanned.\n  I think this editorial raises another interesting point.\n\n       Will Congress Members, few of whom are physicians, now \n     outlaw other lifesaving procedures because they are difficult \n     to watch? Will this Congress, despite its promise to reduce \n     the intrusion of Government into private life, increasingly \n     assert its authority at the medical bedside?\n\n  What is next, I ask? Then the editorial concludes.\n\n       The Senate should stop this perilous slide. When the \n     legislation comes its way, the President should be prepared \n     to veto it.\n\n  And the President has clearly stated that abortion should be legal \nand rare, and his standard is life and health of the mother. This bill \nmakes no such exception.\n  Then the New York Times says:\n\n       The House bill is harsh and intrusive. The Senate should \n     have more respect for women and for doctors and for Roe--\n\n  Meaning Roe versus Wade,\n\n     the Supreme Court decision that gives the right to the States \n     in the last trimester to set the rules and the standards.\n\n  USA Today: ``Attack on rare abortion procedure invites misery.''\n  They say:\n\n       These cases are tragic. These cases are personal. \n     Legislation is a clumsy and painful response.\n\n  And then the Baltimore Sun, and I see my colleague from Maryland is \nhere, I think gets right to the heart of it:\n\n       When a late-term abortion is necessary, usually to protect \n     the health or life of the mother, a physician should not have \n     to base his decision on how to proceed on the politics of the \n     issue.\n\n  So under the House bill, we are not only putting physicians in peril \nfor doing what they think is right, according to their medical training \nand their experience, to save a woman's life, we are putting them in \nperil, putting them in jail but we are bringing politics into the \noperating room as well, because make no mistake about it, this is about \nthe agenda of the far right in this country, who put together a \ncontract. They want to do away with the woman's right to choose, and \neven though late-term abortions are regulated by the States, this is \nhigh on their agenda.\n  I know the phones are ringing off the hook. That is OK, that is fine, \nbecause they are ringing off the hook on both sides. Then we see the \nDes Moines Register, and they talk about this legislation as mean and \nmeaningless. They say:\n\n       Physicians, not Members of Congress, should decide on \n     abortion methods.\n\n  Look, what procedure are we going to get into next? What are we going \nto ban next? What are we going to outlaw next? I mean, the sky's the \nlimit if we go down this slippery slope, and that is why having a \nhearing is so important.\n  I got a call today, they just sent it over to me: ``Please, Senator \nBoxer, tell these people that the women they are talking about are \nsomeone's baby.''\n  And they talk about babies. The woman who is in peril was somebody's \nbaby and now she is somebody's daughter and somebody's granddaughter. \nLet us talk about that baby, because, yes, my baby may be 27 years old \nand have her own baby, but she is still my baby, and she will be my \nbaby until the day that I am not here.\n  So this woman puts it into perspective. She wants me to put her name \nout. I do not know this woman. Dorothy Fox, from Santa Barbara, thank \nyou for calling my office. ``Please, Senator Boxer, tell these people \nthat the women they are talking about are someone's baby. My daughter \nhad this procedure, and I would have done anything to save my baby, my \n36-year-old daughter who had to endure this horrible procedure to save \nher life and her reproductive health so that she could have healthy \nchildren in the future. Please tell them''--meaning the supporters of \nthis bill--``that the fetus isn't the only baby involved. Those women \nwere once somebody's baby.''\n  I want to talk about the nurse that the Senator from New Hampshire \npoints out, her emotional testimony about being in the room and seeing \nthis procedure. And she is here to take questions, and that is good. I \nam glad \n\n[[Page S 16743]]\nshe is here, because I have a lot of people here, too, whose stories \nyou are going to hear.\n  Here is a letter from the Women's MedPlus Center in Cincinnati, OH, \nwhere this nurse worked.\n  I want to point out that the nurse worked at the clinic for 3 days; \nshe worked at the clinic for 3 days. This is the woman who now comes \nhere as an expert on this procedure. So you should ask her about that \nexperience.\n  The letter we have here is from Cristy Galvin, RN, and here is what \nshe says:\n\n       I am a registered nurse and have worked since July 1993 in \n     the Dayton office of Dr. Martin Haskell. In this capacity, I \n     was the nurse that supervised the training of Brenda Pratt \n     during her brief temporary employment at the Women's Medical \n     Center of Dayton.\n       As you know, we initially conducted a search of our \n     employment records under the name ``Brenda Shafer,'' as this \n     was the name she signed to the letter which was given to us.\n       When provided with the correct last name, we did, in fact, \n     find the record of her 3-day employment at our Dayton \n     facility.\n       The information provided by Ms. Pratt as to our practices \n     at the Women's Medical Center at Dayton is largely \n     inaccurate. First, she describes Dr. Haskell performing one \n     25-week and one 26-week abortion. Dr. Haskell does not \n     perform abortions past 24 weeks of pregnancy. This is a self-\n     imposed limit to which he has scrupulously adhered to \n     throughout the time I have worked for him.\n\n  So let us not be fast and loose with a doctor's lifetime commitment \nto health.\n\n       Second, Dr. Haskell does not use the ultrasound in the \n     performance of second-trimester procedures. We use ultrasound \n     only to determine the pregnancy's gestation. Therefore, her \n     entire description of her experience when viewing the second-\n     trimester abortion, which includes Dr. Haskell's using the \n     ultrasound while doing the procedure, is clearly \n     questionable.\n       Finally, at no point during a D is there any fetal \n     movement or response that would indicate awareness, pain or \n     struggle. Ms. Pratt absolutely could not have witnessed fetal \n     movement as she describes. We do not train temporary nurses \n     in second trimester dilation and extraction since it is a \n     highly technical procedure and would not be performed by \n     someone in a temporary capacity. If, indeed, Ms. Pratt \n     entered the room at any point during a D procedure, she \n     clearly either is misrepresenting what she saw or remembers \n     it incorrectly.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                   The Women's Medical Center,\n\n                                            Dayton, July 17, 1995.\n       Dear Congresswoman Schroeder: I am a registered nurse and \n     have worked since July, 1993, in the Dayton office of Dr. \n     Martin Haskell.

Mr. President, I need just about another 10 minutes to \nfinish my response, and I know that my colleagues here will \nparticipate.\n  We are talking about pain and suffering. We are talking about \ntragedy, and I am going to read a couple of other stories of women who \nhave had to face this. If you notice on the chart, when the chart is \nshown, there is no face of a woman shown. There is no face of a woman \nshown. There is no talk of the woman and the peril to her health and \nthe horrible consequences of what could happen to her if she carried \nthe fetus to term.\n  I want you to hear about Coreen Costello. Coreen was 7 months \npregnant with her third child when she discovered through ultrasound \nthere was something seriously wrong with her baby. The baby, named \nKatherine Grace, had a severe neurological disorder. The movements \nCoreen had been feeling were not the healthy kicking of a baby. They \nwere nothing more than bubbles and amniotic fluid which puddled in \nCoreen's uterus rather than flowing through the baby.\n  The baby had not been able to move for months. Not move her eyelids, \nnot move her tongue, nothing. The baby's chest cavity was unable to \nrise and fall to stretch her lungs to prepare them for air. Her lungs \nand chest were left severely underdeveloped, almost to the point of \nnonexistence.\n  The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was not going to \nsurvive. They considered all the options, but all brought severe risks \nto the mother. If Coreen waited to go into labor naturally, there was \nconcern her uterus would rupture. I am not going to go into all the \ndetail of what that looks like. I am not going to show a chart. They \nconsidered inducing labor, but were told it would be impossible due to \nthe transverse position of the baby, and the fact that the baby's head \nwas so swollen with fluid, while the baby's body was stiff.\n  Coreen and her husband faced a tragedy that most people never even \nhave to face, thank God. In the end, they made a decision to save the \nmother's life, to save Coreen's life. She underwent a late-term \nabortion, and because of this procedure, she is alive today caring for \nher husband and her remaining two children.\n  Michele Brydon was 23 weeks pregnant with her third child when she \nwent for a routine ultrasound to ensure that her baby was doing OK. The \nresult of this ultrasound turned Michele's family life upside down. The \ndoctors informed them that the baby--a girl--was suffering from a \ndiaphragmatic hernia. The diaphragm protects and separates the heart \nand lungs from the stomach and intestines. A diaphragmatic hernia is a \nhole in the diaphragm, which leaves the baby's heart unprotected and \npushes abdominal organs, such as her stomach and intestines, into the \nchest. Because of the intrusion of the abdominal organs, there was no \nlung growth. Michelle sought answers from specialists and a pediatric \nsurgeon, who might try to fix the hernia. She was told the baby would \nnot live; the baby was not compatible with life. She chose, in this \nparticular case, to have this procedure.\n  In October 1992, Claudia Crown Ades was 6 months pregnant with her \nfirst child. Everything was perfect. At age 33, she was told there was \nno need for an amniocentesis. But, for some reason, she began to get \nanxious, and her doctor sent her to an ultrasound specialist to ease \nher mind. Three days and four doctors later, Claudia and her husband \nRichard were informed their baby was plagued with severe anomalies, \nincluding brain damage, heart complications, extra digits, and more. \nThe abnormality is known as trisomy-13.\n  Claudia and Richard were told their baby would likely not survive the \npregnancy, and would have little or no chance of living through the \nfirst year. They were devastated. They were devastated. I do not have a \nchart to show you that they were devastated. They wanted this \npregnancy, and they were faced with the most agonizing of decisions.\n  After Tammy Watts and her husband found out she was pregnant in \nOctober 1994, they did everything prospective parents do--they \ndiscussed names, what kind of baby's room they wanted, whether it would \nbe a boy or a girl. Everything looked fine.\n  Then in a routine 7-month ultrasound, after a few minutes, the doctor \nsaid, ``There is something I did \n\n[[Page S 16744]]\nnot expect to see.'' A mass appeared outside the fetus' stomach.\n  Tammy was sent to several specialists for more tests to determine if \nsomething was indeed wrong with the fetus, or whether the ultrasound \nmachine was wrong. The doctors and the genetic counselor gave Tammy the \nworst possible news--the fetus, which was a girl, had no eyes, six \nfingers, six toes, and enlarged kidneys which were already failing. The \nmass on the outside of the stomach involved her bowel and bladder, and \nher heart and other major organs were affected.\n  This condition is known as trisomy-13, where on the 13th gene there \nis an extra chromosome. The trisomy-13 was causing the slow death of \ntheir daughter in utero. If Tammy's baby had died in utero, it would \nhave begun to breakdown, releasing fatal toxins into the woman's \nbloodstream.\n  Tammy and her family made the hardest decision of their lives, but \none that saved Tammy's life. These people are here to talk to you. \nListen to them, look in their eyes, and look at how they love their \nfamilies and their children.\n  Women in their late-term pregnancies do not desire, do not \nanticipate, want, or even think about abortion. Women in the late term \nof their pregnancies are anticipating the joy of child birth, the \nfulfillment of motherhood and family.\n  Doctors know late-term abortions are dangerous and difficult. They \nare emergency medical procedures done in the most tragic and painful \ncircumstances. Yet, this bill would outlaw an emergency medical \nprocedure. It will put a doctor in jail because he tried to save a \nwoman's life. It is going to happen without a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee, unless the Republican motion to commit, which will be \noffered by Senator Specter, passes. We were not elected to be doctors, \nand we were not elected to be God. And the States control late-term \nabortions. We have the list.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this list of \nthe States with the postviability restrictions. Every single State has \nrestrictions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                States With Post-Viability Restrictions\n\n\n                                alabama\n\n       No abortion may be performed after viability at an abortion \n     or reproductive health center unless immediately necessary to \n     preserve the woman's life or physical health.

I lived through that. \nOthers lived through that. Women died because they could not get \naccess. That is what this is about.\n  I can only conclude that it is about a commitment to the extreme \nright, who has made this a litmus test issue. I can only conclude that \ntheir commitment to State rights which, by the way, when they repealed \nnursing home standards, they said let the States set those standards. \nWe said, wait a minute, we need to have Federal nursing home standards \nbecause our seniors will go back to the days when they were scalded in \nthe bathtubs, sexually abused, and worse. They said, no, no, no, we \nbelieve in States rights. Well, here they are overstepping the States. \nThe States control this in the late term of a pregnancy.\n  It is their desire to take the most painful and difficult and tragic \ncircumstances and turn them into a political win. Without any \nhesitation, I can state that if it passes--and I know the President \nwill not sign it because he already said he will not because it makes \nno exception to preserving the life and health of the mother--but if \nsomething happened that and President was not there and it was another \nPresident and that President signed the bill, women will die, and they \nwill be our babies that we raised. Those are the babies that will die.\n  What kind of country do we want to be? I say to my friend, we have to \nlook at that. Is this going to be a country which outlaws a medical \nprocedure that is used to save a woman's life? Are we going to put \nwomen to their death? What is next, the Government deciding when people \nshould die? Maybe we will withhold life procedures that Senators do not \nthink are nice, and they will have charts and say withhold that \nprocedure from your grandmother. Well, not on my watch, not on my \nwatch.\n  I want to close by asking every male Senator to picture this: Your \n32-year-old daughter or your 28-year-old daughter comes home to you--\nor, more likely, you get a call from the emergency room at the \nhospital, and the doctor says, ``I do not know how to tell you this, \nbut if I am going to save your child's life, your baby's life, I have \nto act now because she is in danger and in jeopardy''--I beg my \ncolleagues to put themselves in that position and be honest about this \nissue because you know what you would say. You would ask questions; you \nwould find out if there is any way to save this pregnancy, if there is \nany way to save her life or the baby's. But if it came down to that, \nafter you checked and double checked and found out that this one \nemergency procedure, and only that, could save her life, you would say, \n``Doctor, with the help of God, do what you were trained to do and save \nmy baby's life.'' I think if Senators are really honest, they will vote \nto send this bill to the Judiciary Committee, where it will be in front \nof the committee that is sharply divided on the issue of abortion, \nwhere doctors can come forward, where nurses can come forward, where \nwomen can come forward, where they can be questioned, where a nurse who \nsaid she saw this can be questioned, where a doctor who performs this \ncan be questioned, so that we can have all the information that we \nneed.\n  I ask my colleague from Maryland if she would like me to yield to her \nbecause I know she has been waiting here for hours.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate that, but I also note there is another \nSenator here. I have a very short statement. But I know the Senator has \nbeen waiting for some time, as well.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Either way. It does not matter.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator's statement long?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mine is probably about 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Why do we not stick to the tradition of alternating. If \nI might respond to the Senator from California, I think the most \nimportant thing in a debate like this is for us to maintain civility \nand the traditions of the Senate. I will be happy to wait my turn. I \nthank the Senator for her concern.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friends, I really appreciate the spirit with \nwhich we entered this debate. I hope it will be the spirit that we have \nthroughout this debate. It surely is difficult.\n\n  I think I have made the case for why I think it is important to send \nthis bill to the committee. I think I have made the point that when we \ntalk about babies we have to talk about all of the life involved in \nthis: My daughter and your daughter, your baby, the fetus in a late \nterm which is so desperately wanted by the family, and why this is such \na tragic decision for families.\n  And why for the first time in history, for Congress to ban a medical \nprocedure that sometimes is the only way to save the woman's life is \ngetting us down a slippery slope, and why it is very important to have \na closer look at this, to be the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me thank my colleague from Maryland for her \ngraciousness in regard to alternating back and forth on the two sides \nof the aisle regarding this bill.\n  I rise today in strong support for the partial-birth abortion bill. I \nthink everyone knows, in this Chamber at least, that I am pro-life. But \nthe comments I make today are not really directed directly at those in \nthe Chamber who are pro-life, but at those who would consider \nthemselves to be pro-choice.\n  I will address some of the concerns that might be raised in regard to \nthis bill by people who do consider themselves pro-choice.\n  As my colleague has so eloquently pointed out, when the House of \nRepresentatives took this bill up and ultimately voted on it, there \nwere a number of people who I am sure still today describe themselves \nas pro-choice, who voted for this bill: Representative Bonior, \nRepresentative Gephardt, Representative Susan Molinari, Representative \nPatrick Kennedy. So I think it is clear that people who consider \nthemselves pro-choice can, in fact, vote for this piece of legislation.\n  I think it is important as we debate today, Mr. President, that we \nnarrow the focus of the debate to the specific bill in front of us, to \nthe language contained in that bill. I believe that, if Members of this \nChamber will do that, they will find that the legislation does deserve \nthe support, not just of those of us who consider ourselves pro-life, \nbut also of those who consider themselves pro-choice.\n  I have seen it quoted in the paper that there are those who argue \nthat this particular piece of legislation will rollback Roe versus \nWade. I do not think that is true. In fact, I know it is not true.\n  It is perfectly possible, Mr. President, and intellectually coherent \nand intellectually consistent, to endorse this legislation and at the \nsame time support the decision in Roe versus Wade. I do not happen to \nsupport Roe versus Wade, but I do believe that by narrowly focusing on \nthis piece of legislation--what it will do, what it will prevent--a \nperson would come to the conclusion that it is not inconsistent with \nRoe versus Wade.\n  This bill, Mr. President, is not a ban on abortions. It is not even a \nrestriction on when an abortion may be performed. Let me repeat that. \nIt is not a restriction on when an abortion may be performed.\n  Restrictions of that kind were actually envisioned by Roe versus \nWade. If you carefully read Roe versus Wade, it is clear that was \nenvisioned by the Court. Roe versus Wade did make the distinction \nbetween the different trimesters.\n  Even though Roe versus Wade allowed for that kind of restriction, \nthis bill does not restrict the timeframe for a woman contemplating an \nabortion. All this bill does is abolish one particular procedure. All \nthis bill does is abolish one particular procedure.\n  My friend and colleague from New Hampshire has described this \nprocedure in great detail. It was unpleasant to listen. At one point I \nliterally walked off the floor. But I compliment him for having the \ncourage to come to this floor and to talk about the facts and to lay \nout before this Senate and before the American people what, exactly, we \nare talking about.\n  Stripping away the pleasant rhetoric that is usually used in \ndescribing in great detail exactly what this single procedure and what \nthis bill is about, and what it actually does. I think we all can agree \nthat this procedure is especially cruel, unusual and inhumane.\n  Prof. Robert White is the director of the Division of Neurosurgery \nand Brain \n\n[[Page S 16747]]\nResearch Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University. He testified \nbefore the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution.\n  Let me just stop at this point in response to my colleague from \nCalifornia, her comment that this bill should be sent back, sent back \nto the Judiciary Committee of the Senate for hearings. There were \nsignificant hearings held in the Judiciary Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives that covered both sides of this particular issue.\n  I think in this case, at least, any additional hearings would be \nredundant. The facts are basically here in front of us.\n  Let me go back to the quote from Professor White when he testified \nbefore the House Judiciary subcommittee on the discussion. He said that \nfetuses that are subjected to this procedure are ``fully capable of \nexperiencing pain;'' ``fully capable of experiencing pain.''\n  Mr. President, they endure that terrible procedure that we have heard \ndescribed, and they are fully capable during that time of experiencing \nthis pain.\n  We should, Mr. President, take some comfort in the fact that the \nprocedure is not performed very frequently. It is rare. The fact is it \nshould not be performed at all. It is an unnecessary procedure. Even \nfrom the perspective of the pro-choice community.\n  Mr. President, some Senators have expressed concern about whether the \nmother will be adequately protected without the availability of this \nprocedure. If you talk to the medical community about this they will \ntell you that if a mother's life is in danger they certainly have more \nhumane ways of terminating the pregnancy to save her.\n  Let me turn, if I could, Mr. President, to a matter that has been \nraised already on this floor and that I know will be raised again. That \nis, the exception for the life of the mother. In this bill, there is \nsuch an exception. It is called an affirmative defense.\n  Let me read from the statute of the proposed bill.\n\n       It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution or a civil \n     action under this section, which must be proved by a \n     preponderance of the evidence, that the partial-birth \n     abortion was before a physician who reasonably believed, one, \n     the partial-birth abortion was necessary to save the life of \n     the mother and, two, no other procedure would suffice for \n     that purpose.\n\n  This is the only way, I submit, that as a practical matter such an \nexception can be included in this type of legislation.\n  Affirmative defenses are not new. Affirmative defenses, as the \noccupant of the chair, the Presiding Officer knows very well, go back \nthroughout history. They include things that we all know about: \ninsanity, for example, or self-defense. In fact, they are contained in \nthe Federal Code in 30 or 31 different statutes.\n  For those who have prosecuted at the State level, we all know about \naffirmative defenses, as well. Affirmative defenses are usually written \ninto the statute when the knowledge about the fact is uniquely in the \nhands or control of the defendant.\n  I submit that is true in this particular case. To not have it \nincluded as an affirmative defense, but rather to write it directly \ninto the statute, would pose a situation that would be virtually \nimpossible to deal with in court, as the prosecutor would have to \nbasically prove a negative in every single case and then would, in \nfact, have to get inside the mind of the defendant. This is the type of \nsituation where affirmative defenses are historically used. In the \nFederal Code, 30 or 35 times affirmative defenses are mentioned and \nare, in fact, built into the statute.\n  The legal test, guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, never changes. Every \nelement has to be proven. It has to be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. The question of the affirmative defense comes in as raised by \nthe defendant and there, when it is raised by the defendant, the legal \nstandard is a very, very low standard; that standard is preponderance \nof the evidence, evidence which is of greater weight, more convincing \nthan the evidence which is offered in opposition to it. It is a \nbalancing test. That is all the defendant has to do.\n  To summarize, to those who are especially concerned about the life of \nthe mother in this regard, as we all should be, this bill does contain \nan affirmative defense for doctors who act with a reasonable belief \nthat this procedure is necessary to save the mother's life. As a former \nprosecutor, I can state it is relatively common in criminal law, both \nat the Federal level and State level, to provide this exception, to \nprovide exceptions to general rules. Among the most common examples are \nself-defense and the insanity defense. There are more than 30 of these \naffirmative defenses in the current Federal law.\n  For example, to a charge of witness tampering, there is an \naffirmative defense that the intent of the defendant was to encourage \ntruthful testimony. In cases of failure to appear, there is an \naffirmative defense of uncontrollable circumstances. In cases of \nknowing endangerment, there is an affirmative defense that the \nendangered person consented to a professionally approved medical \ntreatment.\n  These protections for defendants are relatively common, and the \nFederal courts know how to deal with them. The affirmative defense in \nthis bill is a sensible and rational provision to protect doctors and \npatients.\n  We should not lose sight of the real health issue involved here. \nAccording to Dr. Pamela Smith of the department of ob-gyn at Mount \nSinai Hospital in Chicago, the procedure of partial abortion itself \nposes risks to the health of the mother. She cites several examples, \nand then she concludes:\n\n       There are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered \n     in this country which require a partially delivered human \n     fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of the mother.\n\n  This is a pretty clear medical conclusion. Frankly, as I examine the \nfacts, I see no reason why this Senate--those who consider themselves \npro-life and those who consider themselves pro-choice--should not \napprove overwhelmingly this bill. This debate will continue, I am sure, \ninto the night tonight and into tomorrow.\n  I ask, again, that my colleagues listen to the narrow focus of the \ndebate. Look at the language in the bill. Recall the basic facts that \nwe have in front of us in regard to what this medical--medical \nprocedure--actually entails.\n  I think, after Members do this, there is only one logical conclusion \nthat they can come to, and that is, whether pro-life or pro-choice, \nthey have to vote to ban this horrible, brutal operation.\n  I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending \nbusiness before the U.S. Senate. Let me say at the outset, I believe \nthat good people can differ on the matter of abortion. I believe this \nis an issue so profound that it requires the utmost thoughtfulness and \nthe utmost dignity, even as we debate this.\n  I would also like to state what pro-choice means. We often use the \nphrase pro-choice or pro-life. We pro-choice people happen to think we, \ntoo, are pro-life. We are not anti-life. For us, the question is not \nwhat is decided; the question is who decides. For the pro-choice \ncommunity, we believe that decisions related to abortion should not be \nmade on the floor of the U.S. Congress but should be left in the \ndoctor's consultation room.\n  So our position, when we say pro-choice, is that we believe it is a \ndecision not to be made by Congress, not to be made by a conference \ncommittee, not to be determined through a Presidential veto, but should \nbe determined between a physician and the patient. That is why we say \nwe are pro-choice.\n  There are any number of circumstances why an abortion is either \nmedically necessary or medically appropriate. There is no way the U.S. \nCongress can look at these issues or even anticipate what a variety of \nthese medical circumstances are. Within this great institution, there \nis only one physician, and I know there are no nurses. Some have strong \nscientific background, but we are not capable of that. These are \ndecisions that need to be made on a case-by-case basis, based on the \nmedical circumstances and the religious convictions of the individual \nfamilies that are involved, not the collective wisdom or lack of it by \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  This is why, when we say we are pro-choice, I say we are not anti-\nlife. We are for appropriate decisions to be made based on what is \nmedically appropriate and what is the individual \n\n[[Page S 16748]]\nfamily circumstances and their own religious convictions. So that is a \ngeneral statement. But on this bill, I would like to say, too, that \nthis bill requires very careful study. It is far reaching. It strikes, \ntoo, at that very core of the doctor-patient relationship that I have \njust commented upon.\n  I bring to everyone's attention, there have been no hearings on this \nbill in the U.S. Senate. Yes, there was a hearing in the House. But \nthis is the U.S. Senate. If a House hearing counted, we would not hold \nhearings on anything. We would have not held hearings on the tax bill, \nwe would not hold hearings on the budget, we would not hold hearings on \nwelfare reform. We, the U.S. Senate, must act as our own body, and I \nbelieve it is up to the Senate to conduct its own hearing on this most \nsensitive, most difficult issue.\n  The ban that is being proposed would have an effect far beyond the \nissue of abortion. For the first time, the Congress would be directly \nregulating what medical procedures a doctor can and cannot provide. It \nis a tremendous intrusion into medical practices.\n  I know tomorrow morning, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, will be offering a motion to send the bill back to the \ncommittee for a hearing, with a time certain for reporting it back. I \nwill support the motion, and I want everyone to understand that the \nmotion to recommit for a hearing is not dodge ball, where we, by \nreferring it back, we avoid the vote. It is to be sure that when we do \nvote, we will have heard from all who have an interest in this \nlegislation.\n  Under this legislation, I want to bring out that Congress could make \ncriminals out of doctors who perform a procedure which, in their expert \nopinion, is medically necessary to save a woman's life or to prevent \nserious adverse risk to her health. Supporters of the legislation like \nto point out that the bill contains a so-called affirmative defense \nwhich allows for procedures performed to save a woman's life. But what \ndoes that mean? If you read the bill carefully, you see that this is \nnot a life exception. It means that after a doctor has suffered the \nhumiliation of arrest, being handcuffed, forced to hire an attorney, \nand posted bond and a trial is underway, the doctor can testify that he \nor she believed the procedure was the only method that would have saved \nthe woman's life. This completely shifts the burden of proof to the \ndoctor after an arrest has been made. We criminalize this. The doctor \nhas to prove that the procedure was the only procedure that could have \nsaved the woman's life.\n\n  What is more, there is no such affirmative defense for cases where \nthe woman and her doctor have decided the procedure is necessary to \npreserve the woman's health and future fertility.\n  The bill before us is a tremendous assault on Roe versus Wade. Under \nRoe, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the constitutional right \nof women to seek an abortion, and has rejected as unconstitutional \nthose laws that do not allow for late-term abortions necessary to \npreserve the life or health of the mother. The Court has repeatedly \naffirmed the right of the physician to make that decision, along with \nthe woman, as to what is in the best interest. The Court has rejected \nlaws that would require the physician to put the health of the fetus \nbefore the health of the woman. In decision after decision, the Court \nhas affirmed that the woman's health must remain the doctor's paramount \nconcern. This bill would overturn that premise.\n  So this bill is carefully crafted to directly attack the \nunderpinnings of Roe versus Wade, and the bill's sponsors, particularly \nin the House, have already served notice that their intention is to \ncompletely outlaw abortion, one procedure at a time.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill is radical and far reaching. This \nbill has not been the subject of a single day of hearings in the \nSenate. We have not heard from one witness, especially the medical \ncommunity. No committee has deliberated on the language of the bill and \nunderstands the full consequences of this. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The abortion issue is a sensitive and controversial one. Emotions run \nhigh whenever we debate this issue. That is why it is so crucial that, \nbefore we vote on this bill, it should be subject to the careful study \nthat committee hearings and deliberation would provide. I would support \na limit on the time being referred to the committee, a 30- to 40-day \nlimit. We could vote before this Congress adjourns for the holiday \nrecess.\n  For myself, I would like to hear the testimony from the proponents of \nthe bill about why they believe Members of Congress are better able \nthan physicians to decide what medical procedures are appropriate for \nwomen facing the tragedy of a late-term abortion. I think the Senate \nshould hear from women who face the painful decision of terminating a \nwanted pregnancy, and whose doctors have selected this method.\n  I think the Senate should hear from the physicians who perform this \nprocedure so that we can understand why it is sometimes necessary, and \nwhat would happen to these women if this procedure were banned. I want \nto hear from the American College of ob-gyn's. They are the experts in \nthis field. The Senate should hear their testimony about what they \nthink about this bill. I have been informed that they think it is \nmisguided. Let them present the testimony. Let us have a discussion \nwith that.\n  There are 13,000 physicians of the American Medical Woman's \nAssociation who oppose this bill. We should hear why. Is it the \nprocedure, or is it the Federal intrusion? We hear so much about the \nFederal intrusion into people's lives. This is the most profound of \nFederal intrusions. But again, let us hear from the doctors. Let us \nhear from the doctors about this issue.\n  This issue is too complex, and its implications too profound to let \nit come to the floor for debate without due consideration through the \ncommittee process. Regardless of any Senator's views on abortion, I \nbelieve that every Senator should support the motion that will be \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania to send the bill to the \ncommittee. This is not an undue delay. It is a responsible thing to do. \nThe Senate is known as the world's greatest deliberative body. On \nsomething so sensitive, and so complex, I do believe that we should \nhear from the American medical community who can give us guiding advice \non this, and also for those women who face this issue, many of whom \nwill tell us their story, and others who have faced this issue and \nchose another path.\n  I believe the Senate should be open-minded, listen to advice, and \nthen in a rational and deliberative way which is characteristic of both \nthis body and I believe those in the House who even differ on the \nabortion--that our decisions be based on a rational set of information \ngoing through the traditional committee process in which there can be \nthe questioning back and forth of the witnesses.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the motion that \nwill be offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania tomorrow and urge, if \nthat does not pass, the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your attention. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe Senator Ashcroft will speak \nmomentarily, and I will be happy to yield to the Senator when he gets \nhere.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand Senator Kennedy will be here momentarily.\n  Mr. SMITH. If Senator Kennedy gets down, or Senator Ashcroft, I would \nbe happy to yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the motion that will \nbe offered by several of our Republican colleagues to refer this bill \nto the Judiciary Committee.\n  Many of us oppose this legislation and believe it should not pass in \nany form. This measure is the latest attack by some of our colleagues \nin their continuing all-out assault against a woman's constitutional \nright to choose whether to continue her pregnancy. The proponents of \nthis misguided legislation make no secret that their goal is to ban all \nabortions.\n  The procedure involved in this case is extremely rare. It involves \ntragic and \n\n[[Page S 16749]]\ntraumatic circumstances late in pregnancy in cases where the mother's \nlife or health is in danger. These cases should not be dealt with by \nthe criminal law, and our colleagues are wrong to try to criminalize \nthem.\n  Who in this Chamber would second-guess the medical judgment of a \nphysician if such a case arose affecting a member of a Senator's own \nfamily?\n  Who in this Chamber would sacrifice a wife or daughter by rejecting \nthe medical procedure needed to save her life?\n  Surely, the debate by the Senate on the serious issues raised by this \nbill should take place after, not before, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has had a reasonable opportunity to consider it fairly and \nhear testimony on both sides.\n  It is sad to see the leadership of the Senate so bent on meeting the \nright-wing's antiabortion litmus tests that they are willing to trample \nthe integrity of the Senate legislative process.\n  Clearly, this legislation is not ready for final action by the full \nSenate at this time. It is a travesty of responsible deliberation for \nsome Senators to pretend that it is. It is irresponsible for supporters \nof this measure to insist on such action without benefit of regular \ncommittee consideration.\n  Extremely important issues are at stake, and the Senate should not be \nstampeded by the shock tactics of the shock troops of the extremists \nwho oppose all abortions at any stage of pregnancy.\n  The Senate has a duty to act responsibly, and to hear from both sides \nin this controversy, especially the views of the medical profession. \nLet us reject this Alice in Wonderland approach to serious \nlegislation--sentence first, verdict afterward.\n  Clearly, in light of the far-reaching questions raised by the purpose \nof this bill and the confusing details of its provisions, it would be \npremature for the Senate to act.\n  Enactment of this legislation would represent the first time in \nAmerican history that Congress has outlawed a specific medical \nprocedure.\n  It would represent the first time in American history that Congress \nhas threatened doctors with prison terms for practicing their \nprofession.\n  It would threaten the life or health of hundreds of American women \neach year.\n  It would undermine the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision in Roe \nversus Wade, which guarantees a woman's right to choose whether or not \nto continue a pregnancy. In fact, the legislation is so poorly drafted \nthat it is likely to be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court \nunder Roe and subsequent decisions.\n  This issue raises fundamental questions about the Federal \nGovernment's proper role, if any, in the doctor-patient relationship. \nFew aspects of the lives of ordinary citizens are as sensitive and as \ndeserving of privacy as the relationship between patients and their \nphysician. Yet this bill puts the Federal Government directly into the \ndoctor's office in the most intrusive way, by attempting to substitute \nCongress' political judgment for a doctor's medical judgment.\n  Despite the importance and complexity of these issues, this bill has \nreceived no consideration whatever by any Senate committee. The bill \nwas passed by the House of Representatives last week. It had only 1 day \nof hearings in the House, and that day could hardly be called fair or \nbalanced or objective.\n  A Senate bill similar to the House bill was introduced earlier this \nyear by Senator Smith.\n  But it was placed directly on the Senate Calendar--in an obvious \neffort to avoid the kind of committee consideration it clearly needs.\n  This bill is not a resolution to establish National Ice Cream Week, \nor to honor a sports championship team. This is a bill that would \ncriminalize a particular medical procedure and send doctors who use it \nto prison.\n  The bill purports to ban a procedure that the bill's proponents refer \nto as ``partial-birth abortion.'' The term was invented by politicians, \nnot doctors. It appears in no medical textbook and has no well-\nunderstood meaning in the medical or scientific community.\n  Medical experts should have an opportunity to testify about any bill \nthat presumes to rewrite medical procedures and ban them, especially \nwhen Congress is defining and naming a medical procedure that the \nmedical profession does not recognize. If Congress wants to play \ndoctor, it should hear from doctors first.\n  The Judiciary Committee should also hear from constitutional scholars \nabout the constitutionality of this bill under Roe versus Wade and \nsubsequent Supreme Court decisions.\n  In addition, the committee should hear from constitutional scholars \nabout its constitutionality under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. As \nrecent press reports make clear, this bill's terminology is so vague \nthat doctors will not know what it means or which medical procedures \nare actually being criminalized.\n  Obviously, the proponents of this legislation are making a political \nstatement with this bill.\n  One purpose of their vague language is to intimidate as many \nphysicians as possible by threatening them with possible prosecution if \nthey perform medical procedures that could be covered by the vague \nnonmedical language of this bill in its present form. Those who want to \nban all abortions do not mind this kind of vagueness in a criminal \nstatute--but the Constitution does.\n  The Supreme Court is likely, therefore, to rule that this bill is \nunconstitutional twice--once under Roe versus Wade, and once under the \nvoid-for-vagueness doctrine.\n  When this bill was debated in the House, its proponents actually \nboasted that it was the first step in an effort to reverse Roe versus \nWade and deny women the constitutional right to choose whether or not \nto bear a child.\n  I believe that a solid bipartisan majority of the Senate supports Roe \nversus Wade and a woman's right to choose, and that this legislation \nwill ultimately be defeated.\n  But that is not the issue here. The motion to send this bill to the \nJudiciary Committee protects all sides in this controversy. It directs \nthe Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the bill and report it back \nto the full Senate with amendments, if any, in 45 days.\n  Surely, legislation so far-reaching and unprecedented deserves at \nleast that degree of responsible consideration. What are its proponents \ntrying to hide?\n  I urge the Senate to refer the bill to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support H.R. 1833, the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. When the Founding Fathers drafted the \nConstitution of the United States, they made it abundantly clear that \none of the most crucial roles of government is to ``secure the \nBlessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.''\n  Yet, over the past few decades, the value of life in America has been \nsubstantially cheapened, and the opportunity for liberty diminished. \nThe rise in drive-by shootings, gang warfare, and abandoned babies, all \npoint to the fact that life in America is not considered as precious as \nit used to be.\n  One of the most gruesome indicators of the decline in the value of \nlife is the practice of partial-birth abortions. A partial-birth \nabortion is an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \npartially delivers a living baby before killing the baby and completing \nthe delivery.\n  H.R. 1833 will bring an end to this grisly procedure. Opponents of \nthis bill try to disguise partial-birth abortions as reproductive \nhealth services, but a close examination of the procedure shows it is \nno such thing. When performing a partial-birth abortion, the individual \nfirst grabs the live baby's leg with forceps and pulls the baby's legs \ninto the birth canal. He then delivers the baby's entire body, except \nfor the head; jams scissors into the baby's skull and opens them to \nenlarge the hole. Finally, the scissors are removed and a suction \ncatheter is inserted to suck the baby's brains out. This causes the \nskull to collapse, at which point the dead baby is delivered and \ndiscarded.\n  Mr. President, this procedure is cruel and indefensible, and it is an \nassault to the common values of the American people. Listen to what \nnurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who witnessed one of these abortions, had to \nsay in her letter to Congressman Tony Hall:\n\n       The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were \n     clasping together. He was kicking his feet. All the while his \n     little head was still \n\n[[Page S 16750]]\n     stuck inside. Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors and inserted them \n     into the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the scissors \n     up. Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube into the hole \n     and sucked the baby's brains out. I almost threw up as I \n     watched him do these things.\n\n  Mr. President, several medical experts have recently stated that this \nis not a medically necessary procedure. The American Medical \nAssociation's Council on Legislation--which unanimously supports \nbanning this procedure--also stated that partial-birth abortions are \n``not a recognized medical technique'' and concurred that the \n``procedure is basically repulsive.''\n  I agree this procedure is repulsive; it is the grotesque killing of a \nnew-born baby. Its feet are out, its hands are out, its legs are \nkicking, its arms are reaching. It is a new-born baby. Think of what \nkind of society we live in when we fine and arrest people for affecting \nthe habitat of an endangered kangaroo rat but explicitly allow the \nabhorrent practice of sucking out the brains of a new-born baby.\n  Moreover, most partial-birth abortions are performed for purely \nelective reasons. Martin Haskell, who is one of the chief advocates of \nthis procedure, stated to AMA News in a July 1993 interview that, \n``I'll be quite frank: most of my abortions are elective in that 20-24 \nweek range. In my particular case, probably 20 percent are performed \nfor genetic reasons. And the other 80 percent are purely elective. * * \n*''\n  Despite the consensus in the medical community that these procedures \nare not used to save the life of the mother, H.R. 1833 contains a \nsafeguard for any practitioner who reasonably believes this procedure \nis necessary to save the life of the mother. This legislation is \nbalanced and well-reasoned, and it merits our support.\n  Mr. President, we need to return to the premise that life in America \nis precious and sacred. Our Nation's children are our hope and our \nfuture, and government at all levels has an incumbent responsibility to \nprotect these children who cannot protect themselves. I support this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \ndebate only during the remainder of today's consideration of H.R. 1833, \nand at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow Senator Specter be recognized to make a \nmotion to commit the bill to the Judiciary Committee, and that a vote \noccur on the motion at a time to be determined by the majority leader \nafter consultation with the Democratic leader, with no amendments in \norder during the pendency of the motion to commit; and further, that \nthe time between 9:30 and 12:30 tomorrow morning be equally divided \nbetween Senator Smith and Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object--as \na matter of fact, I think this is an excellent request--I just want to \nclarify with my friend that we are looking at a vote around the 12:30 \nhour. In other words, it is our intention certainly by 1:30 to have \ndisposed of the motion. Is that his understanding of it?\n  Mr. SMITH. That is correct. We anticipate a vote sometime in the \nvicinity of 12:30, not before 12:30. It could be 12:45 or 1:30. But \nthere is no intention to delay matters beyond that. It is our intention \nto have any speakers who may wish to speak this evening or tomorrow \nmorning on the bill on either side, and we would divide that time \nequally.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, I say to my friend, if we do decide to go over \nanother 45 minutes, we could equally divide it in the same fashion. I \nknow that is not in the request, but I am sure that is the way we would \nwork together.\n  Mr. SMITH. I have no objection to that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, on behalf of \nthe majority leader, I will announce that there will be no more votes \nduring the remainder of today's session.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire for his work on this legislation. Few have \ndone more for the unborn than has Senator Smith, I am pleased to join \nhim as an original cosponsor of the bill before us today.\n  In just the past several months our work has been witness to acts of \nterror in Oklahoma City and again over the weekend in Israel. Each of \nthese cases has been surrounded by voices of concern for the harsh \nrhetoric many feel provoked the atrocities. While I do not know how \nthoroughly I agree with that analysis, it does point out the need for \nour national debate on even the most divisive issues to be civil, to be \nreasoned--to win, arguments must not merely move the heart, they must \npersuade the mind.\n  And so today, that is what I want to accomplish--to speak with \ncivility and reason about the horror of partial-birth abortions which \nliterally rip a child from its mother's womb.\n  As I mentioned earlier, abortion is the divisive moral issue of our \nday. It hits at our deepest notions of liberty and questions our most \nfundamental assumptions about life.\n  For more than 20 years now, abortion-on-demand has been the law of \nthe land. I think it a poor law and I think it an immoral one. But for \nnow it is the law and it must be observed.\n  The bitter fruits of this law have been the death of over 30 million \nhuman begins who will never know what it means to learn and live and \nlaugh among us. The inhumanity of this loss can never be gauged, never \nbe measured, never fully be felt. We saw yesterday humanity's grief at \nthe funeral of Yitzhak Rabin. A great man was mourned by a grateful \nworld. How much greater the grief of 30 million lives that will never \nknow peace, never know love, never know the warmth of a father's \nembrace or the strength of a mother's love?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor his comments on the bill and on the procedure and for his comments \nwith regard to my involvement in this issue. I appreciate it. No one in \nthe Senate is more committed to this issue and a more honorable man. I \nappreciate very much his friendship and support on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of comments on this \nmotion to refer back to the Judiciary Committee. As a recap here, bear \nin mind that the House Judiciary Committee held a number of hearings. \nThe Judiciary Committee held a hearing. They had a subcommittee markup, \na committee markup, they had a committee report. The House had a full \ndebate. It passed after that full debate by a vote of 288-139. And so \nto say that somehow we need to refer this bill back to committee, back \nto the Judiciary Committee, is nothing more than a dilatory process. \nAnd really the reason for it is quite simple. It is an effort not to \nhave to make this vote. It is a reason to avoid the tough question. It \nis a reason for those who basically want abortion on demand to not have \nan opportunity to vote on this procedure, which we have all heard is \nthe most outrageous procedure.\n  In addition, the AMA Legislative Council voted twice to endorse it. \nThey did not need further study. They are the experts. We are having a \nfull debate here on the Senate floor.\n  I just want to point out to my colleagues, if you do not approve of \nthis process, this motion to refer is a hostile motion to that issue. \nIf you refer this matter to the Judiciary Committee, you are saying \nthat you want this process to continue. That is really what you are \nsaying. Some will say that is not true, we want to study it more and \nhave more hearings. How much more study do you have to have \n\n[[Page S 16751]]\nthan what we have already had with the process that we see? Why do we \nhave to study something as obvious as this is? We have all the medical \nexperts, we have all the testimony from people who worked in abortion \nclinics, who have observed Dr. Haskell and others. We have the nurse's \ntestimony. We have the testimony of the abortion doctors. We have the \ntestimony of other medical doctors. It is an effort to make sure that \nthe full Senate does not have to face this matter.\n  This is one of the things about politics and politicians that just \nturns the American people off. Whatever your position is, if you feel \nthat taking the life of a child with only its head in the womb is \nright, then vote that way. Go ahead and vote that way. That is your \nright. You have the right. That is your vote and I respect that.\n  But to delay it further and send it back to the Judiciary Committee--\nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee does not want the bill sent \nback. Yet, apparently, Senator Specter is going to try to send it back \nthere against the wishes of the chairman. I hope that we will respect \nthe wishes of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, not some member \nof the committee, who simply supports this process, who wants this bill \nto be delayed. This is the reason for it. It is not to have hearings. \nWe can have hearings until hell freezes over. It is not going to change \nanything. How many more hearings do you have to have? How many more \npeople do you have to have testifying saying that we are killing babies \nthis way? How many more times do you have to hear it? How many more \ntimes do you have to see these charts? How many more times?\n  So I want my colleagues to understand when you come in here tomorrow \nand we deal with this issue between the hours of 9:30 and 12:30, that \nthere will be an effort here to send this bill back to Judiciary \nCommittee--not to have hearings. That is just a facade. It is to delay \nthe bill and eventually kill it so that we do not have to vote on it.\n  You are killing more than a bill if you do this, you are killing \nhundreds of children. On average, remember, there is at least one \npartial-birth abortion per day. So every day we delay it, there is one \nmore child. We are not talking about the debate. I happen to believe \nthat, after conception, it is a living child. That is not what we are \ntalking about. We have been through this before. I will not repeat it \nall. But we are talking about a child in the birth canal, and one a day \nis killed.\n  So I just say to my colleagues, is there really anything that you are \ngoing to hear or see in the Judiciary Committee hearings that is going \nto change your mind? You either support this procedure or you do not. \nIf you do not support it, do not delay it by sending the thing back to \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  So I encourage my colleagues, if you have something to say on this, \nto be here tomorrow and be prepared to express yourself. Please bear in \nmind that delaying this accomplishes nothing except delay. That is what \nthe American people get so upset with us about--that we do not make \ndecisions. We just debate and talk.\n  Let me tell you, if debate and words could solve the world's problems \nand America's problems, we would sure do it here on the floor of the \nSenate because we are all good at debating. But that does not get the \njob done. Do you support this process of taking the life of an unborn \nchild--partially-born child--or do you not? If you do not, then do not \nvote to delay further the vote to stop it. That is the issue, pure and \nsimple.\n  The American people, I think, are up to here, Mr. President, with \neverybody dodging issues. I really think they are up to here with it. \nWhy do we not just face up to it? I would respect that. Let us face up \nto it and just say that we are going to have an up-or-down vote, we are \nnot going to have these phony issues of sending it to the Judiciary \nCommittee or maintaining that there is not a life of the mother \nexception when there is one, or that there is deformity, or that \nsomehow it is right to take a child that is deformed from the womb. Let \nus deal with the issue at hand, which is this process, this procedure. \nLet us have an honest up-or-down vote on it, tomorrow hopefully, and \nget it to the President's desk. That is what the issue is about.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we are winding down debate this \nevening and we will have an opportunity tomorrow to cast a very \nimportant vote on a motion by Senator Specter, a Republican Member of \nthe Senate, cosponsored by six other Republican Members of the Senate, \nto take an issue that is precedent-setting, precedent-breaking, and \nrefer it to a committee that needs to look at it. Why do I say that? I \nsay that because if this House bill passes the Senate as it is, this \nwould be the first time, that anyone around here can verify, that a \nmedical procedure has been banned by the Congress of the United States \nof America--a medical procedure that is used in the most tragic, most \ndifficult circumstances, where a life is at stake, a life of the \nmother, with serious health implications for the mother.\n  As one of my constituents who called during the debate said, there is \nmore than one baby involved here, because the mother was somebody's \nbaby at one time.\n  As I said, I ask Senators not to dodge this at all, but before they \nvote, close their eyes and think it was their daughter--their \ndaughter--who they adore, where there was an emergency call and the \ndoctor they respected and admired who had brought other children into \nthe world said, ``Your daughter is facing a tragic situation. If I do \nnot perform a particular medical procedure, she could be dead. I cannot \nguarantee that she would live if I use any other procedure.''\n  You would say, I believe--believe me, I am not putting words in your \nmouth, this is what I think you would have said--``Have you double \nchecked? Have you triple checked? Have you tried another idea? Have you \ntried another approach? How do you know? Have you done all the tests?''\n  If the doctor answered those questions to your satisfaction, you \nwould say, ``With the help of God, save my child.''\n  I think that is what we are coming down to here--not somebody's \ncontract, not somebody's ideology, but with a human decision that must \nbe made, tragically, by too many American families.\n  So we have never before banned a medical procedure as far as we can \nverify. This is one where it is used in these tragic circumstances--and \nI went through some of those circumstances --we have people here \nwilling and ready to talk to colleagues, people who have gone through \nthis procedure, who have made gone through this tragic choice, who are \nhappy to talk about it.\n  They are not political. I do not know what party they are in. I can \njust tell you they are human beings, they suffered, they struggled, and \nthey want to spare other people, frankly, not only the pain, but the \nloss of life that will ensue if a lifesaving procedure is, in fact, \noutlawed by this Congress.\n  It is not about ducking issues; it is about making informed choices \nhere for us.\n  How can we make an informed choice, I say to my friends and \ncolleagues, if the committee that writes the laws about criminalization \ndoes not even have a look at this, and this would criminalize a \nprocedure that is used by a doctor in tragic and terrible \ncircumstances. We are going to put that doctor in jail. This greatest \ndeliberative body in the world is not even going to hold a hearing.\n  I am very pleased to see seven Republican colleagues put this motion \nforward. It is common sense. It is highly appropriate.\n  I happen to believe if we did this willy-nilly and President Clinton \nwas not there and there was another President who did not believe that \nit is important to save the life of the mother or protect her health \nand another President signed this, women would die.\n  Why do I say that? Not to be sensationalist. I do not have charts. I \ndo not have pictures. But we know this is used in tragic circumstances. \nI think we should come together as a Senate, regardless of our view on \nthis issue, and send this to the Judiciary Committee.\n  There is a time certain. It is 45 days. It could be sooner. It could \nbe sooner. That is an outside date. \n\n[[Page S 16752]]\n\n  I just hope colleagues will consider this, recognize the precedent-\nsetting nature of this House bill, and vote to send it to the Judiciary \nCommittee, which is a very, very fair committee to send it to in terms \nof its membership. We get a fair hearing. Hear from the doctors.\n  Do not have Senators come on the floor who never spent a day in \nmedical school describe a procedure, tell you how it feels when a baby \ncomes down the birth canal. I know how that feels. I can talk about \nthat. But I am not a doctor. We are not doctors. We are certainly not \nGod.\n  I believe that we need to do the prudent thing here: Send this to the \nJudiciary Committee. They will look at some amendments. Yes, there is \nan affirmative defense for a physician. If he uses this procedure \nbecause he thinks under the Hippocratic oath, this is the only way he \ncan save the life of this mother, he has committed a criminal act--he \nor she, as the case may be. That physician--in the bill--yes, can go to \nthe court and defend himself or herself and explain why he did this.\n  What kind of society is this where we will haul a doctor into a \ncourtroom for saving a woman's life? That is not a society that is a \ngood society. That is not a society that looks after its people.\n  We are not doctors here. We are not God. We have to do the best we \ncan to make wise and sound decisions.\n  It always strikes me as being very strange when we hear States' \nrights advocated on this floor of the Senate day in and day out. We \neven voted in this Senate, the Republicans did, with a couple of \nexceptions--not many--to completely abolish nursing home standards, and \nwhen we won a vote to restore them, that was overturned by the Roth \namendment, which says there is a waiver in the process so States could \nhave no Federal standards for nursing homes. Why? They said, ``Oh, we \ntrust the States.''\n  Well, my friends, under Roe versus Wade the States control abortion \nafter the first trimester. That is clear. I have printed in the Record \na list of every State and all the restrictions in those States. This \nwould wipe out all those restrictions.\n  I find it amazing that some of my Republican friends, and certainly \nnot all--some--would argue States rights in repealing Federal standards \nfor nursing homes, but then come right around and say, ``We do not \ntrust the States when it comes to late-term abortion.''\n  This is about a whole other agenda. That is why I hope we can rise \nabove a political agenda--this is a political agenda--and do what is \nright for the American people.\n  Let me say this. We do not put people in jail for political crimes in \nthis country. This is what is so great and unique in America. We do not \nput people in jail for political crimes.\n  But I honest to God believe this, that if we outlaw a procedure which \nmight be the only procedure to save a woman's life, and a doctor uses \nit and the doctor does wind up in jail because there is no exception \nfor the life of the mother in this radical legislation, he would be \nserving time for a political crime. He would be in there for a \npolitical reason--somebody's agenda. I just hope that we can come \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16730-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16752-S16753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE MINERALS ISSUE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here many times discussing a \nvery important issue for the State of Nevada, and that is mining. This \nstatement today is a follow up of the conference which was completed \nwith the House in recent days. It was during that conference that I was \nreminded of the old ``Dragnet'' program where Jack Webb, who was Joe \nFriday on the program, when interviewing the witnesses, would say, \n``Just the facts ma'am,'' or ``Just the facts, sir.'' Many times we \nneed this as we debate mining.\n  As the Chair knows, the debate on this issue has centered in recent \nyears between the Senator from Nevada and my good friend, the senior \nSenator from the State of Arkansas. And during the course of that \ndebate, and the conversations and the discussion we had during the \nconference, my friend from Arkansas on a number of occasions referred \nto one of the big employers in Nevada, the Newmont Mining Co., as a \nforeign corporation. I wanted to make sure that I was right. I on a \nnumber of occasions questioned my friend from Arkansas.\n  I think it is important that we understand the motives for raising \nthis issue are clear--the desire of some to arouse fear that somehow \nthe minerals industry has been taken over by people from outside the \nUnited States. The fact of the matter is that the vast, vast majority \nof investors in the mineral industry are American citizens.\n  Mr. President, Newmont Mining Co., as I have indicated in recent \nweeks, in recent years, recent months, has been the target of some very \nnegative statements and rhetoric by the Secretary of the Interior, \nBruce Babbitt, and the senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  The latest tirade that was offered against this company was the fact \nthat they had been issued a patent by the Interior Department of some \n118 acres in the State of Nevada.\n  Now, in the State of Nevada, keep in mind, we are a State of \napproximately 72 million acres, and this was a patent of a little over \n100 acres.\n  Both the Secretary and my friend from Arkansas continue, as I have \nindicated, to refer to Newmont as a foreign company taking title to \nU.S. land and resources. First of all, understand, Newmont Mining Co., \nwas formed in the United States, in the State of Delaware, in 1921. The \nname Newmont comes from the two areas where the company at that time \nwas operating--New York and Montana. Therefore, the name Newmont.\n  Putting aside, Mr. President, the larger debate that foreign \nownership should not, I believe should not even be an issue, when you \nunderstand that Newmont Mining Co. has invested over $1.5 billion, now \napproaching $2 billion in its Nevada operations, and has paid about \n$700 million in wages and about $600 million in payroll, property, \nsales and net proceeds taxes, including Federal income taxes since they \nhave been there--not bad--Newmont Mining Co. is not now and never has \nbeen a foreign company.\n  Newmont Mining Co. stock has been publicly traded on the New York \nStock Exchange since 1925. If anyone in this room decided they wanted \nto go buy some Newmont stock, they could walk into any stock dealer in \nthe United States and purchase shares of Newmont stock. No one is asked \nfor proof of U.S. citizenship or should they be, when purchasing stock \nin U.S. companies.\n  At the present time, records show that about 95 percent of Newmont's \nstockholders are U.S. citizens or institutions or U.S. residents. The \nlargest single stockholder in Newmont Mining Co., owning some 13 \npercent of the stock, is a man by the name of Mr. George Soros, who has \na very interesting background--a man who escaped from Communist Hungary \nin 1956, came to America, settled in New York where he made a fortune.\n  Mr. Soros owns not only 13 percent of Newmont Mining Co. but various \npieces and sometimes the whole of various U.S. companies. No \nshareholder owns more than 13 percent of the stock that Mr. Soros owns \nin Newmont Mining Co.\n  The next largest shareholders are very important institutions in the \nUnited States: the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System; the State \nof Wisconsin Investment Board, which manages pensions for Wisconsin \nState government retirees, is a large holder of Newmont stock; the \nState of New York Employees Retirement Fund holds a very large block of \nNewmont stock; Fidelity Investment Management of Boston, the largest \nmutual fund organization in the United States, owns a large block of \nNewmont stock; Ark Assessment Management, a New York City pension \nmanagement firm, owns a large block of Newmont stock.\n  Mr. President, this information is readily available to be obtained \neither by the Secretary of Interior or my good friend from the State of \nArkansas. I think the time has come that we should stop attempting to \ndegrade, in \n\n[[Page S 16753]]\nany way belittle this fine mining company that has invested almost $2 \nbillion in the State of Nevada.\n  I think it is time, as I stated at the start of this discussion, we \ndeal just with the facts. Let us deal just with the facts. As Jack \nWebb, I repeat, the Joe Friday of the ``Dragnet'' series, said, we need \nto deal with the facts, have this discussion on the facts, not rhetoric \nthat has no bearing on the issues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16752-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

A bill to provide for State control over fair housing \nmatters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   the kyl-faircloth state fair housing laws recognition act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Kyl-Faircloth State \nFair Housing Laws Recognition Act of 1995. I thank Senator Faircloth \nfor his cosponsorship of this bill, and his leadership in States rights \nissues. I am pleased to introduce this amendment which will prohibit \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] from enforcing a \ncomplaint of discrimination on the basis of a housing provider's \noccupancy standard, and thereby transferring from HUD to the States and \nlocalities the authority to set occupancy standards.\n  Mr. President, an occupancy standard specifies the number of people \nwho may live in a residential rental unit. In July of this year, HUD \ngeneral counsel Nelson Diaz issued a memorandum which, in effect, \nsupplants the traditional two-per-bedroom occupancy standard, and may \nforce housing owners to accept six, seven, eight, or even nine people \nin a two-bedroom apartment. HUD should not be establishing national \noccupancy standards.\n  HUD was created in 1965 with the best of intentions: To build and \nfund housing for the poor. But the agency's regulations have gone far \nbeyond the scope of that intent. Housing is first and foremost a local \nissue. The Federal Government should play a limited role in it. State \nofficials are closer to the situation and can tailor standards to meet \nthe needs of their communities.\n  HUD has accepted a two-per-bedroom standard as reasonable in \nenforcing fair housing discrimination laws under the Fair Housing Act. \nMost public housing units subscribe to that standard. That is, until \nHenry Cisneros became Secretary of HUD. Secretary Cisneros and his then \nDeputy, Roberta Achtenberg, disagreed with the traditional occupancy \nstandard, arguing that it discriminates against larger families.\n  The new HUD standard is without factual foundation. Mr. Diaz has used \nthe Building Officials and Code Administrators [BOCA] Property \nMaintenance Code as a foundation for his occupancy standard. The BOCA \ncode, however, is a health and safely code specifically drafted by \nengineers and architects to provide guidance to municipalities on the \nmaximum number of individuals who may safety occupy any building. It \nwas never intended to alter the minimum number of family members HUD \ncould require owners to accept under fair housing law.\n  The code was adopted without any consultation, public hearings, or \nanalysis of its impact on the Nation's rental housing industries. That \nis wrong. Secretary Cisneros, through HUD's general counsel, has \ncircumvented the Federal Government's rulemaking process by imposing \nthis standard through an advisory without public hearings.\n  Mr. President, the Manufactured Housing Institute, Arizona \nAssociation of Homes and Housing for the Aging, and the Arizona \nMultihousing Association endorse the bill. Arizona Gov. Fife Symington, \nspeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives Mark Killian, and \npresident of the Arizona Senate John Greene have sent me a letter in \nsupport of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that their letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  States and localities should establish occupancy standards, not a \nFederal bureaucracy. Several States have an occupancy standard \nincluding my own home State, Arizona. And it has worked well. It is \ntime we begin returning a certain amount of authority back to the \nStates. Public housing laws are a good place to start. That is why I \nintroduce this bill which blocks HUD's attempt to set a national \noccupancy standard, and transfers that authority to the States and \ncities. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your prompt and decisive \n     action regarding the issue of federal intervention in the \n     area of occupancy standards as outlined in our joint letter \n     of August 15, 1995. As you know, the issue has been a very \n     divisive one in Arizona, and has now spread to other states \n     nationwide.\n       We believe that your proposed legislation will resolve the \n     issue by reaffirming the right of each state to set standards \n     that it deems most appropriate. We especially applaud your \n     requirement that HUD shall not establish a national occupancy \n     standard, but defer to authorized state agencies in the \n     administration of cases involving occupancy standards.\n       We fully support your legislation and by this letter have \n     notified other Members of the Arizona delegation of our \n     support. We appreciate your leadership on this issue and \n     compliment your excellent staff for their work on the bill. \n     If we may assist you in any way to promote the passage of \n     this legislation, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fife Symington,\n       Governor, State of Arizona.\n     John Greene,\n       President, Arizona Senate.\n     Mark W. Killian,\n       Speaker, Arizona House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1398. A bill to increase the penalty for trafficking in powdered \ncocaine to the same level as the penalty for trafficking in crack \ncocaine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  federal crime penalties legislation\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I was honestly shocked to learn of \nthe huge difference that exists between the Federal penalties for \ntrafficking powder cocaine and for trafficking the exact same amount of \ncrack cocaine.\n  Right now, selling 5 grams of crack cocaine results in the same 5-\nyear mandatory minimum prison term as selling 500 grams of powder \ncocaine. Selling 50 grams of crack cocaine gets you a 10-year minimum \nsentence, while you'd have to sell 5,000 grams of powder cocaine to get \nthe same 10 years in prison.\n  While these penalties are vastly different--100 times greater if you \nsell crack cocaine--the damage caused by these criminal acts are the \nsame. Lives are lost, families are destroyed, careers are ruined, and \nour Nation itself is seriously threatened.\n\n[[Page S 16755]]\n\n  Tough penalties are necessary to send a clear signal that the United \nStates will not tolerate selling illegal drugs. The answer to the \nproblem presented by this wide difference in penalties is not to lower \npenalties for selling crack cocaine but to increase the penalties for \nselling powder cocaine.\n  Therefore, my legislation is very simple and very clear. \nTrafficking--that is the manufacture, distribution or sale--of 50 grams \nof powder cocaine will result in a 10-year minimum sentence--the same \nas dealing in crack cocaine.\n  Manufacture, distribution or sale of 5 grams of powder cocaine will \nresult in a 5-year minimum sentence--the same as dealing in crack \ncocaine.\n  I'm pleased that Senator Hank Brown of Colorado has joined me as a \nprinciple cosponsor of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Exon, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Kerrey, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1399. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure \nfunding for essential air service program and rural air safety \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   the rural air service survival act\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat will help preserve air service in rural areas and save the \nEssential Air Service [EAS] Program for the future. I am pleased that \nmy colleagues Senator Exon and Senator Rockefeller are joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of the Rural Air Service Survival Act.\n  Last week, the Senate passed the conference report for the \nTransportation appropriations bill which cut the EAS Program by one-\nthird, reducing appropriations from $33 million in fiscal year 1995 to \n$22 million in fiscal year 1996. Under these reductions, dozens of \ncommunities will experience reductions in air service. As my colleagues \nunderstand, the EAS Program provides support to maintain air service in \nremote rural communities that would have no air service at all. EAS is \na critical program that plays an essential role in the economic \nviability for many rural communities. It is also an indispensable \ncomponent to our national transportation system, connecting remote \nrural areas with hub airports. If the EAS Program is terminated--as \nsome in the Congress and in the administration have proposed--then \ndozens of rural communities will lose the only air service available to \nthem. In the grand scheme of things, the EAS Program does not amount to \na lot of money, but to the over 60 rural communities dependent upon \nEAS, it determines the very survival of air service.\n  When the airline industry was deregulated, the EAS Program was \nestablished as a means to ensure rural areas continue to have air \nservice. In several rural communities in North Dakota, EAS support is \nthe only means to maintaining some kind of air service. These \ncommunities are at least 100 miles from the nearest airport which \noffers jet service.\n  Over the past few years, the only constant in the EAS Program has \nbeen funding cuts. Each year, the administration proposes to eliminate \nEAS and those of us who understand the critical importance of this \nprogram are forced to fight for funding. The dramatic cuts for fiscal \nyear 1996 should be a sign that the current budget process is not \nworking for EAS and without the establishment of a permanent financing \nmechanism, the future is too uncertain for the rural communities that \nrely upon EAS support.\n  This legislation that would provide a permanent financing mechanism \nfor the EAS Program. It seems to me that the EAS Program ought to be \nremoved from annual appropriations battles and be given more secure \nfinancing. Looking at the trend over the past few year, it is \nunrealistic for anyone to expect the EAS Program to last very long \nunless we develop a new financing mechanism to sustain the program.\n  Under this legislation, a 10-cent fee would be imposed on every \nenplanement. The revenue raised would fund the EAS Program. The \nlegislation would ensure that any administrative cost to carriers in \ncollecting this small fee would be reimbursed. Any unobligated funds \nwould be used to enhance the airport improvement program, directing \nthat any excess funds be made available for small community airports \nfor maintenance projects.\n  This legislation would assure passengers and the industry that this \nfinancing mechanism will only be used for its intended purpose. The \nprice of a dime will ensure that all areas of our country are \naccessible by air travel. It seems to me that we need to work to \nrestructure the EAS Program and save air service in rural areas and \nthis approach would provide a solution protected from annual Washington \nbudget battles.\n  I realize that given the present budget situation, those of us who \nreally care about programs like EAS have to think of new solutions. We \ncannot continue to put new wine into old wineskins. We need to develop \nnew financing mechanisms and make the most of limited Federal funding.\n  Our transportation system in this country is vital to our economic \nhealth and national security. It is of critical importance that, \ndespite tight budgets, we finds ways to maintain a truly national \ntransportation system that links every region and State in the union. \nThat is why we need to save the EAS Program and establish its own \nfinancing mechanism.\n  It seems to me that we need to make some changes in aviation policy \nin this country and stop ignoring the fact that rural regions are \nsuffering a serious decline in air service. The airline industry has \nundergone many changes since deregulation in the early 1980's. The \ninvisible hand of competition replaced the assuring hand of Government \nin the aviation market place. As a result, some areas of the country \nhave seen lower prices and more choices in service. In other parts of \nthe country, namely in rural areas, we have seen dramatic losses in air \nservice and higher prices.\n  It is my view that our Nation's small communities, especially in \nrural areas, have not fared well under deregulation: One hundred sixty-\nseven nonhub communities have lost all air service since 1978 while \nonly 26 have gained new services. Several hundred more have had jet \nservice replaced by high-cost turboprop or piston aircraft. The result \nfor small communities has been a deterioration of the quality of \nservice an increase in prices.\n  The legislation will secure a reliable source of financing for the \nEAS Program. The EAS Program is essential to our Nation's national \ntransportation system and this legislation will ensure that this \nprogram continues. The legislation has been endorsed by Communicating \nfor Agriculture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Labor to issue guidance \nas to the application of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974 to insurance company general accounts; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                  THE ERISA CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator \nDodd and Senator Jeffords, to introduce the ERISA Clarification Act of \n1995.\n  This legislation is designed to protect pension plan participants and \nbeneficiaries by removing the threat of retroactive liability based on \nthe way life insurance companies have historically organized and \nmanaged pension assets. Importantly, the legislation would not affect \nany ongoing civil action.\n  For nearly 20 years, the insurance industry relied on an interpretive \nbulletin issued by the Department of Labor, as well as an Internal \nRevenue Service ruling, which stated that assets held in an insurance \ncompany's general account were not considered plan assets under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA]. In December 1993, \nhowever, the Supreme Court ruled in John Hancock versus Harris Trust \nthat this long-standing practice of including pension assets as part of \na general account could violate certain provisions of ERISA. The Court \nrecognized that its decision created the possibility of serious \ndisruptions in the way pension assets were managed. As such, it \ncommented that problems arising from the decision should be addressed \nlegislatively or administratively.\n  The Department of Labor is working closely with all parties to \ndevelop rules, consistent with Harris Trust, for dealing with \nprospective insurance company activities. However, without additional \nlegislative authority, the Department of Labor may be unable to grant \nprotection for retroactive activities which might expose insurance \ncompanies to significant liability and threaten the security of pension \nassets.\n  Mr. President, in the nearly 20 years before the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Harris Trust--and in the 2 years since that decision--there \nhas been little evidence that plan participants have been harmed by the \ninsurance industry's long-standing practice of managing benefits, or \nthat the insurance industry is especially prone to the problems of \nasset mismanagement that gave rise to ERISA. In fact, there were no \nenforcement proceedings initiated by the Department of Labor against \ninsurers resulting from the mismanagement of pension assets prior to \nthe Harris Trust decision.\n  I believe, however, that our failure to address this issue could \nthreaten the safety and security of pension assets by exposing the \ninsurance industry to millions of dollars of retroactive liability. \nTherefore, I believe we should consider, and enact, this important \nlegislation as quickly as possible. I look forward to working with my \ncosponsors, and with other Members of this body, to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16754-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pryor, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Nunn] was added as a cosponsor of S. 881, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify provisions relating to church \npension benefit plans, to modify certain provisions relating to \nparticipants in such plans, to reduce the complexity of and to bring \nworkable consistency to the applicable rules, to promote retirement \nsavings and benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Texas \n[Mrs. Hutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 949, a bill to require \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the \n200th anniversary of the death of George Washington.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from \nFlorida [Mr. Graham] and the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1028, a bill to provide increased access to health \ncare benefits, to provide increased portability of health care \nbenefits, to provide increased security of health care benefits, to \nincrease the purchasing power of individuals and small employers, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Exon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1181, a bill to provide cost \nsavings in the medicare program through cost-effective coverage of \npositron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1233, a bill to assure \nequitable coverage and treatment of emergency services under health \nplans.\n\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the names of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] and the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1340, a bill to require the President to appoint a \nCommission on Concentration in the Livestock Industry.\n\n\n                                S. 1370\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1370, a bill to amend \ntitle 10, United States Code, to prohibit the imposition of any \nrequirement for a member of the Armed Forces of the United States to \nwear indicia or insignia of the United Nations as part of the military \nuniform of the member.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16756-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I ask that the attached article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 17, 1994]\n\n    Casino Gambling Surges in United States, Tempting More Teenagers\n\n                          (By David Holmstrom)\n\n       A new gambling industry survey indicates that casino \n     gambling has grown explosively in the United States.\n       Four years ago, only two states--New Jersey and Nevada--\n     offered casino-style gambling. Now, 23 states offer the roll \n     of dice and spinning roulette wheels. Another dozen states \n     are considering legislation approving casinos.\n       According to the survey by Harrah's Casinos and the polling \n     firm Yankelovich Partners, the number of ``household'' visits \n     to casinos has almost doubled since 1990. In 1993, the number \n     of visits was 92 million, up from 46 million visits in 1990. \n     (A ``household'' visit, as defined in the survey, averages \n     out to 1\\1/2\\ persons from the same family.)\n       Spokesman in the industry now define gambling as \n     ``entertainment'' and refer to it as the ``new American \n     pastime'' because the number of people visiting casinos last \n     year outnumbered total attendance at major league baseball \n     games. ``The experience we want guests to have at a casino is \n     enjoyment in an atmosphere that is not intimidating but \n     memorable,'' says Bala Subramanian, corporate director for \n     marketing information and planning for the Memphis-based \n     Promus Company, the parent company of Harrah's.\n       Casino gambling, for years legal only in Nevada, has grown \n     rapidly as states, cities, and Indian tribes have turned to \n     gambling to try to generate economic development and jobs. \n     Dozens of tribal reservations across the US now offer casino \n     gambling, and riverboat casino gambling is legal in six \n     states along the Mississippi.\n       Estimated casino revenue for 1993 is $12.9 billion, up from \n     $8.3 billion in 1990. The Harrah's survey compiled results \n     from a questionnaire developed by Home Testing Institute on \n     Long Island, N.Y., and mailed to 100,000 households. From \n     that mailing, 18,600 casino players were identified. Their \n     responses were then combined with responses from 2,500 adults \n     in an annual national survey of American values and attitudes \n     by Yankelovich Partners.\n       Even though 51 percent of the adults in the survey said \n     casino gambling is ``acceptable for anyone,'' the acceptance \n     percentage declined by 4 percentage points from Harrah's 1992 \n     survey. The 1993 survey attributes this decline to casino \n     referendums in southern states that caused heated public \n     debate about gambling.\n       Critics of gambling say its rapid growth in the US has a \n     dark side, particularly among youngsters and teenagers. \n     ``Kids today have grown up in an atmosphere where gambling is \n     promoted by the state, churches, and synagogues, and the \n     availability of it is everywhere,'' says Tom Cummings, \n     director of the Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling.\n       ``We are getting more and more calls from desperate high \n     schools asking us to put on programs to help kids deal with \n     gambling.'' A council study of the effects of illegal \n     gambling on 3,000 students found that 32 percent of students \n     who do not gamble said they felt their refusal to partake in \n     it was not normal. ``There was tremendous peer pressure on \n     them to gamble,'' Mr. Cummings says.\n       In 1992, some 280,000 teenagers were denied entrance to \n     Atlantic City casinos, and another 29,000 were led out of the \n     casinos. Harrah's Casinos has implemented ``Project 21'' to \n     keep underage gamblers out of casinos by stopping them at the \n     doors or ejecting them once inside.\n       A second program, ``Operation Bet Smart,'' includes posters \n     around casino floors saying: ``Know when to stop before you \n     start.''\n       Harrah's president, Phil Satre, told the National Press \n     Club in Washington recently: ``Just like car manufacturers \n     build safety devices into new automobiles, responsible casino \n     operators must take action on the issue of problem gambling . \n     . .. We are not in business to capitalize on compulsive \n     behavior. We are in the business to entertain our \n     customers.''\n       The problem is that gamblers lose money, Cummings says, \n     ``and that is millions and millions of dollars diverted out \n     of the mainstream economy. Somebody has to lose all that \n     money.''\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/07/senate-section/article/S16757-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16757-S16758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ASSASSINATION OF YITZHAK RABIN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nsorrow, my shock, and my anger over the cowardly assassination of Prime \nMinister Yitzhak Rabin.\n  Yitzhak Rabin will be remembered as a man of extraordinary courage \nand unusual vision who lived in a time when both of these traits were \nscarce.\n  I first met Yitzhak Rabin when I called on Prime Minister Golda Meir \nduring my first visit to Israel in 1973. As two individuals who shared \na commitment to Israel's well-being, our paths crossed on numerous \noccasions over the course of the next 23 years. I saw him for the last \ntime in October when he came to Washington to commemorate the 3,000th \nanniversary of King David's entry into Jerusalem.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was a man who did not mince words--a quality which \nearned him the respect and trust of a country which has a reputation \nfor toughness. To anyone who encountered \n\n[[Page S 16758]]\nhim, it was immediately evident that his overriding concern was for the \nsecurity of his fellow countrymen.\n  He was born into the small community of Jews in Palestine, which \nlater formed the core of the nascent State of Israel. He went on to \nplay a key role in the war of independence; commanded the army that \nunified the city of his birth; served in key Government posts; and, in \nperhaps his finest hour, he drew upon the lessons of half a century of \ndefending his people to pursue the path of peace which promises to \nsecure the future of the nation he helped create.\n  Yitzhak Rabin's ability to distill the fundamental choices facing his \nnation was a quality born of his unique experience as a soldier and a \nstatesman. He articulated in stark terms the reasons why Israel's long-\nterm security hinged on the success of the peace process. He viewed the \nstatus quo as unacceptable, because it meant continued violence into \nthe indefinite future and possibly the eventual loss of Israel's Jewish \ncharacter. He saw that possibility clearly and he believed Israel had \nto reject it in favor of a path of enlightened self-interest--pursuing \nan agreement on the basis of land for peace, preserving Israel's Jewish \ncharacter, achieving normalcy with long-hostile neighbors, and securing \nIsrael's long-term survivability.\n  Mr. President, many are now suggesting that this terrible \nassassination was the isolated act of a madman. I wish it were true. \nBut I think that all of us know better.\n  This act was not perpetrated in a vacuum. It occurred against a \nbackdrop in which a culture of hate and violence was being promoted \nactively by people who should have known better and behaved more \nresponsibly. The extreme rhetoric was not confined to Israel. \nUnfortunately, some in this country added their voices to the alarmist \ncries.\n  There is a lesson in this for all of us. For while words alone do not \nkill, they can encourage others to do so. Those who employed hyperbolic \nrhetoric for the sake of political gain must bear some measure of \nresponsibility for creating a climate in which a cold-blooded \nassassination could be contemplated as a patriotic and pious act.\n  I hope that those who irresponsibly stoke the fires of hatred will \nuse this slaying of a great man to look deeply within themselves and \nchange their ways.\n  Mr. President, this is in many ways Israel's most difficult and \nemotionally wrenching hour since here creation 47 years ago, because \nthe assassin's bullet was aimed not only at Yitzhak Rabin but also \ndirectly at the very heart of the democratic process in Israel. It is a \ncommitment to democracy that has distinguished the Israeli nation from \nits neighbors in the Middle East and has been the enduring foundation \nof the long, traditional friendship between Israel and the United \nStates.\n  As one of the founders and defenders of the independent State of \nIsrael, as its Prime Minister, and most of all as a devotee of \ndemocracy, Yitzhak Rabin personified the process that made possible the \nprogress toward peace in the Middle East. He also understood how \nviolence could threaten both the process and the peace--just moments \nbefore he was shot he spoke against violence, which he said had \nrecently taken, in his words, ``* * * A shape which damages the \nframework of fundamental values of Israeli democracy.''\n  It was that framework of democratic values the assassin was out to \ndestroy--and it is designs of just such antidemocratic violence which \nIsrael and the friends of Israel must deny in memory of Yitzhak Rabin.\n  I believe that we have already begun to erect that memorial. I \nbelieve that this assassination, as deeply as it has shaken us \npersonally, will serve to reinforce the bonds of friendship between \nIsrael and the United States. I believe that we will summon the resolve \nto successfully complete the unfinished journey on the path of peace \nembarked upon by Yitzhak Rabin.
