Under the previous order, H.R. 2606 will \nnow be laid aside and the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] will be \nrecognized to submit a Senate concurrent resolution. The able Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I send a resolution to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 35) expressing the \n     opposition of the Congress to President Clinton's planned \n     deployment of United States ground forces to Bosnia.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very simple resolution. It \nis the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution that says, very simply, we oppose \nPresident Clinton's decision to deploy American troops into Bosnia.\n  The second part is also very simple. It says we support the troops of \nour country 100 percent.\n  Congress must exercise its responsibility under the Constitution. We \nmust say ``no'' when there is a bad decision that will cost American \nlives. Congress has not been consulted. Congress has not authorized \nthis deployment. It is not an emergency.\n  The President is talking about a year. Congress should not authorize \nany deployment of troops that will put them in harm's way for a 1-year \nperiod.\n  This is not within the parameters of the NATO agreement. I have a \ncopy of the NATO agreement here with me. If any Member of the U.S. \nSenate can show me the provision in this agreement that somehow makes \nit our responsibility to send troops into a civil war in a country that \nis not a NATO country, I invite them to come to the floor and do that.\n  Mr. President, it is not there. The NATO treaty is a mutual defense \npact among nations that were trying to make sure that we would have the \nability to repel a large and onerous foreign invader. There is no such \npotential foreign invader for our NATO countries and, therefore, rather \nthan run around the world and react to crisis upon crisis where there \nis not a U.S. security threat, it is time for us to look at NATO and \nour agreement and make it strong by planning ahead, by having a \nstrategic vision about what is needed now to make Europe stable.\n  America wants to be part of making Europe stable, but, Mr. President, \ngoing into a civil war in Bosnia is not the way to make Europe stable. \nThe way to make Europe stable is to help the people of Bosnia by making \nsure there is parity, by making sure that the people are able to defend \nthemselves, but not to put United States troops on the ground.\n  I am just going to end this morning by quoting from a letter that I \ngot from one of my constituents, and I think it really sums it up:\n\n       I remain to be convinced that we have a greater moral \n     obligation to the Bosnians than we do to our own soldiers and \n     their families.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a bad decision, and it is the responsibility \nof Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to say, ``No, Mr. \nPresident. Come to us. Let's discuss it before you deploy American \ntroops. Sending them to Haiti without our authorization, expanding the \nmission in Somalia without our authorization has not worked, and \nsending our troops to Bosnia without our authorization will not work.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina. \n  \n[[Page S18450]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the concurrent \nresolution offered by the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, myself, and others.\n  For the past couple of months, I have made statements on the floor \nand in hearings conducted by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nexpressing my grave concerns over the commitment that President Clinton \nmade to the Presidents of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia to deploy United \nStates military ground forces to implement and enforce a peace \nagreement to end the fighting in Bosnia.\n  I continue to have those concerns. To date, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has conducted eight hearings on the situation in Bosnia and \nthe use of United States military forces to enforce the Bosnia peace \nagreement. In testimony before the committee, administration witnesses \nand experts in the area of national security, foreign policy, and \nintelligence have stated that it is in the vital national interests of \nthe United States to deploy ground forces in Bosnia to avert a wide-\nscale war in Europe to save NATO and maintain United States leadership \nin NATO and to preserve the good word of the United States.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated before, as a superpower, I believe it \nis important for the United States to show leadership in matters of \nnational security and foreign policy. I also support NATO and do not \nwant to endanger NATO as a security organization which was largely \nsuccessful in bringing the cold war to an end.\n  I also believe that it is important to follow through with \ncommitments. However, I will not rubberstamp a decision by the \nPresident, just because he has the constitutional authority to deploy \nmilitary forces. The administration has testified that the President \nwould proceed with the deployment of United States forces to Bosnia, \nregardless of the concerns expressed by Congress.\n  Despite this testimony, I believe Congress has a constitutional \nresponsibility to review decisions of this magnitude. In the conduct of \nthat review, I have yet to be convinced by the President, the Secretary \nof Defense and the Secretary of State, that there are vital national \nsecurity interests that warrant the deployment of United States \nmilitary forces to Bosnia; or that our national security is threatened.\n  I am not convinced that the mission is clear, that the objectives of \nthe mission are achievable, or that there is a clear exit strategy.\n  I have great confidence in NATO's ability, under the operational and \ntactical control of the U.S. military, to manage the operation--more \nconfidence than I ever had in the United Nations. However, there will \nbe a number of non-NATO nations participating in the implementation \nforce, a great number of them deployed in the United States sector. \nWhile they will be under the operational control of the United States \nmilitary commanders, I have concerns about their perception or \ninterpretation of actions by the people for whom they are supposed to \nbe securing peace, and the paramilitary forces in the area who may not \nsupport the peace effort.\n  This operation is supposed to be a peacekeeping action, and at the \nsame time, a peace enforcement action, as necessary. I am concerned \nthat there is great potential for disaster, despite robust rules of \nengagement, if there is not a clear understanding among all the parties \nin the sector, as to interpretation of military action, and what \nconstitutes the use of force.\n  Further, I am not convinced that United States military forces \nparticipating in the Bosnia peace implementation force will not get \nbogged down with nonmilitary activities such as providing assistance to \ninternational organizations. From reading the I-For mission statement, \nit is quite clear to me that the mission statement is ambiguous and \nunclear. Specifically, it states that I-For will not conduct election \nsecurity, provide humanitarian assistance or conduct mine or obstacle \nclearing activities. At the same time, though, it says that members of \nI-For will assist international organizations in these activities, if \nrequested.\n  Mr. President, I supported lifting the arms embargo so that the \nBosnian Moslems could protect themselves, and so the United States \ncould avoid sending U.S. troops to Bosnia. The President and the \ninternational community repeatedly rejected the bipartisan effort to \nlift the embargo.\n  I still support the idea that a stable military balance is necessary \nto enable Bosnia to defend itself. However, now that United States \ntroops will be deployed in Bosnia, I have concerns for their safety, if \nthe United States becomes directly involved in providing equipment, \narms, training, and the logistics to the Bosnian Moslems.\n  Mr. President, regardless of the outcome of this debate, I want to \nstrongly emphasize my support for the U.S. military forces who have \nalready been deployed to Bosnia and Croatia, and who may shortly be \ndeployed to Bosnia to participate in the implementation force. I will \nbe monitoring very closely the situation in Bosnia, so that we can \nensure that our military forces can return to their families as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the concurrent \nresolution offered by Senator Hutchison, myself, and others.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, after a great deal of reflection, and with \nsome reservations, I have decided to support the President's decision \nto send United States troops to Bosnia to help enforce a peace \nsettlement. When the peace agreement was initialed in Dayton 3 weeks \nago, I wholeheartedly welcomed the peace, congratulated the \npeacemakers, but expressed my skepticism about the need for U.S. ground \ntroops to enforce that peace.\n  When President Clinton first suggested almost 2 years ago that United \nStates troops might become involved in Bosnia, I outlined my strong \nconcerns about such a course of action in a letter to the President. I \nnoted two minimum conditions that I thought should be met before we \neven considered committing troops to Bosnia. I said that the mission \nshould be a multinational one, conducted either under U.N. or NATO \nauspices, and that the United States should provide less than a \nmajority of troops to that effort. Both of those conditions have, of \ncourse, been met, but for me, that is only a starting point.\n  My qualms about sending United States troops to Bosnia stem from my \nfear that we will become stuck in a Balkans quagmire. To my mind, \nthroughout history, the Balkans have been a place of war and strife, \nand I worry about involving United States troops in conflicts that are \ncenturies old.\n  But I also have said that it was up to the President to make the case \nfor sending troops, and that I would listen with an open mind. During \nthe past 3 weeks, the President and other members of the administration \nhave put forth their case to me in private and in public, and I have \nbeen listening. I found President Clinton's address to the Nation to be \nparticularly compelling. I believe the President did an excellent job \nof laying out exactly what is at stake in Bosnia. I agree that the \nDayton Agreement, which was brokered by very talented U.S. diplomats, \noffers us the chance, as the President said ``to build a peace and stop \nthe suffering'' in the heart of Europe, which is of course very \nimportant to U.S. national security interests.\n  In that speech and in subsequent presentations, the President and \nother members of the administration have defined the limited \npeacekeeping role our troops will be asked to play. They have been \nappropriately reassuring to the families of the young men and women who \nwill be sent to Bosnia. Our troops know already that they are the \nworld's best equipped and trained fighting force. The President, in a \nclear statement to any would-be troublemakers, has stated flatly that \nour troops will be well trained, heavily armed, and ready to retaliate \nagainst any threat to their own safety.\n  While our troops will have broad discretion to respond to any \nchallenges or threats, there also will be limits on their role and \nmission in Bosnia. In a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on December 1, Secretary Christopher, Secretary Perry, and \nGeneral Shalikashvili testified that there are limits to what our \ntroops will be asked to do. The fact that there will be limits has gone \na \n\n[[Page S18451]]\nlong way in convincing me to support our President's decision. Our \ntroops are not going to fight a war, but rather to help implement a \npeace to which the parties themselves have agreed. Their objective is \nto achieve a concrete set of military goals outlined in the Military \nAnnex to the Dayton agreement. They are not, I have been reassured, \ngoing to get dragged into the conflict itself. I have also been assured \nthat our military will not be engaged in rebuilding Bosnia. That is a \nresponsibility of the parties themselves, with such civilian assistance \nfrom the international community as the Dayton Agreement provides.\n  Mr. President, I do continue to have some questions about the \nimplementation of the peace plan. While these concerns will not cause \nme to withdraw my support of the President's decision, they are \nserious.\n  First, I would like to see a more precise rendering of the \ncircumstances under which the implementation force will carry out or \nprovide direct support for such civilian tasks as creating secure \nconditions for elections, assisting humanitarian missions, preventing \ninterference with the movement of civilians, and mine clearing. General \nShalikashvili and Secretary Christopher told the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that the implementation force--or I-For--has the authority to \nengage in such activities but that this authority would be used rarely \nand at the discretion of local I-For commanders. I would hope that \nbefore the main body of troops are sent to Bosnia, we will have a \nbetter sense of the specific guidelines being given to local commanders \nabout involving I-For in these activities. Otherwise, I fear that there \nmay be an uneven enforcement of the peace plan, and more importantly, \nthat we may see mission creep develop.\n  Related to this issue is my concern that there be a strong and \neffective civilian program that will ensure that free and fair \nelections are held, refugees are resettled, and that reconstruction \nbegins. Moreover, I hope that there will be tight coordination between \nthe civilian and military aspects of the implementation program. \nAlthough I do not want to see I-For involved in the civilian aspects of \nthe peace implementation, I do, after all, want to ensure that we \nachieve the maximum progress possible on the civilian side. Without \nsuch progress, the exit strategy for our troops becomes much more murky \nand problematic. If sufficient progress is not made on elections, \nrefugees, reconstruction, and related matters by the time I-For does \nwithdraw in a year's time, I fear that there will be backsliding on the \nmilitary side and that United States troops will have done nothing more \nthan preside over a year long cease fire.\n  Finally, I hope that the administration will define more clearly how \nit hopes to achieve a military balance in Bosnia once I-For leaves. I \ndo not think anyone would quibble with the goal of achieving a balance, \nbut we need more details about how that is to come about, consistent \nwith the Dayton Accords and U.N. Security Council Resolutions.\n  To me, it is unfathomable that we would want to see more arms in that \npart of the world. Moreover, I am uneasy about any U.S. plans to arm \nand train one side--the Federation--while participating in an \nImplementation force which is supposed to be even-handed. One need only \nremember the ill-fated U.S. military involvement in Lebanon to be \nreminded of the danger of taking sides in such a situation. While it \nmight ultimately make sense for the United States to coordinate such an \neffort, for U.S. citizens--be they military personnel or private \ncontractors--to actually engage in arming and training may make our \ntroops particular targets. To this end, I welcome President Clinton's \nassurance that providing arms and training to Federation forces will \nnot be done by either I-For or U.S. military forces. Before our troops \nare sent to Bosnia, we should know definitively how we plan to proceed \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, Balkan history has been a source of my skepticism \nabout sending troops to Bosnia. I have spent long years of service in \nEurope: first as a Coast Guard lieutenant based in Sicily during World \nWar II, then as a Foreign Service officer in Prague, Bratislava, and \nGenoa as the Iron Curtain was drawn between East and West, and as an \nofficial with the International Rescue Committee working in Vienna with \nrefugees fleeing Hungary's Communist regime. Because of my experience, \nI am deeply and personally conscious of how important Europe's freedom \nand stability is to the United States. I am also acutely aware of how \nfragile the current peace engulfing most of Europe is. If left \nunchecked, the Bosnian war could threaten the peace on the rest of the \ncontinent.\n  The people of Bosnia have suffered untold misery and horrors. To \nthem, the Dayton Agreement is long-awaited and good news. For us, the \nagreement offers an historic opportunity to end Europe's worst conflict \nsince World War Two. We all hope it presages a lasting peace.\n  That is why I believe we must support the President's call to \nparticipate, with our NATO allies, in an effort to stem the tide of war \nin Bosnia.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to rise today as a cosponsor and \nstrong supporter of the Hutchison resolution. I want to commend Senator \nHutchison, Senator Inhofe, and other Senators whose outspoken and \npersuasive leadership has given us this opportunity to send a clear \nmessage to the President on the Bosnia issue.\n  Like my 28 colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution, I believe \nthe Senate must express its opposition to President Clinton's planned \ndeployment of United States ground forces to Bosnia.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues who have strong reservations about \nthe President's actions to vote for the Hutchison resolution.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am convinced that \nthis resolution is the only way to send a clear, unambiguous message to \nthe President without hurting American troops who are already on the \nground or who will be arriving imminently in Bosnia.\n  The President has failed to convince the American public of his basic \npremise--that such vital national security interests are at stake in \nBosnia that we should risk the lives of United States soldiers to \nenforce a fragile peace there. Letters and calls from my home State of \nMinnesota continue to oppose sending troops 3 to 1.\n  Unfortunately, I hold out little hope that the Hutchison resolution, \neven if it passes, will prevent United States troops from being \ndeployed to Bosnia.\n  If the President is willing to begin the Bosnia operation despite \nstrong and sustained public opposition, it is difficult to imagine that \none more vote in Congress will change his mind.\n  We all understand the President has the constitutional power to \ncommit troops without congressional approval, but a far more worrisome \nquestion is whether he should sustain this dubious military operation \nwithout a solid base of public support.\n  In 1993, during the height of the civil war in Bosnia, President \nClinton made a regrettable mistake: He pledged to commit 25,000 United \nStates ground troops to enforce any future peace agreement between the \nwarring parties in the Balkans.\n  The President made this promise without knowing the exact terms of \nthe peace agreement that would emerge, without conducting a thorough \nreview of the operation's dangers and without consulting Congress.\n  Now, he has essentially dared Congress to break his ill-considered \ncommitment of U.S. forces and thereby, he says, risk undermining the \npeace agreement, our international credibility and our relations with \nNATO allies.\n  In doing so, the President has effectively painted the American \nsoldier and Congress into an uncomfortable corner. As a result, United \nStates troops are already on the ground in the Balkans as part of \nNATO's advance force, and thousands more American soldiers will find \nthemselves in Bosnia for Christmas.\n  Moreover, the President has repeatedly blocked efforts by Congress to \nend the unjust arms embargo on the Bosnians. This embargo has prevented \nthe Bosnians from defending themselves and has encouraged continued \nSerbian aggression against their outnumbered foes.\n  Even the Clinton administration is admitting that a military balance \nbetween warring factions is the key to stability in Bosnia and the \neventual withdrawal of United States troops. \n\n[[Page S18452]]\n\n  How tragically ironic it is that the necessary outcome of NATO's \noperation in Bosnia could have been achieved without shedding American \nblood if the President had only allowed the Bosnians to arm themselves.\n  Congress should not rubber-stamp the President's premature decision. \nWe must not compound this Presidential blunder by abdicating our \ncongressional responsibility.\n  First, Congress should continue to express specific concerns about \nthe scope of the NATO mission in Bosnia. While administration officials \nhave made claims to the contrary, most Americans realize there is real \npotential for this operation to become increasingly open-ended and \ndangerous.\n  During hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of \nState Christopher said that the NATO implementation force's only \nobligation was to carry out military objectives--namely, the separation \nof Bosnia's warring parties.\n  But he also said that the peace agreement ``authorizes'' NATO forces \n``to take additional [civilian] actions if the local commander desires \nto do so.''\n  Well, undoubtedly, giving NATO forces this discretionary power to \nsupport nation-building activities will put our troops at greater risk. \nSo far, there have been many reports about the lack of coordination \namong international organizations charged with achieving civilian \nprovisions in the peace agreement. If progress is not made on these \ncivilian missions, the temptation for NATO forces to advance civilian \ngoals--such as refugee resettlement--will only increase.\n\n  In addition, without an effective exit strategy, the Bosnia \noperation's supposed 1-year time limit could evaporate. As I mentioned \nearlier, the key to an exit strategy for United States troops is the \nestablishment of a military equilibrium among the warring parties.\n  If the United States does not take a leading role in the arming and \ntraining of the Bosnians, it is very doubtful that it will be done to \nour satisfaction.\n  Opponents who claim that a strong American role in arming the \nBosnians will jeopardize the neutrality of United States troops are \nsimply deluding themselves. The Serbs never have and never will \nconsider the United States a neutral power in this arrangement. Have we \nforgotten that only months ago United States planes were bombing Serb \npositions? For the Serbs, an indirect American role in arming the \nBosnians will hardly be more reassuring than a direct one.\n  Indeed, one of my strongest concerns about the United States role in \nthis operation is that we are mistakenly assuming we will be perceived \nas neutral by all parties in Bosnia. In 1983, a similar tragic \nmiscalculation failed to prevent the deaths of 241 United States \nmarines in Lebanon.\n  Without question, the scope of the Bosnia mission must be narrowed \nand an effective exit strategy developed. For this reason, I appreciate \nwhat the majority leader and Senator McCain are trying to accomplish in \ntheir resolution and I know they are acting solely with the safety and \nwell-being of our troops in mind.\n  However, I cannot vote for the Dole resolution, which authorizes the \nPresident's deployment of United States troops to Bosnia. Given the \nmanner in which the President has chosen to pledge our soldiers' lives \nfor this peace agreement, I cannot vote to give him Congress' seal of \napproval. The President's strategy simply does not deserve it.\n  Yet, while I am not willing to acquiesce to the President's plan, I \nalso will not support cutting off funding for our troops while they are \nalready on the ground. Although this action is within the \nconstitutional powers of Congress, it would potentially endanger the \nmen and women in our Armed Forces even further.\n  We must learn from our past mistakes. We should not repeat the 1993 \ndebacle in Somalia where United States troops were actually denied the \nequipment and weapons their commanders had requested. Soon afterwards, \n18 American soldiers were killed when they were trapped during a tragic \nfirefight.\n  Therefore, the Senate's vote today on the President's plan to deploy \ntroops in Bosnia is only the beginning of Congress' obligation to our \nmen and women who serve and defend this Nation. We will closely monitor \nthe Bosnia operation to ensure that it is fully funded, that our troops \nare adequately supplied and that the mission remains strictly focused.\n  Mr. President, we owe our soldiers, their friends and family, and the \nAmerican people nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first, I want to commend my colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, from Texas, for the initiative she has taken, \naddressing what I think is one of the most critical and important \nissues the Senate will face in a long, long time. It is appropriate we \ngive proper deliberation to this issue. There really is no more \nserious, wrenching decision than one similar to what we face today, \nbecause it not only has consequences for America's role in the world, \nbut consequences for the lives of young men and women, poised at this \nvery moment for deployment in Bosnia.\n  We have two burdens in this debate. One is to exercise American \nleadership and the second is to justify American sacrifice.\n  Let me state at the beginning, I firmly believe in American \nleadership. Our active engagement in the world is an expression of our \ninterest and our values. But in exercising this leadership, I think it \nis important that we understand that justifying American sacrifice is \nthe higher and the harder and the heavier responsibility that we face \nbecause it demands not just plausible goals, but compelling reasons.\n  It is not enough to say that a questionable promise has been made, or \nthat an alliance needs to be politically repaired, or that we feel \nguilty or somehow compromised and helpless. These are factors that may \ncontribute to a case for intervention, but I do not believe they are \ndeterminative factors in terms of deciding whether or not we intervene. \nBecause, in the end, I think we have to be able to say certain things \nwith confidence, that there is no other, more viable option consistent \nwith our interests and that there is no honorable alternative to the \nrisk of American lives. This is a decision that has to be made \ndeliberately, not by default.\n  Like many of my colleagues here, I faced these questions before. I \nvoted to send United States marines to Lebanon to be a presence in a \nland that was factionalized and fractionalized like Bosnia, and I will \nalways regret that decision and that vote which resulted in the deaths \nof 241 marines who saluted smartly when ordered to what clearly, in \nretrospect, was an ill-defined mission.\n  I also voted to send American troops to the gulf to fight aggression. \nWhen America's interests are clear, as I believe they were in the gulf, \neven great sacrifice can be justified, but when America's interests and \ngoals are vague and murky and unobtainable, the loss of one life is too \nmuch.\n  In the administration's proposed police action in the Balkans, there \nare a number of operational questions, some of which I will briefly \nraise, but I want to begin by stepping back and asking some fundamental \nquestions of philosophy and strategy.\n\n  Why Bosnia? Why this region? Why this moment? It is said we have a \nmoral responsibility to end the bloodshed. But I think that goal is too \nbroad to be useful. Bosnia, unfortunately, is not unique when it comes \nto undeserved suffering. Bloody civil wars rage today in Rwanda, Sudan, \nLiberia, and other places of the world. There were far more civilians \nkilled in a year in Kabul than there were in Sarajevo.\n  So, how do we choose where American troops are used to end the \nworld's civil wars? Is that a decision made by TV news, determining \nwhich country has the most telegenic suffering? Clearly, this alone \ncannot be a sufficient basis for intervention.\n  It is said the Bosnia conflict is a direct threat to the security of \nEurope, an area where American interests are implicated. It has been \nrepeatedly stated by the administration that intervention is necessary \nto prevent the spread of the Bosnia conflict to other nations, \nincluding Hungary, Albania, even Greece, and that failure to intervene \nnow will inevitably lead to a broader conflict and a greater \ninvolvement at greater sacrifice of American troops. \n\n[[Page S18453]]\nBut I believe this to be a serious exaggeration.\n  Europe today is not the Europe of 1914, deeply factionalized and \narming for a broader war. In fact, the Balkan war has not been \nexpanding, but contracted. It is a serious crisis, but it is not an \nexpanding crisis. No European leaders are seriously convinced that the \ndominoes of France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and the rest are about to \nfall, pushed by Balkan violence.\n  It is said that our vital national interests are challenged by a \nBalkan civil war, but this is simply not credible. What resources are \nthreatened? What trade route is interrupted? What strategic military \nthreat to the United States has developed? What American citizens are \nbeing placed in danger? The term ``national interests'' cannot be \nstretched indefinitely. It must mean something or it means nothing.\n  So, it seems that we are left with one reason, one explanation why \n20,000 American troops are headed for the Balkan winter: Because the \nPresident gave his word, and we cannot go back on it. Is this what the \nadministration means by credibility? National interest is not found in \nthe Balkans themselves but found in closing a credibility gap that \nthe administration itself has opened.\n\n  Henry Kissinger summarizes this point as follows: ``The paradox of \nthe decision before Congress is that while we have no inherent national \ninterest to justify the sending of troops, a vital national interest \nhas been created by the administration's policies: If other nations,'' \nKissinger says, ``cease to believe our assurances, our capacity to \nshape events to protect American security and values will be \njeopardized.''\n  I do not want to minimize this concern. Many scholars and experts \nthat I deeply respect believe that this reason alone is sufficient to \njustify American intervention. But, if that is the case, I have two \nquestions that have yet to be answered in this regard.\n  First, how do we come to this place? Why should the world's only \nsuperpower, fresh off the success of Desert Storm, need to prove its \ncredibility in a Balkan civil war? Have we so squandered American \nleadership and credibility that now it needs to be bought back with the \npresence of American troops and the risk of American blood?\n  This brings me to my second question: Will this intervention actually \nrebuild American credibility?\n  It is possible, but only under one circumstance: The mission must be \nan obvious success. Credibility is not determined by the promises we \nkeep but by the outcome we achieve. An outcome similar to Somalia or \nLebanon would be difficult to calculate. the important questions are: \nIs this Bosnian mission likely to add to American credibility? And what \nis the prospect of success?\n  These are questions I asked in the hearing process. In several key \nareas, and I have yet to find adequate answers.\n  How can the United States remain neutral and build up the Bosnian \nArmy? Is not this logically contradictory, and inherently dangerous?\n  Though it is not entirely clear what form these arms and training \nwill take, does anyone believe that the Serbs will stand by while their \nmilitary advantage is reduced as the Bosnians arm and train with the \nbest quality arms to the best extent possible? The Dole resolution \nportion of that--and I commend Senator Dole, Senator McCain, Senator \nLieberman, and others for a well-intentioned and serious effort at \noutlining the conditions of American involvement--and much of this \nresolution contains language I can enthusiastically support, but a \nportion of it is deeply disturbing to me, particularly section (2)(b)3 \nwhich says the United States will ``lead an immediate international \neffort to provide equipment, arms, training and related logistics \nassistance of the highest possible quality to ensure that the \nfederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina provide for its own defense, \nincluding, as necessary, existing military drawdown authority.'' And on \nit goes.\n  America, in effect, will be acting as a shield while one faction in a \ncivil war aggressively arms. Taking sides in previous peacekeeping \nefforts have brought tragedy--not success. Clearly, the implementation \nagreement to an implementation of this section (2)(b)3 of the Dole-\nMcCain resolution could lead to both a mission impossible to achieve \nand potentially disastrous consequences.\n  A second question is, How certain are we that a Bosnian Moslem-Croat \nfederation is politically sustainable?\n  The Dayton agreement presupposes the survival of this fragile \nalliance--an alliance that is not even 2 years old. It was not even in \nexistence when the Bosnian conflict began. It was the Bosnian Moslems \nand the Croats that were the warring factions--the Croats on the same \nside as the Serbs, each trying to carve up Bosnia for its own benefit.\n  What we have today is a marriage of convenience between some very \nreluctant partners. Are we going to stake American credibility on the \nassumption that eventually these uncomfortable allies will continue to \nenjoy each other's company? Henry Kissinger has cautioned that, ``It is \nnaive to expect the Croat-Moslem marriage of convenience to last \nindefinitely.'' He argues that the relationship is more of a time bomb \nthan a permanent political identity.\n  A third question: What exactly is our mission, and how will we define \nsuccess?\n  The President believes our mission is to supervise the separation of \nthe forces and to give the parties confidence that each side will live \nup to their agreements. He wants the U.S. military to serve in this \ncapacity for 1 year in order to ``break the cycle of violence.''\n\n  The most clear portion of the proposed mission is keeping the warring \nfactions separated. That will not be easy. But at least its \neffectiveness can be measured, and I think it can be accomplished. I \nargue, however, that it is a mission that should not be necessary if, \nin fact, there is a real peace agreement reached.\n  But the second component of the President's mission statement, that \nof ``giving the parties the confidence that each side will live up to \ntheir agreements,'' is dangerously unclear. These confidence-building \nmeasures include establishing the foundation for economic, social, and \npolitical reconstruction in the region. But, as I just previously \nstated, it is the explicitly stated but not agreed to by the parties to \nthis agreement, it is that explicitly stated mission of arming and \ntraining one side in what I believe to be a civil war that is most \ndisturbing to me.\n  I have struggled to understand this. I have struggled to find answers \nto these questions. I have struggled to find agreement with this so \nthat I could support the Dole-McCain resolution. But I cannot resolve \nin my mind what I believe to be an inherent contradiction between a \nstated, written, agreed-to-by-all-parties portion of this Dayton peace \nagreement that calls for disarming of the parties, an achievement of a \nmilitary balance, and the contradictory goal of immediately leading an \neffort to ensure arms and training to one faction of the three warring \nparties.\n  This militarization--not demilitarization--inevitably will lead to an \narms race and, I believe, will inevitably lead to a failure of mission. \nAnd that failure of mission then squanders the last opportunity to \nestablish or regain American credibility.\n  I ask the question I asked before. Have we since the gulf war so \nsquandered American leadership and credibility that now we must regain \nit by engaging in a civil war in the Balkans at great risk of loss of \nAmerican lives and at great risk of squandering future American \ncredibility?\n  All these problems conspire to create a very difficult situation. We \nhave staked our credibility on one outcome in the Balkans--peace. But \nthat is the outcome that is the least likely of the many possibilities. \nOn the one side, we have the evidence of 600 years of bitter conflict \nand, more recently, 34 broken cease-fires. On the other, we have the \ndesperate hope that all the participants will show good will and good \nsense. I trust and pray that they will. That would be contradictory \nto 600 years of history.\n\n  The problem here is simple. Our credibility is at sake, but we do not \ncontrol the outcome. Our success or failure will be determined by the \nparties and factions that have demonstrated that they cannot control \nthemselves.\n  If, at the end of 12 months, there is chaos in the Balkans, the \npressure on American credibility will be even \n\n[[Page S18454]]\ngreater than it is today. We will have invested American lives, \nAmerican resources, and American leadership. So then how can we walk \naway at that moment with our leadership enhanced? Will there not be \ninevitable pressure to expand our efforts, to extend them?\n  Jeanne Kirkpatrick has commented that ``failure to provide ground \ntroops might do superficial damage to America's credibility, but \ncommitting troops and failing to achieve our goal would do major damage \nto America's credibility--really major damage. It is not possible to \ncontemplate the damage to America's credibility that would result,'' \nshe said.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that this Bosnian crisis is a symptom \nof a deeper foreign policy crisis, the evidence of a basic \nmisunderstanding of what it means to be a superpower. The will to \nintervene, to spend lives and money, is a limited resource of any \nnation. It must be carefully preserved for essential missions that \nconcern our vital interests and maintains stability in the world.\n  Endless and pointless interventions squander that limited resource of \nnational will. It is precisely because we cannot be isolationists that \nwe must be deliberate and realistic in our actions. It is because \nintervention must remain an option of American policy that our \ninterventions must be wise. In Bosnia, discretion is wisdom.\n\n  This does not mean America should be and can be indifferent about \nsituations like the Balkans, but it does mean we should consider other \noptions--alternatives to ground forces--in conflicts where our \ninterests are not directly engaged. One of those options available to a \nsuperpower is to lead our allies instead of following them. \nUnfortunately, that course has not been taken.\n  Gen. John Shalikashvili has conceded that ``from a purely military \nstandpoint'' the West Europeans could undertake the Bosnian mission on \ntheir own. They have chosen not to do so. Rather, they have insisted \nthat America make a symbolic commitment--not so symbolic when you \nconsider it is 20,000 troops--to the extension of an unwise NATO policy \nof peace enforcement among ancient enemies. It is not the kind of \nmission for which American troops are trained or suited. It is a \nmission much closer to the British in Belfast than the Americans in the \ngulf war, and it is clearly not a mission to be achieved in 12 months. \nI am deeply troubled that American lives should be sacrificed to prove \nloyalty to an organization--NATO--that America should be leading, not \nfollowing it into mistakes that can be reliably predicted by our \nexperience in Lebanon and Somalia.\n  Once these troops are placed in the field--and they are being placed \nnow--I will do everything in my power to assure that they succeed. But \nI cannot accept the responsibility of voting to place them there in the \nfirst place simply for the purpose of preserving U.S. credibility. It \nwill do nothing in the long run for American credibility to follow our \nallies into this misguided deployment.\n  I will reluctantly be opposing the Dole resolution for reasons that I \nhave stated and supporting the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution that we will \nbe voting on shortly today.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, and others for \ntheir efforts in attempting to address what I think is an \nextraordinarily difficult situation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, throughout the Bosnian conflict, I have \nhad grave reservations about the involvement of American ground troops \nin that troubled region. After the President made his speech on \nNovember 27, 1995, I continued to have serious concerns, because I felt \nthat U.S. ground troops should not be involved in such a violent area \nthat should be, primarily, a European responsibility.\n  Following his speech, I expressed these concerns in view of the \nfragility of the tentative Dayton peace agreement and the prospects for \nsimilarities to our peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon. I recalled the \nchanges of attitude on the part of Congress and the public when the \ndisastrous consequences in Beirut and Somalia unfolded on the nightly \nnews.\n  Over the last several days, I have immersed myself in a study and \nevaluation of our present posture regarding the situation in Bosnia. I \nhave listened and talked to military, political and foreign policy \nleaders, Members of Congress, and individuals in other related fields \nas well.\n  First, let me say that I hope during this debate over our role in \nBosnia, we will rethink America's role as the sole remaining superpower \nand its participation in foreign disputes. We must recognize that other \ncountries will want to use our military and financial resources to \nsolve problems that basically they should remedy themselves. In my \nopinion, there should be less military involvement by the United \nStates, as well as reduced foreign financial assistance, unless there \nis a vital U.S. interest involved. Furthermore, this need for \nrethinking is augmented by the movement to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Having said that, I want to share some of the thoughts that have \nentered my mind after reflection and discussions.\n  Like most Americans, I am thankful that a cease-fire and hopefully an \neffective Bosnia peace agreement has been reached between all of the \nwarring factions in this long-standing conflict. I pray that the cease-\nfire holds, that the agreement succeeds, and that the Bosnians can live \nin peace. We have watched for nearly 5 years as these neighbors have \ncruelly and methodically torn each other apart.\n  On the surface at least, the Dayton agreement does hold promise for \npeace. It allows the thousands of refugees, theoretically at least, to \nreturn to their homes; it removes the foreign ``holy warriors'' from \nBosnia; it withdraws heavy weapons; it preserves the October 5 cease-\nfire; and hopefully, it will stop the genocide and other atrocities \nthat have plagued that part of Europe for far too long.\n  My primary concern with the agreement and the NATO mission it calls \nfor is the requirement of having to send American ground forces to \nimplement its provisions. This should be, essentially, a European \nmission. The use of air power on the part of the United States was very \neffective. That was, I believe, the extent to which most Americans \nexpected U.S. forces to be involved. Perhaps this was then and is now \nthe appropriate extent of our involvement.\n  NATO is probably the only military force that can be counted upon to \ndo the job of peace implementation in Bosnia. The NATO air strikes, \nwhich were largely responsible for forcing the warring parties to the \nnegotiating table in Dayton, were proof positive of their \neffectiveness. The strikes also proved that the Serbs do respond to the \npower of military might. Still, the mission in Bosnia seems to go \nbeyond the defensive purpose for which the alliance was established \nnearly 50 years ago, and might set a dangerous precedent for NATO. If \nNATO's role is to be different from its treaty responsibilities, it \nshould be tailored on an ad hoc basis to limit U.S. participation in \nwhat are primarily European internal problems.\n  Throughout this debate the question arises, ``Is it in the vital \nnational interest of the United States to become involved in Bosnia?'' \nThe term ``vital national interest,'' however, seems to mean different \nthings to different people. I would therefore like to take a moment to \nreflect on my idea of a vital national interest and how it differs from \nother interests our Nation may have.\n  A vital national interest is one that a country considers to be \ncrucial to its national security. These are issues that are so \nimportant they are not open to compromise or negotiation. A country has \nno choice but to risk war to protect a vital national interest. With a \nmajor interest, on the other hand, the country is not at immediate \nrisk. Instead, a decision must be made as to whether the use of force \nis justified. The use of the military is a question of risks, benefits, \ncapabilities, and, in this case in particular, conscience.\n  Applying these definitions, it is questionable whether participation \nin Bosnia is a vital national interest of the United States. Some have \nstated their belief that the Bosnian conflict could spill across \nnational boundaries and engulf Europe in bloodshed. They \n\n[[Page S18455]]\nuse our vital national interest of a stable Europe to justify action in \nBosnia. We have, however, effectively managed to prevent the spread of \nthis conflict for nearly 5 years without committing ground troops to \nthe region.\n  We must also remember the peace keeping mission in Beirut, Lebanon. \nMany argued back in 1983 that if we did not end the fighting in \nLebanon, it would soon spill across the borders and the entire Middle \nEast would be at war. However, our national interest was in a stable \nMiddle East, not necessarily a stable Lebanon. After we pulled out our \nmarines, we rightly redoubled our efforts on preventing the war from \nspreading across the borders to Israel and Syria.\n  Another problem we faced in Lebanon and may face in Bosnia is our \napparent lack of neutrality. It is essential that peacekeepers \nenforcing an agreement or cease-fire not take sides. Yet in Beirut, we \nbombed and shelled the Syrian-backed forces in support of the Lebanese \nArmy and Christian militia. This lack of neutrality made our men \ntargets and led to the fatal bombing of the Marine compound.\n\n  In the present situation, United States planes have bombed numerous \ntargets in Bosnia and killed hundreds of Serbs. Do we believe the \nfriends, comrades, and commanders of these dead men view the Americans \nas neutral? And if we begin to arm the Moslems to achieve military \nbalance among the three parties, will any Serbs view us as neutral? If \nany of the warring parties become convinced that the Americans are \ntheir enemy, it could mean real trouble, not the least of which could \ncome in the form of terrorist attacks similar to Beirut in 1983.\n  There are other problems to consider as well, such as the divided \nfeelings among the Serbs themselves about the Dayton agreement; \ndivisions among the Croats and Moslems; the remaining residuals of the \npresence of foreign ``holy warriors''; the millions of land mines; \nprobably unfriendly or hostile police forces; and the lifting of the \narms embargo after 6 months.\n  Having outlined some of my reservations about this operation, we have \nto be realistic. Some of our troops are already in Bosnia. The \nremainder of the 20,000 have been committed and will soon be there. \nFurthermore, the constitutionally-suspect War Powers Act allows the \nPresident to deploy troops for 60 days without congressional approval. \nIt is also highly unlikely that Congress will vote to cut off funding \nat any time during the mission.\n  There is no Member of this body who does not support our troops when \nthey are put in harm's way. While we might disagree over strategy or \nwhether or not to support the peace plan itself, on the matter of \nsupporting our troops, we do not differ. Since their deployment to \nBosnia is a matter-of-fact, our task as Members of Congress, then, is \nto see that they have every possible means to succeed from weaponry to \nintelligence.\n  Another point to be raised is whether a failure to support the \nmission at this point will in some ways undermine the forces sent to \nBosnia. This is a real possibility, since those rogue elements who may \nnot believe that we are united on this issue, or that we are looking \nfor an excuse to withdraw, could cause much greater danger to our \ntroops.\n  While the impact of our vote on our troops is of paramount \nimportance, there are a number of other issues that we must take into \naccount as well. For instance, we must consider the constitutional role \nof the Commander in Chief and the War Powers Act; the respect we have \nfor the military professionals; the constitutional roles of both \nCongress and the Executive; and the credibility of the United States.\n  Our decision must take into account the constitutional role of the \nCommander in Chief. Even strong opponents of the mission concede that \nthe President has the power to deploy troops with or without the \nconsent of Congress. The War Powers Act allows him to deploy troops for \n60 days without congressional authorization. No President, however, has \never acknowledged the constitutionality of the War Powers Act, and it \nhas never been invoked by Congress. Since it is constitutionally \nsuspect, in all reality, the only way for Congress to stop the \ndeployment is to stop funding. Otherwise, a constitutional crisis could \nbe precipitated, with Congress invoking the act and the two branches \nending up in court while troops are in the field.\n  Our decision should also take into account the great professionalism \nof the military. In my discussions with military leaders, I have been \nreassured of the fact that we do have the most highly skilled, \neducated, and trained military in our history. I am confident that if \nwe give them every means necessary to succeed, they will succeed. While \nmistakes and unforeseen circumstances may arise, there is no reason to \ndoubt their bravery, dedication, or professionalism in carrying out \ntheir task.\n  The respective constitutional roles of both the Congress and the \nexecutive branch should also influence our thinking here. The President \nis the Commander in Chief and head of state. The Congress has the power \nof the purse, the power to declare war, and the role of approving \ntreaties and ambassadors. But we must be realistic. The President is \nsupported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon, the CIA and other \nrelated security agencies, and the State Department. He therefore has, \nat least in terms of numbers and experience, superior resources than \nthe Congress in deciding the feasibility of committing military forces. \nThis reality must be taken into account. However, this is not to say \nthat Congress does not have independent, knowledgeable resources and a \nrole to play in such a decision.\n  I also believe that the credibility of the United States is on the \nline in this situation, and we should carefully consider what would \nhappen if we do not live up to the commitments made by the head of \nstate, even if we disagree with those commitments. We only have one \nPresident, who is also the head of state, and he speaks for the country \non matters of foreign policy. I fear that our credibility will be \nseriously damaged if we fail to support the mission. Such a vote will \nnot prevent a deployment, but it will, however, send a message to the \nfactions in Bosnia and to our allies and enemies as well. Without \nabdicating the role of the Congress, it is crucial that we give the \nPresident some degree of flexibility in conducting foreign affairs.\n  Finally, there is certainly a moral dimension to this issue. During \nour history, whether we were facing fascism or communism, we fought \nknowing our cause was just and that America was in the right. Our \nconviction that we were right was strong because we were certain that \nfascism and communism were wrong.\n  Mr. President, we all know that ethnic cleansing is wrong. We all \nknow rape is wrong. We all know that murder is wrong. And without a \ndoubt we all know that genocide is wrong and a great evil. It is a \nwrong so great that it shocks our humanity and lets our conscience know \nthat it is right to take action.\n  The intense debate and congressional action regarding the Persian \nGulf War was proof that even a deeply divided Nation and Senate will \nrally around a cause once a decision has been made. The vote to \nauthorize the use of military force was 52 in favor and 47 against.\n  Yet, 5 days later, on January 17, 1991, the Senate voted 98 to 0 in \nfavor of a resolution which commended and supported the efforts and \nleadership of the President as Commander in Chief in the Persian Gulf \nhostilities and expressed unequivocal support of the men and women of \nthe United States Armed Forces. I remember many Senators who had voted \nagainst the authorization of force saying before that vote in which we \nsupported our Commander in Chief, that no one should doubt that the \nSenate and the Nation would be united once the authorization had been \napproved. I hope the same will be true once the votes have been cast \nwith regard to the Bosnian troop deployment.\n  For the reasons I have stated and to demonstrate United States \nresolve and, most importantly, to give our American troops every means \nof success, I will support the deployment of America's military might \nto Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose sending American troops to \nBosnia. The Dole resolution asks us to agree to, support, and expand \nthe mission that the President has subscribed to in Bosnia. I intend to \noppose that \n\n[[Page S18456]]\nresolution because I think that the President's mission is deeply \nflawed. I think we are making a mistake, and I intend to make it very \nclear that I oppose the policy we have undertaken with respect to \nBosnia.\n  What we are being asked to support is the sending of American troops \ninto the line of fire as a buffer force between two warring factions \nwhich have broken every cease-fire and violated every treaty over the \npast 500 years.\n  Historically, in our country, we have set high standards for sending \nAmericans into harm's way. Each of us has set standards a little \ndifferently, but in general, we have all tried to ask ourselves, ``Do \nwe have a vital national security interest?''\n  Our President has, for 3 years, tried to make the case that we have a \nvital national security interest in Bosnia. I submit that the President \nhas failed, not because he is not a great salesman, but because he has \nno product to sell.\n  What is happening in Bosnia is terrible. Many Members of the Senate \nhave been to the Bosnian region. Every American has seen on television \nwhat is happening there and we are all outraged about it. But when you \nget down to the bottom line, whether we have a vital national security \ninterest in Bosnia, the answer is clearly no.\n  It seems to me the second question we have to ask ourselves is, \n``Will our intervention be decisive in promoting the objectives we \nseek?''\n  It is one thing to have good intentions and pure motives, but it is \nanother thing to have a plan that would allow you to put those good \nintentions and pure motives into force.\n  I see no evidence, whatsoever, to substantiate the claim that our \nintervention, as a buffer force between warring factions in Bosnia, is \ngoing to be decisive in promoting the objective we seek. I have always \ntried to apply a third test in committing Americans to combat and \nharm's way, a test which has come about in my own mind because I \nrepresent a large State of over 18 million people. Texas has a lot of \npeople in uniform; many people born in other parts of the country have \nbeen stationed in Texas at one time or another, and, for myriad \nreasons, have become citizens of my State.\n  So when Americans died in the Persian Gulf and when Americans died in \nSomalia, Texans died. I was called upon to console the parents and \nspouses of Texans who had made the supreme sacrifice for our country. \nAs a result of this experience, I have concluded that there is one \nadditional question that I need to ask myself before committing \nAmericans to combat and before putting Americans in harm's way. This \ntest goes beyond whether or not we have a vital national interest and \nit goes beyond the question ``Will our intervention be decisive in \npromoting our interest?'' This test concerns my two college-aged sons \nand it asks ``Am I so convinced that we have a vital national security \ninterest in Bosnia, and do I have strong enough belief that our \nintervention will be decisive in promoting those interests that I would \nbe willing to send one of my own sons?''\n  Until I can answer that question with a very decisive yes, I cannot \nfeel comfortable in sending someone else's son and someone else's \ndaughter.\n  We are told by the President that if we do not send troops to Bosnia, \nthat we are going to undermine NATO. I submit, Mr. President, that this \nis an absurd notion. NATO is a defensive alliance. NATO was established \nin Western Europe to keep Ivan back from the gate, to keep the Soviet \nempire out of Western Europe. NATO has been one of the most successful \nalliances in history, but never, ever--not when NATO was established, \nand not to this point in its functioning--have we viewed NATO as an \nalliance which should intervene in civil wars. I submit that this is a \nchange in the mission of NATO. To claim that a defensive security \nalliance will be undercut if the United States of America does not \nintervene in a civil war, simply has no merit and no justification. I \nam also very concerned about the Dole resolution. I am concerned about \nthe fact that in the initial presentation, the President argued that we \nwould be part of a NATO force that, on a neutral basis, would be a \nbuffer between warring factions. My concern, under these initial \ncircumstances, was that the cease-fire would not hold--every other \ncease-fire in recent history has not held--or that the peace agreement \nwould be broken, something which has happened consistently for over 500 \nyears.\n  The Dole resolution only increases my concerns by injecting a new \nelement into the mix. Since the President has no exit strategy, and \nsince the President's plan is very specific as to how we get into \nBosnia but not very specific as to how we get out, the Dole resolution \nimposes an exit strategy by having the United States of America take \nsides in this conflict, by having us arm and train one of the warring \nfactions. I submit, Mr. President, that if we take sides in this \nconflict, any protection in neutrality that our troops might have had \nwill be lost. If there were to be any security in neutrality for our \ntroops, then agreeing to take sides in the conflict, by arming and \ntraining one side, can only serve to further endanger American lives.\n  Paradoxically, if we were debating not to intervene in Bosnia in a \npeacekeeping role, but rather to be part of an effort to try to bring a \nbalance in military power by lifting the arms embargo, by bringing the \nleadership of the Bosnian army to Germany to be trained by Americans, \nand to have an international effort to supply arms, in all probability \nI would be supportive of that proposal. But when we take on the role of \na neutral peacekeeper, by the very nature of that role, we eliminate \nour capacity to take sides in the conflict, to be a source of weapons, \nor to be a source of training. I understand the desire to find an exit \nstrategy, but, quite frankly, I believe the Dole resolution takes a \nflawed policy and goes one step further by making it more flawed. I \nintend to vote against the Dole resolution.\n  Let me raise a concern that I have thought about now since Somalia, \nand I raise it because, by going back to Somalia, I can divorce this \nissue from partisanship since it was President Bush who sent troops to \nSomalia. We could get into an argument about how he sent them there in \none role and President Clinton used them in another role, but that is a \nsubtle argument that I am not interested in.\n  I am very concerned about the fact that we are setting American \nforeign policy by channel surfing. I am very concerned about the fact \nthat we went to Somalia for one, and only one, reason, and that was \nbecause the suffering and misery in Somalia was on television. Similar \npictures could have been shown from a dozen other spots on the planet, \nbut when one network decided to highlight Somalia, and when the public \nsaw these pictures politicians in Washington responded by establishing \na policy to intervene.\n  I submit that you cannot, and should not, run our Nation's foreign \npolicy as if it were social work. You cannot always be looking for some \ngood to do around the world. We, even as powerful as we are, and even \nas the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, \ncannot fix everything that is broken. We cannot right every wrong. We \ncannot take unto ourselves the mission of seeking out all human \nsuffering or all injustice on the planet, with the goal that we, \nthrough our power, should solve these problems. Quite frankly, we have \na lot of problems of our own; we have a lot of human suffering in our \nown country. But I believe that we made a mistake in Somalia, and I \nbelieve that we are making a mistake in Bosnia.\n  I think in conducting foreign policy, you have to define your vital \nnational security interests first. Then when something in the world \nthreatens those predefined national security interests, you can \ndetermine whether or not, given your abilities, you can be decisive in \nprotecting these interests. I think in the Persian Gulf the answer was, \nyes; our vital national interests were threatened. We had a military \ndictator who was developing, as we now know and have convincing \nevidence of, both chemical and nuclear weapons. His invasion of a \nneighboring country threatened the whole Middle East, it threatened \nSaudi Arabia, and threatened our ally, Israel. We had a vital national \nsecurity interest in the Persian Gulf, and we had the capacity, through \nour intervention, to be decisive in promoting that interest. This, \nhowever, is not the case in Bosnia. \n\n[[Page S18457]]\n\n  I am very alarmed about this new approach--which is the foundation of \nforeign policy in the Clinton administration--of viewing foreign policy \nas simply an extension of social work.\n  One final point on this subject. The cold war is over. We are \ndebating the powers of the President to use American military power \naround the world. Virtually everyone in this body has served in the \nCongress during a period where we were in a life or death struggle. \nSome of our Members served, not here, but in the service of the \ncountry, when that enemy was fascism. Every Member, except the newest \nMembers here, has served in the Congress when we were in a life-and-\ndeath twilight struggle with world communism. While that struggle was \nunderway, either against fascism or communism, American intervention \naround the world as a way of promoting our national interests was the \nmost successful policy of this century--it won the cold war. Under \nthose circumstances, when Ivan was literally at the gate, it made sense \nto give the President the benefit of the doubt. As a result, we have \nall conditioned our foreign policy thinking in terms like \n``partisanship ends at the water's edge.''\n  I submit that this conditioning of our thoughts comes from an era \nthat no longer exists. It was from an era when there was a worldwide \nstruggle for survival underway. I submit that this sort of logic does \nnot apply in this case. Why should the President have more benefit of \nthe doubt while engaging in police activity in Bosnia than he has while \nengaging in police activity in Cleveland, OH?\n  I submit that there is no reason to give the President this \nadditional benefit of the doubt. But even if one did, there is no \nevidence to substantiate the belief that we have a vital national \ninterest at stake nor that our intervention can be decisive in \npromoting this interest. I am very concerned that, unless we are very \nlucky, the outcome of this intervention might simply be to add American \nnames to a casualty list, but not to end the tragedy that we all want \nto see ended.\n  I am going to vote against the Dole resolution. I am going to vote \nfor the Hutchison resolution, and I am going to vote for the resolution \ndenying funds for the deployment of troops to Bosnia. I believe that we \nmust take the strongest stand possible. I believe that the current plan \nis a mistake and that it is not a logical way to promote American \ninterests. I do not want to send troops to Bosnia. I know they are \ngoing and I understand that the votes are here to assure that the \nPresident is going to not only be able to send troops to Bosnia, but \nalso is going to be able to cloak himself in congressional support.\n  But I want to make it very clear. I do not support this policy. Since \nstopping funding is the only way to prevent the troops from being sent, \nI will vote to stop funding. There are those who will say, ``Well, \nthen, are you not supporting the troops?'' The answer to this is that I \nam not concerned about the troops doing their job--I know they can and \nwill do what they are ordered to do. I am concerned about the U.S. \nCongress doing its job. I know that our warriors will do their duty and \nI know they will serve proudly. I know that if this mission can be made \nto work then they will make it work. I know that every Member of the \nSenate and every Member of the House will be supportive of our troops, \nand I know we will give them the supplies, the weapons, and the support \nthey need. But knowing all of this does not mean that this is not a bad \ndecision which should not be undertaken. I oppose the deployment, and I \nintend to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the legislation before us concerns one of \nthe most important issues the Senate ever considers--whether to send \nAmerican servicemen and women into danger. The decision to send \nAmerican troops on this military peace operation is a huge \nresponsibility, and we must weigh it with the greatest care and \ncaution.\n  President Clinton has demonstrated impressive leadership in achieving \nthe Bosnian peace agreement, to be signed tomorrow in Paris. The United \nStates troops being sent to Bosnia are going there to help implement \nthat peace plan. Because of U.S. leadership so far, they are not going \nthere to fight a war--there is no longer a war to fight. And with U.S. \nleadership in the year ahead, there is a good chance the war will never \nresume.\n  Everything depends on the parties' own commitment to peace. We have \ngiven that question very careful consideration in our Armed Services \nCommittee hearings in recent weeks, as well as in consultations with \nSecretary of Defense Perry, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Shalikashvili, and Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke.\n  Secretary Perry and Ambassador Holbrooke made very clear that the \nparties initialed the Dayton peace agreement and will sign the Paris \npeace agreement because they are tired of war, not because the United \nStates or anyone else imposed it upon them. The parties met \npainstakingly for 21 days and nights in Dayton and reached a landmark \naccord to end the 4-year-long war that has plagued all of Bosnia and \ndestroyed much of that country.\n  President Clinton is now sending United States troops to Bosnia to \nhelp all sides implement the peace agreement. Without American \nleadership, there would have been no agreement, and without American \ntroops to implement the agreement, there will be no peace.\n  The role of United States forces in Bosnia serves American interests \nin several ways. Most important, this mission is the only real chance \nto achieve peace in Bosnia. That peace is essential to prevent a wider \nwar in Europe; a wider war would inevitably involve the United States \nand with vastly greater risk of casualties. Twice in this century, tens \nof thousands of Americans have lost their lives in world wars that \ndestroyed much of Europe. Containing such wars before they spiral out \nof control will save future American lives.\n  Sending United States troops to Bosnia will also serve the American \ngoal of ending the massacres, ending the ethnic cleansing, and ending \nall the other atrocities that have claimed a quarter million lives in \nthis war and driven 2 million more people from their homes.\n  The United States cannot be the world's policeman, and this \ndeployment does not make us one. But our country was founded on respect \nfor human rights, and on a responsibility to help those in need where \nwe can. In this case, we can stand up for those principles by ending a \nwar and helping a war-ravaged nation heal itself.\n  It is also in the U.S. national interest for NATO to succeed in this \nmission. This is a clear test-case for NATO. This alliance, created \nduring the cold war to meet cold war threats, faces the massive \nchallenge of reshaping itself to deal with security threats in the \npost-cold-war era. Meeting the challenge of Bosnia, using military \nforces to enforce a peace in a local conflict that threatens to \nescalate into a wider war, is the type of threat that NATO must be able \nto meet. If the alliance fails the test, it may well not survive. \nSurely, no one can deny that the vitality of NATO is in America's \nnational interest.\n  Many of us had hoped that the U.N. peacekeeping force could have \ndealt with this conflict and produced a lasting peace, but that was not \npossible. Cease-fires came and went--the only certainty was that the \nwar always resumed.\n  Now, the United States and NATO face this challenge. NATO air \nstrikes, led by the United States, were the key factor in producing the \nmost recent cease-fire, and NATO forces, led by the United States, will \nbe the key factor in keeping that peace and giving it the chance it \nneeds to take root in the hard, bitter, blood-stained fields of Bosnia.\n  This is no Gulf of Tonkin resolution blank-check commitment. The \nmilitary mission is limited and achievable. The United States and NATO \nare not assuming open-ended responsibility for peace in Bosnia. That is \nvery important. The mission of the U.S. and NATO forces is to give the \npeople of that divided nation new breathing room, not more breathing \nroom to implement a specific peace plan. There is no commitment by the \nUnited States or NATO to nation building or to provide a long-run \nguarantee of peace. President Clinton has made clear that \n\n[[Page S18458]]\nif the war resumes, he will withdraw our forces. He has also placed an \napproximate 12-month deadline on our troops' stay in Bosnia.\n  The war in Bosnia went on too long. The United Nations, the United \nStates and our allies in Europe made many mistakes along the way. The \nwar claimed too many lives, and it often threatened to spread to other \nnations. But now that all sides in Bosnia have chosen peace themselves, \nthe United States is in a position to lead NATO and over 25 nations \nfrom around the globe, including Russia, in an unprecedented effort \nthat is also a limited but clearly needed effort to continue the peace \nand give it time to stick.\n  We all recognize that the mission may fail to achieve a lasting \npeace. But the real failure would be not to try.\n  I commend President Clinton for his leadership. I commend our brave \nmen and women going to Bosnia to serve American interests and American \nideals. We stand behind them, and we wish them a safe and successful \nmission.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I begin by thanking Senator Hutchison and others who are leading the \neffort on the amendment regarding the disapproval of the deployment of \nUnited States ground troops to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Mr. President, on today's local NBC-TV news, it was just simply \nstated that there would be Senate debate today on Bosnia and that there \nwould be a vote. But then the newscaster said, ``But the President does \nnot need congressional approval. The troops are already committed.'' \nThis statement was made as if it is a simple matter of fact. More \naccurately stated, as if it is an undisputed point of law rather than \nthe subject of what I believe to be one of the oldest and most \nimportant debates in our country's history: The question of whether the \nPresident can deploy troops without congressional approval.\n  I, and several other Members of the body, have said that we do not \nagree with this notion and that Congress must--must--approve such \ndeployment, whether it be under article I of the Constitution's war-\nmaking powers or under the War Powers Resolution or under a more \ngeneral notion of the checks and balances between the Congress and \nExecutive.\n  In any event, Mr. President, it is obvious that this institution, \nthis Senate, does not have the will to challenge decades of executive \naggrandizement of congressional war powers. This is only the last and \nmost recent chapter of that syndrome. It is certainly not only the act \nof President Clinton. It has been the act of Presidents of both parties \never since World War II.\n  So it is with disappointment in, what I consider to be, the falseness \nof this process that I rise to support the only amendment that allows \nsome semblance of what I believe to be Congress' role in this process, \nand that is to approve or disapprove the sending of tens of thousands \nof troops into what is indisputably harm's way.\n  This notion that Congress has to approve a deployment is not \nsomething in my imagination or just a relic of America's past. It is \none of the most important opinions that has been expressed throughout \nAmerican history. I first ran into it as a high school student, when we \nwere involved--in fact, trapped--in the Vietnam war. During my \nundergraduate years, I followed the debate and passage of the War \nPowers Act which was designed because of that crisis. I remember well, \nwhen I was a little younger, hearing about the very few Senators--a \nprecious few Senators--who stood up and questioned the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution. Of course, it was that resolution which let us slip into \nthe quagmire that became known as Vietnam.\n  But my views on this are not just a throwback to Vietnam or the Gulf \nof Tonkin resolution, although I think appropriate parallels can be \nmade between how we got into Vietnam and what is happening here with \nregard to Bosnia. There are several recent serious efforts to look at \nthe role of Congress vis-a-vis the Executive in deploying troops. I am \nspecifically thinking of two which were published this year. In his \n1995 book ``Presidential Power,'' Louis Fisher carefully documents the \nconstitutional role of Congress. Mr. Fisher dedicates the book to the \nrepublican principle that warmaking is reserved for the legislature, \nand says ``this definition of Executive power''--meaning the prevailing \nview that seems to dominate our proceedings now--``this definition of \nExecutive power, to send troops anywhere in the world whenever the \nPresident likes, would have astonished the framers of the \nConstitution.''\n  ``It would have astonished the framers of the Constitution.'' Mr. \nPresident, it astonishes me today. I fear it is completely out of sync \nwith our national interests, our international interests, and our \ncapacity to make decisions as a nation in this post-cold-war world.\n  In another book published just this year entitled ``A Culture of \nDifference; Congress' Failure of Leadership in Foreign Policy'' by \nStephen Weissman, it says: ``It is not too much to say that Congress \nhas substantially ceded its fundamental constitutional role in foreign \npolicy.''\n  As a Senator and as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and as a believer in Congress' role in the constitutional \nsystem, it is painful to hear that kind of assessment in 1995. But even \nmore painful is to see this acquiescence and timidity played out in the \ncontext of Bosnia.\n  Late yesterday afternoon, the debate on various resolutions of \nsupport for and opposition to the deployment in Bosnia really began. \nUnfortunately, the resolution of authorization I would have hoped to \nhave voted on will not be presented. In any case, the debate began \nyesterday afternoon and will conclude later today, with three votes, \nleaving essentially just 1 day of debate on a subject involving the \nsending of upward of 20,000 U.S. troops, or perhaps more, into harm's \nway.\n  Earlier this year, we spent a month out here on the balanced budget \namendment, and I think it was well worth the effort. But just 1 day or \n1\\1/2\\ day on the commitment of U.S. ground troops seems to me to be \ninsufficient.\n  I have listened to just about all of the statements that several \nSenators have made since last night, either here or on the television. \nWhen I was listening, I heard mostly Republican Senators speaking in \nopposition to the deployment. And, although I do not agree with the \nconclusions, I was especially interested and impressed with the remarks \nof the Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen. I appreciated several things \nhe said.\n\n  The first point he made is that President Clinton is not doing this \nfor political reasons; that President Clinton is sincere in his \nmotives. I believe that, too. I believe he is doing this, not to get \nvotes, but because he believes it is the right thing to do. It is \nessential that we say that because there are those--including people \nwho agree with me on this issue--who have suggested otherwise. I \nstrongly believe the President, in his heart, believes this is the \nright thing to do, and that's why he's doing it.\n  I also appreciate what the Senator from Maine said, in candor, about \nthe importance of the debate about constitutional power. He said it is \nimportant to resolve the issue of what is the role of Congress and what \nis the role of the Executive in deploying troops overseas. But then he \nquickly conceded that it is not going to be resolved on this one.\n  Do you know what, Mr. President? I have been here 3 years and we have \nalready struggled with troop deployments in Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and \nBosnia. That is an awful lot of intervention in just a few years when \nwe do not even have an enemy like the Soviet Union threatening us. Yet \non each occasion I have heard Senators say, ``We have to do something \nabout this, but it is not going to be resolved on this one.''\n  To refer to Senator Cohen's statements again, I want to echo his \nobservation that what is at stake here is not really just that the \nPresident has tried to assert warmaking powers. The fact is, Congress \nhas not done its job of using our power either as an institution, as \nthe U.S. Congress, to exert our war powers. In fact, Senator Cohen used \nthe phrase from the law, ``possession is 90 percent of ownership,'' \nwhich, in effect, means you have to use the power or it goes away.\n  I remember a scene from the television show ``Dallas,'' years ago, \nportraying a much more mundane expression of this same concept. It was \nthe episode where the senior Ewing, Jock, \n\n[[Page S18459]]\nwas confronting his son, Bobby, who was complaining about his brother \nJ.R. Ewing taking control of the oil company. Bobby said, ``Daddy, you \ngave me the oil company.'' But Jock said, ``Son, nobody can give you \nreal power. You have to take it.''\n  That is what Congress must do with regard to the war power: it must \ntake the powers that the framers intended for it and use them. Here we \nhave allowed the President of the United States to commit 20,000 or \n25,000 troops without even having a binding vote on it.\n  What do the Members of the Senate who support the deployment say? \nThey say, ``The President should not have done it, but it is too late. \nHe is the President. War Powers Act does not work.'' Even more \npuzzling, I've heard, ``We have to get this thing done today because \nthe peace treaty will be signed tomorrow.'' These are the excuses that \nare being used for not exercising our constitutional role of approving \nor disapproving this action.\n  We have been presented a fait accompli, a done deal. As was said by \nseveral Republican members at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing last week, this is really a situation where we are being asked \nto participate in what is a pseudo-decisionmaking process, where the \ndecision was already made a long time ago in the back rooms of the \nWhite House and within NATO, and maybe even in some of the back rooms \nof this building. That does not take away from the sincerity of the \npeople who came to such understandings, but it does represent an \naffront to Congress. In effect, the Senate, in its constitutional role, \nis being co-opted here. The fix has been in for a long time.\n  Again, it is not really just the President's fault. It is Congress' \nfailure to challenge and insist on a procedure whereby there is a true, \norganized debate, involving public participation, and culminating in a \nvote that the public will understand to mean that if we say it is a \ngood thing to do, it will happen, and if we say it is not a good thing \nto do, at least there will be a serious consideration on the part of \nthe Executive that it should not go forward.\n  But that is not what we have here. Senator Cohen pointed out, the \nExecutive should seek a real vote on this mission, if for no other \nreason than the President and all of us may need--down the road as this \noperation goes forward and the going gets tough--we may need that \nunderstanding and public support which cannot be generated in this \ncontext.\n  That is why I introduced, on October 20, Senate Resolution 187. It \nsimply says, ``It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should vote \non a measure regarding deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in the Republic \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina as a part of the implementation force as part \nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization prior to the United States \nentering into a commitment to carry out such deployment.'' That is the \nsort of resolution that I would have hoped would have gone through this \nbody before the treaty was signed.\n  Another step we should have taken was to lift the UN arms embargo \nagainst the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I was the first Member \nof the 103d Congress, as a new freshman Senator, to introduce a \nresolution calling for lifting the arms embargo. I am certainly not the \nonly one who has advocated that, but I was involved early on, and was \npleased to work with Senator Dole who played a great leadership role \nlater on.\n  But I must say, for the leader of this body to suggest that the \nPresident failed to lift the arms embargo and that Congress did \neverything it could do is false. We voted to lift the arms embargo, on \nS. 21, on July 26, by a vote of 69 to 29; theoretically veto proof. I \nknow the President might have called a few of us and tried to get his \nnumbers up, but where was the attempt to override this veto on the \nfloor of the Senate?\n  Where was Congress in saying we will exert our role and--although we \nmust defer to the President on foreign policy, in many cases--where \nwere we to say that this one was different? Instead, I feel some of the \nleadership is trying to have it both ways, saying we do not want to \nconfront the President, and that we support him; saying we support the \ntroops, but we did not support the deployment. This is a masterful way \nto try to have it all ways. I think Senator Brown had it right last \nnight. The more truthful characterization of what is going on here is \nwe are ducking our responsibility. I am very concerned about the \nprocess. Mr. President, assuming the vote today really was going to \ndecide whether these troops are going to go or not, I'd like to address \nthe merits, briefly, because I know many other Senators wish to speak. \nI believe that the United States has a very important interest in \nEurope--very important. But I am not convinced that we need United \nStates ground troops in Bosnia to protect those interests for us or for \nEurope. I think the European countries certainly could provide all the \nground troops in this case.\n  The list of issues and concerns about this operation are a mile long, \nwhether it be the commitment of troops for just 1 year, or the \nchallenges of the terrain, or to tie in the rationality of this \napproach with the discrepancy between the arms of the different sides. \nThey are all important issues that have been raised. But, to me, to \njust come on the floor of the Senate and hear people say it is all \nabout U.S. leadership or European stability, really does not tell me \nanything. I am not sure what those terms mean in the post-cold-war era. \nWhy cannot the U.S. leadership in this context be defined as air power, \nnaval power, intelligence, resources? Why does the definition \ninherently have to include the deployment of ground troops? I do not \nthink ground force is inherent in the term ``leadership,'' especially \nfor a country that has shown such leadership already and will continue \nto show leadership throughout the world.\n  In my mind, ground troops indicate an ultimate physical threat to the \nUnited States. What is the ultimate physical threat to the United \nStates that requires the sacrifice of American lives in this case? Is \nit a threat to Europe? Is it refugees on our doorstep? Is it just the \npictures on CNN? I will show you pictures from Liberia, Angola, and \nEast Timor and they are the same or worse. There is a very strong \njustification to stop the horror in those places as well with American \ntroops.\n  When we look to our European allies in this case, I am not sure \nwhether this is a question of whether we are leading. I am not so sure \nwe are not just being led when it comes to being forced to put our \nground troops in to the tune of a third of the I-FoR forces. As far as \nI understand, the possibility of not committing U.S. troops was not \neven seriously discussed during the negotiations in Dayton.\n  Again, we have to be cautious about analogies. People ask me if this \nis like the Persian Gulf or Vietnam. I want to be careful, but I guess \nI would have to say it is a lot more like Vietnam than the Persian \nGulf.\n  Senator Smith spoke last night, as a Vietnam veteran, about the \njustification for the process of the Vietnamization in Vietnam, and \nmade the parallel that much of the language and things being discussed \nfor the Bosnia mission are not unlike the extremely unsuccessful effort \nwith the Vietnamization of South Vietnam during the Vietnam war. We \nmust learn the lessons of history. I think there are very serious \nlessons from that quagmire.\n  Also, how does this effort fit in with our main goal of this Congress \nto balance the budget? We are having a terrible time trying to prevent \nsevere damage to our important domestic programs and to balance the \nbudget. Yet we have already had a $7 billion expense on the Bosnia \ndeal--$7 billion, I say, because the President was determined to veto \nthe defense appropriations increase of $7 billion until this proposal \ncame down the road. I call that $7 billion the opening ante in Bosnia. \nI think it is going to cost a lot more.\n  Mr. President, I also worry about whether or not this intervention \nwould have so much support if we still had the draft. I have always \nbelieved that it was good to have a volunteer Army, but I remember the \nVietnam era, and I remember the people from all classes of society and \nall backgrounds who started to question the war because everybody's kid \ncould possibly go to Vietnam. That is not what is going on here.\n  Have we thought about the economic status, the racial status, the \nethnic \n\n[[Page S18460]]\nstatus of the people who are more likely than others to die in Bosnia? \nIt worries me. It worries me that we are not learning these lessons of \nhistory from that period either.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think we have to ask the question in the \npost-cold-war era: What are the limits of American power? We are the \nmost powerful country in the world, and we certainly want to stay \nthere. But there are limits.\n  I remember the discussion years ago of the danger that we may try to \ncreate or enforce a Pax Americana, as Rome tried to do with a Pax \nRomana. Rome became overextended and ultimately could not withstand the \nstrain on their own internal well-being.\n  I think this action--which, to me, is the first step toward our \nattempting to police the world--threatens our own national security. We \nneed a new foreign policy that reflects post-cold-war realities, \nincluding our vital interests and our domestic needs.\n  Mr. President, I finish by simply saying that in addition to the fact \nthat we are not following a constitutional procedure which could \nstrengthen us in this kind of commitment, by not avoiding the \ndeployment of ground troops we also run the risk of sapping America's \nstrength from within.\n  So, regretfully, I have to oppose the President on this, which means \nI will support the Hutchison amendment, and oppose the Dole resolution \nin support of the deployment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, earlier this week we had a debate on \nwhat it means to support the flag. Now we are voting to stand behind \nthat flag--and that means voting to support our troops.\n  No American ever wants to send our troops into harms way. Certainly \nno one wants to do this days before Christmas.\n  All over this country, and as our troops are doing abroad, families \nare planning for the happiest time of the year. They are visiting \nfamily, trimming trees, and singing Christmas carols.\n  But instead, as for our troops in Germany, they are planning to spend \na year away from loved ones. And they are preparing for the risks that \nare part of any military mission.\n  After consultation with the President, the Vice President, the Vice \nPresident, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and our \nambassador to the United Nations. And after prayerful reflection--I am \nvoting to do just that.\n  Why? Because after 4 bloody years, the people of Bosnia have decided \nto give peace a chance. Only NATO can enforce this peace. But without \nthe United States, NATO cannot and will not enforce the peace.\n  The fighting will continue. The savagery could continue. Mass murders \nand rapes could continue, and ethnic cleansing will continue unless \nNATO and the United States involvement takes place. Older people and \nchildren will continue to be pushed from their homes, but lights will \ngo out once again in Sarajevo, and the lights will go out for any \npeace, or any possibility of peace.\n  But even as I say this, I want to speak directly, if I can, to the \ntroops and to their families. I want them to know that I would not \nsupport this vote unless there was a specific, focused, and limited \nmission. Over and over again at every meeting I have spoken out for the \nfact that there must be clear criteria for going in and clear criteria \nfor getting out.\n  Those are the questions that I asked the President and the Vice \nPresident--not what will send our troops there, but what will bring \nthem back home. They gave me these following answers, and I shared this \nwith the military, with our troops, and I share this with the families \nall over the United States of America who are watching what I think is \na debate of great stability.\n  What we have been told--and I believe--is that the U.S. military, \nfirst of all, will only go if all sides agree to abide by the peace \nagreement. No peace agreement, no troops. No peace agreement, no \ntroops. When our troops go, it is to create the climate for the \nBosnians, all parties in Bosnia will take hold and make peace among \nthemselves. We are to create the framework and the climate. If that \ndissolves, we are going to pull out.\n  Our troops will have these criteria for leaving as soon as the \nfollowing things are accomplished: The cessation of hostilities; \ncreation of a zone of separation; and the return by the Bosnians of the \nSerbian-Croatian troops and weapons to their home bases.\n  You, our men and women of the military, will be there to enforce the \npeace, not to rebuild Bosnia. But while you are enforcing the peace, \nthe international community will provide humanitarian aid, resettle \nrefugees, oversee elections, and also that there needs to be a military \nbalance created between the Bosnians and the Serbs.\n  I would not vote to send those troops unless I was assured that they \nhad received excellent training, the best equipment in the world, the \nbest technology to find landmines and the right to use every means \npossible to defend themselves, and also that they would serve under an \nAmerican commander.\n  To our troops, I want to say, you will not be alone. Over 25 nations \nwill participate. They will be sharing the burden also of the risk as \nwell as the financial one. Our oldest NATO allies, England and France, \nas well as new democracies like Poland, will be there-- the countries \nthat you helped liberate by winning the cold war. The Congress must \nback you. I believe that Congress will back you. And I know as always \nthe American people will support you.\n\n  I would not vote to send you if your mission was not essential and \nhonorable. Your mission is essential because without you, there will \nnot be peace or stability in Europe. Without you, NATO, the world's \nstrongest military alliance, would be destroyed. Without you, I am \nconcerned the war in Europe might spread to Macedonia and Albania. It \ncould bring Greece and Turkey into this situation.\n  Your mission is honorable because you are crucial to stopping the \nbloodshed in Bosnia. The people of Bosnia have endured misery, \nsuffering, and brutality; 250,000 people died in this war. Families and \ncommunities, cities have been ravaged. Children were killed as they \nplayed. Old people were killed as they shopped for food. Hospitals were \nattacked as they tried to care for the wounded. War crimes that remind \nus of the Second World War were committed. We are asking you not to do \nthis for some abstraction like NATO or Bosnia. Actually, we are asking \nyou to do this for the people of Bosnia, for families that are just \nlike yours, for children just like yours, for a child that I met named \nZlata, a 9-year-old girl who keeps a diary and speaks to the world. \nThey call her the Anne Frank of Sarajevo. Because of you, she will have \na far better fate than Anne Frank endured. She is a child who tried to \ntell the world the suffering the war has caused and a child we hope we \nkeep in our mind as we go forth in this mission.\n  So to you, the American troops, while you train for war, you will be \nthere to enforce the peace. The American people greatly appreciate you \nand are grateful for your heroic sacrifice. We thank you for taking the \nrisk so that others could have the opportunity to give peace a chance. \nWe thank you for being there when you are needed. I say to you as we \nvote on this, may the grace of God be with you and protect you as you \ngo forward to protect us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Congress will respond today to President \nClinton's decision to deploy United States troops in the former \nYugoslavia as part of the Bosnia peace accord that was negotiated and \ninitialed in Dayton, OH, and which will soon be signed in Paris.\n  President Clinton has articulated his policy to all of us, to the \ncitizens of this country, and has now requested congressional support. \nYet even as our troops are headed to Bosnia, the President has, in my \nopinion, failed to supply a defined goal or mission, strategy for \nachieving the goal, an exit strategy and/or the national and security \ninterests of our country.\n  The President has raised three concerns to justify U.S. participation \nin implementing the peace accord: The potential spread of conflict \nthroughout Europe, our leadership in NATO and international \ncommunities, and the need to end the carnage in the Balkans.\n  I do not question the concerns raised by our Commander in Chief. All \nof \n\n[[Page S18461]]\nthem have some degree of legitimacy. Mr. President, we would all like \nto respond to what we will refer to as the moral imperative President \nClinton and others continue to emphasize as it relates to the \ndevastation and the human suffering that has gone on in the Balkans and \nhas left us all a tremendous feeling of frustration to which many \nSenators, including myself, have come to the floor of this Senate over \nthe last 3 years to speak.\n  These feelings are not new. Four years ago, I was contacted by a \nCroatian-American constituent of mine when the conflict first raged \nbetween the Serbs and Croatians. This gentleman is a friend who was \nconcerned, maintaining contact with my office, and his fears and \nfrustrations were all very real to me, as all of us have experienced \nthat with some of our constituents.\n  The moral imperative existed then. However, then, like now, our \noptions for involvement, in my opinion, were very limited, and we still \nface the fundamental difficulty of trying to make the peace a greater \nvictory than winning the war. While we all understand and agree with \nthe moral imperative, we have yet to hear why this action would serve \nour national interests and our security needs.\n  I have listened to the President's proposal as presented by his \nrepresentatives, and I have listened to my fellow Idahoans. I have read \nand I have reviewed the agreement and the proposed deployment. My \nconclusion is this: the answers I have been seeking such as defined \ngoal, exit strategy, national security interests, have not been \nsatisfied--not just to this Senator but to the American people.\n\n  Therefore, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Inhofe, and others, in offering an amendment to oppose this \nPresident's actions. Let me be clear, Mr. President, so that there is \nno effort to cloud what is being debated here. I oppose the President's \ndecision to deploy our troops. I will, however, as I always have, \nsupport our troops if they are ordered by our Commander in Chief to \nimplement a Bosnian peace agreement. I will not allow our brave men and \nwomen to become pawns in what I believe is rapidly becoming a high-\nstakes political game.\n  I find it ironic that as the Senate prepares to vote on United States \nground forces in Bosnia, the Serbians there will be exercising their \nown voice as they have been in an unofficial referendum to vote on the \npeace agreement. I also find it ironic that we in the Senate conclude a \nhistoric vote on protecting the honor and the sanctity of our national \nsymbol, the United States flag, while it is being trampled, torn and \nburned in the streets where our soldiers will be sent to make the \npeace. I think this Senate and this Congress has to explain to the \nAmerican people why they cannot express a clear and strong opposition \nto our President.\n  The debate on the President's plan to deploy U.S. troops as \npeacekeepers to Bosnia is not a new debate but the continuation of a \nlong and ongoing one over the President's desire to deploy ground \nforces in the Balkans. The Congress has spoken in opposition to this \nidea in the past, and I hope we will speak clearly on this issue again \ntoday. That argument is one that must be clarified for the American \npeople.\n  I know of no other time when my constituents in Idaho have spoken \nmore clearly to me.\n  Last weekend as I walked across the Boise airport, a crowd gathered \naround me as one man reached out and grabbed hold of my arm and said, \n``Senator, I have to talk to you for a moment. You,'' he said, meaning \nme, ``cannot allow this President to put our young men and women at \nrisk when there is no defined need to lose human life. We are not at \nrisk nor is our security.''\n  While this man and others in that crowd were clearly concerned about \nthe loss of human life in the former Yugoslavia, they could not justify \nthe spilling of American blood to stabilize that situation when this \nCongress stood on an arms embargo and tried to express our will, and \nthis President refused; and we refused as a nation then to allow that \nkind of equity to exist.\n  The more I review the information on the agreement in the proposed \npeace mission, the stronger my concerns have become. As part of this \nagreement, our President, our Commander in Chief, will be deploying \nU.S. troops into extremely rugged terrain during the middle of what \nappears to be a very severe winter. In addition to poor conditions and \nfreezing temperatures, there is the problem of about 3 million land \nmines that exist within the sector assigned to the American forces.\n  Mr. President, as my fellow Idahoans and I know, winter in the \nmountains can be demanding at best. The area where our troops will be \nis like an area in Idaho that we call Stanley. And I will tell you that \nin Stanley, ID, in December and January, if you are living in a tent, \nyou are challenged as would be the most extremely capable survivalist. \nAnd that does not include the snipers, the civil disorder, or the land \nmines. I suggest that we are sending our troops into a most difficult \nsituation.\n  During the December 1 hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, even the Secretary of Defense, William Perry, underlined the \ndifficulties facing our troops. In addition to the snipers and the \ncivil disorder, they include extreme elements of undisciplined militia \nand the hostiles that are there.\n  The dissatisfaction of some Serbian factions should not be taken \nlightly. There is a strong likelihood that our troops will be \nchallenged, even attacked, in carrying out their mission of peace. How \nin that effort can it be called peace other than engaging us in an \nongoing war? Yet we are continually told that our men and women are not \ngoing to fight a war, they are simply going to keep a peace.\n  In these conditions, Mr. President, the lines are so gray that they \nare no longer discernible. I believe this President cannot clarify \nthem, nor can he define them. I have opposed the use of ground forces \nin Bosnia in the past. And I will continue to oppose that policy today.\n  It is most frustrating that the use of American ground troops is not \nthe only option at hand. I am frustrated that the President has refused \nto lift what I viewed was an illegal arms embargo on Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. I have strongly supported the efforts of the majority \nleader and others in a very strong bipartisan voice on this floor to \npursue the best policy options in a difficult situation. And one of the \nbest policy options was to lift the illegal arms embargo on Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. It would not have caused us to take sides. It would have \nsimply allowed fair play and the right of self-defense in those \ncircumstances.\n  The last vote on this issue occurred as recently as July of this \nyear. At that time, Mr. President, I asked how many bills will be \npassed, how many U.N. resolutions presented, how many cease-fire \nagreements will be broken before the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nwill be allowed to stand against their aggressors and defend \nthemselves?\n  Mr. President, there is ample reason to question the enforcement of \nthe 1991 embargo against Bosnia in the first place. The embargo was not \nimposed on Bosnia, because Bosnia did not exist in 1991. Rather, it was \nimposed on Yugoslavia. In addition, enforcement of this embargo could \narguably violate Bosnia's right to self-defense under article 51 of the \nU.N. Charter.\n  Many Americans hoped that the passage of S. 21 would end the arms \nembargo and finally allow the Bosnian Moslems the right of self-\ndefense. With rough parity in this conflict that might have happened, a \nlasting peace agreement would be far more likely than the kind that we \nare stumbling into. Instead, we have a very unequal situation going \ninto the implementation phase of a peace agreement that at best could \nerupt into major fighting with our forces being squarely in the middle \nof it all.\n  Mr. President, I will just add, the United States did not need to do \nanything. Well, I think that is not true. We have done a great deal in \nthe past 3 years. We have provided the support, the air cover, the \nnaval logistics, all that we needed to do as a participating member of \nNATO.\n  It is now time for us to define much more clearly our role in foreign \npolicy around the world. I would suggest to this President that every \ntime we are called upon or led into a skirmish, deployment of our \nground troops are not necessarily a demonstration of leadership. To \nlead means to try to solve it \n\n[[Page S18462]]\nby alternative means. In this instance, I think the President has \nfailed, and in failing, he risks now the loss of American life in a \nvery tragic situation.\n  So I hope that we could support a strong voice today. I think the \nAmerican people expect us to lead on these issues. I think they expect \nus to speak out as strongly as we can. And I hope that we can oppose \ntoday, with our vote, the President's deployment of United States \nground forces in the former Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, later today the President of the United States will \nleave for Paris to participate in a historic event, the signing of an \nagreement which will open the door to peace in the Balkans. Think about \nit, Mr. President.\n  The year 1995. Think about the conflict in the Balkans that marked \nthe beginning of this century and how it was left to run wild, leading \nto World War I and in some ways leading to the imbalance and \nincompletion of that war that ultimately led to World War II.\n  The year 1995. Conflict breaks out in the Balkans, and today the \nPresident of the United States is leaving for Paris to participate in \nthe signing of an agreement which opens the door to peace in the \nBalkans, which implements, as my friend and colleague from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, has said and hopefully will say again, some basic \ntenets of international law.\n  Mr. President, much has been said in the last month about the role \nthe United States played, first, in bringing the parties to the \nnegotiating table, and second, in hammering out a complicated agreement \nwhich all the warring parties would be willing to sign and, most \nimportantly, would be willing to live with. Much has also been said \nabout the role the United States must continue to play if this \nagreement is going to have a chance of bringing the benefits of peace \nto the people of Bosnia, stability to Europe, and increased security to \nthe world.\n  So, Mr. President, I would say that this is another one of those \nhistoric days in the life of the U.S. Senate. It is one of those \ndefining moments in our history. Most of us in the Senate today faced a \nsimilar situation on January 12, 1991, when we stood to vote for or \nagainst authorizing President Bush to use American military forces in a \nwar in the Persian Gulf. That situation in fact was very different from \nthe situation we face today.\n  There, on January 12, 1991, the President had already committed a \nhalf million American military personnel to the gulf region, within \nrange of Iraqi Scuds. There the war the President was about to engage \nin would find American forces facing a dug-in, fortified Iraqi force, \nfighting a war. And casualty estimates stated on this floor and \nelsewhere went as high as the thousands.\n  Here we are being asked to support, not a war, not to send our troops \ninto war, but to send them on a mission of peace, to implement and \nmonitor the peace that the parties to the war want as opposed to \nfighting as we did in the gulf war an untractable, unyielding enemy.\n  And remember, though the forces that fought in Desert Storm were \ninternational, they were primarily American. Here, on this peacekeeping \nmission, two-thirds of the implementation force will be non-American; \none-third will be American.\n  Many of my colleagues believed that the best course of action in the \nearly days of 1991 was to allow economic sanctions to continue to bite \nat Saddam and so did not vote for the authorizing resolution which \nSenator Warner and I offered.\n  I understand the sincerity of that position. But the Senate did \nsupport President Bush on January 12 and voted 52 to 47 for Senate \nJoint Resolution 2 which stated, and I quote:\n\n       The President is authorized . . . to use United States \n     Armed Forces. . . .\n\n  While 47 Members of this body did not vote for that resolution, let \nus not forget that when the President exercised this authority and \nordered Desert Storm to begin, every Senator, and I daresay every \nAmerican, supported our troops and the President of the United States. \nAnd I hope and sincerely believe this will be the conclusion of our \ndiscussions and deliberations and votes this week with regard to the \nmission our troops are going to carry out in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, the debate we have heard over the past days and weeks \nhas been a good one, a thorough one, a sincere one. We have had \nnumerous opportunities, as Members of the Senate, to hear directly from \nthe President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nPresident's National Security Adviser, Ambassador Holbrooke who \nnegotiated the agreement, and a variety of former Government officials, \nacademics, and thinkers.\n  The administration has, in my view, gone to extraordinary lengths \nthroughout the negotiations and afterward to consult with Congress and \nto provide us ample opportunity to ask questions and to express our \nviews. And so we find ourselves now, in the week when the Dayton \nagreement is to be signed by the warring parties. In the days following \nthe signing, U.S. forces and those of our allies in NATO and 16 other \nnon-NATO countries will move into the region to implement the peace \nwhich has been agreed to.\n  These forces go not to impose a peace on unwilling participants, they \ngo because the parties to the conflict asked them to go. They go \nbecause the world community, acting as a result of American leadership \nand through the mighty force of NATO, finally struck from the air to \nbring some pain to the aggressors, aided by an increasingly strong \nground force of the federation of Bosnians and Croatians.\n  Our troops will go because the parties to the conflict are fed up \nwith the killing and slaughter, the deprivation and denial of their \nright to live in peace and civility, and they have asked us to come in \nand give them a chance to make this peace work.\n  They have asked us to come in, in the case of the Serbs, because of \nthe effectiveness of the economic sanctions the world community imposed \non the government in Belgrade and on the former Yugoslavia, on Serbia \nand Montenegro. That is a point worth noting. People criticize economic \nsanctions and say they are irrelevant, they are useless, they are \nwrong. They worked here. That, as much as the failure, the increasing \nopposition that Serbian forces were facing in Bosnia certainly brought \nMr. Milosevic to the peace table.\n  Mr. President, we have been briefed on the missions which our \nmilitary forces will perform. We have reviewed the rules of engagement \nwhich will be followed by our forces. We have seen the nature of the \nforce which we will be sending to the region. And we can conclude with \nsome confidence from all of this that the highly trained, heavily armed \nprofessional force of volunteer soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nwe are sending will be able to do their assigned military missions \nwithin a reasonable time, and they will carry out this operation \nsuccessfully.\n  The operation is not without risk. No one in the administration has \nsaid otherwise. None of us who support the deployment of American \ntroops to Bosnia to implement this peace has said otherwise. No one in \nthis administration or this Congress is eager to send our forces to a \nplace where some of these brave young men and women might be injured \nor, God forbid, killed. But I believe that with their training, the \nbest in the world, their professionalism, the finest in the world, \ntheir sense of service and duty which impelled them to volunteer, their \nnumbers and composition, the limited scope of their mission, the \nflexibility and robustness of their rules of engagement--which \nbasically means that if these troops are threatened in any way, they \nwill respond with overwhelming force.\n  Remember what happened in Haiti when American troops there were \nchallenged at that police station. They responded with overwhelming \nforce and were essentially never challenged again in Haiti. All of this \nprovides as much safety as one can hope for when a military force is \ndeployed to what was, until recently, a combat zone.\n  Of course, all Americans will be praying for the safety of our forces \nin the days and months ahead. All of us will understand and empathize \nwith them and their families as they see Christmas, Hanukkah, and New \nYear's come \n\n[[Page S18463]]\nand go separated from their loved ones and their friends. But these \nconcerns, as real and deep as they are, are not sufficient reason to \ndecide not to send our military to perform this important mission: To \nbring peace to Bosnia, to bring a greater level of assurance that there \nwill be stability in Europe and in the former Soviet Union, to revive \nNATO, to reestablish at an ever higher level the strength and \nleadership of the United States of America.\n  For the first time in nearly 4 years, the people of Bosnia--who have \nengaged the minds and hearts of every one of us in this Chamber as we \nwatched their suffering, as we watched them be the victims of \naggression and genocide--for the first time in nearly 4 years, these \npeople in Bosnia can see a ray of hope for their future, they can \npicture a day without running from snipers or praying that mortar \nrounds do not land in the marketplace while they are shopping with \ntheir children, or land on the snowy hills where their children go to \nsled and to act like children rather than targets for the irresponsible \ncowards who have fired on them now for 3 or 4 years.\n  Mr. President, we do not have the luxury of turning back the clock to \na time when we might have done something other than sending our troops \nto serve on the ground as peacekeepers in Bosnia. As you know, in the \npast 4 years, I have spoken on the floor numerous times, joining with \ncolleagues of both parties, in calling for a lifting of the arms \nembargo which was immoral, as the Senator from Idaho said before me. It \nwas immoral, it was illegal, it was outrageous to deny a people the \nright they are given under the U.N. Charter, let alone and what might \nbe referred to as natural law, to defend themselves and their families \nand their country.\n  So I, and others here, finally a strong bipartisan majority, called \nfor a lifting of the arms embargo against the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and the conduct of airstrikes by NATO forces, to try to \ncreate some balance of force on the ground, to try to deter the \naggressors, those who were committing genocide.\n  Finally, this summer, thanks in large measure to American leadership \nafter the fall of Srebrenica which led to a slaughter of thousands of \nmen and boys buried in mass graves, finally NATO struck at the Bosnian \nSerb aggressors from the air.\n  I will not go into all the what ifs which fill the minds of many of \nus.\n  I wish we had followed a strategy of lift and strike long ago. Had we \ndone so, there might well have been an end to the killing before now. \nBut let me say, Mr. President, in supporting the lift and strike \nstrategy, I never thought it was a substitute for an ultimate \npeacekeeping force. At its best, I believed that the lift and strike \nstrategy would create that balance of force on the ground that would \nbring the parties to the peace table--exactly what has happened now. I \nbelieve if we had implemented that policy earlier, we would have \nbrought them to the peace table earlier because we would have removed \nfrom the aggressors, particularly, the motivation to continue to fight. \nBut I have always felt that when they got to the peace table, if they \ncould agree on the peace, there would be a need for an international \npeacekeeping force. That is where we are now.\n  Mr. President, it was important to many of us that on the day after \nthe Dayton agreement was signed, the United Nations acted with the \nforce of international law to lift the arms embargo--the goal so many \nof us in this Chamber had for so many years. In some ways, I regret \nthat in the excitement over the Dayton agreement, and the questions \nraised about it, that extraordinary act did not receive sufficient \nattention and appreciation. The fact is that we have acted now. Thanks \nto American leadership, the parties came to the negotiating table and \nagreed to an extensive peace treaty; and tomorrow they will sign that \ntreaty in Paris.\n  We have brought the parties this far. It is American leadership, \njoined with our allies in NATO and Europe, and impelled by the will of \nthe combatants in the field themselves that have brought us this far. \nWe cannot abandon these people or the cause of peace now. Nor can we \nabandon our allies in NATO who are sending their forces in to implement \nthis agreement.\n  The President made it clear that he is prepared to send our forces, \nwith or without the support of Congress, just as President Bush \ncorrectly made clear in 1990 and 1991 that he would send the United \nStates' forces to the gulf war, even if Congress did not support his \nefforts. You come to a point where decisions and judgments of this kind \ncannot be made by 535 Members of Congress. That is what we elect \nPresidents for. In this case, I think President Clinton has \ndemonstrated the leadership and courage we expect of our Presidents, \njust as President Bush before him did in the gulf war.\n  When we speak of defining moments in history, post-cold war, this \ndecision will stand alongside the decision in the gulf war, as a marker \nas to where we would go and the extent to which the forces of Western \ncivilization--particularly regarding Europe--were joined together to \nstop conflict and deter war.\n  Now it is this Senate's turn to demonstrate courage and leadership. \nNow it is this Senate's turn to support, in very clear terms, both the \nAmerican troops, who will be on the ground, and the policy which has, \nat last, brought us to the point where the Bosnian Prime Minister Haris \nSilajdzic, could tell me last week when he was in Washington, ``We are \nan inch from peace. Do not abandon us now when we are this close.''\n  So, Mr. President, we have three choices before us. First is the \nresolution that comes from the House, which would effectively cut off \nfunding for any peacekeeping operation by American forces in Bosnia.\n  Second, we have the amendment cosponsored by the Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Oklahoma, which supports the troops but opposes \nthe mission.\n  Third, we have what is now described as the Dole-McCain resolution, \noffered by the distinguished majority leader and the Senator from \nArizona--but I am sure it will be a bipartisan resolution when it comes \nto a vote--which offers support for the mission and the troops, the \nsupport contingent on terms that are stated in the resolution that the \nPresident has agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about the language of the \nresolution offered by Senator Hutchison and Senator Inhofe, which \n``opposes President Clinton's decision to deploy United States military \nground forces.'' Yet, it says that ``the Congress strongly supports the \nUnited States military personnel who may be ordered by the President to \nimplement the General Framework Agreement.''\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere belief--and I say this with the \ngreatest regard for my colleagues who are sponsoring this resolution--\nthat we cannot support the troops and oppose their mission. I remember \nthe words from the Bible, ``For if the sound of the trumpet be \nuncertain, who will follow into battle?''\n  Mr. President, the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, with all respect, \nsounds a very weak and uncertain trumpet. Of course, we support our \ntroops. No one ever doubted that. But how can we claim to both support \nthe troops and oppose the mission? How would we feel if we were in \nuniform, heading to Bosnia, and the Congress of the United States says, \n``Well, we are behind you, folks, but we do not support your mission\"? \nI would not feel secure. I would not feel I had the support that I \nwould want to have for my country going into a peacekeeping mission in \na potentially dangerous zone, which the Commander in Chief has decided \nto send me into. I would want to see a closing of ranks in the same way \nthat occurred at the time of the gulf war, to receive strong support, \nthe kind of support that is involved and stated in the Dole-McCain \nresolution.\n  The Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, in my opinion, sends a muddled \nmessage to every one of our troops, to their loved ones back home and, \nmost worrisome, to those in Bosnia who would like to see this framework \nwrecked by keeping the United States and NATO forces out of Bosnia.\n  To say that this Congress opposes the decision, the mission to deploy \nour forces, tells the war criminals in Pale and the rogues and \nterrorists in Bosnia who do not want peace and want the United States \nand the international implementation force out of Bosnia, that they can \nwork their mischief \n\n[[Page S18464]]\nagainst American forces, and because this Congress does not support the \nmission, this Congress may well pull the rug out from under the \nPresident and the troops and try to force him to withdraw those forces \nif damage is done to the troops by these rogue elements in Bosnia.\n  I am very concerned about this possibility. I know it is not the \nintention of the sponsors of the resolution. But, frankly, I do not see \nhow we can have it both ways. I do not see how we can support the \ntroops and say we are supporting them if we so clearly oppose their \nmission.\n  The Dole-McCain resolution offers a very thoughtful and credible \nalternative. It is not, to put it succinctly, a statement of \nunconditional support for the decision the President has made, but it \nis support for the mission. As one of the witnesses before our Senate \nArmed Services Committee said last week, the question now is not \nwhether the commitment to send American forces to be part of this \ninternational implementation force should have been made--that is \nhistory and is done--the question now is whether we will honor that \ncommitment, and that is what the Dole-McCain resolution offers us the \nopportunity to do. Many of my colleagues have come to the floor in \nrecent weeks and spoken of their concerns about the danger associated \nwith the terrorist, rogue, unreconciled Bosnian Serb groups and what \nharm they may do to our forces. But why, then, would we want to do \nanything which will give them hope that they can sabotage this peace \neffort of which American forces are so critical a part? This is a time \nto close ranks. This is a time to go back to the great moments in our \nhistory--obviously through the world wars, but then afterward as well.\n\n  We associate the ultimate in this with the Truman-Vandenberg \nrelationship, but it has happened throughout the cold war and continued \nthrough Operation Desert Storm. To close ranks, to honor the commitment \nthat is made, understanding, as the Dole-McCain resolution says \nclearly, that it is in the interests of the United States to preserve \nAmerican credibility, that it is, in the words of this resolution, a \nstrategic interest.\n  In that regard, I was very honored to receive yesterday a letter, \nwhich I suspect many of my other colleagues received, from retired Gen. \nAndrew Goodpaster, a former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, \nrespected soldier, statesman, and patriot. General Goodpaster signed \nthe letter on behalf of five other retired general flag officers: Gen. \nMichael Davison, Gen. Walter Kerwin, Gen. William Smith, Adm. Harry \nTrain, and Lt. General William McCaffrey.\n  Here is a sentence from that letter from General Goodpaster and the \nothers:\n\n       As you consider our country's involvement in Bosnia, we \n     encourage you to send a message to our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen and Marines wherever they may be . . . [and to all \n     others as well] that our country is giving them its full \n     backing . . .\n\n  But listen to the final words of this sentence. Not just full \nbacking--\n\n       . . . its full backing in the accomplishment of their \n     assigned mission. We believe it is time to close ranks, \n     support our troops in the field, and concentrate on helping \n     them do their job in the best possible way.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of this letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for all these reasons I will vote \nagainst the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do \nso as well. Frankly, if people oppose this mission I think the choice \nis really to step up to the plate and vote for the first resolution \nfrom the House to cut off funding. But to oppose the mission and \nsupport the troops I respectfully do not think works. I do not think it \ngoes together.\n  Again, the Dole resolution speaks in thoughtful and supportive terms. \nThe Congress, it says, ``unequivocally supports the men and women of \nour Armed Forces who are carrying out their missions in support of \npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.'' I am quoting from the latest draft \nof that Dole-McCain resolution. And I continue:\n\n       . . . and [the Congress] believes they [the troops] must be \n     given all necessary resources and support to carry out their \n     mission and ensure their security.\n\n  It goes further, as I suggested earlier, to offer support for the \nPresident's commitment, to offer support for the mission based on the \nfulfillment of certain conditions in carrying out that mission. Again I \nsay, the President has accepted those conditions. The resolution \nparticularly includes language which expresses the high priority that \nso many us in this Chamber, led by the distinguished majority leader, \nhave given to the issue of equipping and training the forces of the \nBosnian Federation.\n  I am pleased the President has now sent the majority a letter on this \nsubject, dated December 10, in which he said:\n\n       We believe establishing a stable military balance within \n     Bosnia by the time the implementation force leaves is \n     important to preventing the war from resuming and to \n     facilitate IFOR's departure. We have made a commitment to the \n     Bosnian Federation that we will coordinate an international \n     effort to ensure that the Federation receives the assistance \n     necessary to achieve an adequate military balance when IFOR \n     leaves.\n\n  Mr. President, I have raised this question of equipping and training \nthe Bosnian Government with the President personally and with members \nof the administration on a number of occasions, as have other Members \nof the Senate and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nparticularly, and the assurances we have received are strong and clear \nand unequivocal. This administration, in supporting the Dayton peace \ntreaty which finally led to the lifting of the immoral, illegal arms \nembargo, is going one step further. This administration is committed to \nleading the coordination of the international effort to arm, equip and \ntrain the Bosnian forces so that they will be able to protect their \nfamilies, their cities, and their nation, and deter aggression by a \nstronger neighbor, which, as Secretary Perry said in marvelous words, \nwas ``a causative factor'' of the war in Bosnia. The imbalance of \nforces was ``a causative factor,'' Secretary Perry's words, in the \noutbreak of war in Bosnia. We want to eliminate that causative factor.\n  So, between the assurances we have received from the administration \norally and in writing, including the letter the President has sent us \nand the requirement stated in the Dole-McCain resolution, I am \nconfident that the Bosnian forces will be equipped and trained to their \nsatisfaction.\n  In fact, when Prime Minister Silajdzic visited the Capitol a week \nago, I asked him specifically if he was satisfied with the commitment \nthat was made to him and the other leaders of Bosnia at Dayton before \nthey signed the peace treaty, and he said yes. In fact, he made it very \nclear that he, frankly, did not care whether it was United States \nforces who did the equipping and training or it was third parties, so \nlong as his people were provided the means to defend themselves if the \nneed should arise after the implementation force leaves Bosnia. And he \nsaid, deeply, he was confident that that would be the case thanks to \nAmerican leadership and support.\n  So we come to the time of voting today. We, in the Senate, have an \nopportunity with our vote on these three pending resolutions to tell \nour men and women in uniform, to tell the governments which have signed \nthe Dayton accords and all that might want to do harm to our forces \nonce they arrive in Bosnia, that we will stand behind our military and \nbehind our President as he executes his foreign policy responsibilities \nin Bosnia, whether or not we think the original commitment was wise.\n  We have the opportunity to avoid instability in Europe which twice in \nthis century has drawn us into dreadful wars. We have the opportunity \nto send a message loud and clear to all the other ethnic groups in the \nformer Soviet Union and elsewhere who have begun or are prepared to \nseek advantage over one another by force of arms, and, yes, by \ngenocide. We have the opportunity here to take this NATO alliance and \nmake it so strong that it protects the security of the world and \nrelieves us, the United States, of our solitary burden for maintaining \nthe peace of the world.\n  Some have said that NATO, by its charter, is a defensive institution \nmeant to defend against Soviet invasion of Western Europe. It was, and \nit did that task magnificently. \n\n[[Page S18465]]\n\n  We are at a different point in history now. For all of us who said on \nthis floor that the United States cannot be the policeman of the world, \nNATO is the way for us to make sure that the United States is not the \npoliceman of the world. Just as we turned to our allies in Europe to \nhelp us in Operation Desert Storm, and they responded by joining us \nheroically, today they turn to us to ask us to help them implement this \npeace in Bosnia. If we say no, what will they say to us the next time \nwe turn to them and ask for help? But if we say yes, as we have, we \nwill see NATO loom large in Europe and beyond as a force for stability \nand peace. It has already begun. For the first time in three decades \nthe French are sitting in the same room at the same table, planning and \nimplementing a NATO military operation.\n  So, let us not let this opportunity slip from our fingers. Let us \ntake the long view. Let us understand that sometimes we are called upon \nto make a decision that is not popular with our friends and neighbors \nat home. Let us understand that foreign policy cannot and should not be \nmade on the basis of public opinion polls, but must be made on the \nbasis of each of our sincere calculations of America's national \ninterests and national security needs.\n  Let us stand together to open ``the door of future to the Bosnian \nchildren'' as Zlata Filipovic, the young Bosnian girl whose diary of \nlife in Sarajevo so moved the world. As Bette Bao Lord, chair of \nFreedom House has said in an open letter: ``As our youth and our \ncompatriots embark on this mission of peace, let them hear but one \nvoice--that of America, a country of conscience and constancy, a \ncountry whose most enduring export is hope.''\n  I say to my colleagues, let us stand together and approve the Dole-\nMcCain resolution.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                December 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: As American military forces are \n     being prepared for commitment in Bosnia, we believe it is \n     essential that they go with a clear understanding that they \n     are supported by their country--that is, by the whole \n     American people--in their difficult and dangerous assignment.\n       Our military forces serving in Bosnia will be under \n     American command, acting in concert with military forces from \n     NATO and other nations that participate in the military \n     implementation of the Dayton peace agreement. The mission \n     statement and the NATO chain of command make it clear that \n     the military forces are not to be drawn into mission-creep \n     nation-building but are to be used for tasks military in \n     nature, and will not be subjected to attempts at micro-\n     management from afar, or to ``dual-key'' aberrations.\n       As you consider our country's involvement in Bosnia, we \n     encourage you to send a message to our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen and Marines wherever they may be (and to all others as \n     well) that our country is giving them its full backing in the \n     accomplishment of their assigned mission. We believe it is \n     time to close ranks, support our troops in the field, and \n     concentrate on helping them do their job in the best possible \n     way.\n       On behalf of the retired general and flag officers listed \n     below,\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael S. Davison,\n       General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n     Andrew J. Goodpaster,\n       General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n     Walter T. Kerwin,\n       General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n     William J. McCaffrey,\n       Lt. Gen., U.S. Army (Ret.).\n     William Y. Smith,\n       General, U.S. Air Force (Ret.).\n     Harry D. Train,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.).\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for a point of clarification, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut was accurate when he talked about the three \nresolutions, or votes that we will be having today. But he did not \nmention the order that they will be in. At 12:30 today we will be \nvoting on H.R. 2606, which is the Hefley bill that was passed in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I want to suggest that I have quite a lengthy statement that I wanted \nto make. But I will withhold that statement, and only make a comment on \n2606 which will be coming up in 40 minutes from now.\n  I will read this very briefly. It merely says ``prohibits the use of \nDepartment of Defense funds for deployment on the grounds of United \nStates Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a part \nof the peacekeeping operation.''\n  So that is clearly what the Constitution gave the power to Congress \nto do.\n  When the Senator from Connecticut characterized the resolution, I \nthink it must be a little inaccurate to say how enthusiastic they are. \nI, finally, 2 minutes ago, received a copy of this. I did not have it \nbefore. It states ``notwithstanding reservations expressed about \nPresident Clinton's decision to deploy United States Armed Forces to \nBosnia and Herzegovina.''\n  That is kind of the preamble. So it is does not sound like to me what \nI would interpret as enthusiastic.\n  Last, Senator Feingold so accurately described what our \nconstitutional rights were in this body, and what the President's were. \nHe quoted Louis Fisher, who I think we all consider to be a foremost \nauthority on the Constitution, wherein he said:\n\n       The framers knew that the British King could use military \n     force against other countries without legislative \n     involvement. They gave to Congress the responsibility for \n     deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as \n     Commander in Chief, was left with the power to ``repeal \n     sudden attack.''\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed \nin the Record, this article by Louis Fisher.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 2, 1995]\n\n                       What Power to Send Troops?\n\n                           (By Louis Fisher)\n\n       Washington.--There seems to be an impression that President \n     Clinton has constitutional authority to send troops to the \n     Balkans without first obtaining approval or authority from \n     Congress. But the case for Presidential power is not so open \n     and shut.\n       The Framers knew that the British king could use military \n     force against other countries without legislative \n     involvement. They gave to Congress the responsibility for \n     deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as \n     Commander in Chief, was left with the power to ``repel sudden \n     attacks.'' He has no general power to initiate military \n     action. This principle was an axiom of republican government.\n       In 1787, James Wilson said the checks-and-balances system \n     ``will not hurry us into war'' and that ``it is calculated to \n     guard against it.'' He said: ``It will not be in the power of \n     a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such \n     distress.''\n       The Framers deliberately separated the powers of the purse \n     and sword. To Madison, in 1793, those who were to ``conduct a \n     war'' could not be safe judges on whether to start one.\n       NATO does not authorize offensive actions or general \n     peacekeeping activities. The North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 \n     was a defensive pact, intended to contain the Soviet Union. \n     The treaty's parties were ``resolved to unite their efforts \n     for collective defense'' and ``resist armed attack.'' None of \n     these conditions exists in Bosnia.\n       To argue that NATO authorizes Mr. Clinton to act as he \n     likes is to argue that the President and the Senate, through \n     the treaty process, can eliminate the House's war power. \n     Treaties do not amend the Constitution. One argument is that \n     Mr. Clinton sponsored the talks, put our prestige at risk and \n     thereby committed us to using force. Are constitutional and \n     legislative processes skirted so easily?\n       In 1969, after the Vietnam buildup, the Senate passed a \n     resolution challenging the President's right to commit the \n     nation without first obtaining Congressional approval. Passed \n     with strong bipartisan backing, it states that whenever our \n     forces are used on foreign territory, or there is a promise \n     to assist a country by using our military, such commitments \n     result ``only from affirmative action taken by the executive \n     and legislative branches.'' This resolution has no legal \n     effect, but it articulates a constitutional principle \n     violated by President Lyndon B. Johnson and now threatened by \n     President Clinton.\n       It might be argued that the ``war power'' is not involved \n     because Mr. Clinton will use American forces for peace, not \n     war. ``America's role will not be about fighting a war,'' he \n     said. He said he refused ``to send American troops to fight a \n     war in Bosnia,'' and ``I believe we must help to secure the \n     Bosnian peace.''\n       Mr. Clinton has already authorized air strikes against the \n     Serbs. He now intends to send ground troops. By making an \n     ``overwhelming show of force,'' he says, ``American troops \n     will lessen the need to use \n\n[[Page S18466]]\n     force.'' Note the word ``lessen.'' Anyone who takes on our troops, he \n     said, ``will suffer the consequences.''\n       Whenever the President acts unilaterally in using military \n     force against another nation, the constitutional rights of \n     Congress and the people are undermined.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Connecticut \nthat, if you really do in your heart oppose the deployment of troops \nover there in that hostile area, this is the strongest message that we \ncan send; that is, voting in favor of H.R. 2606 at 12:30 today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Frederic S. \nBaron, a Pearson Fellow, and Maureen Fino, an Industry Fellow, be \npermitted floor privileges for the duration of the debate on the \nresolution on Bosnia.\n  I do that on behalf of my distinguished colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, life can only be understood backward; but it \nmust be lived forward. As such, we often find ourselves forced to \nrespond to the consequences of decisions and even indecisions that were \nand were not made at the most appropriate moment in time.\n  As a Nation, we have no oracle--only history--and the wisdom of God \nhas given us to govern our affairs and to support our democratic ideal \namong sovereigns and allies.\n  Often we overlook the majesty of our role--our responsibility--that \nis, until a man of Shimon Peres' standing reminds us that our Nation is \n``a commitment to values before an expression of might * * *'' That our \nstrength has saved the world from ``Nazi tyranny, Japanese militarism, \nand the Communist challenge.'' That we have ``enabled many nations to \nsave their democracies even as [we] strive now to assist many nations \nto free themselves from their nondemocratic past.''\n  This, Mr. President, is our legacy. And I am grateful to Prime \nMinister Peres for reminding us of who we are and what--since our \ndivinely-appointed founding--has been our mission: freedom for us and \nself-determination for our fellow man.\n  Certainly, there are many ways to pursue this mission. We cannot be \nthe world's policeman; nor should we. We must cherish the strength of \nAmerica, and that means using it wisely, sparingly--certainly with some \nsacrifice--but never with imprudence, undue risk, and wanton disregard \nfor our best interests.\n  The territorial aggression and horrific atrocities in the Balkans \nbring us to the floor today. The death and crimes committed in the \nformer Yugoslavia have bruised our collective spirit, especially as the \ninternational community has been unable to resolve the conflict and \nestablish reconciliation and lasting peace.\n  There was a time when, perhaps, America's resolved leadership could \nhave minimized and even resolved the crisis by lifting the arms embargo \nagainst the Bosnians--by allowing them to defend themselves against the \nwell-armed Serb aggressors.\n  At the same time we could have provided tactical and strategic air \nsupport to the Bosnian forces.\n  But President Clinton chose another road, one that brings us to the \nfloor today. Life can only be understood backward; but it must be lived \nforward. Today we are forced to respond to the consequences of the \nPresident's decisions and indecisions, and history must be our guide.\n  The outcome here will not only have an influence on the security and \nlives of thousands of young American men and women, but it will affect \nus as a society, our leadership among allies, and the future of \nEurope--particularly the war-torn region known as the Balkans.\n  It is a difficult debate, one that must be entered thoughtfully, \nsolemnly, and with the object of finding solutions rather than playing \npolitics. It would be tempting to fill the air with ``what ifs'' and \n``if onlys,'' but we are beyond that point.\n  President Clinton has committed U.S. ground forces. He has done this \nas part of a peace process whose success will largely depend upon how \nwe, the Congress, react--upon our determination and demonstration of \nsupport for the young American men and women who are even now moving \ninto that region.\n  If we appear divided, we risk sending a message to those who would \nthwart the peace process that if they only hold out long enough support \nfor our troops will weaken. This is not a risk that I am willing to \ntake.\n  Much of the support leaving our shores is leaving from Dover Air \nForce Base. I have met with many of these young men and women; I know \ntheir concerns; I know their courage. And I know that every individual \nbeing sent into the Balkans is just like them. And I will not trifle \nwith their security, with their future, and with the future of their \nfamilies, their children.\n  When they wear our uniform in Bosnia I want them to know that they \nhave my unqualified support.\n  I want them to know that they are there for a reason, they are on a \nmission--a mission with a purpose that was outlined so eloquently by \nPrime Minister Peres, to help this war-torn land free itself from its \nundemocratic past.\n  We cannot avoid our leadership, nor can we dismiss our legacy. \nCertainly, President Clinton could have embraced our earlier proposal \nand taken America down another road; but he did not. And the fact is, \nwe do have an interest in seeing that peace is maintained in this \nregion.\n  To date, more than a quarter million men, women, and children have \nbeen killed--many in the most horrible and atrocious manner. Over 2 \nmillion have been displaced and forced to flee. We have proof of mass \nexecutions, rapes, and other unspeakable crimes. Our legacy of support \nfor human rights abhors these conditions.\n  America has gone to Europe to advance our ideals in two world wars. \nWe have spent untold resources and dedicated countless lives to winning \nthe cold war for the same reason--to advance the principles of freedom, \ndemocracy and self-determination. Perhaps the time has come to finish \nthe task, to take a step toward bolting down our successes and see that \nthe foundation for a peaceful European future is strong and sure.\n  This is not inconsistent with our responsibilities as a member of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  In fact, this peace-keeping mission will be the largest NATO mission \nin its history and the first since the end of the cold war. An \nunwillingness on the part of America at this point could do irreparable \ndamage to the Transatlantic Partnership and its central institution, \nthe North Atlantic Alliance.\n  Failure to follow-through on the commitment President Clinton has \nmade would also undermine our position as a world leader. Our allies \nmust know that they can depend on us.\n  This is critically important, because if we fail to keep the peace in \nthe Balkans it is possible that the conflict may well spill beyond the \nborders and into NATO territory. Under those circumstances we would not \nbe sending our young men and women to strengthen the peace, but to \nprosecute a war. I would rather have them there to strengthen the \npeace.\n  Mr. President, life can only be understood backward; but it must be \nlived forward. Perhaps President Clinton should have heeded our earlier \ncounsel.\n  I would rather see peace in the Balkans and negotiations based on \nparity of strength, rather than on the presence of our ground troops.\n  I would rather see our involvement limited to strategic and tactical \nair and sea support. But those are not options, not anymore. When \nPresident Clinton picked up one end of the stick, he picked up the \nother. Now we must give the troops he has committed to the Balkans our \nfull support.\n  An absolute requirement for success is to have Congress and the \nNation united over the mission now under way. We must have bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is why I have been so impressed by Senator Dole's and Senator \nMcCain's role in the negotiations between Congress and the executive \nbranch.\n  Through their statesmanship, they have offered an approach that \ncaptures our commitment to protect and support American troops deployed \nto the Balkan and that defines the core requisites to the success of \nthe peace process.\n\n[[Page S18467]]\n\n  Supporting the Dole-McCain endeavor is the appropriate response to \nour responsibilities as a world leader and as member of NATO. The most \nuseful contribution this body can make to the peace process is to help \nensure that America's role in the peace process will be guided by \nclearly defined objectives and strategies. In doing so, we would be \nliving up to our responsibilities to support the American men and women \nassigned to this mission of peace and to the interests of America in \npost-cold-war Europe.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, first may I congratulate the Senator \nfrom Delaware on a wonderfully cogent and compelling statement, with \nthat marvelous phrase of Kierkegaard's that ``life can only be \nunderstood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.'' I would like to \nuse that as the theme for my remarks. We are responding today to what \nwe have learned from the past. What we have learned about the \nimportance of law and of collective security.\n  It is for that reason, Mr. President, that I rise in support of the \nresolution developed by the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, and \nSenator McCain. At the appropriate time I would ask, as I am sure many \nothers will, to be a cosponsor.\n  This morning's debate has been, as the Senator from Connecticut \nsuggested, a defining day in the history of the Senate. I think not \nleast because of the quality of remarks not just of the Senator from \nDelaware, but the Senator from Idaho, although he is, perhaps, on the \nopposite side of the issue. He spoke of the arms embargo imposed on \nBosnia and Herzegovina as being illegal, and indeed it was illegal, and \nit is illegal under article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides for \nthe inherent right of collective and individual self-defense. This is a \nprovision Senator Vandenberg, at the San Francisco conference, insisted \nbe in the U.N. Charter, so that there would not be a conflict with the \nRio Treaty for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. But that is \nsingularly an American provision.\n  Then the Senator from Connecticut spoke of the way sanctions bit in \nSerbia. This has been the first ever successful use of sanctions in the \ncourse of enforcing international law after a century of advocacy of \nsuch measures by groups looking to a world of law, a world of \ninternational law, and consequently of a measure of order.\n  The failure of sanctions after the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, now \nEthiopia, discredited the idea so severely it has rarely been \nattempted. It has worked somewhat in Iraq, let us grant, but it has not \nbrought a regime to the peace table. Sanctions bit in Yugoslavia.\n  We have before us a resolution which begins:\n\n       Whereas beginning on February 24, 1993, President Clinton \n     committed the United States to participate in implementing a \n     peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina without prior \n     consultation with Congress;\n       Whereas the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been \n     unjustly denied the means to defend itself through the \n     imposition of a United Nations arms embargo;\n\n  And now the third clause. I do not know that there has been such a \nstatement on this floor in half a century. Since, that is, 1945, when \nthe U.N. Charter came to the Senate under bipartisan sponsorship. The \nclause reads:\n\n       Whereas the United Nations Charter restates ``the inherent \n     right of individual and collective self-defense,'' a right \n     denied the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina whose \n     population has further suffered egregious violations of the \n     international law of war including ethnic cleansing by \n     Serbian aggressors, and the Convention on Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, to which the United \n     States Senate gave its advice and consent in 1986.\n\n  This is a rousing statement of the centrality of law to the actions \nthat the United States, the NATO alliance, and the extraordinary \nassembly of other countries, some 29 in all, are now undertaking.\n  We sometimes forget how central international law has been to our \nunderstanding of what would follow World War II. The Genocide \nConvention, as it is called in shorthand, and which is specifically \nreferred to in the Dole-McCain resolution, was in effect proposed by \nthe General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1948, when it \ndeclared that ``genocide is a crime under international law.''\n  To make it a crime required a treaty. In time a treaty was drafted, \nand in time ratified by the United States. As a treaty it is the \nsupreme law of the land. This land, Mr. President.\n  The resolution also refers to the ``egregious violations of the \ninternational law of war.'' By that, sir, we refer to the Geneva \nConventions, which were agreed to in the city of Geneva in 1949. A \nlittle history here. The Nuremberg tribunals, and the equivalent in \nAsia that followed World War II, were arguably extralegal, in that \nindividuals arguably were not subjects of international law at that \ntime for most of the issues that were involved in those trials. To \nresolve any question the Allied Powers determined to remove any shadow \nof doubt by adopting treaties to establish that the laws of war apply \nto individuals.\n  Four treaties were drawn up concerning the treatment of particular \nclasses of vulnerable persons during war. These nearly universally \naccepted treaties are known as the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The \nconventions make it illegal to target civilians as the objects of \nmilitary operations. Each of the four conventions has a common Article \n3, which states:\n\n       In the case of armed conflict, not of an international \n     character occurring in the territory of one of the High \n     Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be \n     bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:\n       (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, \n     including members of armed forces who have laid down their \n     arms . . . shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, \n     without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, \n     religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar \n     criteria.\n\n  Note ``sex,'' Mr. President.\n\n       To this end, the following acts are and shall remain \n     prohibited at any time and any place whatsoever with respect \n     to the above-mentioned persons:\n       In the case of armed conflict not of an international \n     character occurring in the territory of one of the High \n     Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be \n     bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:\n       (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, \n     including members of armed forces who have laid down their \n     arms. . . shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, \n     without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, \n     religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar \n     criteria.\n       To this end, the following acts are and shall remain \n     prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with \n     respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a) violence to life \n     and person, in particular merder of all kinds, mutilation, \n     cruel treatment and torture; (b) taking of hostages; (c) \n     outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and \n     degrading treatment; (d) the passing of sentences and the \n     carrying out of executions without previous judgment \n     procounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all \n     the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable \n     by civilized peoples.\n\n  It is under that common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that the \nwar crimes tribunal has been convened in the Hague and indictments have \nbeen handed down. The Dole-McCain resolution specifically provides that \nthe President will regularly report to the Congress on the progress of \nthe tribunal.\n  Mr. President, the United States is in the process of assembling the \nmost formidable and broadly-based collective effort to maintain \ninternational peace and security the world has ever known. This \nrepresents a triumph of an American position concerning the law of \nnations which goes back to the beginning of the Republic, a position \nthat has defined American policy for much of this century, at least \nuntil mid-century. But which until this moment, with this resolution, a \ntradition that has been singularly absent from statements about the \nDayton agreement by the President, the Secretary of State or the \nadministration generally.\n  They have spoken about moral imperatives, which no doubt exist, but \nthere is nothing in the Constitution that speaks of moral imperatives. \nThe Constitution says, ``The Congress shall have Power * * * To define \nand punish * * * Offenses against the Law of Nations.'' It says \n``Treaties * * * shall be the supreme Law of the Land. And in a \nlifetime of searching through article II, I have never found any real \nduty assigned to the President of the United \n\n[[Page S18468]]\nStates other than that ``he shall take Care that the Laws are \nfaithfully executed.'' We are now saying that he is doing this.\n  This goes back a very long way. S. 1, the first bill introduced in \nthe first session of the first Congress of the United States in 1789, \nwritten if I may say, by Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, who in 1796 \nwould be appointed Chief Justice of the United States, was titled ``An \nAct to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States.'' It was the \n20th public law enacted. Among other things, the legislation provided \nthat--\n\n       . . . the district courts shall have . . . cognizance . . . \n     of all causes where an alien sues for a tort only in \n     violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United \n     States.\n       An alien can sue in U.S. court for a tort violation of the \n     law of nations or a treaty of the United States which \n     occurred outside our territory.\n\n  That was 206 years ago. Eight weeks ago the U.S. Court of Appeals of \nthe Second Circuit unanimously held that under that statute the leader \nof the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic could indeed be sued in the \nSouthern District of New York for offenses against the law of nations \ncommitted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The suit was brought before \nKaradzic was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It is not likely that Mr. Karadzic \nwill appear soon in Foley Square. Yet in the unanimous ruling, the \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit, said, yes, indeed, our laws do \nprovide for such actions.\n  That spirit infused our early Republic. We thought of it as the basis \nof our legitimacy. When Chancellor Kent published his ``Commentaries on \nAmerican Law,'' lectures given at Columbia University, his first \nlecture in his first volume was entitled ``Of the Law of Nations.'' \nThat tradition goes back to the Constitution itself which gives \nCongress the power ``To define and punish Offenses against the Law of \nNations.''\n  At the beginning of this century, there was a strong movement, the \npeace movement so-called, consisting of those who hoped that law could \nbe used as a device for preventing war altogether. George Kennan has \ndescribed this as follows:\n\n       At the outset of the present century, there emerged in the \n     United States, England and other parts of northern Europe, a \n     vigorous movement for the strengthening and consolidation of \n     world peace, primarily by the development of new legal codes \n     of international behavior.\n\n  This is from an introduction by Ambassador Kennan to a reprinted \nvolume of a report on the Balkan wars of 1912-1913 which was sponsored \nby the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Elihu Root, then a \nU.S. Senator from New York, was, as I recall, chairman. I might say, \nwhen the Carnegie endowment was established in 1910, such was the \ndegree of optimism in the world that the bequest provided the moneys be \nused for further objectives once ``the establishment of universal peace \nis attained.''\n  Ambassador Kennan is, as always, generous. In retrospect, the peace \nmovement, he writes, might seem ``unrealistic, naive, and pathetic. But \nthey were * * * profoundly prophetic and well justified in the concerns \nthey reflected.'' You had no more to see the First World War than to \nrealize that.\n  Then came Woodrow Wilson's effort to create an international \norganization, the League of Nations, and the failed effort on the \nSenate floor to enact it. A failure that was far more the President's \nfault than the Senate's fault. He could have had the Treaty of \nVersailles if he made a few concessions, which were not of any \nconsequence. But it failed.\n  We withdrew from the world. The world brought us back in with the \nSecond World War. Then the U.N. Charter was signed and then the great \neffort began to see that law became the arbiter of relations between \nStates.\n  That was reflected not least in the Genocide Convention, and in the \nGeneva Conventions, reflecting such deep convictions and beliefs on our \npart.\n  But there followed a time when, among many liberals, international \nlaw began to be seen as a set of doctrines that always got you into \ntrouble, that said you had to do this, you had to do that in distant \nplaces of which, as the phrase goes, ``we know little.''\n  Next, in a conservative period that followed, for quite different \nreasons, the same rejection of law occurred. International law in the \neighties came to be seen as a system of negative restraint saying what \ncannot be done. So damn the treaty: Mine the harbors.\n  Those are inadequate understandings both of what our laws are and \nwhat our interests are. We have a profound interest in a world with a \nmeasure of order, a measure of predictability, and a capacity to \nenforce it in some measure at least. As do others. Twenty-nine nations \nare going to join us in this effort, at last count. Forty-two nations \nmet in London to discuss reestablishment of a civil society in the \nregion.\n  So, Mr. President, I know my colleague from Nebraska would like to \nsay a word, and that a vote is scheduled at 12:30. May I simply welcome \nthis resolution for its ringing reaffirmation of a central tradition in \nAmerican statecraft, American diplomacy, American military operations: \nThe centrality of law, the legality of what we are doing and the \nimportance of the fact that we are doing it in a collective mode, \nanticipated by the U.N. Charter.\n  I was once our Representative to the United Nations. I once \nrepresented the United States as the President of the Security Council. \nI did not know I would live to see such a hopeful hour as this.\n  None of us knows how much resistance the implementation force will \nface. There will surely be losses. I made my way into Sarajevo 3 years \nago this Thanksgiving and I saw the dangers the French, Egyptian, and \nUkrainian forces faced, along with the air crews of a dozen nations. \nAnd that, in theory, was a peace-keeping exercise. This is much more. \nWe have settled for the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, however \nlittle we may like the term. With half the population of that state \neither dead or displaced in 4 years of war imposed on it from the \noutside, this is surely something.\n  Peace may come, in the sense of the absence of war. But stability is \nsurely a long way off. Even so we have at length recognized the \nnecessity to address the legal obligations of the parties involved, \nwhich include all members of the United Nations by treaty definition. \nWe will do what can be done, and do it according to law. That has the \npotential for rescuing us from the shame of having done so little until \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska has \nbeen waiting, and I am not going to take long because I want him to \nhave his chance. But I do want to take this time to respond to the \nSenator from Connecticut who said he did not understand how someone can \nsay they support the troops but do not support the mission. I just want \nto say, I think it is very easy to say you do support the troops but \nyou do not support the mission. I think we have sent troops into harm's \nway in this country when we should not have done it.\n  No one would ever not support the people who are giving their lives, \nputting their lives on the line to protect our freedom.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Texas yield? The two leaders are on \nthe floor. I would like to, while they are here, find out, since \nSenator Exon and I have been waiting most of the morning, if the time \ncan be extended to speak for a few minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator can add the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to finish my statement, unless the \nmajority leader is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. REID. I just ask, if the Senator will withhold for a second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Can I direct a question to the majority leader?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader and minority leader are now on the \nfloor. I know they have been to the service for Reverend Halverson. But \nwe have been on the floor most of the morning, all four of us, waiting \nto speak, and I wonder if there is a way for a limited period of time. \nI only need a few minutes. Senator Exon said he needed a short \n\n[[Page S18469]]\ntime. I do not know how much time the Senator from California needs.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not have a problem with that, unless somebody has \nalready made plans on voting at 12:30 and then doing something else off \nthe Hill on either side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, does this pertain to \nthe pending amendment, or is it to the larger issue of Bosnia?\n  Mr. REID. I think, to be candid with the two leaders, I can speak \nlater. It is inconvenient, but it is on the issue and I could speak \nlater.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This may not work----\n  Mr. DOLE. The vote is for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We can get unanimous consent that those Senators who are \nhere be recognized immediately following the vote, if that will \naccommodate our Senators. I think it would be better to try to keep the \nschedule, if we can.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, let me just say that \nSenator Frist also should be put in that group, and I will not object. \nHe has been here all morning. He finally left. I told him that I would \nprotect his rights. I have no objection to the people who have been \nwaiting, but I think we should add Senator Frist and Senator Specter, \nwho is also on his way in, for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not know which order over here, but whatever the \norder----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Exon, Senator Reid, Senator Boxer and then \nSenator Bob Kerrey I am told on our side were here. Senator Moynihan \nspoke.\n  Mr. DOLE. And then Senator Specter.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. For 15 minutes and Senator Frist and Senator \nDomenici.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senators Specter, Frist, and Domenici.\n  Mr. EXON. If the majority leader will yield for a question to try and \nstraighten this matter out. The vote is scheduled at 12:30. Is there a \ntime scheduled for the second vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not yet.\n  Mr. EXON. Several of us have been waiting a long, long time. Maybe we \ncan get some agreement so I can keep my schedule. Nobody can keep \nschedules these days because of what is going on. If I could be \nrecognized following the vote for 12 minutes, I would be glad to \ncooperate.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nnext vote the Senator from Nebraska be recognized first, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee next, the Senator from Nevada next, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and the Senator from California be recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And we have two additional Senators. I would hope that \nwe can alternate back and forth if we have additional Republicans. But \nour order would be as Senator Reid has suggested.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nebraska needs 15 minutes. I need 12 \nminutes. Two Senators that are Republicans need 15 minutes each.\n  Mr. DOLE. There are no time limits. We will just get a sequence. The \nonly time limit is that the President would like to have us complete \naction on these by 6 or 7 o'clock so they can go to the House and they \ncan be addressed there, if not tonight, tomorrow, shortly after they \nsign the peace treaty in Paris. So we are trying to accommodate the \nadministration here.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, Mr. President, that the unanimous-consent request be \ngranted.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure it \ngoes back and forth, a Republican and a Democrat.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, it will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes the following unanimous-\nconsent request has been made: After the vote, to recognize first, \nSenator Exon, the Senator from Nebraska; second, Senator Frist, the \nSenator from Tennessee; third, Senator Reid, the Senator from Nevada; \nfourth, Senator Specter, the Senator from Pennsylvania; fifth, Senator \nBoxer, the Senator from California; sixth, Senator Domenici, the \nSenator from New Mexico; seventh, Senator Kerrey, the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Are there any additions?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest another Republican Senator and \nthen Senator Robb on our side. So we would hold open the slot for a \nRepublican Senator, to be announced at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18449-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18469-S18470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROHIBITION OF FUNDS FOR BOSNIA DEPLOYMENT\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on H.R. 2606.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 2606) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Warner \nbe inserted into the Republican spot there, following the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, does the majority leader accept \ncosponsors at this point of the Dole-McCain amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to be added.\n  Mr. EXON. Put me on.\n  Mr. DOLE. So we have the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from \nNebraska, the Senator from South Dakota, we will be accepting \ncosponsors throughout the day.\n  I will proceed for 2 or 3 minutes before the vote on this bill. I \nwill speak later on the Hutchison amendment and on my own amendment.\n  Let me speak to the Hefley resolution because I think it is \nimportant. Just for the record, I went back and had the Congressional \nResearch Service check my votes and the debates I was participating in \nbetween 1969 and 1973 when it came to cutting off funds in Vietnam. We \nhad one debate that lasted 7 weeks, and I was the leader of the effort \nnot to cut off funds because we had people like John McCain who were in \nprison, and we had other young men and women who were on the ground in \nVietnam. I thought it would have been a tragedy. We had long, \nrancorous, heated debates, on the so-called Cooper-Church amendments--\nSenator Cooper from Kentucky and Senator Church from Idaho.\n  So let me say on the so-called resolution before us now, and having a \nlot of experience in efforts to try to avoid cutting off funds once we \nhave our young men and women committed somewhere around the world, we \nhave a couple of choices. We can cut off funds for this operation and \nour forces who are already underway; second, we can loudly protest the \nPresident's decision and express our opposition; third, we can require \nthe President to take measures that will enhance the safety of our \ntroops and ensure that they will return quickly--without their \nwithdrawal leading to resumption of hostilities.\n  I have given this matter a lot of thought, and I have been engaged in \na lot of these debates on the Senate floor. I have thought about my own \npersonal experience during World War II and deliberations I have had \nsince that time. I have thought about the American troops spending a \nChristmas overseas in the mountains of Europe. I have also thought \nabout the experience of our brave war heroes like Senator John McCain \nand Bob Kerrey. John McCain was in a Vietnamese prison while tens of \nthousands of Americans were marching to protest the war, and Congress \nregularly debated cutting off funds for United States military \noperations in Southeast Asia. As some may remember, the Congress spent \nweeks--even months--on debating Cooper-Church, McGovern-Hatfield, and \nother measures to cut funding for the war in Vietnam, Laos, and \nCambodia.\n  I recall that in the spring of 1970, I led a filibuster against the \nCooper-Church amendment cutting off funds for military operations in \nCambodia and Laos. In that debate, I offered an amendment that would \nhave allowed \n\n[[Page S18470]]\nthe President to waive the funding restrictions if he determined United \nStates citizens were being held as prisoners of war in Cambodia by \nNorth Vietnam or the Viet Cong. This amendment failed. Believe it or \nnot, the amendment failed by 36 to 54, and Cooper-Church passed, but \nonly after troop withdrawal had begun.\n  Mr. President, while I understand opposition to and disagreement with \nthe President's decision to send American ground forces to Bosnia, I \nbelieve that action to cut off funds for this deployment is wrong. It \nis wrong because it makes our brave young men and women bear the brunt \nof a decision not made by them, but by the Commander in Chief.\n  I will vote against H.R. 2606, sponsored by Representative Hefley, \nwhich was passed by the House last month. H.R. 2606 prohibits any use \nof Department of Defense funds for deployment of United States Armed \nForces on the ground in Bosnia participating in the NATO implementation \nforce--unless such funds have been specifically appropriated by \nsubsequent law. There has been no appropriation for this operation, so \nthe effect would be to cut off funds to our troops who are on the way \nor already on the ground in Bosnia. I do not believe we should limit \nthe funds for food, supplies, and ammunition for our troops. It was \nwrong during Vietnam, and it is wrong now.\n\n  I believe that passing the Hefley resolution would undermine our \ntroops, as well as our credibility.\n  I believe that even at this late date, the Congress can play a \nconstructive role--supporting the troops by enhancing their prospects \nfor a timely and safe withdrawal, and ensuring that there is a military \nbalance upon the departure of our forces.\n  President Clinton does not have an exit strategy for our troops. Let \nus be clear: A date is not an exit strategy. In my view, it would be \nirresponsible to send thousands of American forces in without a \nconcrete plan to bring them out. We will be debating that at a later \ntime.\n  Furthermore, we need to do what we can to make certain that the \nsacrifices being made now--by our men and women in uniform, by the U.S. \ntaxpayer--are not for nought. It would be inexcusable to undertake this \nimmense endeavor, only to leave Bosnia, a year later, in the same \nsituation it is in now--virtually defenseless and at the mercy of its \nbigger and stronger neighbors.\n\n  Later today, we will have an opportunity to vote on the Hutchison-\nInhofe and Dole-McCain resolutions. Now, we should speak decisively in \nsupport of our troops and defeat H.R. 2606.\n  This is not the way to go--cutting off funds. As I have said, in all \nthe debates that I have engaged in, these are the records of my votes \nbetween 1969 and 1973. It never seemed appropriate for me, when you had \nyoung men like John McCain, a prisoner of war, that we would cut off \nfunds in the U.S. Congress, and I still have that same attitude today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on H.R. 2606. The \nquestion is: Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 22, nays 77, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 601 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--22\n\n     Brown\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--77\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n  So, the bill (H.R. 2606) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOLE.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 35, offered by the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate resume \nconsideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 35 and it be in order for \nthis Senator to offer my Senate joint resolution and that no amendments \nor motions to commit be in order to either vehicle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we now have had our \nfirst vote. We would like to complete action on the concurrent \nresolution authored by Senators Hutchison, Nickles, and others and then \nhave that vote very quickly if we can. I know a lot of people want to \ntalk, but I think it is general debate. We would also like to have the \nvote on my joint resolution, the Dole-McCain joint resolution, \nsometime, hopefully by 6 o'clock this evening. So that gives us about 5 \nhours of debate. We have already had a number of Members, I would say \nabout 20 Members, each requesting from 10 minutes to 15 minutes to 90 \nminutes.\n  Now, we are not going to be able to accommodate everybody, or I hope \nthey can accommodate us, and I hope we can, as much as we can, keep our \nremarks limited to 5 or 7 or 8 minutes, because if I just add up these \nrequests, this will take us beyond 6 o'clock, probably 7 or 8 o'clock. \nAnd I would say as the Republican leader, we are trying to accommodate \nthe President of the United States. So, hopefully, we will have \ncooperation on both sides. I think the Senator from Texas would like to \nhave a vote about what, midafternoon, on her concurrent resolution?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, yes, I would like to vote as early as \nwe can. I think most people are speaking in general terms so I think \nmidafternoon. And then I would like to see the final vote on yours \naround 5 so that the House could have the opportunity, if that is \npossible.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will do our best.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just add to what the majority leader said. \nObviously, a lot of Senators wish to speak, for good reason, about this \nissue and on these resolutions. I hope, though, that we could \naccommodate all Senators who wish to speak by shortening the length of \nour statements to the extent that it is practical to do so. Obviously, \nwe will have more opportunities once the resolution passes to come to \nthe floor and continue this exchange and to continue to express \nourselves.\n  But if we are going to allow every Senator an opportunity to speak, \nwe are going to be constrained somewhat in the time allotted for each \nSenator. So I hope everyone will bear that in mind and cooperate to the \nextent it is possible so that we can have a vote at the earliest \npossible time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we need to get aunanimous consent on \nthe next sequence of speakers. I wish to do that so that people know \nhow to plan their afternoon.\n  This is the second list after the one that was agreed to earlier, and \nit would include Senator DeWine, then Feinstein, then Lott, then Biden, \nthen \n\n[[Page S18471]]\nAshcroft, Kohl, Hatfield, Levin, Inhofe, Byrd, Faircloth, Wellstone, \nD'Amato, Murray, Leahy, Simon, Bradley, and Nunn, and there will be \nRepublicans between Murray, Leahy, Simon, Bradley, and Nunn. Senator \nMurkowski would be after Senator Byrd. I ask unanimous consent that we \nput that order in place so that people can begin to plan. And I urge, \nbut do not ask for unanimous consent, that people hold their remarks to \n5 minutes so that everyone will have a chance, with the hope that we \nwould be able to vote around midafternoon on the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution and then around 5 on the Dole-McCain resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? The Chair hears none, \nand the additional Senators will be added to the list.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon] is recognized.\n  Mr. President, for the past few weeks, military and civilian \nofficials from the administration have come to Congress to make the \ncase as to why United States ground troops must be a central part of \nthe international peacekeeping force that will go to Bosnia following \nthe formal signing of the Dayton peace accord this Thursday in Paris. \nTo date, I have withheld final judgment on the advisability of this \naction and kept an open mind to arguments on both sides of the debate. \nI listened closely to President Clinton's national address on Bosnia \nand have discussed, in both public and private forum, some of my \nconcerns with members of his cabinet and top military advisers. In \naddition, I have sought and received the advice of my constituents in \nNebraska, many of whom are members of the Armed Forces or have \nrelatives in the services.\n  I have been impressed by the bipartisan leadership on this issue by \nMajority Leader Bob Dole and Senator McCain. I support their bipartisan \namendment.\n  The facts are that the President has exercised his constitutional \nauthority to dispatch troops to Bosnia. What we do by vote here today \ndoes not start nor can it stop troop deployment. It's a done deal \nwhether we like it or not.\n  I have carefully deliberated on the question of blessing or \ncondemning the deployment of American peacekeepers in Bosnia. I believe \nthere is no more solemn an action the President can take or we as \nSenators can take or vote to endorse the process. The deployment of \nAmerican men and women overseas into a potentially harmful environment \neven though it is advisory, is a legislative action that requires \nparticular care and a need for thoughtful introspection that is \ntypically not required in the conduct of our day-to-day business. Let \nno one be under any allusions, the collective voice of Congress on the \nissue of troops to Bosnia along with the President's decision as our \nCommander in Chief will have great historic significance, affecting not \nonly the short-term prospect of peace in the Balkans but also the long-\nterm role of America in NATO and as a worldwide leader.\n  Some seem to believe that some of us who have served our country in \nthe past by being placed in harm's way have some special insight or \nsuperior wisdom or license to be holier than thou in these decisions. \nOur wartime experience provides us with just that--experience--but not \nnecessarily a priviledged status in reasoned decisionmaking because of \nour past valor.\n  While the perils of participation in the international peacekeeping \nforce in Bosnia are unquestionable, I believe a reasonable case has \nbeen made for the deployment of American troops there.\n  Once the three parties sign the peace agreement in Paris on Thursday. \nFor me, the debate boils down to this central question: By risking the \nsafety of American troops in the next year do we avoid an even greater \nthreat to our national security interests and possible loss of life in \nthe future? That is a judgment call. There is no certainty. The \nquestion is: Will this stitch in time save nine?\n  If the United States was to renege on its promise by its President \nand constitutional Commander in Chief to join 27 other nations in the \nNATO-led peacekeeping force, I am concerned the consequences would be \ndramatic and irrevocably harmful to the pursuit of peace and the \nfurtherance of our security interests. If the United States does not \nfollowthrough with its commitment to provide one-third of the Bosnian \npeacekeeping force, it would be the end of American leadership in NATO, \nand likely the end of NATO itself. NATO has been a stabilizing force \nfor peace for 50 years. To pull the rug out from under it now at a time \nwhen a peace agreement has been brokered that will hopefully end a \nbrutal 3-year war filled with ethnic cleansing, rape, mass executions, \nand torture would be unconscionable. To scuttle the agreement now would \nthrow the region back into the horrific morass of war, guaranteeing \nmore civilian deaths, more refugees, more instability in Europe, and \nthe very distinct possibility that the fighting will spread and soon \nensnare other bordering nations, allies of the United States, into \narmed conflict with one another. Opponents of the President's policy \nare fond of delving into history to discuss centuries old animosities \nthat exist between the warring factions in Bosnia. Let us not \nconveniently skip over, however, the lessons of World War I and what \nhappens when one regional ethnic conflict, left unchecked, draws \nin other nations, which in turn brings still other nations to arms. \nEuropean incubation of World War I and World War II eventually cost us \n522,000 deaths and 875,000 in military casualties. Whether or not we \nlike it, it is clear what happens in Europe does affect us.\n\n  Bosnians, Serbians, and Croatians came to Dayton because they sought \nan end to the fighting. The peace agreement reached in Ohio is their \npeace, not a peace that the United States or any other nation is \nimposing upon them. The Dayton agreement is quite clear about what is \nexpected of each of the signatory parties. If the agreement is broken \nby any of the three parties, we and the other peacekeeping nations are \nunder no obligation or commitment to remain in that troubled country. \nMore importantly, the military tasks required of our troops in Bosnia \nhave been explicitly set forth and can be accomplished within 12 \nmonths, the 12-month timeframe set by the administration. Our \npeacekeeping troops will be in Bosnia to assist in the separation of \nforces along a 4-kilometer demilitarized zone of separation. We will \nassist in transferring of territories as called for in the Dayton \nagreement. We will be there to break the cycle of violence and ensure \nthat all sides are living up to the requirements of the Dayton accord. \nOur ground troops will not be in Bosnia as a police force. They will \nnot be asked to disarm militias or move refugees or deliver aid. Nor \nwill they be required to perform many of the civilian tasks set forth \nin the Dayton agreement, such as economic reconstruction, supervising \nnew elections, or bringing about a military force balance among the \nthree entities within Bosnia. These tasks will be performed by \nnongovernmental organizations and other nations. In short, the United \nStates military mission in Bosnia is narrow, specific, finite in \nlength, and, most importantly, unencumbered by any limitations on \nAmerican unit commanders to preemptively strike at hostile forces and \notherwise defend our forces using whatever means necessary.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Perry, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General \nShalikashvili, Secretary of State Christopher, and Ambassador Holbrooke \nhave gone the extra mile in my opinion to spell out as best they can \nall the intricacies of our involvement in the implementation force. \nOver many long congressional hearings they have detailed how our troops \nare being trained and prepared for mission, how and when the forces \nwill enter the region and the Tuzla Zone, the steps involved with \nimplementing the military tasks set forth in the peace agreement, the \ntime line for transitioning to peace, and our exit strategy and have \nall been spelled out. The administration has been as forthcoming as \npossible in addressing congressional concerns with respect to rules of \nengagement, the additive cost of the operation, the command and control \nof our forces, and so forth. The steps also have been spelled out that \nwill be taken to bring about a balance of military power in the region \nonce the peacekeeping force is withdrawn.\n  Mr. President, no military operation is risk free. Even during \npeacetime, we \n\n[[Page S18472]]\nlose scores of men and women each year due to training mishaps and \nother duty-related accidents. Life in the Armed Forces is inherently \ndangerous. Like law enforcement and firefighting, they are \nprofessionals. The profession of soldier is also a voluntary one, \nfilled with uncertainty and peril. That is the history of service to \nthe United States of America. There are no guarantees about what will \nhappen in Bosnia in the next 12 months. With or without congressional \nauthorization, the President of the United States, as our Nation's \nCommander in Chief, has the constitutional authority to commit troops \nto the multinational operation in Bosnia. He has done that.\n  Over the past 3 years a large number of Senators have taken to this \nfloor and given an even greater number of speeches deploring the \nbloodshed in Bosnia and the desperate need to do something--anything--\nto end the fighting, end the ethnic cleansing, end the raping, end the \nmass executions. Now, after years of handwriting, a window of \nopportunity has presented itself to see that the ceasefire becomes a \npeace and that the peace, in turn, can mature into lasting stability \nand the restoration of a nation figuratively and literally bled dry. I \nhope that those same Senators who called for action are now ready to \nget behind the President's policy. The reality is that for this process \nto succeed, our Nation's leadership is essential. We cannot simply wish \nfor a happy ending in Bosnia. If we want the United States to continue \nto be the world's preeminent power, if we want NATO to remain strong \nand relevant into the 21st century, if we want to prevent the Bosnian \nwar from rekindling and potentially spreading into neighboring \ncountries, then the United States cannot disengage itself and stand on \nthe sidelines and act as a critic.\n  Mr. President, preserving stability on the European continent and \nstrengthening NATO is in America's national security interests. If it \nwas not, then we should bring home the 100,000 Americans we have \nstationed there, close dozens of bases, and cut our $264 billion \nnational defense budget by a healthy percentage. But I suspect that \nthose who are critical of the President's policy would squeal loudly \nover such a suggestion. Well, Mr. President, you cannot have it both \nways. If we do not want to be the leader of NATO, then we should \nwithdraw our forces and cut our defense budget. If we want to stop the \nslaughter of innocent men, women, and children in Bosnia, we must be \nwilling to act, even if it means assuming some risks. The world's \nproblems are often complicated. Sometimes it is too much to expect \nantiseptic, risk-free solutions, because they are unreasonable. The \nalternative of isolationism is no alternative, in my opinion, and only \nguarantees our Nation greater problems down the road. We are not \ndeclaring war, we are declaring peace in conjunction with 27 other \ncountries sending in peace-keeping forces at the invitation of the \nprevious warring parties. If we were to renege now, America would lose \nits world respect and surely darken and make more somber other \nchallenges in the future that could come home to haunt us.\n  I urge support for the bipartisan amendment offered and led by the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Frist] is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of American \ntroops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I respectfully, but strongly, \ndisagree with the President's decision to deploy U.S. troops there. It \nwas the wrong decision. And it is that decision that I will address in \nthe next few moments.\n  However, before I do, I want to make it as clear as possible that I \nam 100 percent behind our troops now that the commitment has been made \nand the process has begun to deploy them. I will support them and their \nefforts in every way possible. I will work to see that their mission is \na narrow one, that the exit strategy is clearly defined, and that they \nreturn home as quickly and safely as possible.\n  There are several unsettling aspects of the President's plan to send \ntroops to Bosnia. They are questions that, in other circumstances, \nwould have been asked and answered during open and public congressional \ndebate. Unfortunately, that debate has effectively been denied to the \nAmerican people by the President's unilateral action in committing \nAmerican troops to foreign soil. But I still think it is important to \nask these questions because, perhaps if they are asked this time, then \nnext time they will be answered before we take action.\n  The first question: Is this action in the vital national interest of \nthe United States? Vital national interests can be clearly and \nspecifically defined. They include defense of U.S. territory, support \nof allies who are threatened, support of treaty obligations, or \nprotection of economic interests, international waters or U.S. citizens \nin operations abroad. In other words, Mr. President, vital national \ninterests are interests clearly worth fighting and dying for.\n  I listened to much of the debate yesterday and today and heard many \nof my colleagues address this very issue. Time and time again, the \ndebate returned to the question of whether our reasons for being in \nBosnia would satisfy the mother or the father whose son or daughter is \nkilled there and who turns to us directly and asks, ``Why?''\n  Like my colleagues, I have failed to hear a satisfactory answer. Some \nsay because our credibility is at stake. But is it truly our \ncredibility or perhaps NATO's credibility? Mr. President, I believe the \ntwo may be very different, particularly in a post-cold-war world.\n  Others say, because without us there will be no peace. But where have \nwe been for the last 3 years, and do we really believe that we can \ncreate peace among people who do not want it? Do we really believe that \nour presence for 12 months--for 1 year--will suddenly make the warring \nfactions who have been at it for nearly 500 years suddenly forget what \nthey and their ancestors have been fighting for and live as neighbors \npeacefully? I do not believe so. Mr. President, the situation in \nBosnia, no matter how tragic, does not equate to a vital national \ninterest.\n  A second question: What is Congress' role under the Constitution in \nthe determination to send combat troops into a conflict such as the one \nwe face in Bosnia?\n  Certainly the President has the authority to deploy forces in \nsituations requiring immediate action, especially in situations where \nvital national interests are threatened. But committing 20,000 American \ntroops to hostile territory in an action where no vital U.S. interest \nis at stake, where there is no clearly defined goal or mission, where \nthe factions have been warring for centuries, where the situation, \nsince the initialing of the peace agreement, has clearly deteriorated \nand where casualties, by the administration's own admission, are \ncertain, in my view, necessitated first a full and fair discussion \nbetween the executive branch and Congress. We owe that to the American \npeople and particularly to the American service men and women.\n  The need for an open debate on this matter is further highlighted \nwhen we focus on the peace accord that was reached in Dayton. There are \nreal questions as to whether a bifurcated Bosnian state will survive \nor, more importantly, whether two separate political entities can \nfunction as one country without the constant presence of troops to keep \nthe peace.\n  Even if the Bosnian conflict did involve the vital interests of the \nUnited States, I am concerned that the underlying peace agreement is \nfundamentally flawed. Already we have seen towns burned, American flags \nburned, and demonstrations against the Dayton accord because this is a \nforced peace. And, Mr. President, the fact that we are sending our \ntroops to support this imposed peace plan with little debate in \nCongress and virtually no support from the American people troubles me \ngreatly.\n  Third, and perhaps most importantly, how can we prevent this \nsituation from occurring again in the future? Before that question can \nbe answered, we must first understand how we got to where we are. The \nslippery slope upon which we have now embarked began largely with the \nend of the cold war, when the world reverted to the ethnic, regional \nand subnational violence that characterized it before the rise of the \nbipolar world. \n\n[[Page S18473]]\n\n  Unfortunately, at that time, America failed to define adequately the \nrole it would play. Instead, we began a pattern of committing U.S. \nforces on hastily decided and hastily defined missions of peace, of \npeacekeeping or, tragically, the potential quagmire of peacemaking \nwithout the advice, consent or even the confidence of the Congress and \nthe American people.\n  In each instance, we have seen a President obligate funds and scarce \nmilitary resources and place U.S. lives on the line for missions well \noutside what can reasonably be called the vital national interest. And \nin each instance, rosy administration projections and lofty \nhumanitarian goals bear no resemblance to the outcome of the missions. \nJust look at Somalia and Haiti today. They are sad mockeries of what we \nwere promised they would become once the most powerful military in the \nworld cleaned them up.\n  So we again face the question, How is it that we ultimately discover \nsuch a radical difference between the intentions and the outcome and \nthat the mission is murkier and the price too high?\n  In each and every instance, this disturbing and dangerous precedent \nhas been reinforced, making it ever more likely that the pattern will \nbe repeated again and again, with Congress offering fewer and fewer \nobjections under its authority under the Constitution.\n  It is very similar to the case whereby States' rights fell by the \nwayside in the push for a stronger and ever more powerful Federal \nGovernment.\n  In the absence of vital national interests, a lack of clear mission \nhas combined with the lack of support of the American people, and we \nhave faced a loss of American life. We have ended these missions \nwithout reaching our goals, without achieving any semblance of peace \nand democracy, and at great cost to the real mission of our Armed \nForces: To be ready to defend, with overwhelming force and resolve, the \nreal threats to our life, liberty, and well-being--or those of our \nallies. Again, Mr. President, we need only look toward our recent \nexperiences in Somalia and Haiti.\n  In each of these instances, United States and Presidential \ncredibility is offered as a reason such ill-conceived initiatives \ncannot be opposed. In the case of Bosnia, the Congress and the people \nare not even given the opportunity to approve or disapprove--but simply \nto give our approval and comment after the fact. Some argue that this \nis the President's prerogative under the Constitution, but it is not a \nshining moment in the life of American democracy. We are asking \nAmerica's finest men and women to face possible death for a commitment \noutside of our national interests.\n  And finally, Mr. President, will we continue to commit our blood and \ntreasure to every cause which captures the moment, and which appeals to \nour collective sense of justice and compassion? Or will we finally \ndefine our interests and our policies, so that when a dangerous \nsituation arises again--and it will--and when our credibility and vital \nnational interests are truly on the line, we will be fully prepared to \ndefend them.\n  It's an unfortunate and dangerous chapter in the life of our beloved \ndemocracy, Mr. President, when we are told it was inappropriate to ask \nthese questions earlier, because the matter had not been settled, and \nthat is inappropriate to raise them now, because the decision has \nalready been made.\n  At what point do we have the chance to answer those questions? When \nthey are placed before us, and when it may be too late? The question \nthen becomes, Mr. President: At what point will Americans define \nAmerican interests? I think the time has come to answer these questions \nnow--before we are faced with our next Bosnia.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a unanimous-consent order already \nin effect regarding the Senators who will speak. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the next grouping, following me, would be, first, a \nRepublican, and that name will be supplied by the leader. After that, \nSenator Sarbanes, and then another Republican, and after that, Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as Members of the Senate, the most important \nand really solemn votes that we cast are those which put at risk the \nlives of American servicemen and women.\n  I have long been concerned about the conflict in Bosnia and the \npotential United States military role in ending the conflict in Bosnia. \nMr. President, I have stated on many occasions on this floor, and in \nvarious places in the State of Nevada, that I personally do not believe \nthat U.S. ground troops should be committed to keep the peace in this \ncenturies-old civil war in Europe. But still, Mr. President, I \nrecognize that I am not the Commander in Chief of the armed services of \nthe United States, nor does the President need congressional approval \nto dispatch U.S. troops on this type of a peace mission.\n  Mr. President, I am going to support the resolution that has been \ndrafted by the Senator from Arizona, the majority leader, and the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Nunn. But I say \nthat I support that resolution, not because President Clinton is in \noffice and is a Democrat. I would remind my colleagues, that I stood \nhere and was the first Democrat to publicly support the Desert Storm \noperation in Iraq. I was standing here, and I received a call from \nthen-President Bush. I was getting ready to speak on the floor. I told \nhim that he did not have to ask me, I have already agreed. So I am \ngoing to support this resolution because I believe it is the right \nthing to do, not because the President is a Democrat. I would do the \nsame for a Republican, as I have shown in the past.\n  There comes a time that we in Congress, despite our opinions about a \nPresident's prerogatives, must lay our criticisms aside. I have given \nplenty of criticism on this issue. This is a time, Mr. President, when, \ndespite our opinions, we must lay our criticism aside. As I speak, \ntroops are being deployed in Bosnia. As I speak, troops are on their \nway to Bosnia by train and airplane and other vehicles. Whether this \nBosnian peace agreement will be recorded in the history books as the \nend of a centuries-old conflict remains to be seen. In the meantime, \nthe President has made his decision, and I now believe all Americans \nshould stand behind those whose lives will be on the line in Bosnia.\n  A number of my colleagues have cited the war in Vietnam in their \nstatements in opposition to the deployment in Bosnia. I also would draw \na comparison between the two situations, but for a different reason. \nThe fine young men and women who risked their lives and, in many cases, \nsacrificed their lives in Vietnam had to perform their missions in the \nface of enormous disagreement at home about their presence overseas. \nThey came home to protests, and they came home to anger. We should have \nlearned by now that dissent at home costs American lives, because \ndissent encourages the enemy to kill Americans. Dissent at home costs \nAmerican lives.\n  Our colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona, \nunderstands what a blow that kind of civilian denunciation can mean to \nour military forces. His statements in this Chamber gave me great \npause, as I pondered the vote I must make relative to my own personal \nmisgivings. I commend Senator McCain, a war hero by any measure, for \nthe work he has done on this resolution. I understand that in Arizona \nthe vast majority of people think the President's decision is wrong. It \nis the same in Nevada. Therefore, it gives me even more pause to think \nhow difficult this was for Senator McCain, but how right it was for \nSenator McCain.\n  I also commend the distinguished majority leader for crafting a \ncompromise that gives congressional support for the deployment of \ntroops, but that better clarifies and defines the U.S. mission and the \ncriteria that will determine its success.\n  This mission must not fall into the trap of what is known as mission \ncreep, where an initial goal grows vague and extended. Our troops must \ngo in with a clearly defined and achievable goal and come out in a \ntimely manner. This resolution, the McCain-Dole-Nunn resolution \ncertainly does that.\n  I intend, I think, along with a number of my other colleagues, to \nclosely monitor the progress of the United \n\n[[Page S18474]]\nStates mission in Bosnia, to do it throughout the year. I look forward \nto the return of the American troops--hopefully before the year is out, \ncertainly by the time the year is up.\n  The commanders of NATO and the U.S. military leaders who trained our \ntroops for the mission have taken every step possible to ensure the \ntroops' security, but we know it would be naive to think there will be \nno casualties and we will all grieve the loss of even one American \nlife. But if there is any lesson we learned from Vietnam, it is that we \ncannot send American troops overseas with a denunciation of their \nmission.\n  I choose now to support the Dole-McCain resolution containing some \ndefined parameters for American involvement rather than disagree with \nthe President's decision.\n  I was on the floor earlier today, right before the first vote, when \nthe majority leader made a statement. He clearly defined the \nresolution, and he talked about heroes. John McCain was one he \nmentioned. He mentioned others. But it was interesting to note that he \ndid not talk about himself.\n  We have in this Chamber some people who have sacrificed a great deal \nfor our country. Senator McCain, of course, was a prisoner of war in \nVietnam for 6 years, in solitary confinement for half that time. We \nhave other people who sacrificed a great deal. Senator John Chafee was \na hero in the Second World War and the Korean conflict. Senator Heflin \nsaw service in the Second World War. Senator Glenn was a marine pilot \nin the Second World War, in Korea, and then, of course, was an \nastronaut. We could go on and on with the list of people who sacrificed \na great deal who now are serving their country in the U.S. Senate. But \nI think it is interesting to note Senator Dole did not talk about \nhimself. He has sacrificed as much as anyone in the service to his \ncountry. During the Second World War, he was wounded. He almost died.\n  So I think the record should reflect the courage of Senator Dole in \nsponsoring this amendment and drafting this resolution. It would have \nbeen very easy for Senator Dole--not only the majority leader but a \nPresidential candidate, who likely will be the Republican nominee for \nPresident next year--to have taken the easy way out. Would it not have \nbeen easy for him to demagog this issue and to be opposed to Bill \nClinton? That would have been the easy thing for Robert Dole to do, but \nhe did not do that. It is because of what he did and what Senator \nMcCain did that there are people like Senator Reid of Nevada, willing \nto swallow, maybe, a little bit of pride, and support this resolution \nabout which these two men, who are certifiable heroes, have said: Our \ntroops are on their way there. Some of them are already there. It is \nwrong not to have this body support them in everything that they do \nwhile they are there.\n  So I want the record to reflect the fact that Senator Dole in his \nstatement this morning did not mention his own name. I understand that \nshows humility, but I want the record to reflect that of all the people \nwho served in the U.S. Senate who have records of heroism in service in \nthe military, to our country, no record tops that of Senator Robert \nDole.\n  I do not want the men and women who go to Bosnia--not to make war but \nto support a peace--to wonder whether the American people support them, \nwhether this Congress supports them, and whether this Senator from \nNevada supports them. I support them.\n  The holiday season is upon us. My thoughts and my prayers are with \nthe families who will not be together this year because of this \ndeployment. We have seen them interviewed on CNN and in other news \nstories, how they are going to spend Christmas away from their wives \nand children and husbands. I commend the men and women who will serve \nthis Nation with honor and courage in Bosnia. I do so with faith and \nhope in their ability to achieve this mission of bringing peace and \nstability to Europe.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request I would \nlike to propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add to the sequence that has presently \nbeen placed in the Record a Republican Senator; following that will be \nSenator Dodd; after that, a Republican Senator; after that, Senator \nBryan; after that, a Republican Senator; after that, Senator Dorgan; \nafter that, a Republican Senator; after that, Senator Glenn; after \nthat, a Republican Senator; after that, Senator Harkin; after that, a \nRepublican Senator, and after that, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the most weighty factor in deciding how \nto vote on the Bosnian resolution is that United States troops will be \ndeployed in Bosnia regardless of what Congress does, since there are \nnot enough votes to cut off the funding. In fact, the advanced troops \nare already in Bosnia. Not only is the congressional vote \nnondeterminative, but the debate has been advanced and the votes \nexpedited in the expectation that there will be some show of \ncongressional support to bolster our troops' morale. Certainly we \nshould do that. So that with the troops on the way and the \ncongressional vote nondeterminative, all the Congress can do now is to \nmake the best of it.\n  After extensive discussions with my constituents, my colleagues in \nthe Senate, and executive branch officials, it is my view that the \nUnited States does not have a vital national interest in Bosnia to \njustify sending United States troops there. When President Clinton \ncalled me, almost 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, seeking my support, I asked the \nPresident what was the vital United States national interest. He \nresponded by commenting on the widespread killing.\n  I said I was very concerned about the atrocities, the mass killings \nand genocide, but asked him how that distinguished Bosnia from Rwanda \nor other trouble spots around the world. President Clinton then warned \nabout the conflict spreading to other nations of Central Europe.\n  I asked if that posed a security threat to members of NATO, which \nwould activate our treaty obligations on the principle that an attack \non one is an attack on all. The President said that he was not basing \nthe national security interest on a treaty obligation on that issue.\n  In extended informal discussions with colleagues, some Senators have \nargued that a vital United States national interest arises in a number \nof contexts. For example, some contend that the stability of Central \nEurope is vital to U.S. security. Other Senators have said that an \nopportunity to involve Russia in the joint action with NATO rises to \nthe level of a vital national interest. Others say that there is a \nvital United States national interest in ousting the Iranians from \nBosnia, so that the fundamentalists do not gain a foothold in that \nimportant region.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger articulates a vital U.S. \ninterest in the following way.\n\n       The paradox of the decision before Congress is that, while \n     we have no inherent national interest to justify the sending \n     of troops, a vital national interest has been created by the \n     administration's policy.\n\n  Dr. Kissinger continues:\n\n       If other nations cease to believe our assurances, our \n     capacity to shape events, to protect American security and \n     values will be jeopardized.\n\n  The problem with Dr. Kissinger's analysis is that it gives the \nPresident the power to create a vital national interest by unilaterally \nmaking an American commitment without the consent of Congress in the \ncontext where the consent of Congress is necessary to bind the United \nStates. My own judgment is that those considerations do not aggregate \nto a vital United States national interest.\n  U.S. national security is not imminently threatened, and we are not \nthe world's policeman. It may be that at some point there will be \nconsideration to the deployment of U.S. troops for international moral \ncommitments or from some other standard, but the vital national \ninterest context has been that which has traditionally governed the \ndeployment of U.S. military personnel. So far, they are proposed to be \nonly peacekeepers. But it is a short distance from being peacekeepers \nto being in harm's way, and really, even being peacekeepers is in \nharm's way, with the troops that are already there being apprehensive \nabout taking a step off a tarmac out of concern about stepping on a \nlandmine. \n\n[[Page S18475]]\n\n  In 1991 on this floor I had the privilege to participate in the \ndebate on the resolution for the use of force as to the gulf war. I \nbelieve that it was indispensable that Congress pass on that matter, \neven though it was a Republican President, President Bush, who in late \n1990 said a number of things about dispatching troops there involving \nthe United States without congressional approval. But ultimately the \nPresident did bring back the issue to the House and to the Senate. And \nwe had debates about vital national interest. A number of us were on \nthe floor at that time--Senator Warner, Senator Nunn, and others--and \ncomments in the media were that it was a historic debate about what are \nUnited States vital national interests.\n  At least, in my own judgment, we have not seen the establishment of \nthe vital national interest in what we have present today in Bosnia. \nBut that is a judgment call like so many other judgments that we have \nhere.\n  In the absence of a vital national interest, it is my judgment that \nthe Congress should support the troops, without endorsing the \nPresident's policy. Our congressional action should show as much \nnational unity as possible under the circumstances and project American \nleadership to the maximum extent possible consistent with congressional \npolicy not to give the President a blank check.\n  It is obviously going to be a tough winter and a tough year for our \ntroops so we should be as supportive as possible where they are \nconcerned.\n  I am encouraged by the testimony presented to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee from the executive branch. We convened those hearings in the \nIntelligence Committee, which I chair. The executive branch officials \ntestified that our troops will be authorized by the rules of engagement \nto defend themselves on their finding of hostile intent rather than \nhostile action.\n  That means that our troops will not have to wait until they are shot \nat; but they can take preemptive action if they conclude that there is \nhostile intent. The anticipation of hostile action gives them the \ndiscretion to make the judgment that preemptive action is warranted.\n  It is obviously problemsome on U.S. international relationships for \nthe Congress to pull out the rug from the President's unilateral \ncommitments to our allies. However, it is fundamental in our \nconstitutional separation of power that the President's authority in \nforeign policy and as Commander in Chief is limited by Congress' \nauthority on appropriations and the declaration of war. And the \nFounding Fathers were explicit in having that kind of a separation of \npowers, and that is what we are concerned about here today.\n\n  My preference, as I expressed it to the President in our \nconversation, was that the President come to the Congress with \nauthorization in advance of dispatching the troops to Bosnia. We have \nlearned from the bitter experience of Vietnam that the United States \ncannot prosecute a war, or really any extended military operation, \nwithout the backing of the American people. And the first line of that \ndetermination is to have the backing of the Congress. The President \nchose not to do so.\n  When we take a look at what our allies' expectation has been, or \nshould be, we have to note that repeatedly congressional action in \nopposing President Clinton's Bosnia policy has put our allies squarely \non notice that the Congress might well disavow the President's \npromises. It was plain on the public record that the Congress voted \noverwhelmingly to lift the arms embargo unilaterally to allow the \nBosnian Moslems to defend themselves against Serbian atrocities. In the \nSenate we had a vote of 69 to 29. In the House the vote was 298 to 128. \nAll of that required a Presidential veto. And it was only after those \noverwhelming votes occurred in both Houses of Congress that the \nPresident's policy in Bosnia was activated.\n  For a long period of time many of us had urged the executive branch \nto undertake massive bombing using our tremendous air power, and we \nwere met with the response that in the absence of ground troops the \nbombing would not be effective. Once that bombing was initiated, \nhowever, quite the opposite occurred from what the administration and \nthe Department of Defense officials had predicted, and it brought the \nBosnian Serbs to their knees. It brought them to the bargaining table. \nAnd this agreement has been worked out.\n  But it is in this context of the very severe disagreement that has \nbeen expressed by this Senator--and many others on this floor and in \nthe House of Representatives--that the allies, the other party \nsignatory to the agreement in Dayton, have been squarely on notice that \nthe Congress might well disagree with the President.\n  The institutional conflicts between the Congress and the President on \nforeign policy have a long history. Many have challenged the \nPresident's actions in ordering United States troops to fight wars \nwithout congressional authorization in Korea and Vietnam. The War \nPowers Act was an effort to establish constitutional balance. But that \nWar Powers Act met with little success.\n  President Clinton took the initiative in ordering an invasion of \nHaiti in the face of overwhelming congressional resolutions expressing \ndisapproval of that Presidential action. Fortunately, it turned out to \nbe a bloodless invasion when potential opposition withdrew.\n  So, Mr. President, our allies have been on notice. Depending on \nfuture events, the Congress may have to assert its authority to cut off \nfunding, if we conclude that the President has exceeded his authority \nor has pursued unwise policies. Those are congressional prerogatives, \nand under our constitutional system of separation of powers they have \nto be zealously guarded and observed. But since the President is not \nnow usurping congressional authority to involve the United States in \nwar, and since the votes are obviously not present to cut off funding, \nwe should make the best of the situation in formulating a resolution to \nsupport the troops, and demonstrate as much national unity as possible.\n  To the extent possible, the resolution should impose the maximum \npressure to strengthen the Bosnian Moslems militarily to establish a \nbalance of power in that area so that our troops may be withdrawn at \nthe earliest practical date. An exit policy from Bosnia will turn on \nthere being a balance of power there.\n  It is critical for the United States and its NATO allies to \narticulate a plan for equipping and training the Bosnian Army. \nRegrettably, the administration has been reluctant to articulate such a \npolicy. But, in letters just publicized yesterday and today, we may \nhave those assurances. And those assurances and that action ought to be \nsubject to the maximum possible congressional power and persuasion.\n  Arming the Bosnians is critical for two reasons.\n  First, it will help ensure a balance of power in the region--a \nbalance that currently favors Serbia and Croatia.\n  Second, the Bosnian Army must be armed before the NATO implementation \nforce can leave. As former Under Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, \nrecently noted, ``Until the Bosnians have the capability of defending \nthemselves, it will be impossible for us to withdraw without terrible \nconsequences.''\n  In addition, we should do our best to use the current situation in \nBosnia to establish important international law precedents against \ngenocide, and to prosecute war criminals.\n  Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and army commander Ratko Mladic \nand others under indictment should be brought to trial in the War \nCrimes Tribunal. This is a unique opportunity to follow up on the \nNuremberg precedent and to establish an international rule of law.\n  Since 1989 the United States has been a signatory to the \nInternational Genocide Convention. The United States has been a leader \nin instituting the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  For years, I have pressed resolutions adopted by the Congress to set \nup an international criminal court with the principal thrust to control \ninternational terrorism and drug dealing.\n  It has been my view that, while it has been impossible to get \ncountries like Colombia to extradite to the United States, if there \nwere an international criminal court, that might be doable in a \npractical political context. And we have yet to be able to put our \nhands on the Libyans under indictment for the terrorism against Pan Am \n103.\n  And there again, if an international criminal court were present, it \nmight \n\n[[Page S18476]]\nbe possible to have extradition to such a court if extradition to \nScotland or England or the United States cannot be obtained. And it is \nvery important for us to press ahead on these prosecutions under the \nWar Crimes Tribunal.\n  In 1993, my amendment was adopted to provide $3 million to assist the \nprosecutor in gathering evidence against those who committed atrocities \nand mass killings in Bosnia. We should press all parties to the peace \nagreement to make their maximum efforts to bring the war criminals to \ntrial. My recent meeting with Chief Prosecutor Justice Goldstone \nprovides encouragement that a significant international legal precedent \ncan be achieved in that tribunal. International action against mass \nkillings and genocide would promote an important goal of the law of \nnations.\n  My discussions with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and \nNational Security Adviser Anthony Lake provide reassurance on the firm \nU.S. policy to bring the war criminals to trial. For myself and many \nothers in the Congress, continued support of the Bosnian operation \nwould be materially affected by the intensity demonstrated to bring \nsuch war criminals to justice.\n  While I do think it an unwise policy to deploy United States troops \nto Bosnia, I am very much concerned about the kind of isolationist \nrhetoric that we have heard in this Chamber in the past 2 days. I have \nconsistently supported a robust national defense and a robust foreign \npolicy by the United States, an attitude gleaned from my earliest days \nstudying international relations as a student many years ago at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\n  The United States should not turn to isolationism, but neither should \nwe turn to being the policeman of the world when there are incidents \naround the world, and so many of them, without having a vital U.S. \nnational interest involved. But weapons systems, army divisions, and \naircraft carriers are not enough to ensure our security. We must be \ncommitted to the notion that the United States needs to be engaged \nthroughout the world diplomatically, economically, militarily, and \nalways carefully. We need to use all our instruments of national power \nto shape the international security environment in a way that \nguarantees American security. In my judgment, for the reasons I have \noutlined, Bosnia and the Balkans do not rise to that level. But by the \nsame token, we must be careful to resist instantaneous or knee-jerk \nreactions to any use of U.S. military force even where we did so in \nDesert Storm.\n  Mr. President, these are obviously matters of great complexity. We \nvote on them in a series of resolutions trying to exercise our best \njudgment, knowing that the troops are on the way, whatever we do. We \nobviously will follow the matter very closely through our congressional \naction in a variety of committees, including the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, which I chair, to bring our best judgment to bear on the \nBosnian situation, to support the troops wherever we can and to bring \nthem home as soon and as safely as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair very much.\n  I rise today in support of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia as long \nas it remains a peacekeeping mission. I also rise to express my strong \nsupport for our men and women in uniform who will be one-third of the \npeacekeeping force.\n  We are here debating one of the most difficult and important \ndecisions to face us as legislators, the deployment of American troops \noverseas. The commitment of our troops is never an issue to be taken \nlightly, so I thank the leadership for bringing this issue to the \nfloor.\n  I also wish to thank those committees that have held hearings on this \nissue over the past few weeks and the administration witnesses who have \nanswered questions openly, candidly, and directly. These hearings have \nproven very informative and have helped me to reach my decision.\n  I support the participation of U.S. troops in I-For first and \nforemost because the mission as spelled out by the President and \nsubsequently by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff is a true peacekeeping mission. This is not like the \nPersian Gulf war when we were sending our men and women off to fight a \nwar. We are sending our men and women to be one-third of a peacekeeping \nforce, keeping the peace as a result of the Dayton peace accord which \nis supported by all the parties involved.\n  This is a point I believe must be made perfectly clear. The major \ncombatants in Bosnia support this peace agreement. We are not going to \nBosnia to force a United States vision of peace upon them. We are going \nto help implement their vision, their agreement.\n  If we were not truly peacekeepers, I could not support this mission, \nand if at some future date the Dayton peace agreement changes course, I \nwill immediately reevaluate my position.\n  I have listened with great interest to Secretary Perry, General \nShalikashvili, and other military and civilian leaders who have \nexplained the rules of engagement for our troops in Bosnia. When I was \na member of the House Armed Services Committee, I realized how crucial \nit is for our troops to have very clear rules of engagement. I have \nseen tragedy occur, and we have lost men and women in uniform because \nthe rules were unclear. In my view, it is essential that our troops \nhave the ability to aggressively respond to threats to themselves or to \ntheir mission. They must not be required to consult with anyone before \nresponding to a potentially life-threatening situation.\n  On this point, I quote the Secretary of Defense, William Perry, who \nsaid:\n\n       If our forces are attacked or if hostile intent is \n     demonstrated by opposing forces, our rules of engagement will \n     permit the immediate and effective use of deadly force.\n\n  In all of his speeches, the President has been very clear on this \npoint. The message he has sent is clear and unmistakable: the first \nenemy that tries to harm our troops will never forget the lesson of the \nfateful misjudgment of our power.\n  So the mission is clear and the rules of engagement are robust. The \nfinal element is to assure that our exit strategy is adequate and, in \nmy view, it is. After close examination, I am satisfied on these \npoints.\n  The administration has publicly stated that our troops will come home \nin about a year. I support that kind of a timeframe. Our mission is to \nkeep peace for about a year, and after that it is up to the parties to \nthe agreement to sustain it. When we leave, we must leave with a much \nmore balanced situation in terms of military balance. And I am pleased \nthat Members of Congress have talked to the administration about this, \nand have received clear assurances that when we leave we will not go \nback to the status quo. This is very important.\n\n  I want to make it clear that I support our participation in the \npeacekeeping force, not because the President wants it but because I \nbelieve it is the right thing to do. I know that some have argued we \nshould support deploying our troops simply because the President has \ncommitted us and we must not act to undermine the Presidency. However, \nI take a different view. I believe that as the President accepts \nresponsibility for his decision as Commander in Chief, we must accept \nfull responsibility for our vote on this matter.\n  I believe that the Congress has the absolute right to deny any \nPresident the funds to carry out this or any other mission. In this \ncase, I did not vote to deny the President the funds, and I will not \nsupport the Hutchison amendment. However, the Senator from Texas has \nevery right to offer it, and every Member here has every right to vote \nfor it, just as they had every right to vote for the prior amendment we \njust disposed of which dealt with cutting off funds.\n  So I believe that when I cast a vote for the Dole-McCain-Nunn \namendment, I am doing the right thing, and I take full responsibility \nfor it. I am not ducking behind it and saying it is because the \nPresident thinks it is the right thing to do. I have not voted with \nthis President before on the question of Bosnia. I have voted, in fact, \nagainst him on two other occasions. When I vote for this, I do not do \nso as a weak partner of the executive branch but as a strong partner. \nIf at some future time I disagree with the administration policy, as I \nhave done in the past, I will speak out and vote accordingly. \n\n[[Page S18477]]\n\n  We now have the opportunity to help bring peace to Bosnia. I believe \nthat as long as our troops are part of a larger force, as long as the \nmission is peace and as long as we have an approximate exit date, I \nwill be supportive of this mission.\n  Mr. President, it is a rare moment in history that we have a chance \nto stop a genocide and generations of hatred. It is rare that we have a \nchance to stop the spread of war in a region where we have lost \nthousands and thousands of Americans. Some of our very own colleagues \nwalk on this floor with the wounds of those wars.\n  This is not some area of the world where war is unknown. Sadly, it \nis. We have seen war spread. Now, maybe, just maybe, the President has \ndone something here that will stop a war from spreading. We do not know \nthat. I may be back on this floor saying, ``Bring the troops home. I \nwas wrong.''\n  But in the war that I well remember that got me into politics, the \nVietnam war, we said, ``Give peace a chance'' in those days, and I \nthink ``give peace a chance'' has not lost its meaning in this \ncircumstance, after generations of genocide and hatred. I lost part of \nmy family in a genocide.\n  Now we have a chance to stop it. At the minimum--at the minimum--if \nthings go reasonably well, when we leave there we will leave there in a \nway where the various parties to this conflict are at least on a level \nplaying field, which I think is very, very important. If there is a \npause in the fighting, it may lead to a lasting peace as a result of \nour participation in this force.\n  So let us give this peace a chance as long as it is truly a \npeacekeeping operation. Let us support our men and women who are going \nover there in a tough time, Christmastime. Let us not send signals of \nequivocation about that support. Let us support the Dole-McCain-Nunn \namendment.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Domenici and \nthen Senator Kerrey are to be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak at the time \nthat Senator Domenici was originally to be recognized in the unanimous-\nconsent agreement, and that he take the place that I had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator from Virginia let me make one more \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names \nof Senators Hatch and Chafee be added to the next available Republican \nslots, which I believe would follow Leahy and Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. And I thank the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia leaves the floor, I'd like to say I was greatly taken by her \nclosing remarks. And I think I jotted it down accurately. I may be \nwrong. ``I may be back here on the floor asking that we bring our \ntroops home.''\n  I say to the Senator, that is precisely why I oppose this \nPresidential decision to send to Bosnia a third significant element of \nU.S. troops--that is, troops on the ground. This Nation experienced the \nproblem of Congress acting to withdraw our troops from Lebanon. This \nNation experienced that problem in Somalia. I happened to have been on \nthis floor protecting Presidential prerogative--at the time we took \nserious casualties in Somalia, some 18 killed in one day and some 80-\nplus wounded on that same day--and I said it is the President's \ndecision as Commander in Chief when a military mission is completed and \nwhen our forces should be brought home.\n  We had a very vigorous battle right here on the floor of the Senate \nabout that Somalia situation. And it was a tough fight to establish the \nPresident's clear right to determine when to bring those troops home \nand not rush to judgment in the sorrow of those severe casualties.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I respond?\n  Mr. WARNER. This is what bothered me. The credibility of the United \nStates of America will be far more endangered if we are faced in 6 or 8 \nmonths with a decision to bring our troops home because of casualties \nand other unforeseen problems, than if we make the stand now not to go \nforward with this mission.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a very brief moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I do not yield the floor, but for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand.\n  I just wanted to respond to my friend. I will, of course, put it in \nthe form of a question. But the deployments that my friend talked about \nI did not support. I come here to say that I think it is worth a try in \nan area of the world where we have lost thousands and thousands and \nthousands of Americans.\n  If the Senator believes that there is no chance that this war can \nspread and this mission cannot change that and is not important and is \nnot worth trying, then he should absolutely vote against the Dole-\nMcCain amendment. And I respect his right.\n  All this Senator is saying is that I have waited, and I believe--and \nI take full responsibility for that vote, and I respect my friend if he \ncomes down on the other side--in this part of the world we have an \nopportunity to make a difference for peace. If it does not work out, we \nat least have tried to do so.\n  I do view it quite differently than in the other areas that my friend \nhas pointed to. I did not support those deployments, I say to my \nfriend.\n  I guess I did not have a question. I merely wanted to respond, but I \nhave the utmost respect for my friend for whatever conclusion he \nreaches, and I hope he would have that same respect for this Senator if \nshe comes down on the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from California, \nthis vote is a clear vote of conscience, not politics, and each of us \nhas to draw on our own life experiences, our own best judgment and make \nthis tough decision.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am on the side opposite the Senator from California and \nwill oppose the President's deployment decision.\n  Mr. President, I will go into some detail regarding my concerns. \nIndeed, this is one of the most important debates that I have been \nprivileged to participate in in the recent history of the U.S. Senate. \nOur Nation has experienced a gradually growing involvement of its Armed \nForces in the tragic civil war in Bosnia and other contiguous areas in \nthe former Yugoslavia.\n  Over the past year, U.S. airmen have flown the majority of the air \nmissions over Bosnia, and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel \nstationed in the Adriatic off the Dalmatian coast have provided a very \nsignificant percentage of the ships and personnel involved in the naval \noperations in that region.\n  America is heavily committed militarily with its NATO allies and \nothers at this very moment. There is a misconception that we are not \ninvolved in Bosnia and that we have to go. Wrong. We are there, very \nsignificantly, at this particular time, and we have been there for \nalmost two years.\n  But now the President has directed a further and very significant \nexpansion of U.S. military involvement. I credit the President, the \nSecretary of State, and others for working out an agreement which I do \nnot refer to as a peace agreement. Nevertheless, it is an agreement \nthat has led to a very substantial lessening of the hostilities. It is \nan agreement that possibly could at some future date form the \nfoundation for a cessation of hostilities, but I do not find that \ncondition to exist now.\n  Therefore, the President has ordered ground troops, some 20,000, for \nactual deployment to Bosnia and approximately another 14,000 to be \ndeployed to nearby geographic regions as support and backup forces.\n  It is interesting, when this mission was first described by the \nPresident back in February 1993, it was always said that we were going \nto send in 20,000 ground troops. But now we learn that almost a force \nof equal size will be required as backup. That is prudent military \nplanning, but the initial impression across the land was of a lesser \nnumber. \n\n[[Page S18478]]\n\n  Ever since this Presidential decision nearly 2 years ago, I have \nconsistently expressed my concerns. Today, I join with many other \nSenators in expressing my total disagreement with the President. I do \nso respectful of his role as President, as Commander in Chief, but I am \nsure the President recognizes I have a right to express my views and I \ndo so as a matter of conscience.\n  President Clinton made this decision on his own, without that level \nof consultation from the Congress that I believe was necessary and \nmight have contributed to a different decision.\n  And now the Congress is left with trying to decide how best, as the \nelected representatives of the people, we can ensure that the voice of \nthe American people is heard. I am privileged to do so on behalf of \nmany, many Virginians with whom I have visited and from whom I have \nheard over the past months.\n  Mr. President, I have always been a strong supporter of Presidential \nconstitutional prerogatives in the area of foreign policy--I expressed \nthat in my colloquy with the distinguished Senator from California--and \nparticularly the President's authority as Commander in Chief. This very \nphrase is embodied in our Constitution. As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the right to deploy, send beyond our shores into harm's \nway if necessary, the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates.\n  Presidents have judiciously exercised that awesome power since the \nvery formative days of our Republic. Therefore, I do not challenge the \nconstitutional authority of the President to deploy United States \nground troops to Bosnia. He has that right under the Constitution. I \ndo, however, challenge the wisdom of President Clinton's decision to \ninvolve this third significant element of United States forces, namely \non the ground in the territory of Bosnia.\n  On the question of constitutional authority on this matter, I ask \nunanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a very fine analysis of that issue by Lloyd \nCutler, former Counsel to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since the beginning of the conflict in \nBosnia in 1992, as I said, I have consistently opposed the use of \nUnited States ground troops. Today, we are faced with the situation of \nwhat do we do now, given the President's commitment? My votes today \nexpressing opposition to this Presidential decision go back to the \nfundamental question: Does the United States have a vital--and I repeat \nand emphasize the word ``vital''--national security interest at stake \nin this region of the world, such vital security interest of a level \nthat would justify the added deployment of United States ground troops \ninto a region that we know is fraught with risk?\n  I see on the floor the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I was \nprivileged to accompany him to this region, the region of Krajina, in \nearly September. We saw with our own eyes the ravages of this war-torn \nregion. We looked into the faces of the refugees, combatants and \nnoncombatants alike. This was the fifth in a series of trips I have \nconducted to this region over the years since the conflict has started.\n  I wish to acknowledge, Mr. President, to my colleague, how much I \nvalue the opportunity to travel with this distinguished Senator, a \nformer naval officer, highly decorated, a man whose judgment and \nopinion I greatly value on military matters.\n  The reason I raise this is that I wish to apply a test to this \ndeployment decision along these lines: Would I be able to go into the \nhome of a service person who had been either killed or wounded in \nBosnia as a consequence of this proposed deployment and explain to a \nparent or a spouse or a child why their loved one was sent to Bosnia \nand why their sacrifice was justified?\n  This is a duty I performed earlier in life as a young Marine officer \nand again as Secretary of the Navy, and it is not an easy one, Mr. \nPresident. I apply that test today.\n  I could not justify such a sacrifice, given the current situation in \nthat region and the current status diplomatically and militarily of all \nthe circumstances surrounding this peace accord.\n  I have listened carefully to the administration's justification for \nthis deployment, but I do not find a vital United States national \nsecurity interest at stake in Bosnia that would justify the use of \nground troops at this time in that nation.\n  I do not want to see further American casualties in trying to resolve \na civil war, based on centuries-old religious and cultural hatreds, \nwhich none of us understand. I certainly say, as hard as I have \nstudied, and based on five trips, I do not understand how people in \nthis civilized age of mankind can treat one another this way. These are \nwell-educated people. Yet, they behave in such a manner as to be on the \nborderline of savagery. I cannot understand it, Mr. President.\n  I remember so well a hearing of the Armed Services Committee in the \naftermath of Somalia. I remember a Col. Larry Joyce, the father of a \nyoung Ranger who was killed in the October 3-4 raid in Somalia which I \ndescribed earlier. He came before the committee and he said to the \nSenators as follows:\n\n       Too frequently, policymakers are insulated from the misery \n     they create. If they could be with the chaplain who rings the \n     doorbell at 6:20 in the morning to tell a 22-year-old woman \n     she is now a widow, they would develop their policies more \n     carefully.\n\n  I would hope that the Somalia experience would cause us to more \ncarefully consider the policy decisions that put at risk the men and \nwomen who serve in the Armed Forces.\n  I have been deeply moved, as has every other Member of the Senate, \nand indeed all Americans, by the suffering we have seen in Bosnia as a \nconsequence of the hatreds and atrocities in that region. I have seen \nit in their faces, in the hospitals we visited and in the wanton \ndestruction of the homes and properties--homes which are so essential \nfor the return of the many refugees. Senator Kerrey and I witnessed, as \nwe went through the villages, a row of houses, and one house with the \ngeraniums out, the fresh laundry hanging out, and the house right next \nto it was flattened to the ground--flattened because it was once \noccupied by a Serb. That Serb had fled this village where he or she or \nthe family had lived for years with their neighbors, but they were \nforced to leave in the face of the Croatian military advance. And the \nlocals destroyed the Serb house--the house being a symbol of their \nhatred for that individual--and they blew it up, destroyed it, so that \nit would be of no use to anyone ever again. We saw that, as the Senator \nwill recall, in village after village--a manifestation of hatred, which \nwe cannot understand.\n  I remember so well the Secretary of Defense in his testimony before \nour committee saying, ``My greatest fear in this operation is the \nhatreds among the people in the region.'' That is what concerns me. I \ndo not want to see 20,000 U.S. troops placed in the middle of this 500-\nyear-old sea of hatred.\n  Mr. President, we have heard President Clinton say that United States \ntroops are not being sent to Bosnia to fight a war, but rather to help \nimplement a peace agreement. According to a December 2 radio address by \nthe President, ``It is a peace that the people of Bosnia want. It is a \npeace that they have demanded.''\n  Yet, I say to my colleagues, most respectfully, I disagree with the \nPresident's assessment. I think the events of recent days, of recent \nweeks, of recent months, have been a harbinger of things to come. At \nthe very time IFOR is beginning its deployment to Bosnia, Bosnian \nCroats are burning villages which will be returned to Bosnian Serb \ncontrol--villages which we, the West, will have to rebuild. Reach into \nyour pockets and take out the funds we are going to be asked to \ncontribute to rebuild these houses, which have been wantonly destroyed, \nnot as a consequence of troops marching through--in some instances, \nyes--but largely because of the hatred that exists.\n  These are not the actions of a people who have embraced a peace. At \nthis point, all we can really say is that the three leaders of this \nregion have done their best to work out an agreement. But only time \nwill tell the extent to which the people will eventually embrace this \nagreement.\n  Nevertheless, the President has made a decision, and it is within his \nconstitutional authority. The troops are being deployed. Initial \nelements have already arrived. We have seen the pride \n\n[[Page S18479]]\nwith which the Marines and others have unfurled Old Glory on Bosnian \nsoil. We salute them and we say: One and all, we in this Chamber \nunanimously support our troops.\n  It has been my privilege to work for 17 years on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and to visit our troops many times throughout the \nworld, wherever they have been deployed--in the Persian Gulf region, \nSomalia, and other areas--and to see our troops in action. So I commit \nmyself unequivocally, in the same way I have throughout my entire adult \nlife, to their support.\n  On that point, I would like to address an issue which I do not think \nhas been addressed by any other Senator to date, and it concerns me \ngreatly. Frequently, I have heard a few individuals in high positions, \nboth in the executive branch and in the Congress of the United States, \nmake a statement along the lines that, ``Well, they are volunteers, \nthey can go.''\n  Mr. President, we are very proud in our country to have the All-\nVolunteer Force. It originated, again, when I was privileged to be the \nSecretary of the Navy in the Department of Defense, and it was a direct \ndecision from the then-Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird. Having \nheard these statements and becoming greatly troubled, I contacted the \nformer Secretary and asked for his views. For the Record I would like \nto explain how we decided to have this force. During Vietnam there was \na great strife across this Nation, much of that strife directed at \nforce conscription and the draft, and President Nixon and Secretary \nLaird said they were going to take a risk and initiate the All-\nVolunteer Force.\n  I will read from Mr. Laird's letter of December 12, 1995. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Melvin R. Laird,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The President's decision to commit \n     United States military forces to Bosnia has brought renewed \n     attention to the high level of patriotism and professionalism \n     of the women and men who serve as members of the All-\n     Volunteer Force.\n       The All-Volunteer Force was instituted during our service \n     at DoD, yours as Secretary of the Navy and mine as Secretary \n     of Defense. I regard the termination of the draft and the \n     successful creation of the All-Volunteer Armed Force as the \n     most defining action taken during my service as Secretary.\n       At this time of placing American military personnel in \n     harms way, it is well to recall that the All-Volunteer Force \n     came into being to end the inequities of pay and service of \n     military conscription and to pay, train, and equip our \n     military forces as professionals. That has been accomplished \n     in large measure. Our country has the finest military force \n     in its history. Because they have volunteered, as opposed to \n     being drafted for military service, does not mean there can \n     be less of a standard for when it's in our vital national \n     interest to interject them into a dangerous environment.\n       It is important that the genesis for the All-Volunteer \n     Force be a part of consideration for the justification for \n     deployment of our military force.\n       With best wishes and kindest personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Melvin R. Laird.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. He stated:\n\n       Because they have volunteered, as opposed to being drafted \n     for militry service, it does not mean there can be less of a \n     standard for when it is in our vital national interest to \n     interject them into a dangerous environment.\n\n  That is right on point, Secretary Laird. You are the father of the \nAll-Volunteer Force. It has worked, and worked beyond our expectations, \nto the benefit of this country. I would not like to see this debate, in \nany way, erode the proud All-Volunteer Force concept that we have \ntoday.\n  The clear implication of those critics that use this phrase, ``Well, \nthey are volunteers,'' is that we are willing to send those who serve \nin the volunteer force to a foreign land to do missions and take risks \nthat we would not have asked of a military draftee. Wrong. This is an \natrocious implication. I hope the Members of this Senate will dispel \nany idea that, because currently the members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States are all volunteers, that they should be treated with any \nless concern than we have for generations treated previous members of \nthe Armed Forces, whether they were draftees, Reserves called up, \nvoluntarily or involuntarily, whatever the case may be. Once they don \nthat uniform they deserve no less than the highest concern by the \nCongress, and indeed the President.\n  Americans willing to ask these volunteers to risk their lives in the \nperformance of missions that do not fit the clear test of being in the \nvital national security interests of this country have to ask \nthemselves a question. When the Congress decided we would fill the \nranks of our military with volunteers--a policy, as I said, that was \ninitiated in the latter part of the Vietnam war, 1972-73--one of the \nconcerns expressed at that time was that our military might be viewed \nas a mercenary force. Is that now the case?\n  You will recall from your history that the concept of mercenaries \nprevailed through much of Europe, in the history of the Middle Ages \nand, indeed, into this century. In fact, Great Britain sent mercenaries \nto our colonies, often, to try to subjugate us.\n  Anyway, I believe that every Senator in this body will agree that \nwhile soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, today are volunteers, they \nare not mercenaries. So let us put to an end any comment about, ``since \nthey are volunteers, they deserve any less measure of concern by the \nCongress.'' The Congress stands, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 12 \nmonths a year, as trustees--trustees to guard the safety and the \nwelfare of those who wear the uniform and of the families here at home \nwho await them.\n  There are many aspects of this I-FoR deployment which I find \ntroubling. First and foremost, I do not believe the mission of I-FoR \nhas been carefully and clearly articulated. In addition to the specific \nmilitary tasks with which I-For is charged in the Dayton accords, there \nare a list of supporting tasks which, in my view, will inevitably lead \nto mission creep and to I-FoR's involvement in implementing the \nnonmilitary aspects of the peace agreement.\n  For example, I-FoR is called on to assist the UNHCR, the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees, and other international organizations, in \ntheir humanitarian missions, to prevent interference with the movement \nof civilian populations and refugees, and to respond to deliberate \nviolence to life and person. It is not clear what guidelines, if any, \nhave been given to the commanders on the ground to help those \ncommanders determine when I-FoR should get involved in these supporting \ntasks. This must be clarified and the mission strictly limited to \nimplementing the military aspects of the agreement. I think that should \nbe done before another soldier, sailor, airman, or marine departs to go \nto that region.\n  I am also concerned about the administration's lack of an adequate \nexit strategy and an announced time limit of 12 months for this \nmission. Just announcing that we will leave in 12 months is not an exit \nstrategy. We have to make sure that there is a balance of military \npower between these warring factions. That balance will serve as a far \nbetter deterrent, far better than anything else we can do.\n  I salute the distinguished majority leader, the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole]. I have joined him in the past year, in trying to implement \nthe concept of assisting one of those factions, the Bosnian Moslems, \nand bringing their level of armaments up to where they can possess a \ndeterrent to attack.\n  I think it is naive to believe in 12 months the United States and \nNATO military involvement will wipe away centuries-old hostilities. \nWhat I fear we are facing is a temporary lull in the fighting until the \ninternational community withdraws its troops. Then, I ask my \ncolleagues, what will happen to the credibility of the United States \nand NATO if this mission ends inconclusively, or is possibly even \njudged to be a failure because the conflict resumes after we depart?\n  Remember, remember those pictures of our brave Marines as they left \nSomalia with the people on the shore firing at them as they disembarked \nin their small craft to go out to a larger American warship and return \nhome. I do not forget that. I do not forget those instances.\n  Because of the serious concerns which I have outlined, I will vote to \noppose this deployment of U.S. ground \n\n[[Page S18480]]\ntroops. This was not an easy decision for any of us to make but I do it \nas a matter of conscience. However, if that full deployment is to occur \nand does occur, then I will, as I have in every day I have served in \nthis U.S. Senate, support the troops 100 percent in every way I know \nhow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent editorials on this \nsituation by the former distinguished Secretary of the Navy James Webb, \nand by a former professional Army officer, Col. Harry Summers, be \nprinted in the Record and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 28, 1995]\n\n                      Remember the Nixon Doctrine\n\n                            (By James Webb)\n\n       The Clinton Administration's insistence on putting 20,000 \n     American troops into Bosnia should be seized on by national \n     leaders, particularly those running for President, to force a \n     long-overdue debate on the worldwide obligations of our \n     military.\n       While the Balkan factions may be immersed in their \n     struggle, and Europeans may feel threatened by it, for \n     Americans it represents only one of many conflicts, real and \n     potential, whose seriousness must be weighed, often against \n     one another, before allowing a commitment of lives, resources \n     and national energy.\n       Today, despite a few half-hearted attempts such as Gen. \n     Colin Powell's ``superior force doctrine,'' no clear set of \n     principles exists as a touchstone for debate on these \n     tradeoffs. Nor have any leaders of either party offered terms \n     which provide an understandable global logic as to when our \n     military should be committed to action. In short, we still \n     lack a national security strategy that fits the post-cold war \n     era.\n       More than ever before, the United States has become the \n     nation of choice when crises occur, large and small. At the \n     same time, the size and location of our military forces are \n     in flux. It is important to make our interests known to our \n     citizens, our allies and even our potential adversaries, not \n     just in Bosnia but around the world, so that commitments can \n     be measured by something other than the pressures of interest \n     groups and manipulation by the press. Furthermore, with \n     alliances increasingly justified by power relationships \n     similar to those that dominated before World War I, our \n     military must be assured that the stakes of its missions are \n     worth dying for.\n       Failing to provide these assurances is to continue the \n     unremitting case-by-case debates, hampering our foreign \n     policy on the one hand and on the other treating our military \n     forces in some cases as mere bargaining chips. As the past \n     few years demonstrate, this also causes us to fritter away \n     our national resolve while arguing about military backwaters \n     like Somalia and Haiti.\n       Given the President's proposal and the failure to this \n     point of defining American stakes in Bosnia as immediate or \n     nation-threatening, the coming weeks will offer a new round \n     of such debates. The President appears tempted to follow the \n     constitutionally questionable (albeit effective) approach \n     used by the Bush Administration in the Persian Gulf war: \n     putting troops in an area where no American forces have been \n     threatened and no treaties demand their presence, then \n     gaining international agreement before placing the issue \n     before Congress.\n       Mr. Clinton said their mission would be ``to supervise the \n     separation of forces and to give them confidence that each \n     side will live up to their agreements.'' This rationale \n     reminds one of the ill-fated mission of the international \n     force sent to Beirut in 1983. He has characterized the \n     Bosnian mission as diplomatic in purpose, but promised, in \n     his speech last night, to ``fight fire with fire and then \n     some'' if American troops are threatened. This is a formula \n     for confusion once a combat unit sent on a distinctly \n     noncombat mission comes under repeated attack.\n       We are told that other NATO countries will decline to send \n     their own military forces to Bosnia unless the United States \n     assumes a dominant role, which includes sizable combat \n     support and naval forces backing it up. This calls to mind \n     the decades of over-reliance by NATO members on American \n     resources, and President Eisenhower's warning in October 1963 \n     that the size and permanence of our military presence in \n     Europe would ``continue to discourage the development of the \n     necessary military strength Western European countries should \n     provide for them-selves.''\n       The Administration speaks of a ``reasonable time for \n     withdrawal,'' which if too short might tempt the parties to \n     wait out the so-called peacekeepers and if too long might \n     tempt certain elements to drive them out with attacks causing \n     high casualties.\n       Sorting out the Administration's answers to such \n     hesitations will take a great deal of time, attention and \n     emotion. And doing so in the absence of a clearly stated \n     global policy will encourage other nations, particularly the \n     new power centers in Asia, to view the United States as \n     becoming less committed to addressing their own security \n     concerns. Many of these concerns are far more serious to \n     long-term international stability and American interests. \n     These include the continued threat of war on the Korean \n     peninsula, the importance of the United States as a \n     powerbroker where historical Chinese, Japanese and Russian \n     interests collide, and the need for military security to \n     accompany trade and diplomacy in a dramatically changing \n     region.\n       Asian cynicism gains further grist in the wake of the \n     Administration's recent snubs of Japan: the President's \n     cancellation of his summit meeting because of the budget \n     crisis, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher's early \n     return from a Japanese visit to watch over the Bosnian peace \n     talks.\n       Asian leaders are becoming uneasy over an economically and \n     militarily resurgent China that in recent years has become \n     increasingly more aggressive. A perception that the United \n     States is not paying attention to or is not worried about \n     such long-term threats could in itself cause a major \n     realignment in Asia. One can- not exclude even Japan, whose \n     strong bilateral relationship with the United States has \n     been severely tested of late, from this possibility.\n       Those who aspire to the Presidency in 1996 should use the \n     coming debate to articulate a world view that would \n     demonstrate to the world, as well as to Americans, an \n     understanding of the uses and limitations--in a sense the \n     human budgeting of our military assets.\n       Richard Nixon was the last President to clearly define how \n     and when the United States would commit forces overseas. In \n     1969, he declared that our military policy should follow \n     three basic tenets:\n       Honor all treaty commitments in responding to those who \n     invade the lands of our allies.\n       Provide a nuclear umbrella to the world against the threats \n     of other nuclear powers.\n       Finally, provide weapons and technical assistance to other \n     countries where warranted, but do not commit American forces \n     to local conflicts.\n       These tenets, with some modification, are still the best \n     foundation of our world leadership. They remove the United \n     States from local conflicts and civil wars. The use of the \n     American military to fulfill treaty obligations requires \n     ratification by Congress, providing a hedge against the kind \n     of Presidential discretion that might send forces into \n     conflicts not in the national interest. Yet they provide \n     clear authority for immediate action required to carry out \n     policies that have been agreed upon by the government as a \n     whole.\n       Given the changes in the world, an additional tenet would \n     also be desirable: The United States should respond \n     vigorously against cases of nuclear proliferation and state-\n     sponsored terrorism.\n       These tenets would prevent the use of United States forces \n     on commitments more appropriate to lesser powers while \n     preserving our unique capabilities. Only the United States \n     among the world's democracies can field large-scale maneuver \n     forces, replete with strategic airlift, carrier battle groups \n     and amphibious power projection.\n       Our military has no equal in countering conventional \n     attacks on extremely short notice wherever the national \n     interest dictates. Our bases in Japan give American forces \n     the ability to react almost anywhere in the Pacific and \n     Indian Oceans, just as the continued presence in Europe \n     allows American units to react in Europe and the Middle East.\n       In proper form, this capability provides reassurance to \n     potentially threatened nations everywhere. But despite the \n     ease with which the American military seemingly operates on a \n     daily basis, its assets are limited, as is the national \n     willingness to put the at risk.\n       As the world moves toward new power centers and different \n     security needs, it is more vital than ever that we state \n     clearly the conditions under which American forces will be \n     sent into harm's way. And we should be ever more chary of \n     commitments, like the looming one in Bosnia, where combat \n     units invite attack but are by the very nature of their \n     mission not supposed to fight.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n                   After the Doubts, Salute and Obey\n\n                           (By Harry Summers)\n\n       When it comes to the Bosnian intervention, ``the proverbial \n     train has left the station,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, South \n     Carolina Republican, chairman of the House National Affairs \n     Committee. But that did not mean he agreed with that \n     deployment. ``I believe we will all eventually regret \n     allowing American prestige and the cohesion of the NATO \n     alliance to be put at risk for a Bosnian peacekeeping \n     operation.''\n       Many senior military officers would privately agree with \n     his assessment. But now is not the time to publicly express \n     their doubts. Before a decision is made, the duty of a \n     military officer is to speak up and express any reservations \n     about a proposed course of action. But once the decision is \n     made, the duty is then to salute and obey and wholeheartedly \n     support the task at hand.\n       And that support especially includes keeping their doubts \n     to themselves. Commanding a rifle company in the 2nd Armored \n     Division in 1965, my executive officer, Lt. Thomas E.M. Gray \n     II, had grave reservations about our emerging Vietnam policy. \n     Expressing those concerns in a Troop Information lecture, he \n     was surprised when the soldiers turned on him with a \n     vengeance. Many were already alerted for Vietnam, and they \n     wanted to believe in what they were being ordered to do. They \n     had their own doubts and fears to contend with, and what they \n     needed from their leaders was reassurance that the task was \n     both necessary and doable.\n     \n[[Page S18481]]\n\n       Like Jesus' centurion, a soldier is ``a man under \n     authority,'' and when his civilian and military leaders say \n     go, ``he goeth.'' Despite his misgivings, Lt. Gray himself \n     went to Vietnam and was tragically killed in action while \n     serving with the 1st Infantry Division's 1st Battalion, 16th \n     Infantry. Like Lt. Gray, many others served in Vietnam, and \n     will serve in Bosnia as well, despite their private \n     reservations.\n       One who did so in Vietnam was Vice President Al Gore, and \n     on the day of the president's address, the vice president \n     invited several of us to the White House for a briefing on \n     Bosnia. In the course of our talk, he called attention to a \n     Nov. 27, 1995, New York Times article headlined ``Commanders \n     Say U.S. Plan for Bosnia Will Work.'' But those comments \n     may not be as telling as he believed. They may well \n     reflect only the traditional military reluctance to \n     undermine soldiers' confidence and morale on the eve of a \n     hazardous operation.\n       Whether the military commanders have private misgivings \n     about the Bosnian operation is not knowable, but what is \n     becoming clear is the lengths they have gone to ensure that \n     the military mission was limited to doable military tasks.\n       Until recently, according to press reports, the military \n     operation was to include not only the ``peacekeeping'' task \n     of keeping the warring parties separated, but the \n     ``nationbuilding'' task of rebuilding the Bosnian political \n     and economic infrastructure and also the job of training and \n     equipping the Bosnian Muslim military to bring it up to par \n     with its enemies.\n       At our White House meeting, the vice president took \n     particular pains to disavow any such ``mission creep.'' The \n     ``nationbuilding'' notion that led to such grief in Somalia \n     will not be a U.S. military mission, he said. That will be a \n     task for the Europeans, specifically the OSCE, the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which \n     has several ongoing missions in the area. Training of the \n     Muslims, originally said to be a task for the U.S. Army's \n     10th Special Forces Group, will now be done by third-party \n     nationals. And the vice president categorically ruled out any \n     manhunts for war criminals, such as the one that led to the \n     disaster in Mogadishu.\n       To their credit, the senior military leaders have done \n     their best to limit the mission to doable tasks. But the one \n     thing they have not succeeded in doing is resolving the issue \n     of military casualties. This is an issue of major concern, \n     and at the vice president's briefing and later in the \n     presidential address to the nation, it was emphasized that \n     the Bosnian operation is not risk free, and that casualties \n     will occur.\n       But casualties per se are not the limiting factor. It is \n     whether those casualties are disproportionate to the value of \n     the mission. In World War II, the value was national \n     survival, and we willingly paid more than a million \n     casualties in its pursuit. In Somalia, the value was never \n     established, and 16 became too many. The task for President \n     Clinton is to establish the value of what we are trying to do \n     in Bosnia as the basis for the costs in both lives and \n     treasure that such an operation will entail.\n       If the polls are correct, that value has not yet been \n     established. And if that task remains undone, then even one \n     casualty may prove to be too many and Mr. Spence's warning \n     will prove to have been only too correct.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 1995]\n\n Our Piece of the Peace--Sending Troops to Bosnia: Our Duty, Clinton's \n                                  Call\n\n                          (By Lloyd N. Cutler)\n\n       After months of sustained effort, the Clinton \n     administration has succeeded in negotiating a peace agreement \n     among the three warring ethnic factions in Bosnia. The \n     agreements initialed in Dayton would require us and our NATO \n     allies to place peacekeeping units of our armed forces in \n     Bosnia for a year or more. This raises once again the biggest \n     unresolved issue under the U.S. system of separate executive \n     and legislative departments: Is the constitutional authority \n     to place our armed forces in harm's way vested in the \n     president or in Congress, or does it require the joint \n     approval of both?\n       President Clinton has said he would follow the precedent \n     set by George Bush before the 1991 Desert Storm invasion and \n     seek a congressional expression of support before committing \n     American units to the enforcement of the Bosnian peace \n     agreement. But he has also asserted the constitutional power \n     to act on his own authority, just as Bush did. This time, it \n     is Republican congressional leaders who are challenging a \n     Democratic president's view that the president can lawfully \n     act on his own, but, more typically it has been Democratic \n     Congresses challenging presidents of either party.\n       During the coming debate, Congress would be wise to bear in \n     mind, as it did five years ago, that the world will be \n     watching how the one and only democratic superpower reaches \n     its decisions, or whether it is so divided that it is \n     incapable of deciding at all. Congress needs to recognize \n     that we cannot have 535 commanders-in-chief in addition to \n     the president and that some deference to presidential \n     judgments on force deployments is in order. That is \n     especially true when, as in Korea, Iraq and Bosnia, the \n     president's proposed deployments are based on United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions that we have sponsored and on \n     joint decisions with our allies pursuant to treaties Congress \n     has previously approved.\n       In the case of Bosnia, the argument for committing U.S. \n     forces to carry out a peace agreement is a strong one. All of \n     us are revolved by the ethnic cleansing and other human \n     rights abuses that the various factions have committed. \n     These abuses are likely to continue if the peace agreement \n     is not formally signed in mid-December as now scheduled, \n     or if it is signed but not carried out. If the war goes on \n     or soon resumes, it may well spread to other parts of the \n     former Yugoslavia and to the rest of the Balkans, still \n     the most unstable region of Western and Central Europe. \n     Any widening of the Balkan wars could well spread to \n     Eastern Europe and the Middle East and pose a substantial \n     potential threat to U.S. national security.\n       Some foreign forces are needed to separate the contending \n     armies and to control the standing down of heavy weapons. \n     Under our leadership, and only under our leadership, NATO is \n     ready to supply the necessary forces. The stronger the \n     forces, the better the chance that they will not be attacked \n     and that they will accomplish their mission. All these \n     reasons argue for a significant U.S. military commitment, now \n     that a promising peace agreement has been reached.\n       In 1991, the Democratic Congress narrowly approved \n     President Bush's decision to reverse the Iraqi invasion of \n     Kuwait, thus mooting the issues of whether the president \n     could have acted alone. Today, the Republican congressional \n     leadership, while sounding somewhat more conciliatory than in \n     recent weeks, is challenging President Clinton to make his \n     case for the proposed deployment. This war powers question \n     has come up repeatedly since the 1950 outbreak of the Korean \n     War, when President Truman committed our forces without first \n     seeking congressional approval, but has never been resolved.\n       In foreign and national security policy, as in domestic \n     policy, neither Congress nor the president can accomplish \n     very much for very long without the cooperation of the other. \n     This is so for both constitutional and practical reasons. The \n     Constitution gives Congress the power to ``declare war,'' but \n     both Congress and the president share the power to raise \n     armies and navies and to raise and appropriate funds for \n     their maintenance and deployment. Only Congress can enact \n     such measures, but it needs the president's approval or a \n     two-thirds majority of both houses to override his veto. Only \n     the president can negotiate treaties, but he needs a two-\n     thirds vote of the Senate to ratify them. The president's \n     separate powers are limited to receiving ambassadors, serving \n     as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and faithfully \n     executing the laws. If as commander-in-chief he orders our \n     armed forces into a combat situation, he still needs \n     congressional approval to finance such a commitment over an \n     extended period of time.\n       Before the United States became a superpower, disputes over \n     the authority to commit our forces rarely arose. We had few \n     occasions to deploy our military units abroad, much less \n     commit them to conflict. Armies, navies and news of battle \n     traveled very slowly. Air forces and long-range missiles did \n     not exist. There was plenty of time after learning of a \n     threatening event for the president to deliberate with \n     Congress about the proper response. Occasionally, presidents \n     committed us unilaterally, as in our attacks on the Barbary \n     pirates in Tripoli in Jefferson's time, but it was rare for \n     Congress to claim that its own prerogatives were being \n     usurped by the president.\n       Since World War II, all this has changed. As commander-in-\n     chief of the democratic superpower, presidents now deploy our \n     armed forces all over the world. We can attack, or be \n     attacked, within moments. On numerous occasions, presidents \n     have committed our forces to armed conflict, sometimes of a \n     sustained nature as in Korea and Vietnam, without asking \n     Congress to declare war. In Vietnam, as it had in Korea, \n     Congress initially supported the president's initiatives by \n     appropriations and other measures. But as the duration and \n     scope of our military actions in Indochina escalated, an \n     increasingly restive Congress enacted the War Powers \n     Resolution over President Nixon's veto. The resolution laid \n     down a series of rules that require a president ``in every \n     possible instance'' to ``consult with Congress'' before he \n     commits our armed forces to combat or to places in which \n     hostilities are ``imminent.'' It also requires the withdrawal \n     of those forces if Congress fails to adopt an approving \n     resolution within 60 days.\n       President Nixon and all subsequent presidents have \n     challenged the constitutionality of these prescriptions, but \n     the Supreme Court has never accepted a case that would \n     resolve this dispute and is unlikely to do so in the near \n     future. When presidents ``consult'' with Congress before \n     committing forces, they are careful to avoid saying they \n     do so ``pursuant to'' the War Powers Resolution; they say \n     they do so ``consistent with'' the resolution.\n       There are obviously situations where modern technology \n     makes advance consultation with Congress impractical--most \n     notably the case where our sensor equipment indicates that a \n     missile attack has been launched on the United States or our \n     NATO allies, or where speed and secrecy are key factors, as \n     in the rescue of American hostages or reprisals against a \n     terrorist act abroad.\n       But presidents have continued to commit our forces to armed \n     conflict or situations where conflict was clearly \n     ``imminent,'' whether or not split-second timing was \n     imperative. President Ford, for example responded forcefully \n     to an attack on a U.S. vessel (the Mayaguez) off the Cambodia \n\n\n[[Page S18482]]\n     coast; President Carter launched a military mission to rescue our \n     hostages in Iran; President Reagan put our forces into \n     Lebanon, the Sinai, Chad and Grenada and ordered bombing \n     attacks on Libya; President Bush sent troops into Panama, \n     Liberia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.\n       As for President Clinton, he has already ordered our forces \n     into Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti and Macedonia and has authorized \n     our air units to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosina \n     itself.\n       Moreover, in the 22 years since the War Powers Resolution \n     became law, Congress has never undermined these presidential \n     uses of force by action (or inaction) in a way that would \n     have blocked the mission or required withdrawal within 60 \n     days.\n       All this does not mean that Congress must cede the power to \n     make national security decisions to the president. Congress \n     successfully forced Johnson and Nixon to limit and finally to \n     terminate the undeclared Vietnam War. Congress successfully \n     stopped Reagan's covert sales of weapons to Iran and his \n     covert and overt military aid to the contras. As these \n     examples show, presidents cannot effectively exercise their \n     separate constitutional powers over national security and \n     foreign policy over an extended period without the \n     cooperation of Congress. That is why Clinton, like Bush in \n     1990, has invited Congress to express its views before our \n     forces are committed to support the peace agreement in \n     Bosnia.\n       A week ago Friday, while the Dayton negotiations were still \n     going on, House Republicans passed a bill that would bar the \n     expenditure of any funds to sustain U.S. forces in Bosnia. \n     Fortunately, the Senate is unlikely to follow, and even if it \n     did, a presidential veto would be difficult to override. But \n     the House Republicans who launched this preemptive strike \n     would do better to emulate former Republican congressman Dick \n     Cheney.\n       In 1990, when we had a Republican president and Democratic \n     majorities in both houses of Congress, Cheney was the \n     secretary of defense. As he said before we entered the Gulf \n     War, ``When the stakes have to do with the leadership of the \n     Free World, we cannot afford to be paralyzed by an intramural \n     stalemate.'' The decision to act, he noted, ``finally belongs \n     to the president. He is the one who bears the responsibility \n     for sending young men and women to risk death. If the \n     operation fails, it will be his fault. I have never heard one \n     of my former [congressional] colleagues stand up after a \n     failed operation to say, `I share the blame for that one; I \n     advised him to go forward.' ''\n       This does not mean that Congress must approve the \n     president's proposed commitments without change. For example, \n     following the Lebanon precedent, Congress could require its \n     further approval if the forces were not withdrawn within, \n     say, 18 months, a period that expires after the next \n     elections. The president and Congress have the shared \n     responsiblity of finding a solution that shows we can \n     function as a decisive superpower and as a responsible \n     democracy at the same time. The public expects no less.\n       It may be too late to help in the Bosnia debate, but there \n     is one change in our process for making national security \n     decisions that ought to be adopted. The National Security \n     Council (NSC), the statutory body created to advise the \n     president on national security affairs, consists entirely of \n     officials in the executive branch. When the NSC takes up \n     issues related to the potential commitment of our forces, the \n     president could invite the attendance of the speaker, the \n     majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate and the \n     chairmen and ranking members of the national security and \n     foreign policy committees of each house. Since the NSC role \n     is purely advisory, no separation-of-powers issues would \n     arise. In this way Congress, in its own favorite phrase, \n     would be effectively consulted before the takeoff, rather \n     than at the time of the landing. The cooperation on national \n     security issues that the nation wants and expects might still \n     elude us, but the president would have done his part to carry \n     out George Shultz's admonition that trust between the \n     branches must be Washington's ``coin of the realm.''\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is next to be \nrecognized under the previous order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent Senator Snowe be sequenced \nfollowing Senator Bradley in speaking order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, the Senator from Virginia just gave \nvery eloquent testimony, not just to the U.S. abilities in the past to \naccomplish good things, but the risks contained in them.\n  I did have a great honor to be able to travel with the Senator from \nVirginia earlier this year, to Zagreb and down to Split and down to \nKnin in the Krajina Valley where the Croatian forces had succeeded in \ndriving, by some estimates, close to 200,000 military and civilian \npersonnel from that valley. It was very clear to me that I was in the \npresence of a man who understood, not just that particular region as \nwell as any, but understood the great value and importance of we \nAmericans leading where we can and doing what is possible to make the \nworld a safer and better place. I have many of the same misgivings the \nSenator from Virginia just expressed and I know that, in expressing \nopposition to the resolution and the deployment, in his own statement \njust now he wants this mission to be successful. He wants this \noperation, this NATO operation to be a success.\n  I also must say----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished \ncolleague. We will travel together again to other places in the world \non behalf of our Armed Forces.\n  I will be pleased to hear the Senator's remarks.\n  Mr. KERREY. I look forward to the travel. I learned a great deal in a \nrelatively short period of time from the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia. I look forward to having a chance to travel and learn \nagain.\n  The goal of any policy, particularly a foreign policy, I presume and \nhope, is success. But, in a complex and confused conflict, such as this \none, which has festered for centuries, success is extremely hard to \ndefine. The civil war in the former Yugoslavia is the consequence of a \nvery confusing sequence of events that very few people understand \nfully. Yugoslavia itself was an intricate construct of religions and \nnationalities. Even the future consequences of U.S. inaction now are \nnot immediately clear. Also, there has been considerable disinformation \nput out by all sides in the conflict, to justify the claims that all \nsides have to the status of being a victim.\n  The international solution coming out of the Dayton agreement is not \nexactly simple either. A NATO force, including non-NATO units and even \nRussian units, is to separate the parties along a meandering 600-mile \nboundary line and then oversee the restoration of civilian government \nfunctions in Bosnia.\n  Meanwhile, the European Community and international donors put \ntogether a financial program to rebuild Bosnia's infrastructure. The \nplan may or may not be brilliant, but it certainly is not simple.\n  So it is not surprising, Mr. President, that well-informed citizens--\nand I am thinking in my case of Nebraskans who I had the honor of \nvisiting with this week to discuss this policy--do not fully understand \nthe Bosnian case.\n  As I indicated earlier, I had the opportunity to travel to the former \nYugoslavia, have attended hours of briefings in the intelligence \ncommunity, and have visited the National Military Joint Intelligence \nCenter in the Pentagon the last two Fridays. I must say I do not fully \nunderstand this problem, either.\n  Mr. President, I do understand that American leadership has already \nmade it better. My response to those who despair of improving this \ntangled region is that from the moment of President Clinton's decision \nlast summer to lead the way to a solution, the former Yugoslavia has \nbecome a more peaceful place. Bosnia is now a safer place for its \ninhabitants.\n  Mr. President, it was only last summer that the only access to \nBosnia's capital, Sarajevo, was over the dangerous Mount Igman road. \nThree American diplomats were killed in July on that road. The airport \nwas closed. Sarajevo's very life was at risk from mortar attacks, from \nsnipers, and from the cutoff of the energy and food on which life \ndepends.\n  Then came the United States commitment to lead, Ambassador \nHolbrooke's full-court press, and today Bosnians are safer as a \nconsequence. C-130's now land at Sarajevo. Sarajevans' daily brushes \nwith death are over, we pray forever. Energy and food deliveries are \nresuming, Mr. President. I am describing the indicators of success--\nsuccess we have already achieved.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia earlier indicated, and I \nthink quite properly, a test that all of us should apply to an \noperation, to a mission of this kind. That is, would we be able to go \ninto the home of a family \n\n[[Page S18483]]\nwho had lost a loved one in a conflict and tell them what their loved \none had accomplished? Was it worth their sacrifice?\n  Mr. President, you would, I think, be hard pressed not to be able to \ngo into the homes of the three diplomats who gave their lives to secure \npeace in Yugoslavia and not be able to say that, thanks to their \nbravery in July, being willing to run the risks associated with travel \nto Sarajevo at the time, that as a consequence of their bravery we now \nhave peace in that city.\n  There are many people who are planning trips there and lots of travel \ngoing on there. Mr. President, there has been a tremendous success \naccomplished already.\n  Last August when I visited Yugoslavia, Sarajevo was judged so \ndangerous that the administration said that I and the delegation that I \ntraveled with should not go there. We could not get to the capital of \nthe country which is at the heart of this problem. Today, not only is \nSarajevo accessible, but Tuzla, where our troops will be stationed, is \naccessible as well. Already, several congressional delegations have \ntraveled there in the past few weeks to see for themselves the \nconditions our troops will face. That access is the fruit of policy \nsuccess.\n  But success in any enterprise, Mr. President, is temporary unless you \nare willing to secure it and to build on it. The Dayton agreement \nprovides for military forces to enforce separation of the parties and \nto ensure compliance with the agreement. If all the parties comply with \nthe agreement, success will be achieved and a peaceful, secure Bosnia \nwill not just be a possibility but an odds-on likelihood.\n  Mr. President, given what has happened in Bosnia and what could \nhappen without the decisive impact of American leadership, I contend \nthis would be a highly successful outcome, one in which all Americans \ncould take great pride.\n  Mr. President, much has been said--I have listened to many \ncolleagues, and I have heard, particularly on talk radio, concern \nexpressed--about President Clinton as Commander in Chief. First of all, \nlet it be said that Mr. Clinton, our President, is the architect of \nthis policy and he is the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. As \nthe distinguished majority leader has correctly stated, we only have \none President, one Commander in Chief. Our Armed Forces have a high \nlevel of good order and discipline. They recognize that fact. They will \nfollow the orders the President gives them. They will proceed to the \nplaces named in his orders.\n  When we do our constitutional duty of debating deployment such as \nthis one, we should not say or do anything which might separate the \nArmed Forces from their properly constituted chain of command. A \nresolution of this body declaring support for the troops but opposition \nto the action the President has ordered the troops to take could have \nvery negative consequences for the morale of the Armed Forces as well \nas for the outcome of the mission.\n  A statement by one Senator such as I read in this morning's New York \nTimes to the effect that this Senator has spoken to soldiers at a \nmilitary installation and said, ``They're with me. They're mixed. They \nknow I'm for them and I'm trying to keep them out,'' is not helpful. \nThe troops are with their Commander in Chief and with no one else, \nregardless of the outcome of this debate.\n  There is also a good deal of talk, as I said, on talk radio \ncriticizing Bill Clinton's right to deploy American forces and his \nability to command those deployed forces because he did not go to \nVietnam.\n  I will address this topic, Mr. President, head on. Having not served, \nI must say, can be a handicap for people serving as Commander in Chief \nof the military, no two ways about it. There are parts of a job you \ngrow into, and I believe strongly that the President has really grown \nas a Commander in Chief. He inherited Somalia from the Bush \nadministration, and as Commander in Chief of the Somalia operation, \nBill Clinton has experienced the human tragedy of being the leader when \nUnited States casualties occur. He has not flinched from hard talks \nwith the families of casualties that occurred on his watch. Those talks \nare a sobering and maturing experience for any commander, even a \nPresident. He is not naive or starry eyed about what he is ordering \nyoung Americans to do.\n  There is another aspect of Presidential service that must be \nconsidered, particularly as we engage in this kind of debate. Bill \nClinton may not have been in combat in Vietnam, but in a very real way \nhe, like all his predecessors, is experiencing combat now. He is \nexperiencing the daily danger which, unfortunately, is part of his job. \nHis residence has been attacked twice. He suffered the loss of a friend \nand ally, Prime Minister Rabin. He knows firsthand every day the sense \nof an unknown but ever present threat to your life and the life of your \nfamily, which is an essential part of combat. In this sense, too, he \nhas matured a lot. The job has that effect on people.\n  In the final analysis, though, the most important tool that the \nPresident brings to being Commander in Chief is the fact that he is \nproperly sworn. He is the duly elected President of the United States \nof America. Mr. President, that is all it takes. Every American \nsoldier, every American sailor, every American airman and marine must \nunderstand it.\n  As far as a national interest, Mr. President, it does fall to the \nPresident of the United States to define the Nation's vital interests \nand then act to defend them. Such interests are at issue in the former \nYugoslavia. The most important one, in my judgment, is the stability of \nEurope.\n  We have learned in this century that we ignore European instability \nat our peril. Twice we have made the mistake of thinking Europeans, \nwith their money and sophistication and long experience as countries, \ncould maintain their own stability. Twice we have had to send millions \nof our soldiers to fight in Europe to correct the mistake and to lead \nEuropeans into stable, peaceful arrangements with each other. There may \ncome a time when Europeans can do this all by themselves, but the \nYugoslavian experience of the past 4 years shows that time is not yet \nhere.\n  At the end of World War II, America determined to shore up the \nstability and security of Europe. Former friend and foe alike were a \nshambles, communism was a growing force in European domestic politics, \nand the Soviet Union showed both the ability and the inclination to \nincorporate all the continent into his family of satellite states.\n  To our farsighted leaders of the period, a crisis was apparent. They \nresponded with a decisive commitment of American leadership. They \norganized an alliance of the United States, Canada, and 13 European \ncountries, an alliance with a simple but breathtakingly open-ended \ncommitment, an attack on any member was an attack on all. In other \nwords, we would go to war to defend any NATO member. With the \nimplementing vision of the first Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. \nEisenhower, the NATO alliance began a record of achievement that \nclimaxed not a year later but 40 years later with the fall of the \nBerlin wall and the collapse of Soviet communism.\n  Whenever we give speeches about what we are proud of in America's \naccomplishments since World War II, we brag, and very properly so, \nabout our victory in the cold war and the U.S. leadership of NATO which \nmade victory possible. Mr. President, our commitment in 1949 was not \ntotally assured of success. Far from it. And our commitment was not \naccompanied by a congressional requirement for an exit strategy. In \n1949 our leaders acted boldly to leverage American leadership into an \nalliance with a good chance of success. Today, with a new situation in \nEurope, we face a requirement to act again, boldly, to restore and \nmaintain European stability. Again, NATO is the instrument of choice. \nIf we do not act, instability will spread more broadly in a region in \nwhich major European powers have historic interests and have not shrunk \nfrom war to advance those interests. If we do not use NATO as our \ninstrument, this alliance will not be available to continue its 40 year \nrole as the guarantor of a peaceful, stable Europe.\n  It was not so long ago that our major European allies were usually at \neach other's throats. NATO created a framework of defense cooperation \nin which shared interests outweighed rivalries. Today NATO expansion \ncarries the potential to extend the same cooperation \n\n[[Page S18484]]\ninto Eastern Europe and I hope, eventually, Russia and other former \nSoviet States. I cannot think of a better way to lock-in the benefits \nof the end of the cold war. But without NATO as a vibrant, capable \norganization, it will not happen. NATO cannot be such an organization \nwithout U.S. leadership. Mr. President, stability in Europe and the \ncontinued viability of NATO are our vital interests, and they are at \nissue today in the Balkans.\n  We have other lesser, but important interests there. We have an \ninterest in a peaceful, stable, Russia which cooperates with us and \nwith NATO on defense matters and with which we can share mutual \nconfidence. The deployment of Russian units to the I-FOR under United \nStates command provides a potentially priceless opportunity to build \nsuch a relationship. Also, we have an interest in developing a better \nrelationship with the Moslem world. Moslems have clearly been the \nunderdog in the Yugoslav war, and American leadership to preserve and \nsecure a Bosnia which is again safe for Moslems will have positive \neffect on United States relations with the Moslem world. It will show \nthe truth of our national character, which is we seek justice and \nfairness and do not play ethnic favorites.\n\n\n                 draft a resolution to support success\n\n  What we vote today matters. We should not hamstring our commanders \nwith requirements that make success harder to attain. When we require \nthe administration to supply armaments of the highest quality to one of \nthe combatants, the highest quality being the best the United States \nhas in its own arsenal, or when we pass a resolution which sets an \nartificial time limit on an operation which should only be bounded by \naccomplishment of the assigned task, we are placing handicaps on \nAdmiral Smith's ability to accomplish the mission. I know none of us \nwants to do that. Once our troops are committed, all of us wants them \nto succeed.\n  I must also add my concern about Congress declaring U.S. \ncreditability to be a strategic interest. We may be issuing an open-\nended invitation to Presidents present and future to make unilateral \ncommitments and require Congress to support them on the fuzzy basis of \ncredibility. The stability of Europe is reason enough for this \noperation, in my view.\n  Mr. President, I have been to briefings at the Intelligence Committee \nand have spent the last two Friday afternoons at the National Military \nJoint Intelligence Center at the Pentagon, trying to learn all I can \nabout this mission and the intelligence support our commanders will be \ngetting. I am immensely proud to have a military that can do a mission \nlike this--to go into difficult terrain in tough weather conditions and \nbe able to provide its own support and security while being prepared to \nengage any or all of three contending armies. I am proud of the work \nour national and military intelligence communities have done and are \ndoing to support our troops with the best intelligence available, and \nalso support the NATO and foreign forces in the I-FOR. No one else in \nthe world could do this, except the United States. We are doing it, as \nI said, to protect vital interests. We are doing it in a good cause.\n  If all the parties to the Dayton agreement abide by it, our \nleadership will be brought peace to the Balkans. More importantly, we \nwill have extended the guarantee of European stability to which we have \nbeen committed, in NATO, since 1949. If we lead with the vision of our \npost-war predecessors, we can achieve success in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, finally, let me point out what should be obvious. The \nsuccess that has been achieved thus far has been a success of the \nPresident of the United States committed to achieve peace in the \nBalkans, but a success that has been put together by diplomats, by \npoliticians, some elected and appointed leaders, not just of the United \nStates but of all three of the nations in the Balkans. And if success \nis to be the end goal, and if we are to achieve that success, the \nmilitary can only do part of it. In order for the military to be \nsuccessful, we political leaders are going to have to do the hard work \nof making certain that all the parties adhere to the agreement that we \nexpect them to sign in Paris tomorrow.\n  I believe there is a good chance of success--of further and continued \nsuccess--a chance of success that is worth the risk that we take, the \nrisk of lives and the risk of capital in the Balkans.\n  I hope that the debate about this resolution--a nonbinding resolution \nthat does not necessarily impact the President--I hope that the \nPresident hears throughout all of this debate perhaps some criticism. \nBut even critics have to grudgingly, I hope, acknowledge that there is \npeace in the Balkans, that you can fly to Sarajevo, that children and \ncivilians in Sarajevo markets do not worry on Sundays--as they did when \nI was there on the 28th of August--that 120-millimeter rockets and \nmortars were going to rain down on them and take their lives. That fear \nis gone today. The fear of sniper attack is gone.\n  If the standdown of forces occurs in the first 30 days and in the \nnext 45 days and the next 180 days, if we can just stand down the \nforces, the United States of America will continue to be able to say \nthat we are saving lives. There are people alive today in Sarajevo that \nwould not have been alive were it not for leadership of the President \nof the United States and the people of the United States backing that \nPresident.\n  I hope we understand and appreciate the great success that only the \nUnited States of America could achieve under the leadership of Bill \nClinton. I hope this debate does not cloud that success, and I hope \nthis debate does not prevent and make more difficult a continuation of \nour efforts to build upon that success.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLott be traded in speaking order for Senator Domenici, who would be \nnext, and also that Senator Kassebaum be added after Senator Nunn in \nthe speaking order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas \nfor accommodating my schedule and allowing me to change the order of \nthe list of speakers. I also want to thank her for her leadership in \nthis area. It is not easy. It takes a lot of courage, and the Senator \nfrom Texas has done an excellent job on this issue. I support her \nresolution because it best reflects my views on this issue.\n  This resolution expresses opposition to the decision to put United \nStates troops on the ground in Bosnia, and also it says that we support \nour troops. Certainly, we all do, whether they are in the Continental \nUnited States or anywhere around the world. This resolution is simple. \nIt is direct. It is to the point. And, I agree with it. I oppose the \ndecision to send U.S. ground troops to Bosnia.\n  Conversely, I intend to oppose the resolution by the distinguished \nmajority leader, and the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. They \nhave done excellent work on their resolution. They have improved it \nconsiderably. But it still has language that to me--leaves the \nimpression that a vote in favor of the resolution equates to \nauthorizing, or agreeing with the decision to deploy ground troops. It \ndoes not say exactly that, but it still has language that gives me \ndiscomfort in that area.\n  I also have difficulty with our putting United States troops on the \nground--supposedly as neutral I-For troops between the Serbians, the \nBosnians, and the Croats on the other side--all while the United States \nleads an effort to train, equip, and arm the Bosnians. That is a \nprecarious position for U.S forces. I think that is a very impractical \narrangement. You cannot appear to be, or try to be neutral while you \nare in fact leading an effort to train one party of the three factions \ninvolved. So I have not been able to get that problem worked out in my \nmind with the language that is before the Senate in the resolution by \nSenator Dole.\n  Mr. President, in 1921, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:\n\n       A page of history is worth a volume of logic.\n\n\n[[Page S18485]]\n\n  Without an understanding of history, it is easy to repeat the \nmistakes of history, and it is in that context of history that we must \ncarefully review President Clinton's decision to send United States \nground troops into Bosnia.\n  On November 21, 1995, President Clinton announced that an agreement \nhad been reached in Dayton, OH, an agreement which he believed would \nsecure peace in the former Yugoslavian Republic of Bosnia. According to \nhim, key to its success would be participation of 20,000 American \nmilitary personnel on the ground. Without American involvement, the \nPresident suggested there would be no peace and U.S. leadership of NATO \nwould suffer, perhaps to the point of rendering NATO useless. But the \nPresident's dire warnings must not be simply conceded under the \nassumption that he is right. The decision to send United States troops \nto Bosnia should not be reached because of feared diminution of United \nStates leadership in the world or of NATO.\n  The fundamental decision should be based on answers to two simple \nspecific questions: Are vital United States national security interests \nunder threat in Bosnia? Do we have an effective exit strategy?\n  Before going further, I want to say that the President deserves \ncredit for creating a negotiating framework which brought together the \nleaders of the warring parties and for fostering an environment of \nserious work to bring peace to war-torn Bosnia.\n  But the decision to deploy United States troops to Bosnia is much \nmore complex than just simply affirming a peace agreement negotiated in \nDayton. Much more must be considered before our troops are deployed en \nmasse.\n  Before addressing the two immediate questions regarding this \ndecision, though, whether to deploy the troops, we must understand the \nhistory of Bosnia, if for no other reason than to gain some sense of \nthe potential success or failure of that Dayton agreement.\n  In his second State of the Union Address in 1862, President Lincoln \ncounseled the Congress to remember that we cannot escape history. That \nsame counsel applies to the strife-ridden Bosnia.\n  The former Yugoslavia found its birth in 1918 as the Kingdom of the \nSerbs, the Croats and Slovenes united under the reign of King \nAlexander. In 1929, the country was renamed Yugoslavia, but the recent \ncivil unrest in Bosnia can be traced much further back than that. The \ndeep hatred and animosity of the Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian peoples \nwas not born from their forced union in 1918. It reaches back to the \nmid-1300's when the Ottoman Turks subdued the Serbian state.\n  History is clear that death, civil strife, and general mayhem between \nthe Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians was prolific between the mid-1300's \nuntil Tito solidified his control of Yugoslavia at the close of World \nWar II. In most cases, the hostility between the parties was based on \nreligious and cultural divisions and the leadership of the day, whether \nit be King Alexander or Tito, used these religious and cultural hatreds \nas tools to suppress, to check, and to trump the national aspirations \nof each of the parties in the region. The result was nearly continuous \nbloodshed between the three warring factions.\n  This backward, bloody, and ugly history led British Prime Minister \nBenjamin Disraeli to tell the House of Lords in 1878 these words, which \nare applicable to today's situation. He said:\n\n       No language can describe adequately the condition of that \n     large portion of the Balkan peninsula--Serbia, Bosnia, \n     Herzegovina and other provinces--political intrigues, \n     constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit--\n     hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions and \n     absence of any controlling power . . . nothing short of \n     50,000 of the best troops would produce anything like order \n     in these parts.\n\n  That was in 1878. If it would have taken 50,000 troops then, how many \ntroops would it take today?\n  When King Alexander was assassinated in 1934 by Croatian extremists, \nYugoslavia began to split apart at the seams. Why was King Alexander \nassassinated? Well, in 1929 he tried to create an autonomous Serb, \nCroat, and Slovene government under a unified federalist structure \ncalled Yugoslavia. While one central government was to remain under his \nleadership, the three parties would achieve independence.\n  The Dayton agreement--at its fundamental base--seeks to resurrect \nmuch of King Alexander's failed plan of 1929. But instead of creating \nthree separate states under one central government, the Dayton \nagreement seeks to create two parts, the Croat-Bosnian Federation and \nthe Serbian Republic, all under one central government.\n  Just as President Lincoln said, ``We cannot escape history,'' neither \ncan President Clinton escape the history of Yugoslavia, nor can any of \nus afford to ignore it. Based on this history, it is likely--and \nunfortunate--that there will be no peace in Bosnia with or without \nUnited States troops on the ground to support it.\n  No international troop presence on the ground in Bosnia will restore \npeace to a region which has forgotten peace, does not remember peace, \nand does not forgive past violations of peace. United States troops \nshould not be squandered on such a prospect.\n  Yes, we all hope for peace, but the peace must be achieved in the \nhearts and minds of the people there who have been warring for \ncenturies. America cannot impose it with military troops.\n  The United States has a history, a noble history, and a heritage born \nfrom war in search of peace. Ours is a noble history and heritage, but \nthis heritage should not and does not commit us to blind military \ncommitments, the goal of which is to right historical wrongs or impose \ntranquility where tranquility does not exist or has not existed for \nover 600 years.\n  War is an ugly, gruesome undertaking. War should not be pursued or \nwaged for mere political expediency or humanitarian gains.\n  Now, there are those who will say there is not war here; this is a \ntenuous peace. Yes, but how long will it be that way? As I pointed out, \none of the things that worries me is if we go in saying we are neutral \nbut acting in a partisan way supporting one faction, how long will that \npeace hold?\n  While we must be good at waging war, not all wars are fit for the \nUnited States to come in and solve the problem. Why must we always be \nthe one that sends our troops in, no matter where it is around the \nworld, when we do not have a vital national security interest? The \nUnited States should only participate militarily on the ground in \nplaces in which U.S. interests are clear and understandable.\n  I have looked long and hard to find United States vital security \ninterests which are under threat by the civil strife in Bosnia. I have \nnot found any. The United States does have vital security interests in \nCentral and Western Europe, but the civil war in Bosnia does not \nthreaten these interests. Therefore, we should not go. That is the \nfundamental hurdle that I cannot go over.\n  If our vital security interests dictate that we should place troops \nin harm's way, then we must go. We should and we will. We will be \nprepared to fight for our vital national interests and win. We should \ngo, though, as combatants prepared to fight, to do whatever is \nnecessary, but only if our vital security interests are required.\n  The President has talked about robust rules of engagement.\n  But he has not clearly and specifically outlined his commitment and \nintent to respond disproportionately should U.S. troops come under \nattack or siege. If our troops go, there must be no limits. If Serb \nforces take hostages, or others, or attack U.S. patrols, the President \nmust be willing, committed and intent on taking the conflict to the \nsafe haven of other countries that are involved, specifically Belgrade.\n  I have not heard this commitment from the President, nor do I read \nthis level of commitment as his intent. Anything less will sentence \nU.S. ground personnel to a hunkered-down, bunker existence suffering \ncasualties in disparate hit-and-run attacks. U.S. personnel would \nbecome targets, plentiful and ripe.\n  We have made that mistake in the past. We made it in Somalia. And we \nshould not repeat it. It may not happen immediately. Maybe it will not \nhappen in the cold, snowy winter months after we first arrive. But it \nwould, I think, happen sooner or later. And the price of American lives \nshould not be set so low for a goal so distant from our own vital \nsecurity interests.\n  As President Clinton announced his intention to send U.S. troops to \n\n[[Page S18486]]\n  Bosnia, I pulled out his National Security Strategy, a document that \nthe President presented to the Congress in July 1994. Under the section \naddressing peace operations, on page 14, it says:\n\n       Two other points deserve emphasis. First, the primary \n     mission of our armed forces is not peace operations; it is to \n     deter and, if necessary, to fight and win conflicts in which \n     our most important interests are threatened. Second, while \n     the international community can create conditions for peace, \n     the responsibility for peace ultimately rests with the people \n     of the country in question. That is what President Clinton \n     had to say just in July of 1994--only 17 months ago.\n\n  The President's own national security strategy does not warrant \nsending troops into this area. Bosnia does not represent a conflict in \nwhich our most important interests are threatened, nor have the people \nof former Yugoslavia assumed the responsibility for peace.\n  The second issue which must be considered prior to sending troops is \nthe question of identifying a clear, definitive exit strategy. How will \nwe know when the mission is completed and it is time to leave? We have \nbeen told a year, or was it about a year? Will it be 14 months or 15 \nmonths? How much will it cost? We were told, well, $1.5 billion. And \nthen we were told, $2 billion. We all know it will be $4 billion or $5 \nbillion.\n  The President said the U.S. mission in Bosnia will be ``clear, \nlimited, and achievable.'' But I have not heard articulated the most \nimportant point: How will we know the mission has been achieved so that \nwe will know it is time for us to leave? If we do not have a clear, \nidentifiable exit strategy, we will be suspect to expanding our reason \nfor going. New missions will be added, like we have seen in other \ninstances. Success will be harder to identify.\n  A successful exit strategy cannot be driven by a time limit as the \nPresident has suggested and as, quite frankly, the Congress has sought. \nIs it just that we will stay 1 year, wait for the Bosnians to be \nsufficiently trained and equipped, and then leave? I do not think that \nis what was intended, but perhaps that is the real exit strategy. It \nmust be constructed with the intention of leaving behind a locally \nsupported peace that does not require an open-ended commitment of U.S. \ntroops. Once again, the history of the region does not lead to any \nrational conclusion that is what would happen.\n  I do not believe that the American people are willing to support a \nprolonged occupation by U.S. troops in Bosnia, and we will have one if \nno clear exit strategy exists.\n  In the Persian Gulf we had a clear, measurable, and definite exit \nstrategy--expel Iraq from Kuwait. Many people think we should have gone \nfurther. I am not one of them, because, you see, we had a strategy. It \nwas to remove Iraq out of Kuwait and then leave, period. No one \ndisputes the results of the gulf war.\n  This is not the case in this present situation. Under the President's \nown National Security Strategy, he acknowledges that successful peace \noperations can only be sustained when the responsible parties want \npeace. Once again, the history of the region does not lead anyone to \nbelieve that the leaders of Serbia or Croatia and Bosnia want peace at \nall costs. And this plan will not grow the seeds for such a desire.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the proposed settlement map. As I \nunderstand it--and there has been some disagreement and controversy \nabout this--but there will be some repatriation of displaced Serbs into \nCroatian-held territory. Maybe we will not be actually doing that, but \nas I understand the agreement, we will be responsible for protecting \nthem and at least in some ways assisting in this operation.\n  How do you think the Croatians will react to this repatriation? \nApprovingly? Or the Bosnians when people of Serbian descent are \nrepatriated to Bosnia? Do not forget that this current conflict started \nwhen the Serbs decided they wanted to exterminate the Bosnian people \nfrom territory they considered theirs from centuries before.\n  I just do not believe this plan will work. If it could work, it could \nwork without U.S. ground troops on the ground. King Alexander tried it \n68 years ago. He paid the price with his life at the hands of a \nCroatian loyalist and extremist. If we try it, Americans will die in a \nfaraway land, one steeped in hatred and one in which we have no vital \nsecurity interests under threat.\n  The United States should not resign itself to rubber stamp this \ndecision--one based on noble intent, yet ill-conceived. The President \nhas tried to explain the logic of deploying U.S. troops on the ground \nin Bosnia, but only one page of the history of this troubled region \nexplains why we should not go.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Hutchison resolution and against \nthe Dole-McCain resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMack be added in speaker order after Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nJeffords be added after Senator Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Under the unanimous-consent order, the next speaker on the Democratic \nside was to have been the Senator from Virginia.\n  Does the Senator from California ask unanimous consent to change that \norder?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. It is my understanding that for the time being I \nam taking his place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have really come full circle on the question of \nwhether or not to send U.S. troops to Bosnia to try to keep the peace. \nI must say I was initially very skeptical. I believed that you could \nnot keep a peace that the people in Bosnia do not want kept. And in the \nearlier meetings of the Foreign Relations Committee I was not convinced \nby the arguments presented by Secretaries Christopher and Perry and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  But as events have developed, I have come to the conclusion, after \nattending every classified briefing and every Foreign Relations \nCommittee meeting, that the President's policy is the only way to stop \nthis war and prevent its spread. I believe there is far greater risk in \ndoing nothing and seeing the spread of this war than there is in doing \nsomething and trying to bring about a just peace.\n  The Dayton peace agreement would not have been reached without U.S. \nleadership, and it will not be successfully implemented without our \nleadership either.\n  I have also become deeply convinced that the United States has a \nmoral mission here, that the cause is noble and the cause is just. \nToday one-half of the people of Bosnia are either dead or homeless. \nRape has become an instrument of war. Atrocities have been committed \nthat have not been seen since World War II. This must end. People have \nhad enough of war.\n  The United States is being asked essentially to provide one-third of \nthe peacekeeping forces. The other day I was visited by the new British \nAmbassador. He pointed out to me that Great Britain is going to provide \n16,000 troops, a nation far smaller than ours; 13,000 in Bosnia itself \nand 3,000 in Hungary and Austria.\n  He also said, ``Know this. If the United States goes, we go, too. We \nin Great Britain and in Europe look at you as the leader of NATO.'' If \nNATO is to function, the United States must lead and perform. And I \nbelieve that is essentially the way it is today, whether we like it or \nnot.\n  At our most recent Foreign Relations Committee hearing on December 1, \nI was deeply impressed with the arguments put forward by Secretary \nChristopher, Secretary Perry, and General Shalikashvili. They laid out \nnot only the rationale for our involvement but a clear and well-defined \nplan for carrying out our mission.\n  Some of the opponents of this policy are making the argument that \nthey oppose the policy but they support the troops to carry it out. In \nfact, the Hutchison resolution that we will be voting on shortly says \nexactly that. But as I listened to these arguments, I must say that to \nme they strike me as a figleaf at best and disingenuous at worst. \n\n[[Page S18487]]\n\n  We all support our troops. That goes without saying. But what message \ndo we send to our troops if we send them off to do a job and in the \nsame breath declare that the job that they are doing is illegitimate? \nHow can you say, ``I condemn the mission you are being sent to do, but \nI support you in doing it''? Will our troops really believe they have \nour support if this is what the Congress of the United States says?\n  Some have raised the specter of a repeat of Vietnam in Bosnia, but \nthe real repetition of Vietnam would be to send United States troops to \ncarry out a mission without supporting that mission. Some of my \ncolleagues have asked: ``Does anyone believe we are really going to \nstand by our young men and women that we are going to send to Bosnia?'' \nWell, I certainly am, the President is, the full force of the United \nStates military is, and I believe that the Senate will in the long run \nas well.\n  In my view, the Hutchison resolution undercuts the troops. It says it \nsupports the troops, but it is designed to give the President a back \ndoor to pull the rug out from under them. Instead of giving lukewarm \nsupport to the troops by questioning the wisdom of their job, we should \nunify behind the policy and commit to giving our troops every \nadvantage, all the equipment and all the support they need to carry out \nthe mission successfully.\n  We cannot have it both ways. If we support the troops, we should \nsupport the policy.\n  I have had an opportunity to review the Dole-McCain resolution, and I \nsupport it and I support it strongly. I would like to set aside some of \nthe myths that I think have been raised by those who are opposed to it.\n  The first is the myth of the intractable nature of the conflict. \nThere are some who appear to have bought into the argument of \nultranationalists on all sides. Yes, there have been wars for hundreds \nof years in the Balkans, but there has been a history of war and brutal \natrocities in Britain, in France, in Germany. Today these nations are \nat peace.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Ohio pointed out yesterday, we had \nPrime Minister Shimon Peres on the floor of the House yesterday \nspeaking about the long history of violence in the Middle East. That \ngoes back to the Crusades, and even beyond. Conflict has been endemic \nto the Middle East for centuries, but today peace is beginning to take \nhold.\n  What about Northern Ireland? That conflict has gone on for a long \ntime as well. But I do not think anyone here would suggest that the \nMiddle East or Northern Ireland are beyond help and doomed to an \neternity of conflict, and I do not think we should come to the \nconclusion that the only way of life in Bosnia is a way of death and \natrocities and the spread of the war.\n  The fact is that there is now an opportunity for peace, perhaps the \nonly opportunity that we will have. If we fail to take this \nopportunity, this war will surely spread to Kosovo, to Macedonia. It \nthen involves two NATO allies-- Greece and Turkey--and then it involves \nthe rest of Europe, and Europe has always been a vital interest to the \nUnited States. Our men and women have fought two wars on the European \nContinent because of that interest.\n  There is also the myth that there is no clear and defined mission, \nand I would like to debunk that.\n  Some of my colleagues have complained that this operation is not \nclear, and that it is not achievable. But if you listen to the \nPresident, to Secretary Christopher, to Secretary Perry, to General \nShalikashvili, to General Joulwan, and to others in our military, it is \nclear that this mission, in fact, is clearly defined. As a matter of \nfact, General Joulwan said yesterday he should know within the first 3 \nmonths whether the mission can succeed or not.\n  There is a clear exit strategy. Our troops are not being asked to go \nto Bosnia to engage in all sorts of nationbuilding activities. The \nmilitary mission and the goals are explicit, and they are limited. We \nwill not be engaged in civilian policing. We will not be engaged in \nrefugee resettlement. We will not be engaged in civilian \nreconstruction. We will not be engaged in election monitoring.\n  The President and NATO leaders have been quite clear. Our forces in \nBosnia will monitor the military aspects of the peace agreement, the \ncessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of forces to their respective \nterritories, and the lines of demarcation. They will monitor the \nredeployment of forces and heavy weapons to designated areas and the \nestablishment of zones of separation. That is the mission.\n  I want to speak about the one part of the Dole-McCain joint \nresolution that does concern me, and that is the part that appears on \npage 4 and speaks to the balance of power. A major portion of this \neffort is to see that when the United States pulls out in approximately \n1 year, there is a defensive balance of power so that the Bosnians, if \nneed be, can defend themselves. This can be a deterrent to future wars \nif it is carried out correctly. However, it cannot become the launching \npoint for radical Islamic fundamentalism on the European Continent, and \nI want to stress that.\n  The Dole-McCain resolution very clearly describes periodic reports on \nthe armaments provided to the Bosnians that the President will make to \nthis Congress, and I think that is extremely important. I think every \nMember of this body should be militant in seeing that destabilizing \nweapons do not go into this area and that the balance of power that is \nachieved is a defensive balance of power. I think that is \nextraordinarily important, and I think it has to be clearly stated.\n  There is another myth about the lack of U.S. interests in the region. \nPeople have said, ``You know, many of our citizens can't recognize \nBosnia on a map. We don't want to send our people there. They may die. \nWe have no major national interest in the area.'' And I thought this \noriginally. But I believe the United States does have an interest in a \nsafe, secure, and stable Europe. The United States does have an \ninterest in assuring that this conflict does not spread and become the \nthird general European war of this century.\n  The United States does have an interest in supporting our NATO allies \nand assuring that NATO can continue in its role guaranteeing European \nsecurity.\n  Because of World War II and because of the threat of Communist \naggression from the Soviet Union, the NATO alliance was set up to \nprovide peace and stability for the NATO nations, and this Nation has \nalways been in the leadership of that effort. We have made the \ncommitment to it throughout the years, and the reason we have done so \nis because of the failure of Europe in World War I to protect itself, \nin World War II to protect itself, and, I am sorry to say, that same \nfailure we see there today. You see, very few strong European leaders \nare willing to come forward and say, ``We will tackle this job alone \nbecause it's on our back door.''\n  Now, we can be repelled by this, we can be reviled by it, we can view \nit with dismay and with some shock, but it is the real world out there, \nand, therefore, this is where the credibility of the NATO alliance \ncomes in. The United States is critical to the success and survival of \nthe NATO alliance.\n  As the British Ambassador said to me 2 days ago, ``We will be there \nas long as the United States is. If the United States leaves, Great \nBritain leaves.'' Period. The end. That, to me, spoke volumes of the \nimportance of U.S. leadership. There was no European country that could \neffect the peace. It took the United States of America to effect the \npeace. So I believe we have an interest in reaffirming our own position \nas the global leader of the free world and protecting that leadership \nand that freedom.\n\n  I believe the United States has a moral interest in ending crimes \nagainst humanity. I, myself, could have been born in Eastern Europe, in \nPoland. I would never have been privileged to have a good life had that \nbeen the case. Well, the same circumstances are present today in \nBosnia. I remember all during the 1940's, when people were saying, \n``How could we not have responded?'' ``How could we not have known?'' \n``How did we not know that these boxcars were traveling throughout \nEurope and turn a deaf ear to what was happening?''\n  It is moral. It is just. It is noble. We are not asked to fight a \nwar. We are asked to give peace a chance.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair. \n  \n[[Page S18488]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Hatfield is on his way to the \nfloor, and he is next in line to replace Senator DeWine in the order. I \nwanted to take this opportunity until he gets here to answer what \nseveral Senators have said on the floor--most recently, the Senator \nfrom California, and before that, the Senator from Connecticut--\nregarding people who would support my resolution, who are in full \nsupport of the troops, though they have questions about this mission.\n  I think it is very important that every one of us in this body give \nto each other Member the right to have a vote of conscience. And there \nare many of us who do not think this is the right mission, but who are \ngoing to go full force to support our troops. In fact, we believe we \nare supporting our troops in the most effective way by opposing this \nmission because we think it is the wrong one.\n  I do not question anyone's motives, or how they feel, if they vote \nagainst the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution. But, by the same token, I \nthink it is important that those who are going to support the Dole-\nMcCain resolution and the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution--that it be known \nthat they, too, are doing what they think is right.\n  It is a tough decision for anyone to vote to put troops in harm's \nway. And if someone decides that they can best support the troops by \nopposing the President's decision, I think that everyone knows, or \nshould know, that that is the right of every Senator to do.\n  There have been other missions in the history of this country, in \nwhich the people have been good people, supported by America, well \nequipped, given everything they need to succeed in their mission, but \nnevertheless the same people in America have not agreed with the \nmission.\n  I think the mission in Vietnam was certainly controversial. But the \npeople of this country loved and revered the people who went to Vietnam \nfrom our Armed Forces and fought there for our country. So I do not \nthink there is any question whatsoever that you cannot support a \nmission and support the troops fully. I think that each of us has the \nability to make this decision for ourselves.\n  As I have said, I think it is incumbent on a Member of Congress to \nmake this decision. It is a constitutional responsibility that we were \ngiven by the Founders. They did not want it to be easy to send troops \ninto a foreign conflict. That is why they put Congress in the power to \ndeclare war. I do not know that our Founders had even thought about \npeacekeeping missions and the nuances that we would have on declaring \nwar. I do not think they thought about a Commander in Chief sending our \ntroops into what is talked about as peace, but which, in fact, is \nsending our troops into military conflicts. I think they would have \nenvisioned that Congress should authorize a peacekeeping mission that \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs have said is going to put troops in harm's way, where \nthere may be casualties, and I believe our Founders would have wanted \nauthorization by Congress.\n  They did not want it to be easy to send our troops into harm's way. \nThat is why they made it the decision of Congress to declare war, while \nthe Commander in Chief would run the operation. The Commander in Chief \ndoes have the right to run the military. There is no question about it. \nBut it is very clear in the Constitution that Congress should be \nconsulted and authorized any time our troops are sent into harm's way.\n  I was holding the floor for the distinguished senior Senator from \nOregon, who has now arrived. I yield the floor to him for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on Thursday, the leaders of the warring \nparties in Bosnia and Herzegovina will formally sign a peace agreement \nthat was initialed last month in Dayton, OH. This formal signing will \npave the way for the deployment of the 60,000-strong NATO peace \nimplementation force.\n  Congress has a role to play in making decisions about the use of U.S. \ntroops in hostile situations. In fact, we have an obligation to our \nconstituents to raise questions about any mission that will lead to our \ntroops being put in harm's way.\n  After the Vietnam war, Congress insisted that it have a partnership \nrole with the President in future conflicts. So the Congress passed the \nWar Powers Act. Under this act, the President retained the power to \ndispatch troops when there was an emergency. But within 60 days of the \ndeployment Congress had to take action to specifically authorize the \ndeployment, tell the President to bring the troops home, or to continue \nto evaluate the situation after another 60 days extension. It was \nintended to force Congress to take action, to participate in the \ndecision.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has found ways to avoid taking action. Since \n1965, Congress has voted only twice to authorize the deployment of \nUnited States troops and, in recent years, we have voted on nonbinding \nresolutions, in some cases, and we have allowed troops to be deployed \nin the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti, without authorizing \nlegislation. We are about to do so again today.\n  During the course of this debate, the Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on three different measures relating to the use of \nUnited States forces in Bosnia. We have already completed the first \none. The President has requested congressional authorization, but has \nsaid that he intends to deploy U.S. troops with or without that \nauthorization.\n  Of course, he would like to have Congress' support. The Senate's \nconsideration of these measures will provide us with the opportunity to \nparticipate in the debate. However, do not be misled. With the \nexception of the measure passed by the House that we have defeated \ntoday, the other two resolutions which we will consider, and likely \npass, are not legally binding.\n  Mr. President, I want to reflect for just a moment on some very \ninteresting history on Vietnam. Many who can recall during that war \nperiod, Members of the Senate, particularly, would stand before the \ntelevision cameras for the evening news and wring their hands about how \nawful this war was and why it should not continue. But at no time \nduring that period was any Member of Congress willing to take \nresponsibility. All they wanted to do was to criticize the President. I \nhave a feeling that there is a reluctance over the last few years, \nsince we passed the War Powers Act, for Congress to stand up and take \nresponsibility. It is much easier to criticize the President, whether \nRepublican or Democrat, than to assume a partnership role, as provided \nunder the War Powers Act.\n  Let me say that while I know that the President is sincere in his \nattempt to bring peace to Bosnia, I find it hard to believe that anyone \ncan define a successful military mission which will ensure a lasting \npeace in the region.\n  The ethnic struggles which have led to war in Bosnia and Croatia are \nthe result of more than 800 years of hatred and mistrust. How are we \ngoing to change the course of history in one short year? In my view, \nthis is an impossible and unrealistic military mission.\n  I will go back to school-teaching days and say I hope that people \nwould take the time to read one very brief synopsis of the history of \nthis region of the world. Robert Kaplan's ``Balkan Ghosts'' is a very \nstraightforward treatise on the history, and the impossibility of this \nkind of a mission I would apply to that history. Read the history. We \ndo so little reading, we do so little reflection on how we got to where \nwe are and what were the forces that made that possible in our own \ncountry, let alone an area of the world that is probably one of the \nleast understood areas of the world from either political, economic, \nsocial, or cultural history.\n  During the last 3\\1/2\\ years we have seen more than 50 partial and \ngeneral cease-fires signed in this region with these contestants, these \nparties. All have been broken within several weeks of their signing. My \ndear colleagues, they have been doing this for 800 years, lying to one \nanother, not meaning what they were doing, because of that deep hatred \nthat they have. To see this happening here, even in our own day we do \nnot seem to be taking much lesson from it.\n  In addition, we have seen three previous peace agreements come and \ngo. Given this history, it is impossible for \n\n[[Page S18489]]\nthe President to promise he can protect U.S. troops. No one can \nguarantee their safety if the peace agreement falls apart.\n  The Dayton peace accord calls for the immediate transfer of \npeacekeeping control from the U.N. peacekeeping forces to the NATO \npeace implementation force. The approximately 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers \nin Bosnia will be replaced by 60,000 heavily armed troops under NATO \ncommand.\n  Mr. President, this is not a peacekeeping force. This is an army. It \nproves that we are trying to solve a political dilemma, a religious \ndilemma, a cultural dilemma, with military troops rather than through \ndiplomacy and negotiation.\n  One must only look at the peace agreement to see this. The primary \nmission of this course will be to implement the military aspects of the \npeace agreement. This includes monitoring and enforcing the \nrequirements that each entity promptly withdraws their forces behind a \nzone of separation which will be established on either side of the \ncease-fire line, and that within 120 days each entity withdraws all \nheavy weapons and forces to barrack areas.\n  However, under the agreement, the current warring armies will \ncontinue to exist. Each entity is permitted to maintain their army. The \nNATO forces will be made up of enough firepower to, in the President's \nwords ``respond with overwhelming force'' to any threats to their \nsafety or violations of the military aspects of the agreement.\n  This does not sound like a peacekeeping mission to me, and it should \nnot be promoted to the American public as a peacekeeping mission.\n  Furthermore, while the agreement calls for the parties to enter into \nnegotiations before the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope on future arms and heavy equipment restrictions, the agreement \nalso contradicts that arms control goal by lifting the international \narms embargo on Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  Now, get this. We are not only sending our troops in there and \nletting them maintain their own troops; we are saying we are going to \nlift the arms embargo so that they can look forward, after 180 days, to \ngetting into an arms race, escalating their military equipment, their \narms.\n  The agreement states that no side may import arms for 90 days after \nthe agreement enters force. There is this 180-day restriction, I \nrepeat, on the importation of heavy weapons, mines, military aircraft, \nand helicopters. After that, all bets are off. In fact, administration \nofficials have indicated that, if necessary, the United States \nGovernment will begin rearming the Bosnian army as early as next summer \nin an effort to bring a balance of power between the warring factions.\n  In other words, arms beget arms, violence begets violence. And we are \ngoing to continue this worldwide arms merchandising that we have been \ndoing with such efficiency during and ever since the Cold War.\n  In addition to equipping the Bosnians, the United States will also \nprovide necessary training. The agreement sets a precedent that \nmilitary arms must be maintained to achieve stability in the region. In \nmy view, this will only lead to an unfettered arms buildup and further \nundermine our ability to bring lasting peace to the region.\n  The arms embargo was not a success to begin with. At the same time we \nnow go through that charade, to think we are going to do something to \nreduce the arms. We should be pushing to get the region disarming; \ndisarming, not rearming.\n  There is no question that the war in Bosnia has had a terrible human \ntoll. More than 140,000 Bosnians have been killed during the conflict. \nAnother 3.6 million refugees and internally displaced persons have been \ncreated by this action and have had to flee their homes. Although the \npeace agreement includes provisions allowing refugees to return to \ntheir homes, it is unclear how many will be willing or able to return. \nAnd we see in the news of the sacking, the burning of those homes that \nare being vacated for the transfer of population.\n  Cases of ethnic cleansing continue to come to light as mass graves \nare uncovered near the so-called safe havens that have been overrun by \nthe Bosnian Serb Army.\n  No side to this conflict has clean hands. I can assure you that \nduring the time that this was happening, there were some of us who were \nraising the question of choking off the arms, choking off the arms that \nwere flowing down the Danube from our allies, from our friends--from \nGreece, from France, from Italy, from Germany. And who knows what kind \nof arms out of our country were in a third-party transfer? We never did \ntry with great effort to stop the flow of arms, even under the embargo. \nNow we are going to lift the pretense of an embargo in order to make \nthem much more available and accessible.\n  In order to end this human tragedy, we must take away the means to \nmake war. A successful peace will be one that includes a strategy to \ndiminish the war-making capability of all sides to this conflict. It is \namazing how we can orchestrate 25 countries of the world for a common \npurpose to fight a war for oil, but somehow we do not find our ability \nto orchestrate our allies for the cause of peace, or to disarm an \noverly armed area of the world that is a great trouble spot.\n  During the course of congressional consideration of the war in \nBosnia, we have failed to take the steps necessary to limit the war-\nmaking capability. The only votes that the Senate has taken since the \nwar began in 1991 have been to unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I \nhave opposed these resolutions in the past because I felt that lifting \nthe arms embargo would only lead to more bloodshed. Those who supported \nthe lifting of the embargo did so because they felt, if we arm the \nBosnians, they would be able to defend themselves, thereby doing away \nthe need for U.S. troops to become involved in the ground war.\n  Rather than joining with our allies to secure and enforce the embargo \nagainst all warring parties in the region, we could only see military \nmight as the solution to the complex problem. How many people do we \nhave to kill in actions of war to realize the total fallacy of that \nthesis? We now say we are going to send more troops in. We are talking \nabout injecting our own troops into the war--and that is what it is, \nbecause there has been no peace reached yet. As I said before, we are \ngoing into Bosnia with an army and we are going to force the peace. \nThis is different from the traditional notion of peacekeeping missions, \nsuch as the ones we have seen in countries like Korea and others.\n  I do not take this deployment lightly, nor do my colleagues. American \nsoldiers will likely be killed during this mission in Bosnia. We have \nto accept that reality. Our brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, and \nchildren will be at risk. In Bosnia and Croatia there are nearly 6 \nmillion landmines in the ground. These hidden enemies pose the greatest \nrisk to our troops. In fact, landmines have become the leading cause of \ncasualties in Bosnia of peacekeeping forces.\n  Even though the peace agreement requires all sides to participate in \nidentifying and removing these mines, the reality is that little \ninformation exists about the layout of the minefields scattered \nthroughout Bosnia. As we have seen in Cambodia and Afghanistan, mine \nremoval is a tedious task which takes years. Landmines in Bosnia \nendanger not only our troops and peace implementation forces, but also \ncivilians who are trying to return home and rebuild their lives.\n  I will not support any resolution that explicitly or implicitly gives \nthe Senate's support for United States troop involvement in Bosnia. \nWhile I will wholeheartedly support our troops once they are there, not \nunder their own doing, under the Commander in Chief, I cannot and will \nnot endorse this military mission.\n  We must bring a lasting peace to Bosnia, but we must do so by \nlimiting, not increasing, the war-making capability of all sides in the \nconflict. In my opinion, the mission outlined by the President fails to \nmeet this basic requirement. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what I want to do, if we can--I know there \nare some people who still want to talk. I know the Senator from Texas \nwould like to have a vote on her amendment. I would like to have that \nvote, if we can, at 4 o'clock. \n\n[[Page S18490]]\n\n  I have just been on the phone with the President. He would like to \nhave the vote as early as possible. I know the House is involved in \ndebating resolutions over there. I know some of our colleagues have yet \nto speak, but there will still be one additional resolution; that is \nthe Dole-McCain-Nunn-Lieberman, and others, resolution. So people could \nstill speak in general debate.\n  It seems to me there is no reason not to vote on the amendment by the \nSenator from Texas. There is no use making a request if it will be \nobjected to. Does the Democratic leader think we can proceed on that \nbasis and still have plenty of time for debate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have consulted with a number of our colleagues on this \nside of the aisle, and many of them feel very strongly about their need \nto speak prior to the time they will be called upon to vote on either \nmeasure. They would prefer to give one speech rather than two.\n  In my urging to limit Members to one speech, and hopefully to keep \nthose speeches to a minimum length, I will have to accommodate them and \ntheir interest in speaking and being protected in their opportunity to \nspeak prior to the time that they would be called upon to vote.\n  I am compelled at this point to object to the scheduling of the vote \nprior to the time that they have had the opportunity to speak.\n  My preference would be that we have both votes back to back to \naccommodate the speeches, and I think we can get some cooperation in \nlimiting the lengths of time, if that can be done.\n  Mr. DOLE. Certainly this Senator does not have any problem with back \nto back--anything that would expedite the process. I think most people \nhave spoken with reference to one or two of the amendments. I do not \nknow how many more speakers are on this side. Some have spoken a number \nof times.\n  I think if we limit our speeches to one per Member, or at least two \nper Member, that would help some. Maybe we can have a back-to-back vote \nat some time.\n  How much more time do you think it will take on your side?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. A lot of our colleagues are not willing to commit to a \ntime limit yet. We are working on getting at least an agreement that \neverybody speak just once and then hopefully limiting their time for \nspeaking.\n\n  At this point, I am not able to give the leader any specific estimate \nas to the amount of time we need.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not make the request, then, because the Democratic \nleader has obviously not been able to give me the consent, so there is \nno need doing that.\n  In the meantime, we will try to see if we cannot find some consensus, \nsome agreement here, where we could have back-to-back votes at some \nreasonable hour.\n  We have how many speakers left now?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could answer, I think there are \nat least 20 people signed up to this point.\n  I was, of course, hoping that the distinguished minority leader might \nbe able to put a time agreement together, and then I think we could \ngauge the length of the speeches a little more and perhaps reach a \nconclusion, and I assume that everyone would like to do this before the \nPresident leaves at 6 o'clock or so.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think there is a phone on the plane.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am sorry to hear that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent the Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, be added in the next Democratic slot on the \nlist of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a unanimous \nconsent request to add Senator Helms in the next available slot?\n  Mr. ROBB. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Helms \nbe added in the next available Republican slot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, we cannot and should not attempt to act as \nthe world's policeman. But that eminently sensible acknowledgment of \nthe limits of U.S. power cannot and should not deter us from acting \nwhen it is the United States and only the United States that can end \naggression and bloodshed, or in this case the genocide that has already \nclaimed the lives of over 200,000 human beings and left over 2 million \nas refugees.\n  I understand the concerns and reticence of many of our colleagues, \nindeed most of the American people. Calls in most congressional offices \nremain overwhelmingly against putting United States ground forces in \nBosnia. But without U.S. leadership, there would be no peace. The \nEuropeans tried nobly but in vain. The fighting did not stop until the \nUnited States led NATO in the air and led the diplomatic efforts which \nculminated in the initialing of the agreement in Dayton and the final \nsigning that will take place tomorrow in Paris.\n  Without U.S. leadership and active participation on the ground, the \npeace will end and the carnage will continue. We now represent the \nlast, best hope to bring the war in the Balkans to a close.\n  Are there risks? Certainly there are risks, serious risks. Of course \nthere are some risks to our troops even in normal training exercises. \nBut I believe the risks are even greater if we fail to honor this \ncommitment. I do not relish putting our troops at risk in the barrens \nof northeast Bosnia.\n  But for each of us, I would suggest that there are some risks--\nsomething that we consider so important that we are willing to work, \nthat we are willing to risk dying for it. I think, for example, we \nwould all agree that we would do whatever it was necessary to do in \norder to protect immediate members of our family. But there are also \nlarger risks that are worth dying for--as a Nation worth putting our \ntroops at risk for. I have seen some of these risks. I have seen war. I \nhave had men literally die in my arms in combat. I have written letters \nand talked to the parents of those who have lost their lives under \nthese circumstances. It is not easy. But the cost of freedom is high. \nYet, it is a price that I believe that we have to be willing to pay.\n  We cannot shrink from the role that only the United States of America \ncan play in making peace work in faraway lands when America is now the \nonly nation with the capacity to lead this effort to a successful \nconclusion. No one supports the atrocities which have occurred daily in \nBosnia. But the question we face is whether the lives of American \nservice men and service women are worth risking to stop it. And I \nbelieve that risk is appropriate. I believe we have a moral \nresponsibility to act.\n  In that vein, I was struck by Elie Wiesel's comments this morning \nwhen he said, ``We in the United States represent a certain moral \naspect of history. A great nation owes its greatness not only to its \nmilitary power but also to its moral consciousness.'' He went on to say \n``What would future generations say about us, all of us, here in this \nland, if we do nothing?'' And I remember his deeply-felt plea to the \nsame effect some 2\\1/2\\ years ago at the dedication of the Holocaust \nMuseum when he turned and urged President Clinton to stop the war in \nthe Balkans.\n  Mr. President, doing nothing represents an abdication of our \nresponsibilities as the leader of NATO and the larger community of \nnations. Doing nothing increases the likelihood of a larger war in \nEurope. Doing nothing amounts to tacit acceptance of more slaughter in \nBosnia.\n  The Prime Minister of Israel, Shimon Peres, yesterday at a joint \nsession of Congress was eloquent and powerful in saying to us\n\n       You enabled many nations to save their democracies, even as \n     you strive now to assist many nations to free themselves from \n     their nondemocratic past. You fought many wars. You won many \n     victories. Wars did not cause you to lose heart. Thanks to \n     the support you have given, and to the aid you have rendered, \n     we have been able to overcome wars and tragedies thrust upon \n     us, and feel sufficiently strong to take measured risks to \n     wage our campaign of peace.\n\n  Mr. President, we now stand alone as the only country capable of \nrestoring order and a sense of hope in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \nAmerican imprimatur carries enormous weight among the community of \nnations. We can and should seek to spread the word of peace to places \nlike the Middle East, and Ireland--and, yes, Bosnia--that have \n\n[[Page S18491]]\nknown the language of violence and war for too long.\n  Mr. President, these war and peace decisions are difficult, and they \nreach deep into our emotions. I believe our Founding Fathers were wise \nto vest in the President the responsibilities of being the Commander in \nChief of our Armed Forces while providing Congress with the power of \nthe purse and the exclusive right to declare war.\n  We have only one President at a time, and he has acted in his \ncapacity as Commander in Chief. Were we in his shoes we well might have \ntaken 100 different courses of action in the Senate, and perhaps as \nmany as 435 different courses of action in the House. Indeed, I have \nlong urged more assertive action by the United States for several \nyears.\n  But, Mr. President, it is the President of the United States who is \nultimately responsible for this decision, and the American people and \nultimately history will hold him accountable. His choice to deploy \ntroops to Bosnia may not be popular with the American people. But you \ncannot lead by following the polls, and for this I commend his courage.\n  The President has made a choice in favor of leadership over \nisolation--in favor of standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies \ninstead of abandoning them, in favor of morality rather than allowing \nthe crimes against humanity to continue. I applaud his choice to \ngrapple with these problems and to seek a comprehensive solution. He \ndeserves enormous credit for taking on this cause of peace and freedom \nthat is so ingrained in our American way of life.\n  I happen to have a very high level of confidence in our troops who \nare the best led, best trained, and most powerful fighting force that \nthe world has ever known. When they have successfully completed their \nlimited mission in Europe, there is clearly going to be more to do with \nrespect to a residual force. And, in that respect, I believe that \nEurope will step up to its responsibility at the appropriate time.\n  In the same context, Mr. President, I would like to salute our \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, and Senator John McCain in particular, who \nhave risen above whatever partisan gain might have accrued to them by \ntaking a different course of action, to join the President in leading \nthe country to support our troops--just as I was pleased to help lead \nthe effort and support our troops, and support President Bush when he \nasked for our help in the gulf war.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the President of the United States has made \na strong case for U.S. leadership. Absent American participation peace \nwill fail in the Balkans, and ongoing war will have continued to \nthreaten our national security interests.\n  Mr. President, I believe our security depends on joining with our \nallies in times like this, and I urge my colleagues to do what I \nbelieve in this case is the right thing to do. And that is to support \nthe deployment and to support our troops in the commitment that the \nPresident of the United States acting in his capacity as Commander in \nChief has made there and on our behalf.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to vote against the \nresolution which would be a resolution of disapproval, and vote for the \nbipartisan effort that the majority leader and others have sponsored to \nsupport our actions, notwithstanding some of their own reservations, so \nthat our troops carrying our flag will know that they have our backing \nwhen they are placed in harm's way.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time has been reserved for the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no time limits.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will try to finish in 8 minutes. Would you notify me \nwhen I have used 7?\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, first of all, I think everybody knows \nof my great support for Senator Dole. I am, for the most part, at his \nside in all the battles that are fought in the Senate. I cherish that \nrelationship very, very much. I am also fully cognizant, at least as \ncognizant I can be, of the Commander in Chief concept that is discussed \nhere so eloquently by many who know more about it than I and by people \nlike the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who understands it from \nthe battlefield.\n  Mr. President, I have heard other Senators talk about the derivation \nof that constitutional power of the Commander in Chief. I heard one of \nthe eloquent Senators last night, Senator Cohen, describe it in a way \nthat I will repeat very briefly. Between the Congress and the \nPresident, the exercise of this constitutional power is somewhat like a \nrace--whomever gets there first has this power. If Congress, 6 months \nago, would have enacted an appropriations bill prohibiting United \nStates involvement in Bosnia and prohibiting the expenditure of funds \nfor that purpose, then it would be illegal to spend these funds. There \nwould be no constitutional issue because the Commander in Chief would \nhave no authority to spend any money.\n  The power of the purse strings and of using the taxpayers' money to \npay for events, whether they are here or overseas, is that of the \nCongress. If the President decides to involve our troops in an issue \nsuch as this, in a commitment such as this, and the troops are deployed \nbefore congressional action, then it is said that we must support this \ndecision because he had the inherent power as Commander in Chief.\n  Now, I do not want any misunderstanding as far as this Senator is \nconcerned. There is no one in the Senate that I take a back seat to in \nterms of supporting the defense of our Nation, and I have had a lot to \ndo over the last 15 years with how much we spend on defense, not \nnecessarily the details, but a lot to do with the total that we spend. \nI have come down for the most part on the side of spending more rather \nthan less. We must have the best equipped force rather than take any \nrisks. We must pay our All-Volunteer Army enough so that it remains an \nall-volunteer army in the concept originated under the Nixon \nadministration. They must be paid with some parity to civilian jobs so \nwe get and keep the very best.\n  All of this is said by this Senator to suggest that I want a very \nstrong American military. I am proud of the fact that when we send our \nmilitary to get involved in the world, they do their job. As far as our \nsoldiers are concerned they always come out of it, with few exceptions, \nas being good people, if you can do that and have war. We are a good \nnation and we have good motives, and, with few exceptions, that is how \nwe behave.\n  But, Mr. President and fellow Senators, in spite of these inherent \npowers, we are each elected as a Senator from our State. American men \nand women are going to be assigned to a foreign country in large \nnumbers--20,000, maybe 25,000--to accomplish a mission, and I believe \nparamount to all of these various powers is my right as a Senator to \nexpress myself either in favor of it or opposed to it.\n  I am opposed to the involvement of the 20,000 American troops with \n40,000 from other countries, mostly the countries that were formerly \nNATO. Now we have expanded NATO's role and we have a few countries \ninvolved that were not part of NATO. I believe it is my right to say I \ndo not think this is the right thing to do.\n  Now, nobody should doubt that this view is going to lose and that the \nAmerican troops are going to go there, and nobody should doubt that \nonce they are there they will find this Senator agreeing to pay to keep \nthem there and keep them the very best. When our generals say you need \nmoney to make sure they are as safe as possible, I will be right here \namong the first and the clearest saying I am for it.\n  I am expressing myself, fortunately, before the troops are there. \nThere is a small contingency there. And let me even say that my remarks \nmight not even be addressed at them because that is a small \ncontingency. They are there, and I do not want to see anything happen \nto them. But this issue I am addressing is-- should we put 20,000 \nAmericans there to maintain the peace? Frankly, I think it is a mistake \nalmost any way that I look at it. We are powerful, and if we go there, \npeople will think we are powerful. If we go there, Europe will think it \nis great. They will say, America is leading again.\n  But the question is, leading what? What are we trying to do? And is \nthere \n\n[[Page S18492]]\na real, bona fide probability that what we are trying to do will not \nwork? I happen to know less than most around here about what went on in \nthat country for the last 600 years. But I do know something. I do know \nthat the only times these people have lived together in peace and \nharmony in modern times were two events in history: One, when the \nGermans occupied it. Clearly we do not intend to keep the peace among \nthese people who do not seem to want to have peace among themselves \nwith an occupancy like Hitler's. I hope we do not, and we are assured \nwe do not.\n  The other peaceful time in modern history was the reign of the \ndictator Tito. The Communists' most pervasive way of keeping peace and \nharmony is block by block behavior that must be consistent with the \nstate or something happens to you, right? That is a simple way of \nsaying you behave or we kill you. This was maybe not like the Nazi \noccupation, but that also maintained the peace.\n  We are not going to do that. There is no one around suggesting that \nanyone is going to do that. And so we have three new countries born of \nnew boundaries and we are going to ask of that leadership, the \nleadership of those countries, what I perceive to be impossible. We are \ngoing to ask them to do a ``Mission Impossible''--disarm those who \nwould cause harm with weapons. How are they going to do that? I do not \nbelieve they are strong enough, and I do not believe they will get it \ndone. There will be plenty of guns around for rebels who want to kill \neach other, who are angry because they do not belong in that country or \ntheir houses are occupied by people they do not want.\n  We are also asked to be part of making sure that these countries get \na balance of military power amongst themselves. I am not even so sure \nthat will work. We have been talking about it for a long time, but I am \nwondering even if a military balance is reached then pull our troops \nout, that Bosnia could be an even bigger tinderbox and more war with \nmore killing. So my own feeling is we are sending our troops to do \nsomething that will not work, to exhibit our leadership in a situation \nthat we ought not be leading or even supporting.\n  Now, obviously, it is easy to get up on the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about how great America is, and how wonderful our military men and \nwomen are. We can almost envision in our mind's eye the great, \nbeautiful sight when they arrive and show up with all of our new tanks \nand all of the American flags. It is going to be a great scene. And \nbelieve you me, I am going to feel very proud, because it is a \nfantastic--a fantastic--accomplishment of the people of the United \nStates who regularly have been paying taxes. Let me mention right now, \nthey are paying about $270 billion for the defense of our country, so \nthat we can have men and women like these that we are sending there.\n  So I close today very simply by saying I would not send any more \npeople in, and I am voting for the resolution that says we do not \napprove of this. It is with reluctance that I will vote against the \nDole resolution when it comes up because I do not think it is the right \nthing to do.\n  I hope I have explained myself that I am not trying to pass judgment \non these constitutional powers, be they inherent or otherwise. I am \ntalking very, very simply about what I perceive to be my right and my \nresponsibility. I express it as best I can here on the floor. And that \nis the way I feel. For those who have led this cause, with far more \neffort than I, I thank them for it. And I thank the junior Senator from \nOklahoma for his leadership.\n  I do believe we are going to be there for quite awhile and spend a \nlot of money. I pray that is all we spend there, and we do not spend \nany lives there. I truly believe it is possible that we will lose a lot \nof lives. But I am not standing up here saying I am frightened \nsingularly of that. I just do not think we ought to do this. I do not \nthink it is the right mission for us. And since I feel that way, \nneither our tanks nor our resources nor our men and women should be \nthere trying to accomplish this job. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today or tomorrow the Senate will be voting \non the President's decision to deploy United States military forces as \npart of a NATO peace enforcement mission in Bosnia.\n  There are many different views of how we got to this point. You have \nmy own views on that. I will discuss them at another time. I have \nalready discussed them in the past on numerous occasions.\n  But it is my hope that the Senate will now be able to concentrate its \nfocus on the choices that are now before us. There are few things about \nthe current situation that we know; a few things that we believe based \non reasonable judgments but not certainty; and many unknowns that are \nsubject only to reasonable speculation at this point, even if it is \nreasonable speculation.\n  The things that we know are what I will try to deal with in a short \nand brief set of remarks today.\n  First of all, we know that President Clinton has decided to commit \nUnited States military forces to this mission in Bosnia.\n  Second, we know that NATO has decided to commit the NATO alliance to \nthis peace enforcement mission. And we know that all NATO nations that \nhave military forces are participating.\n  Third, we know that several hundred American troops are now on the \nground in Bosnia; and several thousand troops will be on the ground in \nBosnia in the next few weeks.\n  Fourth, we can debate the constitutional power of the Commander in \nChief, as we have many times in the past and we will again, and we can \ndebate congressional responsibility to declare war, but we all know \nthat Congress has neither the ways nor the means to prevent this \ndeployment unless we cut off the funds. We know that. It has already \nbeen decided by the Senate today that we are not going to cut off the \nfunds. We know that.\n  Fifth, we know that the Defense appropriations bill has passed, been \nsigned, and the President, like his predecessors of both parties, will \nfinance the operation out of operation and maintenance funds and then \nseek reimbursement of these funds next year in a supplemental \nappropriation.\n  Sixth, we know that if Congress cuts off the funds at this point, it \nwould require a majority in both Houses to pass and two-thirds vote in \nboth the Senate and House to override a certain veto. The Senate \nrejected this cutoff of funds decisively today when we voted on the \nfirst resolution because I believe the Senators concluded this would \nhave an adverse effect on our own military forces, an adverse effect on \nour allies, an adverse effect on our leadership in NATO and the world, \nas well as an adverse effect on the parties on the ground in Bosnia.\n  The President has decided on deployment. The NATO alliance has \ndecided on deployment. The United States forces are on the way to \nBosnia. What then is the congressional role in this important national \nsecurity decision?\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk at length today about some of the \nconstitutional challenges we have in terms of determining the role of \nCongress in the post-cold war era. I will return to that subject \nshortly.\n  But today we must face a world of reality. The cards have been dealt. \nThe administration's actions--starting with the President's commitment \nalmost 3 years ago--and that was a public and international commitment \nthat United States forces would participate in a NATO force to \nimplement a Bosnian peace agreement--have put Congress in a situation \nin which a great deal is at stake, including United States reliability \nand leadership, but also including the peace agreement itself, the \nending of the tragedy in Bosnia, as well as the future of NATO as an \nalliance.\n  We also know that a cut off of funds will not become law, but passage \nof this type of legislation--followed by a veto and a vote to override, \nif the House passes it or we pass it today--would put our military \nforces in limbo in the middle of their deployment--when they are most \nvulnerable. To me this is unthinkable and unacceptable.\n  We also know that the effect of such action would erode the value of \nU.S. commitments around the world and would increase the danger to U.S. \nmilitary personnel in harm's way that are stationed in dangerous places \naround the world.\n  That danger certainly would be an increase to our military forces \nwhether \n\n[[Page S18493]]\nin the Korean Peninsula or in Europe or in the Middle East because the \ngreatest thing they have behind them is United States credibility and \nthe credibility of our own word.\n  The bottom line--Mr. President--if today Congress found a way to \nprevent the President from going forward with his commitment, the \ndamage to America and the increased danger to our troops in the world \nis certain. There is really no doubt about that.\n  If we do give the President the green light and permit the mission to \ngo forward in a carefully prescribed manner, the risks are considerable \nbut there is at least a chance of success if that term is narrowly and \ncarefully defined.\n  I will not dwell on the definition of success in these remarks today. \nBut before the week is out I do want to give a much more detailed \npresentation including what I think we should do in terms of the \ndefinition of success, including the risk of this operation as well as \nthe opportunities of this operation.\n  Mr. President, my main concern today however is the message the \nSenate sends to our military forces who are about to embark on this \nNATO mission to Bosnia.\n  I would like to read into the Record and place in the Record a letter \nI received today. It was dated December 12. It is signed by Michael S. \nDavison, General, U.S. Army, retired--many will remember General \nDavison for his service to our Nation--Andrew J. Goodpaster, General, \nU.S. Army, retired, who also served as the Supreme Allied Commander in \nEurope as well as the head of NATO forces, Walter T. Kerwin, General, \nU.S. Army, retired, who had a very distinguished career in the Army, \nWilliam J. McCaffrey, Lieutenant General, U.S. Army, retired, William \nY. Smith, U.S. Air Force, retired, Harry D. Train, Admiral, U.S. Navy, \nretired, and others.\n  For those of us who have been here very long in the Senate, this is a \nsterling list of outstanding military leaders that have served our \nNation with distinction. Here is what they say:\n\n       Dear Senator Nunn: As American military forces are being \n     prepared for commitment in Bosnia, we believe it is essential \n     that they go with a clear understanding that they are \n     supported by their country--that is, by the whole American \n     people--in their difficult and dangerous assignment.\n       Our military forces serving in Bosnia will be under \n     American command, acting in concert with military forces from \n     NATO and other nations that participate in the military \n     implementation of the Dayton peace agreement. The mission \n     statement and the NATO chain of command must make it clear \n     that the military forces are not to be drawn into mission-\n     creep nation-building but are to be used for tasks military \n     in nature, and will not be subjected to attempts at micro-\n     management from afar, or to ``dual-key'' aberrations.\n\n  Continuing the quote from these distinguished retired military \nofficials.\n\n       As our leaders consider our country's involvement in \n     Bosnia, we encourage them to send a message to our Soldiers, \n     Sailors, Airmen and Marines wherever they may be (and to all \n     others as well) that our country is giving them its full \n     backing in the accomplishment of their assigned mission. We \n     believe it is time to close ranks, support our troops in the \n     field, and concentrate on helping them do their job in the \n     best possible way.\n\n  And then the letter is signed by these generals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 13, 1995.\n       As American military forces are being prepared for \n     commitment in Bosnia, we believe it is essential that they go \n     with a clear understanding that they are supported by their \n     county--that is, by the whole American people--in their \n     difficult and dangerous assignment.\n       Our military forces serving in Bosnia will be under \n     American command, acting in concert with military forces from \n     NATO and other nations that participate in the military \n     implementation of the Dayton peace agreement. The mission \n     statement and the NATO chain of command must make it clear \n     that the military forces are not to be drawn into mission-\n     creep nation-building but are to be used for tasks military \n     in nature, and will not be subjected to attempts at micro-\n     management from afar, or to ``dual-key'' aberrations.\n       As our leaders consider our country's involvement in \n     Bosnia, we encourage them to send a message to our Soldiers, \n     Sailors, Airmen and Marines wherever they may be (and to all \n     others as well) that our country is giving them its full \n     backing in the accomplishment of their assigned mission. We \n     believe it is time to close ranks, support our troops in the \n     field, and concentrate on helping them do their job in the \n     best possible way.\n\n     Michael S. Davison, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Russell E. Dougherty, General, U.S. Air Force (Ret.)\n     John R. Galvin, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Andrew J. Goodpaster, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Walter T. Kerwin, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     William P. Lawrence, Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n     William J. McCaffrey, Lt. Gen., U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Jack N. Merritt, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Bernard W. Rogers, General, U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     Brent Scowcroft, Lt. Gen., U.S. Air Force (Ret.)\n     George M. Seignious, II, Lt. Gen., U.S. Army (Ret.)\n     William Y. Smith, General, U.S. Air Force (Ret.)\n     Harry D. Train, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I agree with every word in this letter. I \nthink they are absolutely right on target. This is where we are today. \nAnd this is the kind of consideration that the Senate must take into \naccount today. We will have plenty of time to debate how we got to this \npoint. But today I think we first and foremost need to consider the \neffect of what we do on not only the military forces themselves that \nare in the process of deploying, but on their families and on their \nmission.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate today to support--or tomorrow, \nwhenever we vote--the Dole-McCain resolution. This resolution has been \nthe subject of intense and constructive negotiations on a bipartisan \nbasis with a Democratic working group headed by Senator Daschle, \nSenator Pell and myself.\n  The Dole-McCain resolution, as now worded, has a key paragraph which \nI believe conveys the kind of support our American troops and their \nfamilies both need and deserve. I quote that paragraph because I think \nit basically follows almost exactly what these distinguished retired \nmilitary generals and admirals have said to us in the way of advice.\n  Quoting the paragraph in the Dole-McCain resolution:\n\n       The Congress unequivocally supports the men and women of \n     our Armed Forces who are carrying out their mission in \n     support of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina with professional \n     excellence, dedicated patriotism and exemplary bravery and \n     believes that they must be given all necessary resources and \n     support to carry out their mission and ensure their security.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the heart of what we are going to be voting \non. I hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nunderstand the importance of what we are doing, and I hope they will \nput the military forces first and foremost in their minds.\n  Mr. President, before we vote on the Dole-McCain resolution, it is my \nunderstanding we will vote on the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution. I have \ngreat respect for both Senators who sponsored this resolution. They are \non the Armed Services Committee, and they do a sterling job of \nrepresenting their States and representing the American people on this \ncommittee. But the Hutchison resolution does not provide what our \ntroops need. It does not provide a sense that the Senate backs them and \ntheir mission. It tells our military forces, in effect--``We don't \nagree with your mission. What you're doing is not important to the \nUnited States. It's not important enough for you to risk your life.''\n  These are the people who are going to be risking their lives. ``It's \nnot important enough for you to risk your life and neither is the NATO \nalliance and its mission.''\n  ``Enforcing the peace agreement in Bosnia''--and this is my \nparaphrasing of the Hutchison-Inhofe message; these are not the words. \nI do not want anyone to think I am quoting the words. This is the \neffect of those words. ``Enforcing the peace agreement in Bosnia is not \nsomething we agree with.'' That \n\n[[Page S18494]]\nis what we are going to be saying implicitly if we adopt this \nresolution. Certainly we will be saying it if we adopt this resolution \nand do not pass the Dole-McCain resolution. We are also saying \nimplicitly the President is totally on his own without the backing of \nthe Congress and the American people.\n  We go forward and say in the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution--again, in \neffect, these are my words--``We will pay you, we will equip you and we \nwill wish you well. We don't agree with the mission, we don't think \nit's important enough for you to risk your life, but we are going to \nequip you, support you and wish you well.''\n  Now, how are our military men and women and their families going to \nfeel about undertaking this kind of mission where, indeed, many of them \nwill be risking their lives? I hope not many will end up being injured \nor killed. I hope none. But nevertheless, there is a very serious risk \nhere. We know that. How are they going to feel if we send them off on \nthis undertaking with this message from the U.S. Senate?\n  Mr. President, I understand the temptation of my colleagues to vote \nfor the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution. It gives Senators the ability to \nsay we were against this mission from the beginning but we support our \ntroops. This resolution, which will be voted on today or tomorrow, may \nbe what some Senators need, but it is not what our troops need at this \njuncture.\n  It is entirely possible--I hope it does not happen--but it is \nentirely possible the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution could be agreed to \nand the Dole-McCain resolution could fail. If this occurs, then our \nAmerican military will have the worst of both worlds. We will be \nsaying, ``Full speed ahead on a risky mission that we don't agree with, \ndon't approve of''--and that is what we are going to be saying--``Full \nspeed ahead on a risky mission with the clear knowledge the mission is \ndenounced at the outset by the U.S. Senate.''\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, \nand I urge them to vote for the Dole-McCain resolution.\n  I urge all of those who at this stage are thinking about voting for \nthe Hutchison resolution to think very carefully. It is essential for \nthe morale of our military forces that we send the clear message of the \nDole-McCain resolution which says, in effect, ``We may not agree with \nthe President or how we got to this point, but we believe the \ncommitment of U.S. military forces to Bosnia is important; it is \nimportant to prevent the spread of the conflict, to maintain United \nStates leadership in NATO, to stop the tragic loss of life, to fulfill \nAmerican commitments and to preserve United States credibility.''\n  There is a different message, a fundamentally different message that \nwill go forward if we adopt the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution. If we pass \nthe Dole-McCain resolution, in spite of the clear concern expressed in \nthat resolution about how we got to this point, there is no doubt that \nthe Dole-McCain resolution fully supports the American military forces \nand fully supports the mission that they are going to be undertaking.\n  I want to read again the paragraph in the Dole-McCain resolution that \nmakes this abundantly clear, and I hope Senators will concentrate on \nthe difference between this language and what is in the Hutchison-\nInhofe language.\n  The language in the Dole-McCain resolution says:\n\n       The Congress unequivocally supports the men and women of \n     our Armed Forces who are carrying out their missions in \n     support of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina with professional \n     excellence, dedicated patriotism and exemplary bravery, and \n     believes they must be given all necessary resources and \n     support to carry out their missions and ensure their \n     security.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I urge the passage of the Dole-McCain \nresolution so that our military forces and their families will \nunderstand not only that we in Congress support them, but that the \nmission they are undertaking and the risks they will bear are important \nto America.\n  I know there are others waiting to speak, and I am not going to go \ninto great detail, but I do want to say, just in summarizing my \nprepared remarks, which I will not give today but will give at a later \npoint in this debate or thereafter, that the Congress of the United \nStates needs to take a fundamental look at the role we are playing or \nnot playing in terms of these national security decisions.\n  Congress must understand--if we do not at this point, we must begin \nto, and I have understood it for a number of years--the War Powers Act \ndoes not work. The longer this outmoded and unworkable legislation \nremains on the books, the longer we will continue the illusion that \nCongress is playing a meaningful role in the commitment of U.S. \nmilitary forces to these types of missions.\n  President Clinton will be viewed by most in Congress as assuming the \nfull responsibility for the fate of the United States military mission \nin Bosnia. That is because this commitment by President Clinton was \nmade in 1993 without consultation with the Congress or the \ncongressional leadership.\n  There is a similarity between this and the Persian Gulf where the \nPresident of the United States, President Bush then, committed the \nUnited States internationally without an approval of Congress. That is \nthe parallel. We are going to face this situation over and over and \nover again, where Presidents commit internationally before they get \napproval at home.\n  We have to address this. I think it is in our court. I think it is \nCongress' responsibility to make the correction. An awful lot of this \ncomes from the illusion that the War Powers Act may some day \nmiraculously work. It has never worked. It is not going to work. It is \nbased on the fundamental flaw that assumes that congressional inaction \ncan require the Commander in Chief to withdraw forces from abroad. \nCongressional inaction will never, ever force a Commander in Chief to \nwithdraw forces. The only way we can do that is by cutting off funds, \nand we need to recognize this.\n  No President will or should allow U.S. forces to be withdrawn from a \nmilitary mission because of simple congressional inaction. I think, Mr. \nPresident, it is time to repeal the War Powers Act and replace it with \nlegislation that is realistic and workable. We must find a way to \ncreate regular, full, and comprehensive consultation between the \nPresident and the Congress before the President makes concrete \ncommitments and before U.S. troops are committed to harm's way.\n  We do not have that mechanism now. We do not have the consultation \ntaking place in a timely fashion, and that has been true both in \nRepublican and in Democratic administrations.\n  So I hope out of this we will begin looking at the War Powers Act and \nbegin to make changes to correct it.\n  I see that the Senator from Delaware is on the floor. He and I and \nSenator Byrd, as well as Senator Warner and several other Republicans, \nseveral years ago sponsored a revision of the War Powers Act. I hope \nour colleagues will begin to think along those lines because it is \nleading us down the primrose path of having a law on the books that \nsupposedly involves Congress in these decisions when, by the time \nCongress gets involved, the international commitment has already been \nmade and the choices are regrettably limited.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the debate that has been \nundertaken here in the U.S. Senate and the remarks of individuals who \nare sincere on both sides of this question. I do think, however, that \nin characterizing the resolutions upon which we will be voting, it is \nimportant to understand the wording of the resolutions and to take them \nfor their face value.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Georgia has sought to \ncharacterize the resolution of Senators Hutchison and Inhofe as being \none which would not signal to the troops that we really support them. I \nwould like to read section 2, which is entitled ``Expressing Support \nfor United States Military Personnel Who Are Deployed.'' The wording is \nsimple, straightforward, and unmistakably clear:\n\n       The Congress strongly supports the United States military \n     personnel who may be ordered by the President to implement \n     the general framework agreement for peace in Bosnia/\n     Herzegovina and its associated annexes.\n\n  It seems to me that that is a very clear and generous statement. It \nis an \n\n[[Page S18495]]\nhonest statement by the U.S. Senate, which allows that even if we \ndisagree with the President--and many of us do--when such a deployment \nis made, in the words of the resolution, we will strongly support the \nmilitary personnel who are ordered by the President to implement the \nparticular mission which has been designated. In this case, it is to \nimplement the general framework for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nthe associated annexes.\n  Today, Mr. President, the United States again finds itself faced with \nthe conflicting demands of a confused and chaotic world. Today's debate \ncarries the name of ``Bosnia,'' but it is a debate that this Congress \nhas faced numerous times before--it is just the name that has changed.\n  At stake and at question are the specific terms, conditions, and \nreasons for deploying U.S. troops, and the nature of U.S. foreign \npolicy generally. These are not small or trivial matters--not for the \nPresident or for those of us here in the Congress, not for the \nmilitary, and certainly not for the families of America's service men \nand women, who are preparing for deployment in Bosnia.\n  Like all Americans, I want to see an end to the killing and cruelty \nthat have come to define the daily existence of millions of people in \nBosnia. The atrocities committed by all parties are so heinous as to \noffend all of our consciences and to fire within us justifiable \noutrage. That these horrors come to an end is not a point of debate; \nthat the United States has a special responsibility in the world, as \nthe only superpower, is likewise not a matter of genuine debate.\n  But today's debate is much more narrowly focused--it is a debate \nabout a so-called peace plan--brokered by the United States, agreed to \nby the warring parties, signed in Dayton--and whether that plan \nwarrants the involvement and possible deaths of U.S. ground troops in \nthe Balkans. I believe that until the Clinton administration can \nclearly and convincingly answer why, how, and under what conditions we \nought to be involved, I cannot support the President's decision to \ndeploy American soldiers to enforce the peace agreement.\n  In any deployment of U.S. ground troops, I believe that we must meet \nat least a five-part test. I will state the parts of that test again \ntoday, just as I have consistently over the course of the last year.\n  First, I think we have to identify the vital U.S. national interests. \nIt has to be a security interest. It has to be an interest which is \nimportant to the continuing existence of this country.\n  Second, we need to outline clear U.S. military and policy objectives.\n  Third, we need to construct a timetable and strategy for achieving \nthose objectives.\n  Fourth, we need to develop an appropriate exit strategy; and,\n  Fifth, we really need to gain the support of the American people for \nthe policy initiatives and the military objectives in any deployment.\n  What we determine to be our vital interests is dynamic. A \ngeographical region that might be vital to our interests at one time \nmay not be at another time. Technology might change. Broadly defined, \n``vital'' U.S. interests are defined as being those interests that have \na direct political and economic effect on the Nation. They ought to \nhave an interest about our capacity to survive and succeed as a nation. \nThreats to strategic assets, to shipping lanes, to our strategic \nallies, and threats to our traditional sphere of influence, similarly \nrepresent ``clear and present danger'' to the United States. Less clear \nis the nature of humanitarian interest, and how and when such interests \nare considered vital U.S. national interests.\n  Despite the protestations of members of the Clinton administration, \nit is this final category that I believe we are dealing here. In the \ncourse of the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to hear from a \nnumber of the architects of the Dayton accord--Secretary of State, \nWarren Christopher; Secretary of Defense, William Perry; Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, and chief \nnegotiator Richard Holbrooke. Their explanations of why we should be \ninvolved, in my judgment, lacked credibility. Their rationale has never \nincluded a valid explanation of how vital U.S. national security \ninterests are at stake in the Balkans at the close of this century.\n  On the one hand, they have said that we have a risk of an expanded \nfull-scale Balkan war that could domino its way all across Europe. Such \nassertions fly in the face of fact. Secretary Christopher has stated \nthat a major reason the peace agreement was reached is that the warring \nparties are suffering from battle fatigue. This is an internal conflict \nthat has raged for years, stemming from differences which have divided \npeople for centuries. If the fighting factions are war weary, then what \nevidence is there to suggest that the potential for the war to spread \nis imminent or greater now than it has been in the past?\n  We have seen some 30 cease-fire in this region before, which begs the \nquestion, is this the cease-fire of the century or a cease-fire of the \nseason, with another long winter's nap? While the threat of another \nmassive European war makes for good headlines, baseless threats make \nfor lousy public policy.\n  The President has argued that our continued leadership in NATO is at \nstake here. He believes that it is a vital U.S. interest to prove \nourselves overseas. U.S. perception and leadership overseas are clearly \nvital. The question that no one has answered, however, is how the \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops will help.\n  The only response I have been given that comes close to answering \nthis question is that U.S. ground troops must be deployed in order to \nvindicate the President because in a speech 2 years ago, he made a \npromise to send troops. Retreating from that promise would somehow \nsignal a failure in his leadership. Well, very frankly, we should not \nput American lives on the line just to rescue an outdated Presidential \npromise.\n  Following the gulf war, world perception of our resolve--of our \ndetermination to get things done--was clear, the United States meant \nwhat it said and acted accordingly. Since that time, world perception \nhas taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Our foreign policy objectives \nhave been unclear, and our resolve has been uncertain. Before we deploy \nU.S. troops anywhere in the world we must determine whether our vital \nnational interests must be at stake.\n  I am confused about the explanations by the administration which \nallege that this indeed involves a set of vital interests because when \nyou ask the administration about the deployment, they say that the \ndeployment will be for 1 year. The achievement is not of a vital \ninterest. The achievement here is a time of duration. If these \ninterests are so vital, if they are critical to the success and \nsurvival of this country in the next century, why is it that they are \nonly critical for a year, and we will leave whether or not we will \nachieve them in a span of a year?\n  The idea this is a deployment for a term of days rather than for the \nachievement of vital and specific interests is an idea which shakes and \nthreatens the very foundation of the allegation that there are vital \ninterests here. I guess there is the question about whether the United \nStates should be a world policeman that imposes her morality on the \nworld. The United States is the world's only superpower, and that role \ncarries with it responsibilities no other nation has. These \nresponsibilities include the responsibility to use our forces \njudiciously. We should not decide to deploy U.S. troops simply because \nwe can. We should not exercise military prowess to conquer a \nmountainous civil war merely because it is there. We should not be a 9-\n1-1 on call to respond to every world dispute or civil disturbance. We \nmust recognize that it is possible to squander our power and our \nresources by misusing them.\n  Mr. President, according to the administration, we have an expiration \ndate but we have no achievement strategy. Why deploy ground troops in \nthe first place if we are going to pull them out whether or not \nanything is accomplished?\n  There is a related issue about this agreement that troubles me. It \nhas to do with the assignment of our soldiers that they are being asked \nto undertake. There are some components of the Dayton accord which \nreally elevate values in which we do not believe. We should ask \nourselves, under the Dayton \n\n[[Page S18496]]\naccord, will we be going abroad with our troops to enforce things and \nvalues which are not things that we are willing to support or that we \nrespect at home? As a matter of fact, are we going there to support or \nreinforce things which we abhor at home? Would we be going there to \nenforce a type of ethnic de facto segregation that we are fighting \nagainst at home? Is it possible that we are deploying America's \nsoldiers to fight for values of ethnic isolation that run contrary to \nAmerica's values? Are we asking our troops to defend territorial lines \namong ethnic factions which were gained through offensive atrocities? \nAre we validating ethnic segregation of the parties to promote peace, \nwhen our Nation painfully learned that it is only ``united we stand, \ndivided we fall.''\n  For generations we pursued an international strategy of promoting \ndemocratic values. I think we have to ask ourselves, is that what we \nare doing here? There are a lot of nuances and uncertainties about \nforeign policies. This is not one of them. We fight abroad for our \ninterests and our values. We must not agree to work for something that \nis both not in our vital national interests, but contrary to our \nvalues.\n  Let me just say in conclusion that I believe that we must make sure \nthat the deployment of our troops is not merely the appetizer and that \nthe main course becomes massive foreign aid that is felt as an \nobligation of this country and Congress as a result of having had the \ndeployment of our troops on the soil of a foreign nation. All too \nfrequently, we feel that we must follow our troops after a deployment \nhas been concluded, with an outbreak of nation building and \ninfrastructure construction and resources which are beyond the ability \nof our culture to afford for ourselves--certainly not within our \ncapacity to provide for everyone around the world.\n  There is a substantial expense in this whole operation that is going \nto take $2 billion out of our defense budget this year, and there will \nbe requests for additional money to support this deployment. Frankly, \nit will hurt--it will hurt our ability to provide defense in other \nareas.\n  I am convinced that we have to be careful not to weaken our ability \nto defend strategic vital national interests where they occur around \nthe world by deploying our troops in areas which do not have clear \nobjectives, where there are no strategic vital national interests, or \nwhere those interests are not clearly outlined and where our commitment \nis not for the achievement of a specific objective but it is for a term \nof days.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the Hutchison resolution \nbecause I believe that it is appropriate for us to indicate to our \ntroops that when they are deployed we will provide them with all of the \nresources necessary for their security and success. But that Hutchinson \nresolution, cosponsored by a number of other Senators, including the \nleadership of the junior Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, also \nprovides an opportunity for Members of this Senate to express their \ndisagreement with the decision of the President to deploy ground troops \nin Bosnia. I believe that is the appropriate position for this Senate \nto take. I urge other Senators to do so. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Chair notes the list I had \nindicated Senator Biden had spoken before Senator Ashcroft, so the \nSenator from Wisconsin would be in order.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield my position to Senator Biden, and I will speak \nafter Senator Inhofe, if that pleases the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Inhofe and I have switched off, so I am taking \nthe place of Senator Inhofe. I will follow Senator Biden.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent, if I yield to Senator Biden, that \nI may speak after Senator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think a little bit of immediate past \nhistory is important for us to recall here.\n  With regard to whether or not this policy that has been pursued in \nthis administration relative to Bosnia and Herzegovina was a sound \npolicy or not, it is the same policy that was pursued by the Bush \nadministration. The Bush administration set a policy in motion that \nsaid we would support an arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, \nas well as others, and that we would not use air power to relieve the \ngenocidal actions of the Serbs.\n  To my great disappointment, although there were faint efforts to \nchange that policy by attempting to convince our allies to lift the \nembargo, the truth of the matter was this administration did not change \nthe position.\n  Some of us, as long ago as the last 4 months of the Bush \nadministration, argued loudly, if not persuasively, that the Bush \npolicy was an incorrect policy. We argued that we should lift the arms \nembargo. In addition to that, we argued that we should supply weapons \nto the Bosnian Government which at that time was a multiethnic \ngovernment made up of a council of Presidents, roughly divided in \nthirds among Moslems, Croats, and Serbs within Bosnia, and a Bosnian \nArmy made up of Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats, and Bosnian Moslems. We \neven passed the so-called Biden amendment through both Houses of the \nUnited States Congress that authorized the President of the United \nStates to seek a lifting of the embargo and to transfer up to $50 \nmillion worth of weaponry, off the shelf, to the Bosnian Government. \nThat was in the last months of the Bush administration.\n  I--and I do not say this to speak to what I did or did not do, but to \nmark it historically--I, after Senator Moynihan, was one of the few \npeople who went to Sarajevo, went to near Srebrenica, went to Tuzla, \nwent to Belgrade, went to Zagreb, met with Karadzic, met with \nMilosevic, met with UNPROFOR, met with the Croatian leadership, came \nback and wrote a report, and was debriefed by the Secretary of State \nand the President. The report called for lifting the arms embargo and \nusing air power to strike at the Serbian genocidal undertakings.\n  Back then, I--and I was not the only one in the world community--I \ncame back and pointed out that this was raw, unadulterated genocide. \nThe Serbs had set up rape camps, a policy explicitly designed to take \nMoslem women, primarily, into camps, rape them, have them carry the \nchildren to term, in order to intimidate and pollute the Moslem people \nin Bosnia. Everyone said that was not going on; this was not 1937 or \n1938 or 1940. But now, no one questions it occurred.\n  I remember coming back--after going up through Mount Igman and over \nthe mountains into a place called Kiseljak and going through villages--\nand saying, ``There are graves.'' You could ride through a village in \nthe mountains and see three or four homes in a row, pristinely kept, \nwindow boxes with flowers. The next home, a hole in the ground. The \nnext home, perfectly kept. After that, two holes in the ground or a \nchimney sticking up. And graves at the end of the town road.\n  I was told by our own people as well as the French, God bless them, \nand the Brits, that these folks are all the same. They are all bad \nguys. They are all like this. They have all been doing this for all of \nthe last 4 centuries--which is historically inaccurate and was \ninaccurate in terms of what was taking place at the time.\n  I remember when we watched on television--the Senator from Arizona \nand I spoke to it on the floor that night--when they overran \nSrebrenica. You could actually see U.N. soldiers sitting there with \ntheir blue helmets and hats on top of tanks, watching the Serb \nconquerors take the women and children and send them in one direction \nand take the able-bodied men and send them in the other direction--for \nextermination. This was not because they wanted segregated prison \ncells. They took them to the woods, they dug holes, they shot them, \nthey dropped them in the holes, they poured lye on their bodies and \nbulldozed the dirt over them.\n  We were told no, that is not happening.\n  Now we have satellite imaging that uncovers this--surprise. Surprise. \n``Oh, my Lord this is happening.''\n  The reason I bother to say this, because I know you all are tired of \nhearing me saying it for the last 3 years, is to make one very \nimportant point. One, with all due respect, I do not \n\n[[Page S18497]]\nthink the President has accurately made. And that is, what is our \ninterest in Bosnia? Is there a vital interest? Or, as my friend from \nMissouri said, ``Does this action represent our interest and our \nvalues?''\n  If this does not represent our interests and our values, then nothing \nthat has happened since the end of World War II represents our values. \nHow many in this Chamber, like me, have gone to Holocaust memorial \nevents and heard the refrain, ``Never again.'' Never again? On the same \ncontinent, in the same proximity, the same death camps--it is happening \nagain. And it happened again.\n  This time it was not Jews. It was primarily Moslems. In 1935 and 1937 \nand 1939 and 1941 and 1943, had it been Catholics like me, or \nProtestants, like many in here, who were being taken to death camps, \nthe world would have risen up years earlier. But it was not. It was \nJews. And we all turned a blind eye, as a world.\n  I respectfully suggest, were it not Moslems this time who were in the \nrape camps, were it not Moslems who were being exterminated as part of \nthis new phrase ``ethnic cleansing'', that the world would have behaved \ndifferently. I wonder how many of us ever thought, as students of World \nWar II or as participants in World War II, that we would ever serve in \nthe Senate and hear the phrase, openly used by one party in a conflict, \n``ethnic cleansing.'' Ethnic cleansing. Is that not an antiseptic term?\n  And notwithstanding the fact only the Serbs used the phrase, I kept \nhearing on this floor that, ``They are all the same. They are all the \nsame.''\n  There have been atrocities committed by Moslems and by Croats. But \nthey have not set up rape camps. They have not set up death camps. They \nhave not mass murdered as part of a coherent plan for people, based \nupon their ethnicity and their religion. That is called genocide--\ngenocide. That is what it is. And now, even in our move to state what \nour vital interest is, this administration and others who support it \nare afraid to use the word. We are told we are not taking sides.\n  I am here to take sides. Milosevic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, \nis a war criminal. He is no better than Himmler. He is no better than \nGoebbels. He is a war criminal. Karadzic is a war criminal.\n  I might add that the leader of Serbia, Milosevic, is also a war \ncriminal, although he is the only one not indicted so far.\n  So I hear people stand here and say, ``What is our interest? What is \nour interest?'' Our interest is that history repeated itself.\n  Let me be presumptuous enough to go on a little more to what I think \nthe next history lesson will be. The Soviet empire has collapsed--the \ngood news. The bad news is that all of the ethnic hatreds, all of the \nethnic fighting, all of the atrocities that occurred 100 years ago and \n40 years ago are now uncovered again. There are 25 million Russians \nliving outside the border of Russia, in the Ukraine, in the Baltic \ncountries, in Kazakhstan. There is war in Armenia, in Georgia, and \nalmost all of it is based on ethnicity.\n  What is the message we send to the world if we stand by and we say we \nwill let it continue to happen here in this place but it is not in our \ninterest? We do not fear that it will spread? I am not here to tell you \nthat, if we do not act, it will spread and cause a war in Europe--\ntomorrow or next year. But I am here to tell you that within the \ndecade, it will cause the spread of war like a cancer, and the collapse \nof the Western alliance. What is so important about the Western \nalliance? NATO for NATO's sake so that we can beat our breast?\n  What I am about to say is going to cause me great difficulty if I am \nreelected and come back here as the ranking member or chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee. But Europe cannot stay united without the \nUnited States. There is no moral center in Europe. When in the last two \ncenturies have the French, or the British, or the Germans, or the \nBelgiums, or the Italians moved in a way to unify that continent to \nstand up to this kind of genocide? When have they done it? The only \nreason anything is happening now is because the United States of \nAmerica finally--finally--is understanding her role.\n  So we do have a national interest. Our national interest goes well \nbeyond the genocide that will spread like a cancer. I will not take the \ntime, because others wish to speak, to explain what the rest of it is. \nBut I do in my longer statement which I will put in the Record.\n  But there is a second question it seems to me after first asking what \nis the national interest of the United States. Once you establish that \nthere is a national interest--and I believe there is one--then, is the \nproposed action by the President the one that can meet that national \ninterest? I respectfully suggest this is not the best one. If the \nPresident and the administration and the last administration, in my \nview, had the gumption, they would have told our European allies that \nwe are lifting the arms embargo.\n  This is not a Vietnamization program. The Vietnamese and South \nVietnam were not sure where they wanted to be, North or South. That is \nwhy it never worked.\n  The Bosnians know where they want to be. They want to be free. They \nwill fight for themselves, and all they have ever asked for is lifting \nthe arms embargo.\n  Prime Minister Silajdzic came after my first visit to Bosnia. I had \nhim in my office and 12 of my colleagues--very good men and women came, \nDemocrats and Republicans. The word was then, if we lift the embargo, \nit is just going to make it worse for those poor folks and more are \ngoing to get killed. One of my Republican colleagues, who is very \ninformed on policy, and a Democratic colleague at my conference table \nasked the same thing of Silajdzic. Silajdzic said something I will \nnever forget as long as I live.\n  He looked at this Senator, and he said: ``Senator, at least do me the \nhonor and the privilege of letting me choose how to die.''\n  ``Senator, do not send me food to fatten me and my family in the \nwinter only to be assured that I will be killed with the full stomach. \nGive me a weapon. Let me defend myself, and have the good grace to let \nme choose how to die.''\n  He then went on to add, ``I am not asking for you to send a single \nAmerican troop. I am not asking for you to send a single American. I am \nasking you to lift this immoral embargo.''\n  That is what should have been done, as a student of history of the \nBalkans--I suspect that I have read as much as almost anybody here, at \nleast I have tried my best, and I have gone there twice and I have \nspoken with everyone I could. During the last two Balkan wars, the only \ntime they ended was when all parties concluded that they could not \nachieve any more on the ground than they could at the peace table.\n  But events have overtaken us. And the event that has overtaken us is \ncalled Dayton. I say to my friends here in the Senate, the part that I \ndo not like about being Senator is when Presidents do not get it right, \nand we do not get to make the best choice. We get to choose among bad \nchoices.\n  It is that old thing about the Hobson's choice. Two bad choices is no \nchoice at all. The best choice is to lift the embargo, provide air \ncover, wait while it is being done, and let the Bosnian Government \nestablish itself because Serbia has already lost. Milosevic has no \ninterest in continuing because he is a pariah in the Western community. \nHave the War Crimes Tribunal go forward and let it be settled. But we \ndid not do that.\n  We have one of two choices now: One, we participate with a better \nthan even chance. We provide enough time for the Bosnian Government to \nget the physical wherewithal and economic strength to defend \nthemselves, and then we leave. Two, we do not participate at all, which \nmeans nothing happens because the Europeans have no center on this \nissue. Nothing will happen except the embargo will be on, the genocide \nwill continue, our interest will be badly damaged, and the cancer will \nspread. My son may not go to Bosnia today, but he may be in eastern \nGermany in 8 years. My grandchildren may not be in Bosnia today but \nthey will be in Europe fighting a war 15 years from now.\n  So given the choices, I support this resolution. I support it because \nwe do have a vital national interest, and we do have a moral rationale \nfor our engagement. \n\n[[Page S18498]]\n\n  If we thought we had a moral interest, a national interest in \nrestoring the Emir of Kuwait to the throne--restoring the Emir of \nKuwait to the throne, God bless his soul--to send 500,000 troops there, \ntell me, tell me why we do not have a moral interest in stopping what \nwas international aggression by Serbia crossing the Drina River into a \nU.N.-recognized country and participating in genocide?\n  In Kuwait we had a single example of one young woman who was raped \nand beaten, which turned out not to be true, to enrage people about the \nawful thing Saddam Hussein was doing. And here we have mass graves. I \nhave visited with Bob Dole a hospital in Sarajevo. Do you know who was \nin the hospital? Seven children. Do you know why there were only seven \nchildren? Because the Serbs sit in those hills and they have as a \ncampaign of terror, the maiming of children. Walk with me through \nSarajevo's streets and see draped across the roads blankets and sheets. \nI thought it was a Lower East Side in 1919 of New York.\n  I asked why. Do you know why they are there? To take over the line of \nfire from Serbian snipers shooting children. We pretended it did not \nhappen. Ask Bob Dole.\n  We stood beside a beautiful raven-haired child who looked at us as we \nspoke. And the neurosurgeon said, ``The reason she is not turning is \nshe has no sight. He turned her head. The bullet had gone through the \nback of her head, severed the optic nerves, and came out the other \nside.\n  There were seven children in that hospital. Nobody else. It was a \nplanned campaign by Mladic and the Serbs to terrorize the Moslem \ncommunity.\n  So let me tell you. If your moral center is oil, I understand you. If \nyour moral center is humanity, there is no comparing the restoration of \nthe Emir of Kuwait with the ending of genocide in Bosnia.\n  But there is only one exit strategy, I say, Mr. President, there is \nonly one.\n  I hope the President, with all due respect, means it. That we will \nnot be able to leave unless--what Bob Dole, Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman, \nand a whole bunch of others insist be in this resolution--the Bosnian \nGovernment is armed and prepared to defend itself. That is the ticket \nhome for Americans.\n  There is a moral reason for this. There is a U.S. interest. It is not \nthe best way to do it, but, as Senators, we only get to choose among \nthe bad ways offered to us. It is worth doing.\n  In this Christmas season, as I saw off the first group to go to \nBosnia from Dover Air Force Base, the only thing I could think to say \nis ``thank you; watch where you walk--there are a million landmines--\nand God bless you. I am telling you, you are doing something right but \nyou are being put in a position that is not the one you should have \nbeen put in in order to accomplish it.'' It is a hell of a way to send \nthem off, but we have no choice, it seems to me, to meet our moral \nobligation and our national vital interest.\n  Mr. President, after nearly 4 years of indifference, half-measures, \nnational policies of European governments pursued in the garb of \ninternational peacekeeping, and other sophistries devoid of moral \ncontent, the western world has finally been moved to put an end to the \nmurderous fighting that has left Bosnia and Herzegovina in ruins.\n\n  While the dilly-dallying has gone on, more than a quarter-million \nBosnians of various ethnic and religious affiliation have been killed, \nand an additional 2\\1/2\\ million persons--over half the total \npopulation--have been driven from their homes.\n  But, Mr. President, numbers alone cannot begin to convey the \nsavagery, the barbarity, the depravity that has reigned in this small \nbalkan country.\n  There have been wars since time immemorial, many on a larger scale \nthan the war in Bosnia. There have been refugee flights in other \ncountries that dwarf the Bosnian numbers.\n  This century has seen the Jewish Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, \nthe murderous collectivation of Ukraine, and the killing fields of \nCambodia. So, Mr. President, I suppose cynics might say that we have \nbecome hardened to the unspeakable.\n  Yet what has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina not only has had \ncomponents of the other horrors the 20th-century, it has actually added \na diabolical new feature: The unprecedented, centrally planned campaign \nof mass rape that the Bosnian Serbs have used as a calculated weapon of \nterror designed to demoralize Bosnian Moslem communities.\n  Mr. President, why was this allowed to happen? To help answer this \nquestion, let me offer a piece of counter-factual analysis that I have \ndelivered before on this Senate floor:\n  ``What if'' a Moslem-dominated Bosnia-Herzegovina had attacked a \npeaceful orthodox Christian Serbia, carried out barbaric atrocities \nagainst Serbian civilians, and then proudly announced that its policy \nof ethnic cleansing had been successful--would Christian Europe then \nhave sat idly by, conjuring up excuse after excuse for not halting the \ncruel and cowardly aggression?\n  Mr. President, I think the answer is self-evident.\n  European Jewry was yesterday's victim. The Bosnian Moslems are \ntoday's. If we let the barbarism in Bosnia stand, who knows who will be \ntomorrow's?\n  Now at last, thanks to the belated--nonetheless, praiseworthy--\nleadership of the United States, we stand on the verge of a massive \ninternational effort designed to put a stop to the depravity, to try to \nrestore a modicum of normal, civilized life to that sorry land.\n  I fear that the chances for success are a long-shot. But Mr. \nPresident, make no mistake about it: if the United States does not \ncontinue to lead this effort, the chances for even a semblance of peace \nin Bosnia are zero.\n  And yet the choice is not an easy one. Like almost every other \ndecision concerning foreign policy that a U.S. Senator has to make, our \nchoice about whether to support President Clinton's decision to deploy \n20,000 American troops to Bosnia as part of the international peace \nimplementation force known as I-FoR is a reactive one.\n  The U.S. Congress rarely gets to formulate policy. We cannot, and \nshould not, write arms control treaties or other international \nagreements. Most of the time we are asked to react to proposed \nsolutions that are far from ideal, perhaps not even the best. But often \nthese solutions, however risky they may be, are nonetheless better than \nnot acting at all.\n  That is exactly how I feel about the proposed deployment of U.S. \ntroops in the I-FoR. For more than 3 years, since September 1992, I \nhave been calling for lifting the illegal and unjust arms embargo \nagainst the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the victim of Serbian \naggression, no matter what our European allies think about such a \ndecision.\n  Concurrently, I have called for striking from the air at the \noffending Serbs while the Bosnian Government was building up its own \nmilitary strength.\n  Finally, I have advocated making clear to the Government of Serbia \nthat it would suffer massive air strikes upon its territory across the \nDrina River if it increased its assistance to the Bosnian Serb \naggressors.\n  Moreover, the Biden Amendment, which I introduced in 1992, and which \nwas successively approved by Congress in 1993 and 1994, authorized \nassistance to Bosnia through a drawdown of up to $50 million of Defense \nDepartment weapons stocks and other military equipment. This year's \nforeign operations conference report has increased this figure to $100 \nmillion. As soon as the President receives and signs the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, he will be able to use this source any \ntime upon termination of the arms embargo.\n  Up until 1 month ago this policy that I proposed remained, I am \nconvinced, the best option open to the United States. It would have \ncreated the conditions of military parity in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nthat are essential for maintaining a lasting peace.\n  Then came the talks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The peace \nagreement that emerged from those talks is not perfect--no \ninternational agreement ever is--but we have to deal with the situation \nnow at hand.\n  Let me take this occasion to congratulate Secretary of State \nChristopher and his negotiating team for their tireless efforts that \nachieved what no one else had been able to accomplish for 3\\1/2\\ years: \na multilateral agreement that offers the only real promise of ending \nthe worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. It is a highly \nsignificant achievement, which brings great credit to the United States \nof America. \n\n[[Page S18499]]\n\n  Yet Secretary Christopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, and General \nShalikashvili would be the first to add that the Dayton Accords are \nstill only a building block for the structure of peace for the former \nYugoslavia, which remains to be put into place.\n  Let me underscore that the involvement of American ground troops in \nthe peace enforcement effort--the solution less preferable than the \nlift-and-strike policy I have consistently advocated--in no way lessens \nthe necessity of equipping and training the Bosnian Federation's army \nin order to allow it to defend itself when all foreign peace \nimplementation forces leave. The bipartisan resolution specifically \nmentions this point.\n  So I would like also to be perfectly clear that if the administration \nhad not assured that this equipping and training would take place--if \nnot by uniformed U.S. military personnel, then by contractors--I would \nnot support the participation of U.S. ground troops in the I-FoR. Third \ncountries may, of course, also contribute weapons and training to the \nFederation, but a failure of Americans to take the lead in this effort \nwould quite simply be a prescription for a prolonged involvement of our \nground forces in Bosnia, a policy which the American people will not \ncountenance.\n  President Clinton's outstanding televised speech to the Nation went a \nlong way toward explaining to the American people the rationale for, \nand mission of our troops in the I-FoR. I do not take issue with any of \nthe President's arguments.\n  Above all, I would emphasize to those who wish to restrict America's \ninvolvement abroad that the choice facing us is not between a risky \nforeign mission and the status quo. If the United States does not \nparticipate in--or more precisely, lead--the I-For, I am convinced that \nthe war will re-ignite, escalate, probably spread, and open the door \nfor a radical destabilization of southern Europe. And that most \nassuredly is in our vital national interest to prevent.\n  Finally there is the issue of American leadership in NATO and in the \nlarger community of civilized nations. I have long criticized some of \nour European allies, first for their utilization of the purposefully \nhamstrung U.N. peacekeeping operation in order not to take the \nmilitarily resolute measures that could have stopped the Serbs in their \ntracks in 1991, and second for their obstinate unwillingness to allow \nNATO--principally American--air power to cripple the Bosnian Serb war \nmachine.\n  It took the massacre in the Sarajevo market at the end of August and \nthe withdrawal of the hobbled European peacekeepers, for us finally to \noverrule our timorous European friends.\n  Yet, Mr. President, the President of the United States has given his \npledge of American troops; the United States was the driving force in \ncrafting the Dayton accords; and our credibility as the leader of NATO \nis on the line. Bosnia has revealed strains within NATO that must be \naddressed, but this is not the time to exacerbate the tensions. \nMoreover, France has just re-entered the alliance's integrated military \ncommand, a sign that a successful operation in Bosnia may bode well for \na stronger NATO in the future.\n  Some of the opponents of our involvement have trotted out the cliche \nthat the United States cannot be the ``world's policeman.'' Well, of \ncourse we can't solve every crisis everywhere. But as President Clinton \nsaid in his television speech, that obvious fact does not mean that we \ncannot help anywhere.\n  The slaughter, rape, and destruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina should \nbe an affront to the sensibilities of every American. The I-For mission \nat the very least will give the brutalized people of that land a last \nchance to stop the killing and to re-enter the world community.\n  For all these reasons, then, our participation in the operation is \nvital. There are, however, serious risks associated with sending our \ntroops to Bosnia, and it is incumbent upon the administration to \nexplain how we are planning to minimize them. These risks include:\n  Millions of lethal mines, which will probably be hidden by snow for \nseveral months;\n  The brutal Balkan winter that makes driving hazardous;\n  Irregular forces, foreign extremists, and other rogue elements that \nmay specially target American troops; and\n  The likelihood that an armed, hostile Bosnian Serb populace in \nseveral locations could both harbor attackers and engage in disruptive \nactivity itself.\n  From administration testimony in hearings before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I am satisfied that these concerns have been \nthoroughly analyzed, and counter measures developed to the fullest \nextent possible.\n  Last Friday at 5 o'clock in the morning, I went to Dover Air Force \nBase in my State of Delaware to personally say good-bye to a detachment \nof our troops as they embarked for Bosnia. They are as fine a group of \nAmerican men and women as has ever represented the Armed Forces of this \ncountry. Every possible precaution must be taken to lessen the threat \nto their person as they carry out their duties in Bosnia. In this \nregard, I emphasize that the robust rules of engagement for our troops \nmust not be altered under any circumstances.\n  In larger terms, I believe that the criteria for the mission's \nsuccess and a responsible exit strategy must be delineated even more \nclearly than has already been done. For example, is the absence of \nserious conflict after 1 year sufficient progress to warrant a \ndeclaration of mission accomplished?\n  Stated more precisely, will we withdraw our ground troops after \nprecisely 1 year even if the envisioned democratic institutions of the \nBosnian central government are not yet functioning? If so, will other \ninternational units remain for a longer period?\n  My own belief is that the I-For mission should be limited to creating \nthe basic conditions for democratic institution-building to take place. \nThere must be no mission creep for our military forces.\n  Yet if the civilian aspects of the agreement do not proceed, then the \nAmerican troops and their international colleagues will have served in \nvain. Hence, a premium must be put on coordinating the mission of the \nAmerican military force with the work of the international civilian \nagencies preparing to implement the electoral, refugee, and \nhumanitarian aspects of the Dayton accords.\n  But it may well be unrealistic to expect construction of a working \ndemocracy in 365 days or less. Therefore, plans must be drawn up \nimmediately for a ``follow-on'' force to remain in Bosnia after the \nUnited States troops leave. My strong feeling is that this force should \nbe led by our European NATO allies, augmented by units of European \nneutrals with experience in peacekeeping operations.\n  Finally, let me repeat once again the absolute necessity of creating \na balance of military strength on the ground so that when the \ninternational peacekeepers are withdrawn, the federation of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina will not be vulnerable to renewed attack.\n  The peace settlement is far from perfect. There is no guarantee that \nit will be implemented. The involvement of American ground forces \nmeans--although I pray I am wrong--that casualties and fatalities are \nlikely to occur.\n  But, as I have indicated, we live in a highly imperfect world. To do \nnothing would be to invite larger problems in the future that would \nrequire a much riskier and bloodier American involvement.\n  If the conditions I have outlined are met: retention of very robust \nrules of engagement for our troops; no mission creep for our troops; \nbut close coordination of the I-For with international civilian efforts \nin Bosnia; a United States lead in coordinating arming and training the \narmy of the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and a finely drawn \nset of criteria for mission success.\n  Then I believe that President Clinton's policy deserves the support \nof the Congress. The President has promised to meet these conditions. \nTherefore, I will vote for the bipartisan resolution, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the Dole-McCain resolution which \nauthorizes the participation of U.S. military forces in what is known \nas the I-For, the NATO implementation force. The purpose of this is to \nmonitor the peace agreement in Bosnia. \n\n[[Page S18500]]\n\n  The Dayton peace agreement and this NATO deployment represents, in my \njudgment, the only opportunity to achieve a long-term peace in Bosnia \nand with it a more stable Europe. That is a very important point, Mr. \nPresident--a more stable Europe, which is a matter of profound interest \nto the United States.\n  The Senate's vote on the Dole resolution involves the question of \nwhat role the United States should play in Europe and throughout the \nworld as we approach the 21st century. Let us just take a brief look \ninto history, if we might. It was an assassination in the Balkans, in \nSarajevo itself, that triggered World War I, a conflict into which the \nUnited States was reluctantly drawn. Indeed, we stayed out of it for \nnearly 3 years.\n  At the conclusion of that devastating war, the United States made a \nvery conscious decision, and that was to withdraw from any involvement \nin European security affairs. From 1919 until 1942, the United States \nremained aloof from Europe, even though World War II raged for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears during that period. Yet, inevitably, we were dragged into that \nwar, the most costly of all wars in terms of lives and treasures.\n  We have now learned that the United States, the world's lone \nsuperpower and the undisputed leader of the NATO alliance, simply \ncannot withdraw from European security matters, nor should we. Our \nactive engagement in Europe for the past 50 years since the end of \nWorld War II has brought enormous benefits to us, to the Europeans, and \nto the world at large. Western Europe has enjoyed peace, it has enjoyed \nfreedom, it has enjoyed democracy, and it has enjoyed economic success \never since the end of that war.\n  This has largely been due to U.S. leadership in NATO. Our leadership \nhas assisted in bringing about the fall of communism and the liberation \nof Eastern Europe. But despite these successes, Europe today is not \nfree of war and bloodshed and instability. We need to look no further \nthan the war that has raged in the Balkans for the past 3 years. Others \nhave spoken about it, and sometimes we forget these statistics: 250,000 \npeople have lost their lives in that conflict, and more than 2 million \npeople have been displaced or are refugees. This war has the potential \nto spill over into the rest of Europe.\n\n  The history which I just touched on has taught that maintaining a \nfree, democratic and peaceful Europe is very much in our interests, in \nour security interests, and deployment of the NATO force in which the \nUnited States provides one-third--not one-half, not two-thirds, but \none-third--of the troops will help ensure the type of Europe we want: A \nEurope that is free, that is Democratic, and that is peaceful.\n  I would ask, Mr. President, those who oppose this deployment to \nanswer this question. If we, as part of NATO, cannot lead an effort to \ntry and end the war in Bosnia, then why should we be members of NATO? \nLet us forget the whole thing, at least our participation in it. It \nseems to me that helping to end destabilizing military conflicts inside \nthe borders of Europe such as Bosnia represents is the type of \nresponsibility NATO should undertake in the post-cold-war world.\n  May I remind my colleagues that the implementation force includes \nmany non-NATO forces--not just the NATO forces, but others--that share \nour interest in securing peace in the Balkans.\n  Those opposing this resolution, the Dole resolution, also argue that \nU.S. troops will be at a risk of being drawn into nonmilitary \nactivities and may also suffer needless casualties.\n  To this I say, take a look at the Dayton peace agreement. Unlike some \nrecent failures--we have had them in this Nation, particularly if you \nthink of Somalia--where United States military roles were not entirely \nclear, the Bosnian deployment plan and the administration's pledges are \nvery specific about what our troops will and will not do. I am \nreassured by this part of the written statements.\n  In addition to its own self-protection, the mission of our force is \nto oversee and enforce implementation of the military aspects of this \npeace agreement. Now, what are we talking about? We are talking about \ncessation of hostilities, withdrawal to agreed lines, creation of a \nzone of separation, return of troops and weapons to their encampments. \nCivilian authority such as the United Nations, not our troops, will be \nresponsible for many of the nonmilitary aspects that are envisioned by \nthe agreement.\n  Now, what are we talking about there? Overseeing elections, \nconducting humanitarian missions, helping civilians move about, acting \nas local police forces. You can be sure that Congress and the American \npeople are going to be watching carefully. We are going to be \nmonitoring this to see that our troops do not engage in any activities \nfor which we are not responsible.\n  I do not want to suggest, Mr. President, that sending United States \nmilitary forces to Bosnia is without risk. Regrettably, we may well \nsuffer casualties, as is often the case in military operations such as \nin the Balkans. But please remember that the United States and the 25 \nother nations are sending a force totaling 60,000 ground troops, \nforgetting those that are in the air or on the waters. This is an \noverwhelming numerical advantage over any group or faction that would \nchallenge our authority.\n  I would also point out that unlike former United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions in Bosnia, we will be completely prepared to defend ourselves. \nThis is a mission in which if we are shot at, we are going to reply \nwith bullets and shells.\n  Mr. President, the rest of the world looks to the United States to be \na leader in promoting peace and democracy, and this is certainly the \ncase in the Balkans where the three signatories have authorized our \nintervention. If a United States-led NATO force can help secure peace \nin Bosnia, it will make an enormous contribution to world security.\n  On the other hand, Mr. President, if we abdicate our responsibilities \nto our NATO allies, it will send a clear and I believe very troubling \nsignal that the United States has once again retreated into Fortress \nAmerica. It will show that we are not there when a difficult job has to \nbe done. That is not a signal we can afford to send. So, therefore, I \nurge my colleagues to support the deployment of United States troops to \nBosnia and to vote for the Dole-McCain resolution.\n  I further would urge a vote against the Hutchison amendment, which, \nin my judgment, sends a very confusing message. It says, on the one \nhand, to our troops, we do not think you should be in Bosnia, but \nnevertheless we support you. I do not think that is the kind of message \nI, for one, would like to receive if I were risking my life or on a \nmission of this nature in Bosnia. The message, again, seems to say we \nare for you, but you should not be there. I do not find that a message \nof much comfort or encouragement, in my judgment.\n  So therefore, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues would support \nthe Dole-McCain amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the question of sending American men and women on a \ndangerous mission, whether it be to fight a war or, as in this case, to \nstrengthen a fragile peace is always a difficult one. A healthy debate \nhas been carried on across the Nation, and it is clear that Americans \nare reluctant to send U.S. forces in harm's way.\n  While I share that reluctance, my reluctance does not stem from a \nsense of isolationism; but rather, I am reluctant to commit our troops \nwhen the situation on the ground is so tenuous. I understand that the \ncombatants themselves have asked us to help them implement the Dayton \naccords; however, I remain skeptical about their commitment to peace. I \nquestion whether the presence of a large NATO force will be enough to \novercome the daunting challenge of national reconstruction facing all \nthe Bosnian people. And, given the deep hatreds that exist there, I \nwonder how realistic it is for us to think that once United States \ntroops leave Bosnia the peace will hold.\n  At the same time, what are our alternatives? I agree that the \nsituation on the ground may have been different if the President had \nheeded Congress and lifted the arms embargo. However, as one of our \ncolleagues pointed out to me recently, even if the administration had \nagreed to lift the arms embargo \n\n[[Page S18501]]\nand the Bosnian Moslems had been better armed, there still would have \nbeen the need for a peace accord, and we would still be facing the \ndifficult question of whether to send in United States ground forces to \nguarantee the peace.\n  After 4 years of anguish over the atrocities in Bosnia, I believe we \nhave a responsibility to try to end this war. We cannot turn our backs \non the innocent men, women, and children who have lived through the \nunspeakable atrocities committed by all sides. We cannot turn down a \nrequest that is probably the last and best opportunity to end this \nharrowing civil war.\n  At the same time, we cannot allow emotion to sway our decisionmaking \nabout sending United States ground troops into what until now has been \na war zone. We would all like to see an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia, \nand an end, for that matter, to bloodshed everywhere. But, it is \ndisingenous to say that we are sending ground troops to Bosnia out of a \nsense of moral responsibility that we must police the entire world. We \nhave already determined that neither do we have the desire nor the \nmeans to be the world's policeman.\n  Recognizing we are not the world's policeman does not mean that there \nare no circumstances under which we should send U.S. troops abroad. If \nwe are to take advantage of winning the cold war and retaining our \ncapacity to shape events in this changing era, then we must demonstrate \nleadership and be willing to take risks for peace. The difficult \nquestion is, when should we take these risks?\n  I have always held that any determination to commit U.S. troops \nabroad should meet four criteria:\n  One, there must be a clear and compelling issue of national interest.\n  Two, the benefits must outweigh the cost of endangering American \nsoldiers.\n  Three, there must be an established plan of action--including plans \nfor troop withdrawal.\n  And, four, there must be support and involvement of the international \ncommunity.\n  Unfortunately, without the stark black and white of the cold war to \nguide our foreign policy, it is less clear when our vital national \ninterests are at stake. The world has become a far more complicated \nplace, and there is much disagreement over whether there is a vital \nnational interest at stake in Bosnia.\n  Some say this is a European problem and we should leave it to the \nEuropeans to solve. Indeed, the Europeans realize that they have more \nat stake here than we do. That is why they are supplying the majority \nof the forces and why they are providing most of the funding and \ntechnical support for the crucial task of rebuilding Bosnia.\n  Then, why could not this be a European-led mission with American \nsupport? Frankly, the Europeans have been indecisive and unable to do \nthis on their own. Yet, if this civil war rages on, it poses a serious \nthreat to European stability. Just as that possibility poses a threat \nto our European allies, it also threatens us.\n  That is why America must assume the mantle of leadership. The future \nstability of Europe is, and always will be, in our national interest. \nWe have fought two major wars in Europe, and in the 50 years since the \nend of World War II we have committed U.S. troops and resources to the \ndefense of Europe and to the leadership of the NATO alliance. Because \nof our ties to Europe--historically and economically--it is in our \ninterest for NATO to be strong and it is in our interest to continue to \nlead NATO.\n\n  That said, do the potential benefits of this mission outweigh the \ncosts? There are many ambitious--I might say overly ambitious--goals \nlaid out in the Dayton accords: The return of refugees, the negotiation \nof arms control agreements, the prosecution of war criminals, and the \nreconstruction of civil institutions. I am pessimistic about the \nprospects for realizing many of these nation building goals in the \nshort term.\n  Nonetheless, I believe there is still a potential benefit to \nparticipate in a strong peacekeeping force. The ominous warnings of \nmany opponents of this mission belie the fact that the NATO \nImplementation Force is not embarking on a combat mission, nor is it a \nmission to impose a peace. This is not Somalia. Furthermore, our troops \nwill not be leading the nation building efforts. This is not Haiti. \nThis mission is in response to a direct request by the combatants to \nhelp them implement a peace agreement that they negotiated. The \ngreatest and most achievable goals of this mission are strictly \nmilitary goals: Separating the forces and creating an environment for \nthe continued cessation of hostilities. And 1 year may not be enough \ntime to rebuild Bosnia, but we cannot underestimate the potential of a \n1-year breathing period to lay the groundwork for a more stable peace \ndown the road.\n  How do these benefits measure up against the potential costs? There \nhas been a strong consensus in the United States that sending ground \ntroops at an earlier date would have been too risky and not worth the \ncost. Are we now risking the same entanglement we so assiduously \navoided by sending in ground forces to implement this shaky peace? As \npeacekeepers, will our troops be a lightening rod for some of the more \ncontroversial provisions of the peace agreement many in Bosnia are not \nsure they want?\n  Over the past few weeks, I have explored these and other issues \nrelated to the risks. I have met with the National Security Advisor, \nand yesterday with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice President, and with \nthe President himself to express my concerns directly, and to listen to \ntheir responses.\n  I have come to believe that it is most unlikely we will become \nentangled in a full-scale war. We are participating in a NATO operation \nto implement a peace agreement painstakingly negotiated over several \nweeks. The Dayton accords set forth clear military goals for the \nimplementation force. Our troops have a limited mission--limited in the \nspecific tasks designed to strengthen the peace and limited in its \nduration. We have made no commitment to stay on should the peace fail. \nAnd, should all out war break out before the year is up, then we surely \nwill leave. Contrary to the views of some of my colleagues, I believe \nthat Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili have established a clear \nplan to action and a clear exit strategy.\n  In the unlikely event that our troops become targets, we have learned \nfrom earlier mistakes: Our troops will be well armed, will be sent to \nBosnia in sufficient numbers, and will be operating under the right \nrules of engagement, allowing them to defend themselves fully.\n  To be sure, we can never eliminate all the risks. Even under the best \nof circumstances, Bosnia is a dangerous place. On balance, however, I \nbelieve that this mission is worthwhile.\n  Can we state with certainty that our efforts will pay off, and that \nthe war is over? Unfortunately, it is too early to tell whether the \nconditions in Bosnia are really ripe for peace. But, that does not mean \nwe should not proceed. If this diplomatic effort fails it will be a \nfailure of the Croatians, the Moslems and the Serbs to take advantage \nof the international commitment to help them implement the peace. Only \ntime will allow us to test their commitment to the peace accord. In the \nmeantime, we cannot afford to turn our backs on the most serious \ndiplomatic agreement to date.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority leader has been \ncompelled by members of his party to have three separate votes on \nBosnia. Either we support this policy or we do not. It is too easy to \nsay that the President has made his decision, that he has committed \nU.S. forces, and then take no responsibility for the mission but still \nvote to support the troops.\n  In this case, I believe that the President has demonstrated \nleadership. He has acted in our national interest, and he has done so \ncognizant of the risks the men and women of our Armed Forces will face. \nNow that the Bosnian people have taken a step toward peace, we have the \nchance to do something concrete, specific and finite to help bring this \nbloodshed to an end. And so I say, let us do it.\n  Mr. President, I will be voting against the Hutchison resolution and \nin favor of the Dole resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. \n  \n[[Page S18502]]\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, at the outset of my remarks on Bosnia, \nI want to state for the record my total support for our men and women \nin uniform deployed in the Balkans. I know they will serve the Nation \nwith honor and distinction. I commit to them today that I will make \nevery effort to provide for their safety, to make every available \nresource for their defense and to work hard and look forward to their \nsafe return home.\n  Let me say that I have lived my entire life in a small eastern North \nCarolina town that is surrounded by Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Seymour \nJohnson Air Force Base, and Cherry Point Marine Base. My whole life, I \nhave literally been surrounded by people who are strongly committed to \nserving our Nation and our Commander in Chief.\n  I am confident that the bravery of our soldiers deployed in Bosnia \nand their respect for their commanding officers will serve as an \nexample and an inspiration to all Americans. While I have nothing but \npraise to offer for our troops, I come to the floor to voice my strong \nopposition to the President's decision to deploy United States forces \nin Bosnia.\n  Despite repeated requests by Congress and the American people, the \nClinton administration has yet to show a compelling national security \ninterest which would justify the commitment of United States ground \nforces in Bosnia. In fact, President Clinton's Bosnia strategy over the \npast 3 years has been an incoherent jumble of vacillating policies.\n  As a candidate, Bill Clinton criticized the policies of the Bush \nadministration and advocated a forceful interventionist role for the \nUnited States. Once in office, President Clinton dithered while the \nBalkan situation degenerated into a brutal, dehumanizing ethnic civil \nwar. Much of the tragedy we see in Bosnia occurred on President \nClinton's watch.\n  Without consulting Congress, President Clinton entered into an \nagreement to commit U.S. ground forces. He has not come before a joint \nsession of Congress to explain his policies on this issue. Rather, from \nthe Oval Office, President Clinton delivered a televised national \naddress and then boarded Air Force One bound for Europe. It struck me \nas though he was more eager to collect congratulations in European \ncapitals than to explain his Bosnian policy to Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  Despite this absence of Presidential leadership, a rejection of the \nClinton administration's troop deployment plans does not mean a \nrejection of American involvement in the Bosnia peace process, nor a \nretreat into isolationism.\n  The United States has played a significant role in Bosnia, and we \nshould continue to do so. United States military commanders provided \nleadership to NATO in advocating the use of airstrikes to break the \nBosnian Serb military advantage, while the Clinton administration \ndallied with the United Nations.\n  In the end, the administration failed to take a leadership role in \nconvincing the United Nations to lift the arms embargo which would have \nallowed the Bosnian Moslems to defend themselves at a much earlier date \nand might have alleviated the need for our ground forces there at any \ntime.\n  We brought the warring factions to the peace table, and we have an \ninterest in seeing that the peace agreement is implemented, but we do \nnot--we do not--have a vital national security interest, which is the \nonly thing which would justify putting at risk the lives of 20,000 \nAmerican soldiers and marines. The President was wrong to make this \ncommitment, and Congress will be wrong if we endorse it.\n  Some believe that President Clinton's hastily concluded decision on \nground forces will demand congressional approval in order to preserve \ninternational respect for the Office of the Presidency. I disagree. \nRespect for the power of the Presidency is preserved and enhanced when \nthe holder of that high office has led the Nation toward a consensus on \nmilitary intervention before troops are deployed. Bill Clinton has \nturned Presidential leadership on its head. He is trying to build a \nnational consensus after having committed U.S. forces. This is not \nleadership.\n  On the ground, our troops will face overwhelming logistic hurdles. In \naddition to arriving at the height of the harsh Balkan winter, our \ntroops will face 6 million landmines covering much of Bosnia. The exact \nwhereabouts of many of these mines is unknown and their detection will \nnot be easy, as many are made of plastic.\n  The infrastructure of Bosnia has been devastated by years of war. The \nbridges, roads, and railroads which remain usable are simply not \ncapable of supporting the weight of M1-A1 tanks and any other heavy \narmaments. Most existing airstrips have been seriously damaged.\n  Clearly, we will have to spend millions of taxpayers' dollars, \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars, in infrastructure before we can begin to \nadequately police the so-called peace agreement. Once we begin that \neffort, we will then spend billions more on military equipment and \npersonnel. How much will this latest effort in nation building cost? \nAnd that is what we are doing, nation building. Some estimates are as \nhigh as $100 million a month. I suspect that probably is not high \nenough.\n  Further, I have written to the Clinton administration requesting \ninformation about its plan to start supplying foreign aid to Bosnia. I \nhave not yet received a response.\n  We have an opportunity to avoid repeating the tragedies of Lebanon \nand Somalia. Now is the time to use our technological superiority to \nspare American lives. Many of those who opposed our investment in \nadvanced military hardware and cut defense spending would now lay aside \nthat advantage. Now is the time for the U.S. Air Force and the Navy to \ntake the lead in enforcing this peace agreement, which grows less \ncertain by the day. It is simply a bad policy to put U.S. ground forces \nbetween enemies who have been fighting each other for over 600 years, \nand that is how long this battle has been going on. One year of \nAmerican troops will not end it.\n  President Clinton stated that our troops will fight fire with fire. \nHowever, this pledge is useless when it is impossible to distinguish \nbetween a Serb, a Croat, and a Moslem.\n  Mr. President, it is not impossible to identify a vital national \nsecurity interest. The invasion of Kuwait and our response provides a \ntextbook example of how to do it. It should be clear to all Americans \nthat President Clinton has yet to measure up to the standards of Desert \nStorm. Until he does, I will continue my strong support and respect for \nour troops by opposing the President's decision to deploy ground troops \nin Bosnia.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have spent a great deal of time analyzing the risks \ninvolved in the United States joining the NATO effort or not joining \nthe NATO effort. There are risks both ways. I have concluded that the \nrisks of not acting, not joining the NATO effort, are greater than the \nrisks of acting with our NATO allies, and I will, therefore, support \nthe Dole resolution.\n  The risks of acting are clear, and include the risk of casualties \nfrom mines, from accidents on the road, possibly from snipers. Those \nrisks are real, and I think the American public should be fully aware \nof what those risks are. As hard as we have tried to reduce those \nrisks--and the Joint Chiefs and the commanders have made an \nextraordinary effort to reduce those risks in every way possible, \nthrough training and equipment and in other ways--those risks are there \nand they are real.\n  But there are risks of not acting to join our NATO allies. Those \nrisks of not participating with NATO are also very real and, in my \njudgment, are greater than the risks of joining. The risks of not \nacting, of not participating with NATO, include the risk of a peace \nagreement falling apart because of NATO's absence. That, in turn, could \nlead to a wider and more dangerous war, with continued killing, ethnic \ncleansing, rape, and other atrocities, more civilian refugees and \nhumanitarian catastrophe in Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, but also \npossibly in Kosova and Albania and Macedonia, and even possibly in \nGreece and Turkey.\n  The effects could be felt beyond the region as well. Of great \nimportance \n\n[[Page S18503]]\nhere--and this is something which I do not believe has been given \nenough attention--is that Russia is now willing to participate with the \nUnited States and our NATO allies in the peace implementation force in \nBosnia. In fact, Russia is willing to place their troops in Bosnia \ndirectly under an American commander. That would be historic \ncooperation with long-term benefits for European security and for world \nsecurity.\n  But if this agreement falls apart and the war widens because we do \nnot participate with NATO, and we know NATO will not carry out this \noperation without the United States, NATO would be weakened and \nfractured, and the United States and Russia could be pulled to opposite \nsides in a Europe newly divided.\n  Hardliners in Russia would balk at working with the United States and \nwould gain political points domestically in upcoming elections. So, in \naddition to the region becoming inflamed again, in addition to the \nUnited States potentially being dragged into a widened war in Europe, \njust as we have been dragged in twice before this century, we could see \na Russia become more threatening to Europe and to United States \ninterests, precisely when NATO is fractured and less able to deal with \nthat newly threatening Russia.\n  So the failure to participate here could well sink our efforts to \nimprove the United States-Russia relationship, to build strong \ndemocracies in Europe, to expand NATO, and to integrate Russia into \npermanent European security arrangements.\n  When President Clinton wrote to the Speaker of the House last month, \nhe highlighted the costs of not trying to help secure the peace efforts \nof the warring parties, and this is what he said:\n\n       Unquestionably, there are costs and risks to all involved \n     in making peace. Peace is the less risky alternative. But \n     there will be no peace without America's engagement.\n\n  Madam President, I have asked a lot of questions about this mission \nover the last few weeks, as a member of the Armed Services Committee. \nThe first question is: Are there important U.S. interests at stake? I \nbelieve the answer is yes.\n  The United States has an interest in helping the parties establish \npeace and stability in Europe. We have an interest in preventing the \nwar from spreading, which also could fracture the NATO alliance and \nwhich could put Russia and the United States on opposite sides of a \nrenewed and wider war.\n  The second question I asked: Is the mission clear, and is it limited \nand achievable? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified \nthat it is, and the military commanders agree. The NATO mission has \nthree primary military objectives: maintaining the existing cease-fire, \nphysically separating the warring parties, and overseeing the division \nof territory agreed to by the leaders in Dayton.\n  Our military leaders have been clear about what our troops will not \ndo, so there will not be any mission creep. They will not oversee \nelection security; they will not conduct humanitarian relief missions; \nthey will not help civilians relocate or act as local police.\n  Now, there is a fine line between actually performing those tasks, \nwhich U.S. and NATO troops will not do and that the U.N. agencies and \nother private organizations will attempt to do, and helping to create a \nsecure environment, which NATO's force will do while they are there so \nthat those other tasks can be accomplished.\n  NATO and U.S. military leaders say that they have sufficient guidance \nto make the judgment about that fine line. Our troops will not be \ndirectly responsible for disarming the Bosnian Serbs or equipping the \nBosnian Government to achieve an equilibrium of forces on the ground. \nWhile both of those missions are desirable, it is appropriate for the \nNATO force to be able to maintain its evenhandedness in dealing with \nall of the parties and therefore to leave those tasks to separate \nmechanisms.\n  The third question I asked: Has the risk to our troops been \nminimized? Bosnia, even after this agreement, is a very dangerous \nenvironment. I have been particularly concerned, as have many of us, \nabout the threat posed by landmines, which some have estimated to \nnumber 6 million. General Shalikashvili has testified last week that \nthe troops have received extra training before deploying to the theater \nspecifically against known hazards, such as landmines and snipers. They \nwill be well-armed, equipped with robust rules of engagement that they \nneed to protect themselves, and local commanders will have the \nauthority that they need to make decisions about using force without \nany cumbersome dual-key arrangements.\n  Secretary Perry testified that they have the authorization to use \ndeadly force, if necessary, and National Security Adviser Tony Lake \nwarned that--\n\n       . . . if anybody fools with our forces, they will get hit, \n     hit immediately and very hard, and we expect that any other \n     challenge or threat to our forces would be intimidated.\n\n  In addition, there is a clear chain of command with U.S. commanders \nat the top. General Shalikashvili testified that he believes the risk \nof physical danger to be small and that he would anticipate more \ncasualties from accidents than from hostile action.\n  The fourth question I asked: Are there clearly defined conditions \nunder which United States forces will not go into Bosnia? The answer is \nyes.\n  We have received repeated testimony that NATO will not fight its way \nin. The parties have initialed an agreement, and they are scheduled to \nsign it in Paris tomorrow. Vanguard NATO units are in Bosnia. We must \nsee evidence of compliance with this agreement before deployment. \nOtherwise, General Shalikashvili has testified that we are not going \nin. We are not going to fight our way in. We are going there to help \nimplement a peace agreement which the parties want.\n  The fifth question: Is there a clear exit strategy? Administration \nofficials are clear that the deployment of United States forces with \nNATO will last approximately 1 year, and they have said that most of \nthe military tasks that the NATO force is charged with achieving may be \nachievable in less than 12 months.\n  There are two key issues here. One is whether an effective \nequilibrium of forces can be achieved between the parties in such a way \nthat the Bosnians can defend themselves when the NATO forces leave. \nThere is still a lot of doubt about this. The goal is not part of the \nmilitary mission itself. It is a separate commitment from the United \nStates to all of the parties, which all of the parties, we are told, \nhave accepted.\n  Now I remain skeptical, as indeed do some of the officials who \ntestified before us, that an arms control agreement as outlined in the \nDayton agreement can by itself effectively achieve that equilibrium. \nSecretary Perry says that he believes that the United States commitment \nto assure success of this effort to rearm and train the Bosnians if the \narms control effort fails, will actually help that arms control effort \nsucceed.\n  We will need to watch closely to see if the parties abide by their \nobligations to reduce armaments, working with the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. For instance, they have agreed not \nto import any weapons for 90 days and any heavy weapons for 180 days. \nIf they do not abide by these aspects of the agreement, the United \nStates is prepared to assure that arms and training will be provided to \nthe Bosnian Government. This must be premised, of course, on the most \nreliable possible assessment of all sides' current military \ncapabilities, and the assessment of what constitutes an effective \nequilibrium: defensible territory with sufficient armaments. If the \narms control agreements are not carried out, as Secretary Perry \ntestified, the United States can and will need to try to accelerate the \narming effort during the 12-month NATO deployment period.\n  The second key issue on exiting is whether a secure environment can \ncontinue to exist after the NATO force leaves. Annex 11, signed by the \nparties, establishes an international police task force assistance \nprogram to monitor, observe, inspect, advise, and train law enforcement \nagencies to improve public and state security. But that may not be \nenough. In addition to the international police task force, full and \nlasting implementation by the parties of all aspects of the peace \nagreement may require the presence of a smaller residual military force \nin the former Yugoslavia for longer than the 1 year planned for the \nNATO implementation force, and any such residual force \n\n[[Page S18504]]\nshould be comprised primarily of Armed Forces from European nations \nwithout U.S. Armed Forces.\n  I believe there should be planning underway now for a European \nresidual force. The President should be encouraging European nations \nnow to initiate contingency planning for such a force that does not \ninclude U.S. Armed Forces to maintain a secure environment for \nimplementation of the peace agreement after the NATO forces leave.\n  Mr. President, there is no need to wring our hands in this body about \nnot having a choice. Some say we have no choice, that the decision has \nbeen made. Well, we have three choices, at least.\n  Choice 1 is to say there shall be no funds for these troops. That was \nthe choice that we voted against earlier today. But that was a choice. \nThat is a constitutional capability that we have, if we decided to \nexercise it, to say that we will use the power of the purse so that \nthese troops would not go to Bosnia. By an overwhelming vote, 22 to 77, \nwe decided not to use the power of the purse, not to use that \ncapability that this Congress has under the Constitution to restrict \nfunding in order to prevent troops from going to Bosnia. But it was a \nchoice. We were not in a position where we were prevented from \nexercising that constitutional option.\n  We have a second choice. We can express an opinion which is in \nopposition to this mission, short of using the power of the purse, but \nnonetheless an expression of opinion. That is what the Hutchison \nresolution does.\n  It seems to me, however, that the Hutchison resolution would be a \nterrible mistake and would sap the morale of our troops terribly. To \ntell our troops that we will support you, we are all for you, as part \nof the Hutchison resolution does, to say that the Congress supports \nmilitary personnel who may be ordered into Bosnia, but we oppose the \ndecision, is telling those troops who are put in a position of danger \nthat we do not support their mission.\n  Now, if anything will undermine morale of troops, it would seem to \nme, it would be saying this to them: No matter how much we say in one \nparagraph of the resolution that we are behind the troops--you can say \nthat all you want, you can proclaim that all you want in one \nparagraph--but it runs exactly counter and undermines that message to \nsay in another paragraph, you are being sent on a mission which is \nwrong. If that mission is wrong, then the power of the purse should be \nused to prevent it.\n  It should be one way or the other. We have the authority under the \nConstitution. We chose not to exercise it. I think we made the right \ndecision. But we had that choice under the Constitution. Having chosen \nnot to exercise a power that this Congress had to prevent the troops \nfrom going to Bosnia to be put in a position of danger, it seems to me \nnow it is totally wrong for us to tell those troops we are now for you \nbut your mission is a mistake. If that mission is a mistake, we should \nhave voted not to allow it. We cannot have it both ways and expect our \ntroops, who are being put in harm's way, to do anything except react in \nwonderment and amazement that a Congress could decide not to restrict \nthe funds, and then to say in the same resolution we are behind our \ntroops, although the mission is wrong.\n  I hope we will defeat the Hutchison resolution and adopt the third \nresolution which will be voted on, the Dole-McCain resolution, which in \na qualified way, in a very careful way, supports the continuation of \nthis mission.\n  Mr. President, it comes down to this: We have vital security \ninterests in trying to help prevent a war in Europe from resuming and \nspreading into a wider regional war which would probably fracture NATO, \nwhich could very well pit NATO ally against NATO ally. We have an \ninterest in reducing the chance of Europe becoming divided again with \nRussia on the other side from most of Europe, with a Russia that would \nbe likely, if this peace agreement failed because the United States \nstayed out of the NATO force, to then grow as a threat to the United \nStates and to our allies. If this peace agreement falls apart because \nof United States non-participation with NATO, we would be playing into \nthe hands of the most extreme nationalists in Russia and furthering \ntheir election ambitions next year. If this NATO military mission \nsucceeds, Russian troops for the first time will be under American \ncommand, an extraordinary development in history, and will be a greater \npart of a European security solution, instead of being part of the \nproblem as they have for so many decades.\n  U.S. involvement in this NATO force is essential if the peace \nagreement of the parties has any chance of being implemented. This is a \nchance, a chance that only the parties can take advantage of. But by \nparticipating, we would also be giving the parties a chance to end the \nslaughter and the ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as a weapon. For \nall of these reasons, and having answered the questions which I put to \nmyself in good conscience over the last few weeks, I have concluded we \nshould participate in the NATO force, and I hope the Dole-McCain \nresolution is adopted.\n   Mr. President, against all odds and against most predictions, the \nwarring parties in the Balkans came together and negotiated a \ncomprehensive and complex peace agreement. It is not perfect, and its \nsuccess is by no means assured, but it is their agreement, and as \nAssistant Secretary Holbrooke testified last week, it goes farther than \nanyone had reason to hope the parties would go when they first started.\n  This agreement represents the best chance for peace in the region \nthat we have seen after 4 years of devastating war. It is still up to \nthe parties themselves to implement the agreement. The role of the NATO \nImplementation Force [IFOR] is to give them that chance, by creating a \nsecure environment in which the many tasks set forth in the agreement \ncan be pursued.\n  But if the United States does not participate in that NATO force, \nafter the parties have signed up to an agreement we urged upon them, \nwith the expectation that we would participate, then the war will \nresume and probably spread. More civilians will be killed, tortured, \nand ethnically cleansed in a renewed war. More refugees will be \ndisplaced and dispersed throughout Europe. As President Clinton said \nlast month:\n\n       If we're not there, NATO will not be there. The peace will \n     collapse. The war will reignite. The slaughter of innocents \n     will begin again . . . American cannot and must not be the \n     world's policeman. We cannot stop all war for all time, but \n     we can stop some wars.\n\n  There is wide support for this conclusion.\n  President Bush's former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft \nwarned against the risks of this undertaking, but he said that ``the \nalternative, in my judgment, is a clear disaster. To turn our back now \nwould be a catastrophe. . . . If we don't go in, a lot more Americans \nwill die, somewhere, sometime.''\n  Former Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz testified to the \nArmed Services Committee that ``if we go in, there is a modest chance \nof success. If we stay out there is a real certainty of failure.'' The \ncost to important U.S. security interests of a wider and more deadly \nwar spreading throughout the region, possibly putting us in direct \nconflict with Russia again after 5 years of improving relations, would \nbe enormous. It is not just the relevance and usefulness of NATO as an \ninstrument of European stability that would suffer, but United States \ncredibility around the globe.\n   Mr. President, there are indeed reasons to be skeptical that the \npeace agreement can be fully implemented. The region has seen centuries \nof historic animosities, and 4 years of brutality. There are still \nterritorial disputes whose final settlement has been put off. The man \nwho fueled war with dreams of a Greater Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, now \nclaims to be the guarantor of the Bosnian Serbs' compliance with the \nagreement.\n  Resettlement of refugees, guaranteed in the agreement, promises to be \nexceedingly difficult. We are not sure how many refugees will even try \nto reclaim their homes, or who will arbitrate claims of ownership. Even \nthis past weekend, some Croat forces looted and burned the homes of a \ntown scheduled to be returned to Serb control.\n   Mr. President, I have concluded however that although there are \nserious risks to this mission, the costs and risks of not acting with \nour NATO allies, would be even greater.\n\n[[Page S18505]]\n\n  People around the world are watching the United States at this \nmoment, watching to see whether we will fulfill again the role of \nfacilitating peace that has long been our tradition. I recently \nreceived a letter from a old friend of mine, Eric Osterweil, now living \nin Brussels, but following our deliberations closely. Welcoming the \nDayton peace agreement, he wrote:\n\n       I think it is in the strategic interest of the United \n     States to ensure that peace reigns in Southeastern Europe. \n     The risks, if we fail to act, are, I think, far-reaching. \n     They include potential Russian intervention, a conflict \n     between Greece and Turkey and other disagreeable \n     eventualities. It may be difficult for the U.S. not to be \n     involved in any major conflict on the continent of Europe. To \n     me, the most potent argument, however, is that the U.S. has a \n     chance to ensure that peace prevails over war and life over \n     death.\n\n  Mr. President, the most important votes we take in the U.S. Senate \nare those involving the deployment of U.S. military personnel to \ndangerous spots around the globe. The volunteers who make up our Armed \nForces are dedicated, talented women and men whose lives we value and \nwhose service we cherish. The NATO mission before them is challenging, \nbut it is doable, as General Shalikashvili has testified, and however \nindividual Senators vote on this resolution, the troops should know \nthat we all stand behind them and we all stand for them.\n  Mr. President, the Bosnian State outlined in the Dayton agreements \nhas two armies, three administrations, and is surrounded by hostile \nneighbors. Can a civil society grow out of a land so steeped in \nmistrust, anger, and savage conflict? There is no guarantee. We cannot \nassure that there will ultimately be that successful outcome--only the \npeople who live there and their leaders can achieve that. But at least \nNATO is acting to give them a chance to build a civil society and put \nwar behind them. That is a mission that the United States should not \nundermine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). According to the previous \nunanimous-consent agreement, the Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, while many of us \nhave serious concerns with the scope and the structure of the Bosnian \nmission, there is no doubt about our troops' ability and competence to \ncarry out the mission that has been assigned to them by the President \nof the United States. Like so many times in the past, when they have \nserved our country well and they have made us proud, I have no doubts \nabout the fact they will be no different in this mission.\n  Despite what is being said here this evening, whether you are for or \nagainst the proposition that is before us, we will obviously not change \nthe outcome. The deal, as they say, is done, because the troops are \nbeing deployed and will continue to be deployed, no matter what we do \nhere or how we vote.\n  Congress is essentially faced with a proposition of accepting the \nPresident's position on Bosnia, having come full circle from ``Mission \nImpossible'' several years ago, to ``fait accompli'' today. By \ndisavowing any congressional role, the President has presented this \npolicy no longer as the administration's policy, but now it is \nAmerica's policy. That clearly places us in a very difficult position. \nWhat we can and should do today is to use this debate to express our \nreservations and concerns, our support--whatever the case may be.\n  Inevitably there are constitutional conflicts between branches of \nGovernment. Inevitably, we have been in this role before, with respect \nto whether or not we should assign troops and whether or not the \nPresident should come to the Congress. I happen to think it is very \nimportant to express our concerns to this and future Presidents about \nthe fact that Congress is not playing such a role before the fact--and \nnot after the fact. The fact of the matter is, it is in America's \ninterests to have congressional involvement and participation. It helps \nthe President to advance his own policy and his own mission. It helps \nto broaden the support if there are doubts about such a mission. But, \nunfortunately, that is not what is before us today.\n  We have also considered other alternatives with respect to Bosnia. In \nfact, I can remember as far back as 1993, in the spring, when I was a \nmember of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, we voted on lifting the arms embargo so that the \nBosnian Moslems could defend themselves and their families, their \nproperty. And for over 2 years we fought that battle, and the \nadministration did not support us in that endeavor. The Europeans \nresisted this effort as well. I think that is part of the Balkan \ntragedy, the fact that the Moslems could not defend themselves; that \nthey did not have the arms or the equipment or the training to defend \nthemselves and their families.\n  Now we are faced with the proposition of deploying troops to Bosnia. \nThis should have been the last option and not the first. We should have \nexhausted all other means and all other possibilities before we \nresorted to deploying ground troops.\n  Back in 1993, it is interesting, the administration presented its own \ncriteria, guidelines for a future mission in Bosnia. In fact, Secretary \nof State Christopher laid out those guidelines in 1993. They said that, \nin order to deploy troops, four criteria should be met:\n  First, that the goal must be clearly stated;\n  Second, there must be strong likelihood of success;\n  Third, there must be an exit strategy;\n  Fourth, the action must win sustained public support.\n  It seems to me the administration has fallen far short in meeting \nsome of these criteria that the administration itself has established. \nBut I would like to take a look at some of those guidelines tonight and \nhow this agreement fits into the context of the criteria the \nadministration laid out for such a mission.\n  First, the goal must be clearly stated. When it comes to the mission \nof the troops, I think this Chamber and the American people certainly \nneed to know what this deployment is or is not about. We know it is not \na peacekeeping mission. In fact, it is much of a departure from a \npeacekeeping mission. It is a peace enforcement mission. That being the \ncase, as the administration has suggested, is the goal simply to \nseparate warring parties for 1 year and then leave? The administration \nhas said yes, and so did witnesses before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. But at other times the administration argued that we will \nonly achieve success if we succeed in creating a single, unitary, \nmultiethnic Bosnian state, as Secretary Holbrooke said after the \nsigning of the agreement in Dayton, when he said, ``Otherwise, we will \nhave failed.''\n  So, is it a part of our mission to also create a more stable arms \nbalance in Bosnia, by ensuring the Bosnian Government forces receive \nthe heavy armor they currently lack? Yes, that is part of the overall \nintent of this administration. But the administration has also agreed \nthat the arms buildup will not occur until we can succeed first in \npursuing an arms builddown. But there is no such mechanism for that \nbuilddown to occur.\n  Then we have the arming and training issue. It will certainly be one \nof the focuses of this resolution before us that will be offered by \nSenator Dole. But it still is not clear what the administration has in \nmind or how, in fact, it will be accomplished. The fact is, this could \nbe accomplished without even deploying troops to Bosnia. But that, \nunfortunately, is not our option today.\n  So the arming, the training, the equipping of the Bosnian Moslems \nwill occur in the face of opposition from our European allies and the \nSerbs. It was so much opposed that it was not even a part of the \nagreement. Yet it now happens to be, and should be, a very key \ncomponent of the overall strategy. Because Senator Dole has been \nworking on precisely defining this mission now, because it has not been \nprecisely defined by this administration, it will remain one of the key \ncomponents of this mission. Yet it will have to be done in the face of \noverwhelming opposition by our allies and the Serbs. How that will be \ndone remains open to serious question.\n  Is our goal, as well, to facilitate elections? Protect refugees? \nUndertake reconstruction activities? Track down and arrest war \ncriminals? The administration sometimes argues no. But then it also \nargues that these nation-building activities are what will determine \nwhether or not we have succeeded. So, are these our goals as well? In \nfact, this case is strengthened by the fact \n\n[[Page S18506]]\nthat in the Dayton accords the United States insisted on granting our \nforces the power to become involved in these activities.\n  To quote from article 6, section 3:\n\n       Our NATO forces will have the authority to:\n       A. Help secure conditions for the conduct of free and fair \n     elections;\n       B. Assist in the accomplishment of humanitarian missions;\n       C. Assist the U.N. High Commission for Refugees;\n       D. Prevent interference with the movement of civilian \n     populations and to respond to deliberate violence to life and \n     person.\n\n  If our powers under article 6, section 3, are not a recipe for \nmission creep, I do not know what is.\n  Second, there must be a strong likelihood of success. Is there? Of \ncourse, that all depends on the definition of our mission. And, as I \nhave already stated, those goals are somewhat confused and vague. I \nhave read the predictions of a wide range of experts on this subject, \nand few are truly optimistic about the long-term success of this \nagreement, whatever the definition of success may be. There is also a \ngreat deal of skepticism of the genuine commitment of all the parties \nto this agreement or to any common vision of a future for Bosnia.\n  But, clearly, we are not going into Bosnia with lightly armed troops \nmonitoring a peace that has been reached voluntarily and in good will \nby the parties themselves. That is what a traditional peacekeeping \noperation is all about. But that is not what this is. Rather, we will \nbe moving in with one of the U.S. Army's six heavy armored divisions, \nthe 1st Armored Division which served as a cornerstone of NATO's \ndefense against the Soviet Union. So, this becomes more like our \ndeployments to Beirut in 1983 and Somalia, in 1993, both of which ended \nwith disastrous consequences, and both attempted to deploy United \nStates troops in the service of so-called nation-building activities.\n  Third, there must be an exit strategy.\n  The administration has said it has an exit strategy by promising to \nbe out within a year. But this is an exit timetable, not an exit \nstrategy. It says nothing about what needs to be accomplished during \nthat year to permit our successful disengagement. Again, any viable \nexit strategy defines our missions and goals. And we still have seen \nthat remains nebulous at best. How can the administration legitimately \nargue that it has an exit strategy if it cannot clearly define the \nmission? In fact, Secretary Perry said before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that the exit strategy will have accomplished the cessation \nof hostilities, a separation of warring parties, and a break in the \ncycle of violence. But that really does not define an exit strategy. \nWhat it does is define an end date. It defines exactly what the state \nof affairs happens to be at the time in which we depart. But it does \nnot define what we have accomplished.\n  As Dr. Schlesinger testified before the Armed Services Committee, he \nsaid, ``We do not really have an exit strategy because the situation is \ntoo messy. We have an exit hope.''\n  Finally, the action must have sustained public support. Polls have \nshown that there is not strong support for this mission to Bosnia. In \nfact, it shows the opposite. The majority of the American people oppose \nthe deployment of American troops into Bosnia. We know that could \nchange as the troops are being deployed and will continue to be \ndeployed.\n  But what is the reason for the concern among the American people? I \nthink the concern stems from the fact that the administration has yet \nto make a compelling case on the merits of the mission or even to \nclearly define the mission itself in terms of our vital national \nsecurity interests. The American people need to know--and they deserve \nto know--that the mission itself merits a military deployment of our \ntroops. The American people have the right to know that the parties \ninvolved in Bosnia are committed to self-sustaining and enduring peace. \nAnd at the very least they should expect that these parties will be \ncommitted to a longstanding peace. That remains open to a very serious \nquestion. And it gets back again to the definition of our goal and \nmission.\n  I happen to think that it is very important that whenever we are \ndeploying our men and women to an area of conflict, when we are putting \nthem in harm's way, that it is absolutely vital that the parties \ninvolved are absolutely committed to securing a long-lasting peace. I \nthink that all that we have heard thus far remains open to very serious \nquestion as to whether or not that will be the ultimate outcome.\n  So I think that the administration has fallen short in meeting its \nown criteria for this mission. But above and beyond that failure, there \nis another question. And that is the unprecedented nature of this \ndeployment.\n  It has been said that this is the first time NATO has embarked upon a \nmission outside of the treaty area itself. And there are those who \nargue in favor of such a mission because they say that it will serve as \na model for future NATO missions as well as securing the future of the \nalliance. That may be true. But no one has answered the question as to \nwhat harm will come to NATO and its prestige if this mission should \nfail. And what damage will that do to the alliance? If 2 years from now \nwe face renewed fighting--which indeed is a serious prospect and \nconsideration--and a partition of Bosnia, as so many analysts believe \nis the most likely outcome, in the end what will we have accomplished? \nWill it have been worth the potential loss of American lives, if that \nloss could have been avoided by employing other means such as lifting \nthe arms embargo?\n  Mr. President, one cannot help but feel that if we had pursued and \nexhausted all other possibilities and alternatives, Congress, the \nAmerican people, and our troops would not be faced with a situation \nthat has now been forced upon us. But, unfortunately, the proverbial \ntrain has left the station.\n  In the final analysis, this is a mission in which success is in no \nway clear--whose mission is yet to be defined, whose goals are yet \nuncertain, and whose mission does not have the sustained support of the \nAmerican people, and with parties who are not fully committed to peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the previous order, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, of course, there is no audience--or very little--here \non the floor. But I do not speak tonight to the audience on the floor. \nI speak to the audience that may be listening or watching through the \nelectronic eye.\n  I also speak for the Record, Mr. President, because a year from now \nwe are going to look back on this debate. Ten years from now we will \nlook back on this Record. And this Record will stand 100 years; 1,000 \nyears. So I think the Record should be made for future guidance.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                   A Contradictory Bosnia Resolution\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, one resolution we are now debating, \noffered by the junior Senator from Texas, directly addresses the idea \nof supporting the troops and the role which they have been asked to \nplay, in what I believe is a somewhat contradictory manner. The \nresolution before us would sign the Senate up to supporting U.S. troops \nin Bosnia without supporting the mission that they are called upon to \nperform.\n  In two simple sentences, this resolution would purport to support \nU.S. troops while simultaneously undermining the very work they are \nperforming. How can we, as the resolution before us states, ``strongly \nsupport the U.S. Armed Forces who may be ordered by the President to \nimplement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. . .'' after having just stated, in the same resolution, \nthat ``the Congress opposes President Clinton's decision to deploy \nUnited States forces into the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to \nimplement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. . .''? What kind of moral support are our troops supposed \nto find in that? And what kind of resolve does that demonstrate to \nanyone who might attempt to undermine the Bosnian peace agreement?\n  This is a clear flag, Madam President, to those who would target our \ntroops telling them that, if they target our troops, we will yank them \nout of \n\n[[Page S18507]]\nthat mission. So, the mission is undercut and eroded from the very \nbeginning by our own actions. That is not support of the troops, to my \nway of thinking.\n  This resolution also fails to address Congress' Constitutional \nresponsibility to weigh in on decisions to employ U.S. troops. It is \nsimply silent on that point. With this resolution, we again fail to dip \neven our toes into the icy waters of a controversial and difficult \npolitical decision to risk the lives of U.S. troops, even in support of \nwhat we all hope will be a relatively unthreatening mission in support \nof a peace agreement. Because we cannot guarantee that the life of not \none U.S. military service person will be lost in this endeavor, we shy \nlike a skittish horse from the halter of our responsibility.\n  I say to my colleagues that the lives of three diplomats have already \nbeen lost in this effort, but we do not think their lives were lost in \nvain, because we have reached a peace agreement. Is their effort, their \nsacrifices, not worth this effort to see the hard-won peace through to \nthe end? There is no better alternative, and Congress must now stand up \nand shoulder its responsibility to vote on this mission, to support \nboth the troops and the job they are undertaking.\n  Mr. President, it is clear from the historical record that, until \nrecently, the President has had only limited powers as Commander in \nChief. Other than repelling invasions and protecting U.S. forces, the \nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief was bound by the \nCongressional power to raise and support armies and the Congressional \npower to authorize the use of those forces in offensive operations. \nCongress not only supported the troops as a daily, practical matter, it \nplayed an essential role in deciding on the circumstances under which \ntroops would be used offensively. President Jefferson and others \nrecognized and acknowledged the limits on their presidential authority \nto order troops into actions that were not clearly in defense of U.S. \nterritory and forces.\n  It is only recent practice in which Congress has acquiesced greater \nauthority to the President to employ military forces in offensive or \nnon-traditional operations without specific authorization. This has had \nthe effect of tying the use of troops ever more tightly with the \nPresident in his role as Commander in Chief. I am sorry that this is \nthe case, because I believe that it is a degradation of Congressional \nauthority that undermines the delicate balance of power intended by the \nFramers, but it is the situation in which we find ourselves as a result \nof our own Congressional unwillingness to assert our Congressional \nrole.\n  As Cassius said, ``The fault is not in our stars, dear Brutus, but in \nourselves that we are underlings.''\n  Congress remains proud of its support of the troops in terms of \nproviding robust, even overblown, defense budgets, but it has failed to \nexercise its authority under the Constitution to direct or authorize \nthe use of troops. This was clearly not the intent of the Framers.\n  How can we reasonably tell troops in the field that we, the Congress, \nsupport you, the troops, but we are not willing to support the task you \nhave been ordered to perform? This is what the resolution before the \nSenate says, but this is a hair that cannot be split. We must step up \nto the plate, and support the job as well as the laborer, or we are not \nfulfilling our Constitutional role. I hope my colleagues will not be \nfooled into thinking that they can have their cake and eat it, too, by \nsupporting the troops without supporting the mission that they have \nbeen ordered to perform.\n  Suppose I would say to one of my grandsons, my beloved grandsons, who \nmight be going off to Bosnia, ``Well, my dear grandson, you know I love \nyou; I love you more than life; but I do not support the mission that \nyou are on. I am going to slam the door behind your back when you leave \nthe house, and you're on your own!''\n  This resolution is a slap in the face to our troops, telling them \nthat we support them, but that their mission is foolhardy.\n  What kind of support is that? You are up there on the high dive, \ntroops, and we support you, but we do not believe there is any water of \njustification in the mission bucket you are about to dive into. That is \nnot support. Anyone can see that such a claim amounts to a hollow nut! \nThere is no meat in it!\n  Let us read what the Apostle Paul said in his First Epistle to the \nCorinthians. It may be a little old fashioned to bring the Holy Bible \nin to the Chamber, but I am a little old fashioned. I am not of the \nreligious left or the religious right, but I believe in this holy book. \nHere is what Paul said:\n\n       And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or \n     harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall \n     it be known what is piped or harped?\n       For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall \n     prepare himself to the battle?\n       So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to \n     be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye \n     shall speak into the air.\n\n  Madam President, the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution speaks into the air, \nsaying one thing on the one hand and another thing on the other. We are \ngiving an uncertain sound with this trumpet. We are speaking into the \nair. Then in the words of Paul, ``Who shall prepare himself to the \nbattle?''\n  This is lighting a candle and putting it under a bushel. Jesus said, \n``Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a \ncandlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.''\n  This resolution by the able Senators from Texas and Oklahoma does not \ngive light to all that are in the house. It puts the candle under a \nbushel, and all that are in the house are left in darkness. And worse, \nthis resolution tells the President--not just this President, but all \nfuture Presidents--that you can do whatever you want, we may not agree \nwith you, but you can count on us to support the troops. Do what you \nwant with the troops, we do not question your authority, and count on \nus to follow up with appropriations and other forms of support to the \ntroops you have committed to the field. This dangerous precedent allows \nCongress to wash its hands--like Pontius Pilate--of the responsibility \nto authorize the use of troops, to stand in judgment on the mission the \ntroops are called upon to carry out. We can just pass contradictory, \nconfusing resolutions to ``support the troops'' in carrying out any \nPresidential whim, without dealing with our constitutional \nresponsibility to deal with politically difficult decisions on how and \nwhen to employ force. I say to my colleagues, think again, before \nsupporting this very unwise and potentially dangerous resolution.\n\n  Mr. President, now I wish to address the resolution by Mr. Dole and \nMr. McCain.\n  I commend the majority leader, Mr. Dole, as well as the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for their resolution. And I commend \nthem for working with the minority leader and other Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to fashion it.\n  I commend the minority leader and Senator Nunn and Senator Pell and \nall the other Senators who were on the task force on the Democratic \nside who worked with the words and with the Republicans in fashioning \nthe final product. It is important from a historical and constitutional \nperspective. It is important as well from a political perspective. \nFirst, if it passes, and I hope that it will, it provides the political \nunderpinning necessary for the President to pursue a military \ndeployment abroad where there are going to be costs in the billions of \ndollars, for the risk of casualties certainly exists, and where the \ncredibility of the United States and NATO is at stake.\n  Second, I believe that the language fulfills the constitutional \nrequirement that the Congress authorize or approve the operation in \nspecific enough detail to draw limits around it. In doing so, the \nCongress fulfills the exercise of its responsibilities that the Framers \nexpected and that has prevailed through most of American history.\n  I think it is important for Senators to reflect on our constitutional \nresponsibilities in respect to our action today. The question of the \nactual constitutional reach of the President, acting alone, and without \ncongressional authority to deploy forces into hostilities or \nsubstantial risk of hostilities has become a recurring modern issue \nbetween Presidents, beginning with Harry Truman and continuing through \nto today.\n  When the Framers began their work at the Philadelphia Convention, \nexisting models of government placed the \n\n[[Page S18508]]\nwar power squarely in the hands of the king. The English Parliament had \ngained the power of the purse in 1665 to control the king, but the \npower to go to war remained a monarchical prerogative. John Locke's \nSecond Treatise of Government (1690) spoke of three branches of \ngovernment: legislative, executive, and ``federative.'' The latter \nconsisted of ``the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and \nall the transaction with all persons and communities without the \ncommonwealth.'' The federative power (what we call foreign policy \ntoday) was ``almost always united'' with the executive. Separating the \nexecutive and federative powers, Locke warned, would invite ``disorder \nand ruin.''\n  A similar model appeared in the Commentaries written by Sir William \nBlackstone, the great eighteenth-century jurist. He counseled that the \nking had absolute power over foreign affairs and war: the right to send \nand receive ambassadors, make treaties and alliances, make war or \npeace, issue letters of marque and reprisal, command the military, \nraise and regulate fleets and armies, and represent the nation in its \nintercourse with foreign nations.\n  These models were well known to the Framers. They knew that their \nforebears in England had committed to the executive the power to go to \nwar. When they declared their independence from England, they vested \nall executive powers in the Continental Congress and proceeded to \nincorporate that principle in the first national constitution, the \nArticles of Confederation. Later, during their learned and careful \ndeliberations at the Philadelphia convention, they decided to vest in \nCongress many of Locke's federative powers and Blackstone's royal \nprerogatives. The delegates emphasized repeatedly that the power of \npeace and war associated with monarchy would not be given to the \nPresident. As James Wilson noted, it was incorrect to consider ``the \nPrerogatives of the British Monarch as a proper guide in defining the \nExecutive powers. Some of these prerogatives were of a legislative \nnature. Among others that of war and peace.\n  By the time the Framers finished their labors, the President had been \nstripped of the sole power to make treaties. He shared that with the \nSenate. He had the right to send and receive Ambassadors, but only \nafter the Senate agreed to his nominations. He had no power to issue \nletters of marque and reprisal (authorizing private citizens to \nundertake military actions). That power was vested in Congress. \nAlthough the President was made Commander in Chief, it was left to \nCongress to raise and regulate fleets and armies. The rejection of \nLocks and Blackstone was decisive.\n  The reasoning for this break is set forth clearly in The Federalist \nPapers. In Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton explained that the \nPresident has ``concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in \nthe formation of treaties,'' whereas the British king ``is the sole \npossessor of the power of making treaties.'' The royal prerogative in \nforeign affairs was deliberately shared with Congress. Hamilton \ncontrasted the distribution of war powers in England and in the \nAmerican Constitution. The power of the king ``extends to the declaring \nof war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies.'' Unlike \nthe King of England, the President ``will have only the occasional \ncommand of such part of the militia of the Nation as by legislative \nprovision may be called into the actual service of the Union''. No such \ntether attached to the king.\n  In Federalist No. 74, Hamilton provided an additional reason for \nmaking the President Commander in Chief. The direction of war ``most \npeculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of \npower by a single head.'' The power of directing was and emphasizing \nthe common strength ``forms a usual and essential part in the \ndefinition of the executive authority.''\n  Designating the President Commander in Chief represented an important \nmethod for preserving civilian supremacy over the military. The person \nleading the Armed Forces would be the civilian President, not a \nmilitary officer. As U.S. Attorney General Bates explained in later \nyears, the President is commander in chief not because he is ``skilled \nin the art of war and qualified to marshal a host in the field of \nbattle.'' He is commander in chief for a different reason. Whatever \nsoldier leads U.S. armies to victory against an enemy, ``he is subject \nto the orders of the civil magistrate, and he and his army are always \n`subordinate to the civil power.'''\n\n  The Constitution grants to Congress a number of specific powers to \ncontrol war and military affairs: to declare war; to raise and support \narmies and provide and maintain a navy; the power to make regulations \nof the land and naval forces; the power to call forth the militia; and \nthe power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the \nmilitia. Furthermore, the Constitution vests in Congress the power to \nregulate foreign commerce, an area that has a direct relationship to \nthe war power. Commercial conflicts between nations were often a cause \nof war. Guided by history, the Framers placed that power with Congress. \nJames Madison later remarked: ``The constitution supposes, what the \nHistory of all Govts demonstrates, that the Ex. is the branch of power \nmost interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with \nstudied care, vested the question of war in the Legisl.''\n  The debates at the Philadelphia Convention include a revealing \ndiscussion on Congress' power to declare war. The early draft empowered \nCongress to ``make war.'' Charles Pinckney objected that legislative \nproceedings ``were too slow'' for the safety of the country in an \nemergency. He expected Congress to meet only once a year. Madison and \nElbridge Gerry recommended that ``declare'' be substituted for \n``make,'' leaving to the President ``the power to repel sudden \nattacks.'' Their motion carried.\n  There was little doubt about the scope of the President's authority. \nThe power to repel sudden attacks represents an emergency measure that \npermits the President, when Congress is not in session, to take actions \nnecessary to repel sudden attacks either against the mainland of the \nUnited States or against American troops abroad. It does not authorize \nthe President to take the country into full-scale war or to mount an \noffensive attack against another nation.\n\n  I believe that any objective reading of this history would lead \nSenators to the conclusion that the President's scope of authority does \nnot include the ordering of a deployment into Bosnia, even if a treaty \norganization such as NATO requested such action by its member states.\n  The Framers empowered the President to be Commander in Chief, but \nthat title relates to responsibilities that are authorized by Congress. \nThe language in the Constitution reads: ``The President shall be \nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of \nthe Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service \nof the United States.'' Congress, not the President, does the calling. \nArticle I gives to Congress the power to provide ``for calling forth \nthe Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections \nand repel invasions.''\n  The title of Commander in Chief was introduced by King Charles I in \n1639 and was always used as a generic term referring to the highest \nofficer in a particular chain of command. With the eruption of the \nEnglish civil wars, both the king and Parliament appointed commanders \nin chief in various theaters of action. The ranking commander in chief, \npurely a military post, was always under the command of a political \nsuperior, whether appointed by the king, Parliament or, with the \ndevelopment of the cabinet system in the eighteenth century, by the \nsecretary of war.\n  England transplanted the title to America in the eighteenth century \nby appointing a number of commanders in chief and by the practice of \nentitling colonial governors as commanders in chief (or occasionally as \nvice admirals or captains general). The appointment of General Thomas \nGage as commander in chief from 1763 to 1776 caused the colonists grave \nconcern, for he proceeded to interfere in civil affairs and acquired \nconsiderable influence over Indian relations, trade, and \ntransportation. The bitter memory of his decision to quarter troops in \ncivilians' homes spawned the Third Amendment \n\n[[Page S18509]]\nto the Constitution. These activities and others prompted the colonists \nin the Declaration of Independence to complain of King George III that \nhe had ``affected to render the Military Independent of and superior to \nthe Civil Power.''\n\n  But the colonists had no reason to fear the governors who were given \nthe title commander in chief, even though they controlled the \nprovincial forces, since the colonial assemblies claimed and asserted \nthe right to vote funds for the militia as well as to call it into \nservice. In fact, grievances came from the governors, who complained of \nthe relative impotence of their positions. The colonists' assemblies' \n(and later, the states') assertions of the power of the purse as a \ncheck on the commander in chief reflected an English practice that was \ninstituted in the middle of the seventeenth century. By 1665, \nParliament, as a means of maintaining political control of the military \nestablishment, had inaugurated the policy of making annual military \nappropriations lasting but one year. This practice sharply emphasized \nthe power of Parliament to determine the size of the army to be placed \nunder the direction of the commander in chief.\n  The practice had a long influence, for, under its constitutional \npower to raise and support armies and to provide a navy, Congress \nacquired a right that the colonial and state assemblies had to vote \nfunds for the armed forces. An additional historical parallel in the \nArticle I, Section 8, clause 13 provides that ``no Appropriation of \nMoney to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years.'' The \nrequirement of legislative approval for the allocation of funds to \nraise troops underscores the principle of political superiority over \nmilitary command. It also constitutes a sharp reminder that a Commander \nin Chief is dependent on the legislature's willingness to give him an \narmy to command.\n\n  The Continental Congress continued the usage of the title in 1775, \nwhen it unanimously decided to appoint George Washington as general. \nHis commission named him ``General and Commander in Chief, of the Army \nof the United Colonies.'' He was required to comply with orders and \ndirections from Congress, which did not hesitate to instruct the \ncommander in chief on military and policy matters.\n  The practice of entitling the office at the apex of the military \nhierarchy as commander in chief and of subordinating the office to a \npolitical superior, whether a king, a parliament, or a congress, had \nthus been firmly established for a century and a half and was \nthoroughly familiar to the Framers when they met in Philadelphia. \nPerhaps this settled historical usage accounts for the fact that there \nwas no debate on the Commander in Chief clause at the Convention.\n  President Thomas Jefferson understood the limitations of the \nCommander in Chief clause. in 1801, in his first annual message to \nCongress, he reported the arrogant demands made by Joseph Caramanly, \nthe pasha of Tripoli. Unless the United States paid tribute, the pasha \nthreatened to seize American ships and citizens. In response, Jefferson \nsent a small squadron to the Mediterranean to protect against the \nthreatened attack. He then asked Congress for further guidance, since \nhe was ``unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of \nCongress, to go beyond the line of defense.'' It was left to Congress \nto authorize ``measures of offense.''\n  Jefferson's understanding of the war clause underwent no revision. \nLike Jefferson, President James Madison was aggrieved by the punishment \nand harassment inflicted on United States vessels. In 1812, he \nexpressed to Congress his extreme resentment of the British practices \nof seizing American ships and seamen and inducing Indian tribes to \nattack the United States. Madison complained but said the question of \n``whether the United States shall remain passive under these \nprogressive usurpations and these accumulating wrongs, or, opposing \nforce, to force in defense of their national rights'' is ``a solemn \nquestion which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative \ndepartment of the Government.''\n  Following his 1823 announcement of what has become known as the \nMonroe Doctrine, President James Monroe was confronted with \ninternational circumstances that seemed to invite the use of force, but \nMonroe repeatedly disclaimed any constitutional power to initiate \nhostilities, since, he maintained, that authority was granted to \nCongress.\n  President James K. Polk may well have initiated war with Mexico in \n1846, when he ordered an army into a disputed area on the Texas-Mexico \nborder. But Polk understood the constitutional dimensions of the war \npower and offered the rationale that Mexico had invaded the United \nStates, which, if true, would justify a response by the Commander in \nChief.\n\n  Until 1950, no President departed from this understanding of the \nparameters of the Commander in Chief clause. But to justify President \nTruman's unilateral decision to introduce troops into the Korean war, \nrevisionists purported to locate in the President a broad discretionary \nauthority to commence hostilities.\n  Emboldened by Truman's claim, subsequent Presidents have likewise \nunilaterally initiated acts of war, from the Vietnam war to the \nincursions in Grenada and Panama. But this claim is cut from whole \ncloth. It ignores the origins and development of the title, the clear \nunderstanding of the Constitution's Framers, the nineteenth-century \nrecord, and the history of judicial interpretation. The Supreme Court \nhas never held that the Commander in Chief clause confers power to \ninitiate war. In United States v. Sweeny (1895), Justice Henry Brown \nwrote for the Court that the object of the clause was to give the \nPresident ``such supreme and undivided command as would be necessary to \nthe prosecution of a successful war.'' In 1919, Senator George \nSutherland, who later became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, \nwrote, ``Generally speaking, the war powers of the President under the \nConstitution are simply those that belong to any commander in chief of \nthe military forces of a nation at war. The Constitution confers no war \npowers upon the President as such.''\n  While the Supreme Court has held that the President may not initiate \nhostilities and that he is authorized only to direct the movements of \nthe military forces placed by law at his command, it has been contended \nthat the existence of a standing army provides the President with broad \ndiscretionary authority to deploy troops on behalf of foreign-policy \ngoals. Although the intrusion of a public force into a foreign country \nmay well entangle the United States in a war, Presidents have often \nmanipulated troop deployments so as to present Congress with a fait \naccompli. Given the broad range of war powers vested in Congress, \nincluding the authority to provide for the common defense, to raise and \nsupport armies, and to decide, in Madison's words, whether ``a war \nought to be commenced, continued or concluded,'' it seems clear that \nCongress may govern absolutely the deployment of forces outside U.S. \nborders. As a practical measure, Congress may choose, within the \nconfines of the delegation doctrine, to vest the President with some \nauthority to send troops abroad, but there is nothing inherent in the \nCommander in Chief clause that yields such authority.\n  Representative Abraham Lincoln in a letter to William H. Herndon \nsaid:\n\n       Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, \n     whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and \n     you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he \n     deems it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to \n     make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit \n     to his power in this respect, after you have given him so \n     much as you propose. If, to-day, he should choose to say he \n     thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British \n     from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, \n     ``I see no probability of the British invading us,'' but he \n     will say to you ``be silent; I see it, if you don't.''\n       The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making \n     power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the \n     following reasons. Kings had always been involving and \n     impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if \n     not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, \n     our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all \n     Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the \n     Constitution that no one man should hold the power of \n     bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the \n     whole matter, and places our President where kings have \n     always stood.\n\n  We are aware of the now familiar pattern of most recent Chief \nExecutives in similar circumstances of invoking the \n\n[[Page S18510]]\ntitle Commander in Chief and descriptions of him as being the sole \norgan of foreign relations or chief of administration to suggest a \nconclusion of constitutional invulnerability. No statutory or \ndecisional authority is volunteered in support of the conclusion.\n  If Congress is to have the sole authority ``to declare war,'' as the \nConstitution clearly states, then are we to suppose that, in any \nmilitary action short of a declaration of war, the authority reposed in \nthe Congress by the Constitution to declare war is shifted to another \ndepartment? Are we to assume that any action short of a declaration of \nwar, shifts the authority from the Congress to the Executive?\n  As we have seen, wars can be waged, and have been waged, without a \ndeclaration by Congress. Such military actions, nonetheless, still \nconstitute wars. The shedding of blood, the taking of lives, the \ndestruction of property, the movement of navys and armies, are all the \nsame, whether done under a declaration of war or without such a \ndeclaration. War is war whether it is a ``declared'' conflict or \notherwise. Are we to imagine that the authority is shifted from the \nelected representatives of the people in such instances to \nsomeone else, or to some other department, or to the executive? The \nlack of a declaration of war does not make the conflict any less a war \nthan it would be with such a declaration. The sacrifices, the costs, \nthe ramifications are just as far reaching in the case of an undeclared \nwar as in the case of a declared war. Why then, should we strain our \nimagination to the breaking point and pretend that, short of a \ndeclaration of war, the authority rests somewhere other than in the \nlegislative department?\n\n  President Clinton has taken the position that he does not believe \nthat he needs the authorization or approval of the Congress to engage \nin a major military deployment in Bosnia, where warring parties have \nsigned a peace agreement but where flashes of violence and hostile \nactions are so possible that NATO and other forces are needed to make \nthe agreement work. His immediate predecessor, Mr. Bush, took a similar \nposition in regard to his deployment of forces to Saudi Arabia to do \nbattle against Iraq in Desert Storm. Nevertheless, both of them \nrequested the formal support of the Congress in advance of their \nactions. I requested President Clinton on a number of occasions to seek \nthe support and approval of the Congress and the American people, \nbefore committing troops. The Senate ``authorized'' Mr. Bush, in S.J. \nRes. 2 on January 12, 1991, ``to use United States Armed Forces'' \nagainst Iraq, by a vote of 52-47.\n  Again, here today in the Resolution offered by the Majority Leader, \nthe Senate is providing clear authorization for the President to \nundertake a specific action, and in this case in somewhat more \nspecificity than was the case with regard to Mr. Bush, and for a \nlimited time. The operative words are in Section 2, that ``the \nPresident may only fulfill his commitment to deploy United States Armed \nForces . . . for approximately one year to implement the general \nFramework Agreement and Military Annex, pursuant to this Resolution, \nsubject to the conditions in subsection (b).'' That language fulfills \nthe Framers' intent, from a constitutional perspective, for the \nCongress to authorize the President to undertake war making powers that \nhe would not otherwise have.\n  The emphasis of the authority given here today is its limitation in \nscope and time. If, in the future, the missions engaged in by our \nforces go creeping into nation-building, to doing the job of civil \nauthorities for reconstruction or refugee movements, then the President \nwould have exceeded his authority. I, for one, would certainly be \nprepared to pull the plug on the operation--as I did in the case of \nSomalia--and cut off the lifeblood of its appropriated funds, if that \nkind of backsliding were to occur. The same is true if we went beyond \n``approximately one year'', language that I insisted be included in \nthis resolution. Our military leaders repeatedly testified that they \nwere highly confident that the military implementation tasks could \neasily be completed within a year, and the Dayton Accords obligated us \nto, specifically ``approximately one year.'' Thus, the resolution holds \nthe parties' feet to the time clock. In the interim, the Bosnian \nMuslims should be properly prepared, from a military standpoint, to \ndefend themselves. Furthermore, we ought to be considering putting into \nplace a follow-on European-manned security force, if further military \nsecurity from the outside appears to be needed. But, for us, our job is \nto be done in ``approximately one year,'' and that should be that.\n\n  The Constitution divides governmental powers into three areas: \nlegislative, executive, and judicial; and distributes them among three \nco-equal branches: Congress, President, and the courts; and provides a \nsystem of checks and balances to keep the powers separate and the \nbranches equal. Underlying this scheme of government in the area of \nimmediate concern is the desire to establish interdependence between \nCongress and the Executive in hopes of fostering cooperation and \nconsensus in the supersensitive areas of national security and foreign \naffairs.\n  As Commander in Chief and sole organ of foreign relations the \nPresident has independent powers, not simply those conferred on him by \nstatutes. Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 661 (1981), quoting \nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319-320 \n(1936). At the same time, by virtue of its power over the purse and \npowers to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and \nto regulate both, Congress has broad constitutional powers implicating \nnational security and foreign affairs. Article I, 1, cls. 12, 13, 14.\n  The separation of powers principle is intended to prevent one branch \nof government from enhancing its position at the expense of another \nbranch and, thus, disturb the delicate balance of powers that the \nFramers assumed was the best safeguard against autocracy.\n  As Commander in Chief the President has command of the army and navy \nand may respond to an attack upon the United States. See, e.g., \nYoungstown Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. at 642 (concurring opinion). Also, \nthere is authority for the proposition that he may act to safeguard \nAmerican lives and property abroad. See Durand v. Hollins, 8 F. Cas. \n111 (No. 4186) (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1860) and Slaughter-House cases, 16 Wall. \n36, 79 (1872). But see the Hostage Act of 1868, 22 U.S.C. 1732, which \nexcludes war from the President's options to obtain the release of \nAmericans unreasonably detained by a foreign government.\n  On the other hand, aside from his powers ``to grant Reprieves and \nPardons for Offenses against the United States . . .'' and to ``receive \nAmbassadors and other public Ministers'', the President is totally \ndependent upon Congress for authority or money and usually both to \nimplement any policy. Congress is under no legal obligation to supply \neither or both. For example, it has been said that ``[w]hile Congress \ncannot deprive the President of command of the army and navy, only \nCongress can provide him an army or navy to command.'' Youngstown Co. \nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. at 644 (concurring opinion).\n  In the Dole resolution, the authority to implement the President's \nproposed Bosnia policy is clearly provided, and in so doing the Senate \nis accepting responsibility for the action. In doing so, a vital \nbipartisan political foundation is being provided for the President's \nactions, and I think it clearly follows that the consequence of \nauthorizing this policy fall upon us here in this branch as well as in \nthe Oval Office. If it passes, we will be giving substance to the \nproposition that politics in America stops at the water's edge, and \nthis is as it should be. The American people should know that the \nBosnia implementation is a national policy, approved through the \nconstitutional scheme that was intended by the framers.\n  The Constitution specifies that ``[n]o Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .'' \nThis provision has been held to be a restriction upon the disbursing \nauthority of the Executive Department, and means that no money can be \npaid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an Act of \nCongress. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 \n(1937). Accordingly, the absolute control of the moneys of the United \nStates has been said to be in Congress, and Congress is responsible for \nits exercise of this great power only to the American people. \nHarrington v. Bush, 558 F. 2d 190, 194 note 7 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The \npower to \n\n[[Page S18511]]\nmake appropriations includes the authority not only to designate the \npurpose of the appropriation, ``but also the terms and conditions under \nwhich the executive department of the government may expend the \nappropriation. . . . The purpose of the appropriations, the terms and \nconditions under which . . . appropriations [are] made is solely in the \nhands of Congress and it is the plain duty of the executive branch of \nthe government to comply with the same.'' Spaulding v. Douglas Aircraft \nCo., 60 F. Supp. at 986.\n\n  Mr. President, the Dole Resolution does not provide the \nappropriations needed to carry out the Bosnia operation. This is a \npolicy resolution. That was also the case when we authorized President \nBush to make war against Iraq in Desert Storm. In that case, the \nappropriations were provided later. In the same way, the Congress will \nhave to approve appropriations for the Bosnia operation in the near \nfuture.\n  I hasten to point out, Mr. President, that the power of the purse is \nour ultimate hammer, and one which is always available, to terminate \nthe operation. If it turns out that the parties to this piece of \ngeography fail to live up to their pledge to keep the peace and to \nprovide for the security of our forces, and the agreement fails, the \nCongress can take swift action to terminate our involvement. We have \nexercised the power of the purse recently to terminate operations and \nlimit them. This was the case in both Somalia and Rwanda. So, while I \nsupport this Resolution and believe it is appropriate and timely, I \nwould certainly not hesitate to participate in an effort to end the \noperation and bring our forces home if the parties will not allow it to \nwork.\n  Although Congress is enacting laws has to scrupulously avoid even \nincidental, adverse effects on fully autonomous presidential powers \n(e.g., the pardoning power, Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333 (1867), it is \nunder no similar constraints in other areas. The fact that in the \nexercise of an acknowledged power, such as powers to fund or to \nregulate the Armed Forces of the United States, the Congress may \nincidentally impinge upon presidential authority as Commander in Chief \ndoes not render that exercise a violation of the separation of powers. \n``There are indications that the Constitution did not contemplate that \nthe title Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy will constitute him \nalso Commander in Chief of the Country, its industries and its \ninhabitants. He has no monopoly of `war powers,' whatever they are. \nWhile Congress cannot deprive the President of the command of the army \nand navy, only Congress can provide him an army and navy to command. It \nis also empowered to make rules for the `Government and Regulation of \nland and naval Forces,' by which it may to some unknown extent impinge \nupon even command functions.'' Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. at \n643-644 (concurring opinion.) ``The Constitution does not subject this \nlawmaking power of Congress to presidential or military supervision or \ncontrol.'' Id. at 588 (opinion of the court).\n  Although Congress is subject to the Constitution in the exercise of \nits power of the purse as in the exercise of all its powers, e.g., \nUnited States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), ``[e]ven when the \nPresident act clearly within his powers, Congress decides the degree \nand detail of its support,'' Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the \nConstitution 79 (1972), and ``it is the plain duty of the executive \nbranch of the government to comply with the same.'' Spaulding v. \nDouglas Aircraft Co., 60 F. Supp. at 986.\n\n  Mr. President, I shall enumerate the defense and war powers set forth \nin the Constitution, as bearing on the President as Commander in Chief, \nas compared with those that are directed to the legislative branch.\n  Section 2 of Article 2 states: ``The President shall be Commander in \nChief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of \nthe several states, when called in to the actual Service of the United \nStates.''\n  Section 3 of Article 2 states, ``. . . He shall take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the officers of \nthe United States.''\n  I find nothing else in the Constitution that would indicate any \nadditional authority or power given to the President with respect to \nthe armed forces.\n  On the other hand, there is much language in the Constitution with \nrespect to the authority and power of the legislative branch anent the \nmilitary. For example:\n  Clause 1, Section 8, Article 1: ``The Congress shall have power to . \n. . provide for the common defense . . . of the United States; . . .''\n  Clause 10, Section 8, Article 1 states: The Congress shall have power \n``to define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high \nSeas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;''\n  Clause 11, Section 8, Article 1: The Congress shall have power ``to \ndeclare war, grant letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make rules \nconcerning captures on land and water;''\n  Under Clause 12, Section 8, Article 1, the Congress shall have power \n``to raise and support Armies, but no appropriation of money to that \nuse shall be made for a longer term than two years;''\n  Clause 13, Section 8, Article 1 states: The Congress shall have power \n``to provide and maintain a navy;''\n  Clause 14, Section 8, Article 1 states: The Congress shall have power \n``to make Rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval \nforces;''\n  Clause 15, Section 8, Article 1 provides that: The Congress shall \nhave power ``to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the \nlaws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;''\n  Clause 16, Section 8, Article 1 states: The Congress shall have power \n``to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and \nfor governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of \nthe United States, reserving to the states respectively, the \nappointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia \naccording to the discipline prescribed by Congress;''\n\n  Clause 18, Section 8, Article 1 states: The Congress shall have power \n``to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying \ninto execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by \nthis Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any \ndepartment or officer thereof.''\n  If Congress is to have the sole authority ``to declare war,'' as the \nConstitution clearly states, then are we to suppose that, in any \nmilitary action short of a declaration of war, the authority reposed in \nthe Congress by the Constitution to declare war is shifted to another \ndepartment? Are we to assume that any action short of a declaration of \nwar, shifts the authority from the Congress to the Executive? To so \nsuppose, strains credulity to the breaking point. I prefer to suppose \nthat the Framers, being unable to foresee the various degrees of \nmilitary action short of that which would be taken under a declaration \nof war, and, therefore, they did not attempt to go into any detail \nbeyond that which would obtain in the event of all out war. Obviously, \nthe President has the inherent power and authority to take action to \nrepeal an invasion, or a sudden and unanticipated attack on the United \nStates or its military forces. In such instances, the President would \nhave no alternative but to exercise such authority, there being no time \nto consult with or to secure authorization from the Congress, which \nmight not even be in session at that moment. It seems logical however, \nto believe that the specific power to declare war--that being the \nultimate circumstance--and such declaration having been invested in the \nlegislative branch, anything short of the ultimate circumstance, \nanything short of the declaration of war, the responsibility and \nauthority for committing the armed forces of the United States in an \noffensive action, the authority would remain vested in the legislative \nbranch. In other words, the lone authority to declare war being vested \nin the legislative branch, anything less than a declaration of war \nwould seem to be reposed for its authority in the same source, namely, \nthe Congress. It strains imagination to the utmost to believe that the \nauthority to commit the military forces of the nation in an all out \nwar, shifts elsewhere when the military forces of the nation are to be \ncommitted to a lesser action by the military forces than that of all \nout war. The authority to go to the ultimate limit would seem to carry \nwith it the authority to extend the military action to something less \nthan the all out or ultimate action of declared war. \n\n[[Page S18512]]\n\n  I close by thanking the majority leader for his leadership and for \nhis statesmanship in taking the position he is taking in introducing \nthe resolution that we are going to vote on.\n  Mr. President, I urge that the Senate vote down the resolution \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Texas and the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, and others, and that the Senate vote to approve \nthe resolution offered by Mr. Dole and Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe resolutions on which we will vote today in the order in which we \nwill vote.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            S.

That the Congress opposes President Clinton's \n     decision to deploy United States ground forces into the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the General \n     Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     its associated annexes.\n       Section 2. That the Congress strongly supports the US Armed \n     Forces who may be ordered by the President to implement the \n     General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina and its associated annexes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                              S.J. Res. --\n\n       Whereas beginning on February 24, 1993, President Clinton \n     committed the United States to participate in implementing a \n     peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina without prior \n     consultation with Congress;\n       Whereas the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been \n     unjustly denied the means to defend itself through the \n     imposition of a United Nations arms embargo;\n       Whereas the United Nations Charter restates the ``the \n     inherent right of individual and collective self-defense,'' a \n     right denied the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina whose \n     population has further suffered egregious violations of the \n     international law of war including ethnic cleansing by \n     Serbian aggressors, and the Convention on Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, to which the United \n     States Senate gave its advice and consent in 1986;\n       Whereas the United States Congress has repeatedly voted to \n     end the United States participation in the international arms \n     embargo on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the best \n     way to achieve a military balance and a just and stable peace \n     without the deployment of United States Armed Forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \n     Republic of Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     initialed the General Framework Agreement and Associated \n     Annexes on November 21, 1995 in Dayton, Ohio, after repeated \n     assurances that the United States would send troops to assist \n     in implementing that agreement;\n       Whereas three dedicated American diplomats--Bob Frasure, \n     Joe Kruzel, and Nelson Drew--lost their lives in the \n     American-led diplomatic effort which culminated in the \n     General Framework Agreement;\n       Whereas as part of the negotiations which led to the \n     General Framework Agreement, the United States has made a \n     commitment to ensure that the Federation of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina is armed and trained to provide for its own \n     defense, and that commitment should be honored;\n       Whereas the mission of the NATO Implementation Force is to \n     create a secure environment to provide Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     an opportunity to begin to establish a durable peace, which \n     requires the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be able \n     to provide for its own defense;\n       Whereas the objective of the United States in deploying \n     United States Armed Forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina can only \n     be successful if the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \n     armed and trained to provide for its own defense after the \n     withdrawal of the NATO Implementation Force and the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas in deciding to participate in implementation of the \n     General Framework Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     President Clinton has cited American interests including \n     maintaining its leadership in NATO, preventing the spread of \n     the conflict, stopping the tragic loss of life, and \n     fulfilling American commitments;\n       Whereas on December 3, 1995, President Clinton approved \n     Operation Joint Endeavor and deployment of United States \n     Armed Forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina began immediately \n     thereafter: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       The Congress unequivocally supports the men and women of \n     our Armed Forces who are carrying out their missions in \n     support of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina with professional \n     excellence, dedicated patriotism and exemplary bravery, and \n     believes they must be given all necessary resources and \n     support to carry out their mission and ensure their security.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding reservations expressed about President \n     Clinton's decision to deploy United States Armed Forces to \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina and recognizing that:\n       (1) the President has decided to deploy United States Armed \n     Forces to implement the General Framework Agreement in \n     Operation Joint Endeavor citing American interests in \n     preventing the spread of conflict, maintaining its leadership \n     in NATO, stopping the tragic loss of life, and fulfilling \n     American commitments;\n       (2) the deployment of United States Armed Forces has begun; \n     and\n       (3) preserving United States credibility is a strategic \n     interest,\n\n     the President may only fulfill his commitment to deploy \n     United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina for \n     approximately one year to implement the General Framework \n     Agreement and Military Annex, pursuant to this Resolution, \n     subject to the conditions in subsection (b).\n       (b) Requirement for Determination.--Before acting pursuant \n     to this Resolution, the President shall make available to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate, his determination that--\n       (1) the mission of the NATO Implementation Force and United \n     States Armed Forces deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina will \n     be limited to implementation of the military provisions of \n     the Military Annex to the General Framework Agreement and \n     measures deemed necessary to protect the safety of the NATO \n     Implementation Force and United States Armed Forces;\n       (2) an integral part of the successful accomplishment of \n     the U.S. objective in Bosnia and Herzegovina in deploying and \n     withdrawing United States Armed Forces is the establishment \n     of a military balance which enables the Federation of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina to provide for its own defense without \n     depending on U.S. or other outside forces; and\n       (3) the United States will lead an immediate international \n     effort, separate and apart from the NATO Implementation Force \n     and consistent with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1021 and the General Framework Agreement and \n     Associated Annexes, to provide equipment, arms, training and \n     related logistics assistance of the highest possible quality \n     to ensure the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina can \n     provide for its own defense, including, as necessary, using \n     existing military drawdown authorities and requesting such \n     additional authority as may be necessary.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT ON EFFORTS TO ENABLE THE FEDERATION OF BOSNIA \n                   AND HERZEGOVINA TO PROVIDE FOR ITS OWN DEFENSE.\n\n       Within 30 days after enactment, the President shall submit \n     a detailed report on his plan to assist the Federation of \n     Bosnia to provide for its own defense, including the role of \n     the United States and other countries in providing such \n     assistance. Such report shall include an evaluation of the \n     defense needs of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     including, to the maximum extent possible:\n       (a) the types and quantities of arms, spare parts, and \n     logistics support required to establish a stable military \n     balance prior to the withdrawal of United States Armed \n     Forces;\n       (b) the nature and scope of training to be provided;\n       (c) a detailed description of the past, present and future \n     U.S. role in ensuring that the Federation of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina is provided as rapidly as possible with \n     equipment, training, arms and related logistic assistance of \n     the highest possible quality;\n       (d) administration plans to use existing military drawdown \n     authority, and other assistance authorities pursuant to \n     section 2(b)(3); and\n       (e) specific or anticipated commitments by third countries \n     to provide arms, equipment or training to the Federation of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may \n     contain a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS ON MILITARY ASPECTS OF \n                   IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Thirty days after enactment, and at least once every 60 \n     days thereafter, the President shall submit to the Congress a \n     report on the status of the deployment of United States Armed \n     Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including a detailed \n     description of:\n       (1) criteria for determining success for the deployment;\n       (2) the military mission and objectives;\n       (3) milestone for measuring progress in achieving the \n     mission and objectives;\n       (4) command arrangements for United State Armed Forces;\n       (5) the rules of engagement for United States Armed Forces;\n       (6) the multilateral composition of forces in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       (7) the status of compliance by all parties with the \n     General Framework Agreement and associated Annexes, including \n     Article III of Annex 1-A concerning the withdrawal of foreign \n     forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (8) all incremental costs of the Department of Defense and \n     any costs incurred by other \n\n[[Page S18513]]\n     federal agencies, for the deployment of United States Armed Forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, including support for the NATO \n     Implementation Force;\n       (9) the exit strategy to provide for complete withdrawal of \n     United States Armed Forces in the NATO Implementation Force, \n     including an estimated date of completion; and\n       (10) a description of progress toward enabling the \n     Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to provide for its own \n     defense.\n       (b) Such reports shall include a description of any changes \n     in the areas listed in (a) through (a)(10) since the previous \n     report, if applicable, and shall be submitted in unclassified \n     form, buy may contain a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, in recent weeks I have spent a great deal \nof time thinking about Bosnia. I have been to hearings and briefings. I \nhave consulted with experts. I have had many discussions with my \ncolleagues and my constituents. One month ago, I even went to Sarajevo \nand Tuzla myself to see the conditions our soldiers would face there.\n  Since my return, I have taken to the floor of the Senate many times, \nand used every public opportunity, to state my opposition to the \nPresident's imminent deployment of ground troops to Bosnia. In the days \nsince the conclusion of the Proximity Peace Talks in Dayton, I have \nalso spoken out against any conditional support of this deployment \ncoming from the Congress. The decision to intervene on the ground in \nBosnia is a bad idea, Mr. President, and while I will always support \nour soldiers wherever they are sent, I want no part of this decision.\n  My conviction that the administration's intention to put troops in \nharm's way in Bosnia is a huge mistake rests on three broad arguments. \nFirst, and above all, the conflict in Bosnia poses no real threat to \nvital American interests--simply put, there is nothing in Bosnia that \nAmericans should die for. Second, the Dayton talks have produced a \nfalse peace that is inherently unstable and politically doomed. \nFinally, the implementation force [I-For] plan is self-contradictory \nand hopelessly optimistic, and will expose our soldiers to unreasonable \nrisks even as they diligently pursue its unrealistic objectives.\n\n\n                     What interests are threatened?\n\n  The administration has repeatedly argued that two vital interests are \nat stake in the conflict in Bosnia. If we don't intervene now, they \nsay, the war will widen to a point where it threatens all of Europe. If \nthe U.S. does not lead NATO in intervention, they say, both the NATO \nalliance and U.S. leadership of it will be at risk.\n  The President is correct when he says that preserving security in \nEurope, and maintaining American leadership of NATO, are vital American \ninterests. But it is one thing to refer to vital interests, and another \nto claim that they are really threatened by the conflict in Bosnia. I \ndo not think they are. The administration asserts that the war in \nBosnia will spread throughout Central Europe. But where is the evidence \nthat this conflict threatens Bosnia's neighbors? Local countries like \nItaly, Hungary, and Austria do not seem concerned.\n  The President has often referred to previous European wars in this \ncentury. But comparing this war to either of the world wars--and \nlikening those of us who oppose United States involvement in Bosnia to \n1930's-style isolationists--is absurd. It shows a profound \nmisunderstanding of history, and of the roots of those conflicts. World \nWar I began in the Balkans because the world powers took sides in a \nBalkan war, not because they kept at a safe distance. What the Clinton \nadministration is doing looks a lot more like taking sides. As for \nWorld War II, neither Serbia, Bosnia, nor Croatia are anything like \nNazi Germany, in terms of ambition, population, industrial strength, \nmilitary power, or anything else. They are focused on each other, not \non external aggression.\n  The Balkan war has not spread in the past 4 years, and it shows no \nsigns of spreading. So when the President states that stability in \nEurope is a vital American interest, he is right. But when he says that \nEuropean security is threatened in Bosnia, he is wrong.\n  The only other vital interest the administration refers to is that of \npreserving our leadership of the NATO alliance. Mr. President, I \nbelieve in NATO. It has served us well, and because there are still \npotential threats to European security, we must enhance and even expand \nit. But right now, the American people are divided on the question of \nNATO's importance. Many wonder if the alliance has outlived its \nusefulness. How does the administration expect Americans to feel about \nNATO when we get bogged down in a NATO mission in Bosnia? They will \nview every body bag as one more reason to get out of the alliance once \nand for all. They will ask: ``This is why we are a part of NATO?'' And \nthey will be much less willing to act when a real threat to Europe \ncomes along. There are still real threats to Europe out there, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Dragging--or being dragged by--the alliance into a conflict for which \nit was not designed and for which it is not suited is not leadership. \nNATO still has a viable mission, but not one of intervening in a nasty \nBalkan civil war that poses no demonstrable threat to European \nsecurity. Why should we risk the inevitable conflicts with our NATO \npartners that will result when we all start taking casualties in a \nplace where no one really wanted to be in the first place?\n  And why, if this is so important to NATO, should Russia--whose \nunpredictable future is one of the principal reasons for NATO's \ncontinued existence--be included so completely? Why would we go out of \nour way to include Russian forces with our own, when their natural \nsympathies lie with the Serbs that we will be trying to disarm, the \nSerbs we were bombing just a few weeks ago? We have been told by the \n\n[[Page S18516]]\nadministration that we would be evenhanded in our actions in Bosnia, \nbut I was told by an administration official not long ago that the \nBosnians were our first priority. But Russia's first priority will \ncertainly be the Serbs.\n  Not only will this forced alliance with Russia bring Russian troops \ninto Central Europe for the first time since World War II; it will \ncreate the potential for misunderstandings and conflict with Russian \nforces that we have not seen since the Berlin Wall came down--all in \nthe name of preserving European security.\n  Mr. President, I repeat--I support NATO. If and when this conflict \ntruly threatens Greece and Turkey, or any of our other NATO allies, I \nwill support action to contain it. But the administration proposes not \nto contain the conflict, but to jump right into the middle of it. If \nNATO is to become a rationale for America intervening in civil wars in \nstates that are not even members of the alliance, then I say we should \ndisband the alliance tomorrow.\n\n\n           What kind of ``peace'' are we trying to implement?\n\n  Mr. President, in all the discussion of the implementation force, \nmany people have lost sight of how shaky the agreement reached in \nDayton is itself. Regardless of our interests in Bosnia, or our concern \nfor the victims of the war there, the NATO force is being sent to \nBosnia to implement what I believe is a fatally flawed agreement, one \nnot likely to survive without the continued presence of large numbers \nof NATO troops. Let me quote at length from a study by John Hillen of \nThe Heritage Foundation, dated November 30, 1995, and titled \n``Questioning The Bosnia Peace Plan'':\n\n       Is a bifurcated Bosnian state a realistic and sustainable \n     political entity? The Bosnian peace accord proposes a Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina that has the appearance of a single state, but is \n     in fact based on two very separate political entities--The \n     Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb \n     Republic. In order for the central organs of Bosnia to \n     actually function as intended, the two separate entities of \n     Bosnia will have to show the most extraordinary goodwill and \n     cooperation towards each other, qualities that have never \n     before been in evidence in Bosnia.\n       Many experienced diplomats have expressed skepticism about \n     the political viability of this Bosnian state and the \n     realistic chances of its survival as a centrally governed and \n     coherent nation. * * * Stephen Cambone of the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies noted that ``any \n     agreement reached in 20 days over issues that have been \n     fiercely fought over for more than four years is fraught with \n     compromises and internal flaws.'' Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the \n     Brookings Institution noted that the accord has ``a lot of \n     loose ends'' and ``many ways in which it could unravel.'' In \n     short, the accord is diplomatically enchanting but \n     realistically impractical.\n       Much of this skepticism over the accord is rooted in the \n     fact that the accord does not address fundamental issues of \n     sovereignty and ethnic self-determination. Instead, it \n     freezes those unresolved issues in place and offers up an \n     elaborate power sharing agreement for a Bosnian central \n     government. However, it will be difficult for a contrived \n     central government to replace the bonds of loyalty, \n     authority, and legitimacy that currently exist between \n     Bosnian Croats and Croatia and Bosnian Serbs and Serbia. \n     Those existing bonds are rooted in centuries of political, \n     ethnic, and cultural identity and are sure to prove stronger \n     than bonds to a hastily fabricated central government. * * *\n       If history is any guide, this agreement does not stand much \n     chance of lasting. In Cyprus in 1964, international \n     negotiators reached a similar agreement between Turkish and \n     Greek Cypriots. Much like the Bosnian agreement, the doomed \n     Cyprus accord attempted to replace bonds to the ``parent \n     entities'' for both sides (Greece and Turkey) with an \n     unworkable central executive and ethnically aligned \n     parliamentary blocs. This ensured continued intractability \n     except in the event of the most extraordinary goodwill. This \n     structure never worked because it never addressed the \n     fundamental fears and aspirations of the warring factions and \n     was completely predicated on a diplomatic fantasy: the hopes \n     for a degree of cooperation that had never been present in \n     Cyprus. After 10 years of sporadic fighting and instability \n     under this makeshift arrangement, Turkey invaded the island, \n     partitioned Cyprus, and put an end to the ephemeral peace; an \n     imposed peace that was never locally supported. UN \n     peacekeepers have been in Cyprus for over 30 years.\n       The same pattern can be expected in Bosnia. How can an \n     imposed peace that does not reflect political realities or \n     the basic concerns of the warring factions hope to survive \n     except by the continued enforcement of thousands of NATO and \n     American troops? The hastily concluded Bosnian peace accord \n     is, by necessity, a weak plan. The weakness is inherent \n     because the accord does not address the fundamental issues \n     that caused the parties to go to war in the first place. It \n     is, at best, a cease-fire that can only work under the \n     continued stewardship of 60,000 heavily armed NATO combat \n     troops.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my view that, in addition to finding threats to \nvital interests in the Balkans where there are none, the President is \nputting U.S. prestige on the line to implement a peace plan that has \nvery little chance of succeeding in the long run even if everything \ngoes well for a year.\n\n\n                   The real risks to American troops\n\n  Maybe the most troubling thing about the Administration's approach to \nthe Balkans is its confidence that it will be able to control the \nconflict after it jumps in with both feet. The President speaks of a \n``limited, focused'' mission; he tells us that we are ``not fighting a \nwar.'' Then why are we sending more than 60,000 troops, reinforced with \ntanks, artillery, and airpower? What of this talk of ``overwhelming \nforce'' and ``robust rules of engagement?'' Just what is ``overwhelming \nforce'' when you are fighting against landmines? What are ``robust \nrules of engagement'' when you are fighting snipers --an airstrike on \nthe village where you think the shot came from? Mr. President, I remind \nmy colleagues that we had robust rules of engagement and overwhelming \nforce in Vietnam, and they did not work in the end. I think that it is \nutter nonsense to apply these concepts to Bosnia.\n  Regardless of any paper agreement signed in Dayton, there are those \nin Bosnia for whom continued fighting is a better deal. There are those \nwho are profiting from the war as bandits or on the black market. There \nare those who are used to getting their way with guns; for them this \nwar is about money, not ethnicity; one NATO commander told me that they \nhad found cases where Serbs were selling black market ammunition to \nMuslims! What about those who will be displaced from their homes by the \nDayton agreement, who will not willingly leave? What about those who \nhave been displaced--there are up to three million refugees in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina--for whom peace means ``going home,'' but who will not be \nallowed to return as the result of the agreement? What about fighters \nwho are demobilized as a result of the treaty, but cannot find jobs \nbecause the economy has been ruined? And those who just miss the power \nof a rifle? While I was in Tuzla last month, the commanding general of \nUN Sector Northeast, General Haukland, told me that there will be \ncriminality and gangsterism when troops are demobilized. Mr. President, \nwhat about those who have a score to settle after four years of brutal \nwar? One thing is certain, Mr. President--there are a lot of people in \nBosnia who may be tempted to shoot at Americans, regardless of our \n``overwhelming force'' and ``robust rules of engagement.''\n\n\n                         A long-term commitment\n\n  On October 17, 1995, Secretary of Defense Perry told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee: ``The U.S. has vital political, economic, and \nsecurity interests in Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens those \ninterests, and the U.S. vital security interest is served by stopping \nthis war.'' At the same hearing, Secretary Perry states the \nadministration's commitment to bringing our troops home in \napproximately one year.\n  But the Administration cannot have it both ways. President Clinton \ncannot say that our vital interests are threatened in Bosnia, and at \nthe same time pledge that we will be out of Bosnia in about a year. If \ntwo vital interests--European security and the NATO alliance--are truly \nthreatened in Bosnia, how can there be a one-year statute of \nlimitations on our response? Since when are American vital interests \nonly worth one year's commitment?\n  The Administration has also said that United States troops will leave \nBosnia if the peace agreement is violated and conflict resumes. In \nshort, their plan claims to be defending a vital interest, but promises \nthat we will leave if enough people shoot at us, or when the 12-month \nclock runs out. But if conflict in Bosnia really threatens a vital U.S. \ninterest, are they not committed to ending that conflict no matter what \nit takes, or how long it takes? Is that not what ``vital interest'' \nmeans? Mr. President, if the administration can tell us that IFOR will \nleave in about a year, no matter what, then there must not be much of a \n\n\n[[Page S18517]]\nthreat or much of a vital interest. If there are vital interests at \nstake, the Administration should be honest and tell the American people \nthat we are committed to Bosnia for the long haul.\n  If I were sending one of my sons to Bosnia, I would want to know that \nhis life was being put on the line to accomplish something important, \nsomething worth doing at any cost, and something that the American \npeople stood firmly behind. But at best, the Dayton plan and IFOR will \nbring a few months' respite to the people of Bosnia. When the war \nresumes after we leave, or if ``systemic violations'' force us out, \nthen the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Americans who died trying to \nimpose a token peace in an artificial country will truly have been \nwasted.\n  Vital interests are the only thing we should ask our soldiers to die \nfor. When U.S. vital interests at stake, the American people and our \ntroops alike will tolerate things going badly for a while. They will \nstay the course. If there were vital interests at stake in Bosnia, the \nPresident would not be giving us all of these details about rules of \nengagement, exit strategies, and time limits--he would not have to.\n  Mr. President, administration officials in Washington seem to be the \nonly people who think we can finish this operation in a year. Not one \nmilitary or diplomatic person I spoke with on my trip, not a single \nU.S., NATO, or U.N. commander, thought that peace in Bosnia could be \nachieved in anything close to 12 months. Given the forbidding \ngeography, harsh winter climate, and wholesale destruction in Bosnia, \nit will be months before even modest degree of stability could be \nrestored, even if everyone cooperates fully. The UN commander in Tuzla, \nGeneral Haukland of Norway, described a one-year presence as a hand in \nwater--when you take it out, nothing has changed. In Balkan history, a \nyear is no time at all.\n  The simple truth, Mr. President, is that the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is about to become America's pet country. The United States \nof America is going to own Bosnia and all of her problems just as soon \nas the 1st Armored Division sets up in Tuzla. Does anyone really \nbelieve that we will leave Bosnia in a year if the threat to her \nstability remains? Does anyone really believe, after arming, training, \nand equipping the Bosnian Army for a year, that we will stand by and \nwatch if our pet army is on the verge of defeat? Of course not; if \nBosnia is as important as the Administration says it is, we will stay \nin Bosnia as long as we have to. We have already employed airstrikes \nagainst the Serbs; we will do so again if Bosnia is threatened again. I \nsay to my colleagues--we are on the verge of what may be a very long \ncommitment.\n  So Mr. President, I have said that I will resist this plan with all \nof my power, and I will do so down to the wire. I think the peace is \nfalse, the plan is naive, and the risk to our troops unrealistically \nhigh. There is only one way to express these conclusions: I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Dole-McCain Resolution of conditional support, \nand to support the Hutchison-Inhofe Resolution opposing the deployment \nof ground troops to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a couple of observations about the \ndebate that is taking place tonight. There seems to be a lot of people \nwho are going to vote, perhaps, for the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, \nthen turn around and vote also for the Dole-McCain resolution. I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that would be a little inconsistent.\n  After looking at a final copy--and we only received a copy of the \nDole-McCain resolution a matter of a couple of hours ago in its final \nversion--I cannot see that it narrows the mission at all. It starts off \nby saying, ``Before acting, pursuant to the resolution, the President \nshall make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate his determination. . .''--and \nthen they cover a number of things that they want the President to \ncertify. For example, the Dole-McCain resolution says: ``The mission \nwill be limited to the implementation of the military provisions of the \nDayton agreement.''\n  But the administration has already, in effect, certified this: \nSecretary Christopher said, on December 1: ``Let me assure you that \nIFOR's mission is well-defined and limited. Our troops will enforce the \nmilitary aspects of the agreement. They will not be asked to guarantee \nthe success of democracy or reconstruction.''\n  Secretary Perry said the same thing: ``The mission of IFOR is to \noversee and enforce the implementation of the military aspects of the \npeace agreement.'' That is exactly the same as we find in the Dole-\nMcCain amendment.\n  Second, Dole-McCain says: ``An integral part of the successful \naccomplishment of the objective is the establishment of military \nbalance.'' This is what the administration has been saying all along. \nFor example, Secretary Christopher has said: ``We are committed to \nachieve the stable military balance with Bosnia and among the states of \nthe former Yugoslavia.''\n  In another part of the Dole-McCain resolution, it says: ``The United \nStates will lead an immediate international effort to provide \nequipment, arms, training, and related logistics assistance of the \nhighest possible quality to ensure that the Federation of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina can provide for its own defense.''\n  Again, on December 1, Secretary Christopher said: ``The Armed Forces \nin the Federation will need to obtain some equipment and training in \norder to establish an effective self-defense capability. As for our \npart, the United States will ensure that the Federation Armed Forces \nreceive the necessary assistance.''\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is I think it is inconsistent for \nsomeone to vote for Hutchison-Inhofe and turn around and vote for Dole-\nMcCain. Dole-McCain simply requires the President to say what he has \nbeen saying all along. Is that supposed to narrow the mission? Is that \nsupposed to reassure us?\n  Second, Mr. President, I was listening very attentively to the very \nknowledgeable and scholarly Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, \ntalking about the constitutional rights of the President and the \nresponsibilities of the President and also the constitutional rights of \nCongress. I thought, all the way through, that he was coming to the \nconclusion that the President cannot do what he has already done. At \nleast that is what I was inferring from his remarks. But I gather he \nwill support the President by voting for Dole-McCain.\n  I did hear several other valuable arguments during the course of the \nday. Senator Feingold came out with some very strong constitutional \narguments that would lead one to believe that the President has indeed \noverstepped his powers. He referred to an article by Louis Fisher, \nwhich I later made a part of this Record. He says: ``The framers knew \nthat the British King could use military force against other countries \nwithout legislative involvement. They gave to Congress the \nresponsibility for deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as \nCommander in Chief, was left with the power to repel sudden attacks.''\n  So that qualifies what the President is able to do within his \nconstitutional rights. We made that a part of the Record. In sitting \nand listening to the debate today--and I stayed in the Chamber the \nentire day, as I feel this is the most critical vote we will have, \nprobably, at least in the last year or 2, and I wanted to hear \neveryone's viewpoint. I think the distinguished Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Heflin, talked at some length about how this should be a \nEuropean mission. I have said over and over again that maybe we have a \nresponsibility--and I am not going to debate that because everybody is \nassuming that we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of \nNATO, to respond in some way to the atrocities that have taken place. I \nhave suggested that there are atrocities taking place all over the \nworld. Where do you draw the line? Do you draw it here? Or are we, in \nfact, doing this because the President, in February 1993, made a \nstatement that he was going to send ground troops in?\n  But the Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, talked about the fact \nthat this should be a European mission. Nobody will deny that it is \nmore a responsibility of Europe than it is the United States. Yet, we \ntalk about the contribution that our NATO partners are making to this. \n\n[[Page S18518]]\n\n  Germany, who is in the backyard of the Balkans, is sending a total of \n4,000 troops, and they debated it in their legislative body before \nagreeing to do that. We did not have time to debate it before we did \nit. Yet, we are talking about sending five times the troops that \nGermany is sending.\n  I listened very carefully while several people on the floor made \npoints. I want to briefly respond to a couple of them. First of all, as \nfar as our troops being supported, I think we all have made it \nabundantly clear that we in this body, as well as the other body, are \nsupporting our troops, not just here, but all around the world. What \ngreater support could there be for our troops than by not sending them \ninto this hostile area to start with? That is real support of the \ntroops.\n  That is what we are trying to do with the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution--make it abundantly clear that our troops should not have to \nbe over there. When they are over there--if, in fact, they end up in a \nmass deployment--yes, we will support our troops all the way. I think \nthat has been said over and over again. I do not think anybody is going \nto deny that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, made a very good \npoint. What we are trying to do is state our opposition to this before \nit gets started.\n  You see, the troops are not deployed yet. Yes, there are some there. \nWe will support those. Those are the advance troops, logistic troops, \nbut the mass deployment that the President has promised immediately \nafter the signing of this agreement in Paris has not yet taken place. \nSo this debate is taking place now, before the mass deployment has \ntaken place.\n  The junior Senator from California commented in her remarks that this \ndeployment was acceptable ``as long as it remains a peacekeeping \nmission.'' I suggest to the junior Senator from California it is not a \npeacekeeping mission now. We keep hearing about peacekeeping as if \nthere is currently peace to keep. There is a cease-fire in effect. But \nI have been in parts of Bosnia during this cease-fire when the gunfire \nwas going off; in some parts of the northeast sector, near Tuzla, they \ndo not even know there is a cease-fire. The title that we are giving \nourselves now, giving to I-FoR, is ``peace implementation.'' There is a \nbig difference between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace \nimplementation means we do not have peace now but we will implement it. \nThat is a totally different mission.\n  Mission creep has already crept into this, Mr. President. The exit \nstrategy seems to be to keep peace for a year, and then leave. As the \njunior Senator from California said, all we have to do is keep peace \nfor a year and we are out of there. She is saying exactly what \nSecretary Christopher said, exactly what General Shalikashvili said as \nrecently as last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nsaying it is inconceivable we will not be out of there in a year.\n  During my visit with the Norwegian general who commands the U.N.'s \nnortheast sector, in the Tuzla area, I mentioned ``12 months,'' he \nsmiled and said, ``You mean 12 years.'' And when we talked about 12 \nmonths he said, ``Apparently the American people do not understand the \nway the people in that region think, the Serbs, the Croats, and the \nMoslems. Their conception of time is totally different.'' He used an \nanalogy I have used on the floor. It is like putting your hand in water \nfor 12 months, you look and take your hand out and nothing has \nhappened. When we leave the war will start again. If they know we will \nbe gone in a year, which we have said we will be--the President has \nreaffirmed that as recently as last week, and it was reaffirmed a week \nago by Secretary of Defense Perry--what will they do? Lay low for a \nyear and then come back out swinging. By the way, Mr. President, the \ncombatants in this conflict have a habit of laying low every winter.\n  I do not think I have ever in my life--and I did serve in the Armed \nForces--I do not ever remember a time in our Nation's history or in the \nhistory of warfare where we went into a hostile area and then our exit \nstrategy was geared to time, instead of being geared to events. But \nthat is exactly what we are proposing to do here.\n  The senior Senator from California was talking about ``A far greater \nrisk in doing nothing than in sending our troops.'' I suggest that it \nis not quite that easy. It would be easy if we were able to pass the \nHutchison-Inhofe resolution and the President would look at this and \nsay clearly we do not have Congress behind sending ground troops in but \nwe have a responsibility to NATO, we have a responsibility to Bosnia. \nIf he felt that way he could do it and we could do it through air \npower. We have already been there with airstrikes. We know that works. \nWe could lift the arms embargo.\n  Sure, our European partners do not want us to do that. They want us \non the ground there. People talk about how well received our President \nwas over in Europe. I think if I lived in Europe I would be receiving \nhim well, too. He is coming over and proposing that we fight their \nbattle for them. I suggest that there are other alternatives.\n  Senator Ashcroft from Missouri was talking about the speech that the \nPresident made in 1993 and suggested something I had not thought about. \nMaybe the President made the commitment of United States ground troops \nback in February 1993 without having been really apprised of the \nsituation in Bosnia, the deep hostility, the history of that area, the \nhistory of World War I, World War II, the 500-year-old civil war, and \nwhat has been going on over there for many years.\n  The Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, was articulate and \noutspoken when he talked about the different parties there. I think he \nreferred to Milosevic as someone who was perhaps a war criminal, and \ncertainly he talked about the others who had actually been indicted for \nwar crimes. Lastly, it was Senator Kohl who said that we either support \npeace or we do not. I think there are many ways where we can offer our \nsupport without doing it on the ground. I will mention one other thing \nthat the Senator from North Carolina mentioned when he talked about the \nfact that the bridges and the roads in that sector--from Hungary down \nsouth through Tuzla, down toward Sarajevo, in the area that goes from \nthe Posavina corridor down to Tuzla--that the roads would not \naccommodate an M-1 tank. We found out when we were over there that \nthere is only one bridge in that entire area that they say can handle \nit structurally. The Americans will have to come in and rebuild the \nbridges, rebuild the roads, and if they do not they will start a civil \nwar because the people are upset for us coming in and messing up the \nexisting roads with our tanks. This came from the people now in \ncommand, the U.N. people in the northeast sector.\n  The most profound thing I have heard on the floor of the Senate today \ncame from the very distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats. \nHe asked the question, ``Have we so squandered American leadership that \nwe must buy it back with American lives?'' I think this puts it in \nperspective. If we are wanting to prove to someone that we have this \nleadership, that we must lead and whatever NATO decides to do is in the \nbest interest of the allies and that we must blindly go along with \nthem, do we do this at the risk of lives?\n  On October 17 we asked the question of Secretary Christopher and \nSecretary Perry. This was after Gen. Michael Rose made the statement if \nthe Americans get into this war they will sustain more losses than they \ndid during the Persian Gulf war, where we lost a total of 390 lives.\n  I asked the question, is your mission here worth 400 or more lives? \nSecretary Christopher said yes; Secretary Perry said yes; General \nShalikashvili said yes. I think that is a defining difference between \nthe administration's view and my own.\n  I think that we need to at least acknowledge this body is already on \nrecord opposing what President Clinton is about to do. So it is not a \nmatter of waiting until the last minute, until the last hour. Over a \nmonth ago we passed a sense-of-the-Congress amendment in both the House \nand Senate, attached to the Defense appropriations bill by Senator \nGregg: ``It is the sense of Congress that none of the funds available \nfor the Department of Defense should be obligated or exploited for the \ndeployment or participation of the United States Armed Forces in any \npeacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina * * *.'' \n\n[[Page S18519]]\n\n  This opposition is not something we are coming up with today for the \nfirst time. The Senate is already on record.\n  Lastly, let me go over some of the things that were talked about on \nthe floor today in terms of danger. I think we are kind of trying to \nsoften this thing, trying to gloss over the dangers. Some say we will \ngo over and everyone will be kissing the American flag and everyone \nwill love us because we brought peace into the Balkans. If you stop and \nlook, and this came out of the Defense News, of the various elements \nover there, the Croats have 80,000 soldiers; the Croatian Serbs 50,000; \nSerbia, 125,000; Bosnia, 110,000; Bosnian Serbs, 80,000; Bosnian \nCroats, 50,000. That is not even talking about the rogue elements, and \nthere are some nine rogue elements that are over there.\n  It is so convoluted it reminds me of the letter that came back from \none of our warriors who lost his life in Somalia. It was the son of \nCaptain James Smith, who read me the letter of his son. His son was \nCpl. Jim Smith who lost his life. Capt. Jim Smith lost his leg in \nVietnam and his son lost his life in Somalia. His was one of those \ncorpses dragged through the street in Mogadishu. His last letter said: \nDad, we cannot tell who our friends are and who they are not. We cannot \ntell the difference.\n\n  I suggest that is exactly the situation that we have here. Many \npeople have talked about the fact that we are going to have just 20,000 \nor 25,000 troops over there. I hope no one is kidding themselves, \ndeluding themselves thinking that is all we are going to have.\n  There was an article in the Defense News that gave a very persuasive \nargument that we would end up with a total NATO force of 240,000 \ntroops. Keeping our ratio, that would be 80,000 Americans who will be \ninvolved over there.\n  Go back and read your history. British Prime Minister Disraeli, over \n100 years ago, who had been observing the battles over there, said, \n``It will take a half-million troops to bring peace to the Balkans.''\n  I think, when we look at the timeframe of 12 months--that is \nfictitious. It is not going to happen. The 20,000 troops, that is not \ngoing to happen. The mission is peacekeeping--that already is not \nhappening, it is now peace implementation. We are kidding ourselves.\n  We have already had a vote on H.R. 2606. That was a very strong vote, \neven though there were just 22 who voted in favor of it. Those are the \npeople who really feel the strongest about not sending troops into that \narea. But we are going to have another record vote. That record vote is \ngoing to take place this evening.\n  We are going to have two record votes. When you have the first vote \non the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution, think very carefully. Because if \nyou vote for that, as I said when I opened these remarks, you cannot \nturn around and vote for the Dole-McCain resolution because they are \ninconsistent with each other. This is the last opportunity that the \nSenators who are here and will be voting tonight will have to get on \nrecord. This is their last shot, the last chance they have to say no, \nwe should not send ground troops into Bosnia.\n  I do not think it is possible for anyone to understand the hostility \nof the area if he or she has not been up there to Tuzla where our \ntroops will go. To the best of my knowledge, only two Members of \nCongress have been up there, Senator Hank Brown from Colorado and \nmyself. When we had a meeting the other day in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I discovered that even Secretary Perry had not been \nup there, Secretary Christopher had not been up there, General \nShalikashvili had not been up there, and certainly President Clinton \nhas not been up there.\n  I cannot imagine that they would be willing to take chances in a \nhostile area without going up and looking at it. I can tell you \nfirsthand, and I went over much of that area in a helicopter not more \nthan 100 feet off the treetops with Gen. Rupert Smith, a British \ngeneral. We looked down and for the first time we could realize how \nMarshal Tito was able to hold off the very best that Hitler had on a \nratio of 1 to 8, because of the unique environment, the very hostile \nand forbidding environment.\n  Mr. President, this is going to be probably the most significant vote \nthat many Members of this body will cast. It is going to be tonight. I \nwould like to have them think long and hard. Because if you vote for--\nif you vote against the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution and vote for the \nDole-McCain resolution, you are saying we agree with the basic policy \nof sending ground troops.\n  You see, I think everybody knows now, we can support our troops and \nnot support the policy. That is an easy thing to do. We all support our \ntroops. The greatest support we could give our troops is to not to \ndeploy them into that warring area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 4 years of mass executions, mass rape, \nmass murders, brutal ethnic cleansing, sieges against civilians, terror \ncampaigns, atrocities, and genocide not seen in Europe since the end of \nWorld War II--\\1/4\\-million people dead, 3 million people in the region \nrefugees, and if we were to think about this in terms of our \npopulation, that would be the equivalent of 170 million American \nrefugees.\n  The people of Bosnia deserve relief from years of armed conflict, \nrelief from displacement, relief from malnutrition and hunger, relief \nfrom winters without heat or electricity, relief from war crimes and, \nyes, relief from the indifference of the rest of the world.\n  I traveled to the former Yugoslavia by myself 2 years ago. I went \nwith my legislative assistant, Colin McGinnis. I visited with people in \nthe refugee camps, and I saw enough pain and enough misery to last me \nfor a lifetime. The Dayton agreement is the best and perhaps it is the \nlast chance for peace in the region. That is why I intend to support \nit.\n  While I am speaking on the floor, I would like to express my thanks \nand my love to the family of three American diplomats killed in Bosnia \nwhile serving the cause of peace.\n  Our proper constitutional role as Senators and Representatives is to \nnot give broad grants of authority to any President. I have talked to \nexperts outside the Congress, had many briefings from people in the \nadministration, met with people in the former Yugoslavia, and I have \ntried to the best of my ability to make the best decision for my \ncountry and for the world that I live in. I believe it is our \nresponsibility to make sure the objectives are limited. I believe it is \nour responsibility to insist on as much clarity as possible.\n  There are several reserve units going from Minnesota, and, as a \nSenator, I owe those families. It is my responsibility to make sure \nthat everything is done that can be done to preserve their safety and \nthe safety of all of our soldiers who are there--not to go to war, as I \nlisten to the Senator from Oklahoma, but are there to secure a peace.\n  Do I have concerns? You bet I have concerns. I do not think the arms \ncontrol provisions of this agreement are very strong. I worry about the \ninternational police provisions; I think they are weak. I believe that \nthere should have been, in the Dayton agreement, really a clear \nunderstanding--we keep talking about this 1-year time agreement--that \nthe Europeans are a part of the transition and that they assume the \nresponsibility for peacekeeping so that when we leave after a year or \nthereabouts, in fact the presence of NATO is there. Because it is not \nclear to me that we will be able to accomplish our objectives in that \nperiod of time.\n\n  Do I worry? You bet I worry. I have been up at night trying to decide \nwhat the right decision would be. I worry about the landmines. I have \nhad briefings from our military, and there are reasons for all of us to \nworry. Our soldiers are trained, they have been doing the training in \nGermany, but I worry about that. I worry about depending on Milosevic. \nI think Milosevic is a war criminal. And when I hear Milosevic has made \nthis commitment and that commitment, it makes me nervous.\n  I wonder what the meaning is when General Mladic says he has not \nagreed to this agreement. Does he go to the hills with his soldiers? I \nworry about that as well.\n  This has been a difficult decision for me, but in the end I really \nbelieve that we are doing the right thing as a nation. In the end, I \nthink the alternative \n\n[[Page S18520]]\nto no peacekeeping force there--and there will be no peacekeeping force \nand there will be no agreement if we are not a part of that force--will \nbe a living hell. The alternative, I say to my colleagues, will be a \nliving hell: More genocide, more rape, more murder, more mass \nexecutions in Bosnia. And it could be a war that spreads to Central \nEurope.\n  We are there to do the right thing. I believe that. I believe that \nfor our children. I believe that for my children.\n  In the end, I stand on the side of hope, hope for an end to this \nconflict, hope for an end to its attendant horrors, hope for a better \nworld that we live in, hope for the peoples of that region, hope for an \nend to the bitter ethnic divisions, hope for an end to the religious \nhatred.\n  I believe that we, therefore, in casting this vote in supporting our \nsoldiers and in supporting this peacekeeping mission--I believe we cast \nthe right vote. That is why I will vote for the Dole-McCain resolution, \nand that is why I am in opposition to the Inhofe-Hutchison resolution.\n  Mr. President, on the day before the formal signing of the Paris \nPeace Agreement on Bosnia, we are gathered here for a historic debate. \nI want to share with my colleagues my views on the deployment of United \nStates peacekeepers to Bosnia to participate in the NATO peacekeeping \nmission there.\n  Designed to help put an end to the violence that has cost so many \nlives and so much suffering over the last 4 years, it offers real hope \nfor peace. After much thought, I have come to a simple conclusion. With \nU.S. participation in the NATO peace effort, there is a real chance for \na durable peace that could break the brutal cycle of violence there. \nWithout our participation, we face an almost certain resumption of the \nfighting, and possibly a wider Balkan war.\n  This war has taken a horrible toll, not only on the people of the \nregion, but also on the conscience of people everywhere who have \nwatched it unfold in all its horror on their TV screens, and struggled \nto figure out a way to help end it.\n  For 4 years the people of Bosnia have suffered some of the worst \natrocities in Europe: mass executions, mass rapes, brutal ethnic \ncleansing, sieges against innocent civilian populations, and terror \ncampaigns. Atrocities we have not seen since the end of WW II.\n  So far, the war there has left a quarter of a million dead, and \nnearly 3 million people from the region refugees, expelled from their \nhomes and villages in brutal campaigns of ethnic cleansing. Three \nmillion refugees. Think of that. If such a war were fought here in the \nUnited States, by population share that would be equal to about 170 \nmillion American refugees.\n  The people of Bosnia deserve immediate relief from the years of armed \nconflict, displacement, malnutrition and hunger, winters without heat \nor electricity, war crimes, and at times indifference by the rest of \nthe world. The Dayton agreement offers a promise of such relief. I \nvisited the Balkans 2 years ago. I met many people there, including \nmany refugees who had been expelled from their homes, and who had lost \nloved ones and friends. I know the trials and horror they have \nexperienced.\n  Even in the face of these horrors, the President's decision to send \nUnited States troops to Bosnia is one of the most difficult foreign \npolicy choices our country has confronted since the end of the cold \nwar. The risks of the deployment, though I think they have been greatly \nreduced by the administration's careful planning, are real. From the \nmillions of landmines left over from the war, to irregular forces, to \nweather, to other hazards, this mission is not without its dangers.\n  But while many of us have had differing views about the proper United \nStates role in Bosnia over the past 4 years, and some of us had pressed \nfor tougher action against the Serbs for many months, there is one \nthing that is becoming more and more clear. The Dayton agreement is the \nbest, and perhaps the last, chance for peace in the region. That's why \nI intend to support it.\n\n  Full and effective implementation of this agreement offers the best \nhope to stop this brutal war, and to give the parties a chance to \nrecover, and to rebuild their cities, to rebuild their nations. After \nmonths of fruitful negotiations led by the United States, and with the \nEuropeans providing the bulk of peacekeeping forces to help monitor the \nagreement, I believe it would be a mistake for the U.S. Congress to \nsound an uncertain, quavering trumpet now regarding our commitment to \npeace in the region.\n  Through tough-minded, tenacious diplomacy, President Clinton's envoy \nRichard Holbrooke worked for many months to help the warring parties \ncraft an agreement that could bring an end to the bloodshed. He \ndeserves our praise, and our thanks--as do those three American \ndiplomats killed in Bosnia while serving the cause of peace.\n  President Clinton observed in his recent speech that the United \nStates can't be the world's policeman, but we can become involved in \ncircumstances such as this, where we have a compelling national \ninterest in maintaining the peace, where we have a chance to be \neffective, and where we have a clear duty to help.\n  Over the course of the last few weeks, I have talked with the \nPresident and with his chief foreign policy advisors, including \nSecretary of State Christopher and Secretary of Defense Perry, and \npressed them to ensure our mission was clear, limited, and governed by \nstrict rule of engagement that would allow our troops to protect \nthemselves in any circumstances. The Dayton Agreement provides for \nsweeping NATO rules of engagement that will allow U.S. forces to use \nall appropriate force to protect themselves. In the last 2 weeks, I \nhave been urging administration officials to clarify the limited, \nnarrow goals of the mission; how they intend to measure progress toward \nthose goals, and the limits they will impose on U.S. troop activity in \nthe region. I believe they have made real progress in clarifying each \nof these areas.\n  This is our proper role in Congress: to press administration \nofficials to clarify key points of their plan, ensure that objectives \nare limited and attainable, that an exit strategy is clearly laid out, \nand that planning for a post-U.S. presence upon withdrawal, composed \npresumably of Europeans, is moving forward. I believe that we have done \nthat, pressing those responsible in the administration to close some \ngaps in their thinking that will serve our troops well in the long run.\n  I have thought long and hard about this deployment and, in addition \nto my discussions with the President and his senior advisors, have \nconsulted extensively with those whom I represent in Minnesota, \nadministration officials at the working level in the Pentagon, the \nState Department, and elsewhere. I have talked with outside regional \nexperts, and others. I've talked with Minnesota military personnel who \nare being deployed to Europe. There are several reserve units from \nMinnesota whose members are being deployed to Europe, and I am aware of \nmy direct and profound responsibilities to them and to their families--\nand to the families of all our troops--to ensure that everything \npossible is done to preserve their safety.\n\n  The Dayton Agreement, especially its key military annexes, were \nclearly designed with these concerns in mind. And it has garnered broad \nsupport. It has the support of the Russians, of the U.N. Security \nCouncil, NATO, the European Union, and the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, each of whom will play a key role in its \nimplementation. It is truly a multilateral effort, of which the \nadministration should be proud.\n  But even though we played a key role in the development of this \nagreement among the parties, let us not forget one critical thing; this \nis their agreement, not ours. It was developed by the parties, not \nimposed by outsiders. They have asked other nations, including the \nUnited States, to help secure the future of that agreement.\n  And they have assured us, NATO, and the U.N. Security Council that \nthey will respect its terms, and take steps to protect our peacekeeping \nforces. Over 25 nations have responded to the call to help secure this \npeace. As the last remaining superpower, we have an obligation to join \nthem. If the current ceasefire holds, and the peace agreement is signed \ntomorrow in Paris and begins to be implemented on schedule in the next \nfew weeks, we have a duty, I believe, to help. \n\n[[Page S18521]]\n\n  I think it would be irresponsible to sit aside and allow the horrors \nthat have taken place in Bosnia to continue. Our great hope is that \nthis peace agreement might finally secure a lasting peace; we must not \nabandon that hope now by cutting off funds for our troops, or by \nrefusing to grant at least conditional support for the mission.\n  I have decided to support this peacekeeping deployment, even though I \nam fully aware of the potential risks and problems with it. For \nexample, I believe the arms control and international police provisions \nof the Dayton Agreement are weak, and must be strengthened. And they \nare being strengthened and fleshed out, by NATO planners and through \nproposals offered last weekend at the London Implementing Conference. \nIn the end, how they are implemented will make the big difference, and \nwe in Congress must monitor this carefully. The reporting requirements \nof the Dole-McCain resolution will help ensure that Congress is kept \ninformed on a formal, timely basis of developments in key areas of the \naccord's implementation, in both its military and civilian aspects.\n  Likewise, I remain somewhat concerned that the very broad NATO rules \nof engagement leave considerable room for interpretation on the part of \nNATO field commanders there about how to react when faced with violent \ncivil disturbances, hostage situations, harassment by irregular forces, \nor other similar situations. I know they do so to provide flexibility \nto our commanders in the field, but this is another area which must be \nmonitored carefully. Supervising the separation of forces, maintained \nby the parties, is one thing. But serving as local police forces is \nquite another. While I know the Dayton Agreement prohibits the latter, \nwe must be careful to ensure that the potential for any mission creep \nis strictly limited.\n  We have heard a lot of heartfelt debate today, and expressions of \nconcern about the potential for an extended, open-ended deployment. To \nthose who are worried that Bosnia could turn out to be a quagmire, I \ncan only say I have consulted as broadly as I could, weighted the risks \nas responsibly as I could, and I do not believe that is going to \nhappen. I believe the administration has built into its implementation \nplans sufficient safeguards to avoid this problem, including strict \nlimits on the areas where our troops will be, and on their mission. If \nI did believe this was a real risk, I would fiercely oppose this \ndeployment. Let there be no mistake. This will be a NATO operation, \nwith clear lines of command and rules of engagement, run by an American \ngeneral. The mission is not open-ended. Our troops will be heavily \narmed, with the power and authority to respond to any potential threats \nas forcefully as necessary.\n  Of course, there are some concerns that can never be fully met. For \nexample, I have doubts about the sincerity of Serb President Milosevic, \nand about his ability to deliver on his promises. I have even less \nconfidence in the Bosnian Serbs. I am frankly alarmed that General \nMladic has not been willing to support the agreement, that Serb \ncivilians in the Sarajevo suburbs have been so vocal in opposing it, \nand that the Bosnians have resisted cutting their ties with radical \nstates like Iran. But those doubts should not deter us from at least \nsupporting this attempt at peace; they simply offer reasons for \ncaution.\n  I have raised some of these concerns explicitly with the President \nand his advisors. I have asked tough questions of administration \nofficials about how they intend to make good on United States \ncommitments to lead an effort to provide arms and training to the \nBosnian Government while serving as neutral peacekeepers. While I have \nin the past supported lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnians, I \nbelieve that with this agreement there is a real chance to stablize the \nsituation through arms control, rather than primarily through building \nup the opposing armies.\n  That's where our emphasis should be now. Demilitarization on all \nsides, not remilitarization, is the appropriate course to follow to \nestalish a military balance between the Serbs and the Moslem-Croat \nFederation. Once a full NATO balance-of-forces assessment is complete, \nthe report required by the Dole resolution is submitted to Congress, \nand the arms build-down begins in earnest, I am hopeful that full \ncompliance with the arms control provisions of the peace agreement will \ngo a long way toward equalizing the forces. And if it does not complete \nthe task, there will be plenty of moderate Moslem nations willing to \nhelp arm, equip, and train the Bosnians to better defend themselves, as \nnecessary.\n  I have also raised questions about the criteria that will be applied \nby NATO to measure progress toward its goals, and about the timetable \nfor the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces. Administration officials \nhave provided me with all the information they could on these \nquestions. While many of us would like to know that our troops will \ncome home by next Christmas, I do not think the administration can \nrealistically provide firm assurances that that will happen, and I \nthink that it would be foolish to demand them as a condition for our \nsupport, since it could place our troops in great jeopardy if they are \npulled our prematurely.\n  I do know the President intends to have us get in, complete our \nmission, and get out, as swiftly as possible, and that General \nShalikashvili has indicated that 1 year is more than sufficient time to \naccomplish the limited military goals of the mission. Completing our \nmission should be our primary goal, not meeting some arbitrary \ntimetable that may by driven more by domestic politics than by the \nsituation on the ground in Bosnia.\n  Whether 1 year is also sufficient time to secure other, broader \ngoals, including return of refugees, free and fair elections, and \nrebuilding of war-torn Bosnia, is unlikely. I know of almost no one who \nbelieves it is possible in that timeframe. But at least this year-long \nrespite can end the violence, and start them on the road toward peace. \nI hope that we will be able to work out an agreement with out allies \nthat will provide for a much smaller, residual force that could stay \nthere longer, if needed, to monitor compliance with the accord. \nComposed largely of NATO troops from Europe, this force could begin to \nshoulder primary responsibility for the mission after 9 to 10 months. I \nhave urged the administration to explore this more vigorously, because \nI think it is key to our exit strategy in the region. I would have \npreferred that it be built into this resolution. But I am satisfied \nthat the administration has taken seriously this concern, and will take \nsteps to explore it with our allies.\n  On these and many other questions, administration officials have been \nvery forthcoming. Where they were unable to provide clear answers, for \nexample on the planned composition of a follow-on force if such a force \nwere necessary after U.S. withdrawal, they outlined for me the state of \ntheir current thinking. Frankly, there is still much work to be done by \nNATO, the U.N. Security Council, and others over the course of the next \nfew weeks and months to nail down answers to some of these key \nquestions. But overall, I am satisfied that this deployment has been \ncarefully planned and will be executed ably by our military forces. It \nis the responsible thing to do, the right thing to do. And that's why I \nintend to support it.\n  Many Americans remain skeptical of U.S. participation in this \npeacekeeping effort. I continue to believe it is critical that the \nPresident have the support of the American people and their \nrepresentatives in Congress before moving forward. And I think that as \nthis process has moved forward, and the President and his advisors have \nmade clear the limited, narrow nature of the NATO mission, more \nAmericans are being persuaded that this peacekeeping effort is the \nright thing to do.\n  Whatever we decide today, the President has already started sending \nU.S. troops to serve as advance support for the U.S. mission there. We \nmust support the troops, and their families here in the United States, \nin every way we can. This resolution expresses clearly our support for \ntheir efforts.\n  Mr. President, this has been a difficult decision for me. But in the \nend I stand on the side of hope--hope for an end to the conflict and \nits attendant horrors, hope for a better future for the peoples of that \nregion, hope for an end to the bitter ethnic and religious hatreds that \nhave engulfed the region. It is a hope tempered by realism, though, \nabout the road that lies ahead, and the potential pitfalls of this \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S18522]]\n\n  Finally, let me say this. Over the last few weeks, some have asked me \nwhy I would be willing to consider supporting this peacekeeping \ndeployment, when I opposed our going to war in the Persian Gulf. There \na host of major differences between the two situations, not least of \nwhich is that our troops were being sent to the Persian Gulf to go to \nwar; in Bosnia, they are going to secure a peace. The have been invited \nby the parties in Bosnia to secure a peace agreement, under firm \nsecurity assurances provided by the parties. I opposed the war in the \ngulf, among other reasons, because--like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Colin Powell--I believed the tough U.N.-imposed sanctions \nought to have been given more time to bite. In Bosnia, I do not believe \nthat are realistic alternatives to this peacekeeping deployment that \nhave gone untried.\n  This may be the opportunity that is needed, Mr. President, to break \nthe cycle of violence in the lands of the former Yugoslavia by helping \nto keep the sides apart for a year in order to give them some time to \nbegin putting their lives back together. Hopefully a year of peace will \nbring about something more lasting. It is my hope for the future of the \npeoples of that region that has led to me to conclude that we should \nsupport the President's action. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution opposing President Clinton sending American troops to \nBosnia, I am obliged to note that the administration's problem is that \nit lacks a coherent policy for resolving the war in the former \nYugoslavia. That is it, pure and simple.\n  A coherent policy must be based upon a clear-eyed assessment of the \nUnited States national interest in the Balkans. It must employ a means \nto address our national interest, calculated in direct proportion to \nthe threat posed to the United States. Most of all, a coherent policy \nmust have an end, a goal, a point at which we can define when the \nmission is accomplished.\n  The administration's plan has none of these elements.\n  The foundation of President Clinton's policy in Bosnia is not the \nnational interest--it is desperation. This desperation to fill the \nvacuum of American leadership in Bosnia has led the President to make a \ndisastrous decision. In a last, desperate act he is demanding that the \nU.S. military rescue his foreign policy.\n  The American people should be prepared for the possibility that \nAmerican lives will be lost any time our national interest is at stake. \nI am certain that if asked to go to war our brave men and women in \nuniform would, without hesitation, heed the President's call. I salute \nthose who would serve the Nation so readily, but I cannot and will not \nsupport the President's decision to ask them to make this sacrifice. \nThe risk to the lives of our troops far exceeds any national interest \nthe United States could possibly have--particularly as defined by \nPresident Clinton--any national interest we could possibly have in the \nBalkans.\n  The question will not go away: ``Mr. President, what precisely is \nyour goal? What is your objective in Bosnia? Is it the creation of an \ninviolable Bosnian nation?'' If so, the Dayton Agreement assuredly does \nnot accomplish that goal. The agreement--pure and simple--is the \npartitioning of a sovereign nation on ethnic lines.\n  Is Mr. Clinton's goal to provide the people of Bosnia the means of \ndefending themselves? If so, the President has so far shown no \ninclination to do so. Is it to save his own foreign policy and salvage \nhis administration's standing on the world stage? If so, it is too \nlate, and a disastrous military campaign in the Balkans can only do \nharm to the reputation and prestige of the United States far beyond \nwhat the 3 years of inaction by the administration already have.\n  The Bosnian people do not deserve war. Americans do not deserve to \ndie in support of a policy that will not bring peace to the Bosnians. \nWhat we can and must do is help the people of that nation help \nthemselves. If we truly want to guarantee lasting peace in the Balkans, \nwe need to give the Bosnian people the tools of peace: the means to \ndefend themselves from renewed Serb aggression.\n  Mr. President, more than 3 months ago I introduced legislation to \nprovide the Bosnian people with American arms and training that they \nneed to defend themselves. That legislation calls upon the \nadministration to lead an international effort to coordinate \ncontributions from those countries who wish to join in helping the \nBosnians acquire the means of self-defense.\n  I will do everything in my power to help the Bosnians acquire the \nmeans to defend themselves. But I cannot, I do not, and I will not \nsupport sending American soldiers to fight, and to die, in Bosnia for \nthe sake of an agreement that offers no more than a brief pause while \nall sides prepare for the next round of Balkan wars.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized for 9 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my qualified support \nfor the deployment of United States military personnel as part of the \nNATO force to implement the Bosnia peace plan.\n  The President has made a compelling case to the American people in \nsupport of U.S. participation in the NATO peacekeeping force. He has \nsaid that the NATO military mission will be clear, limited, and \nachievable; and that the risks to our troops will be minimized.\n  Congress has had the opportunity to go over this plan carefully, \nthrough a series of extensive briefings and hearings, which have been \nheld over the last few weeks by at least four committees. Through this \nprocess, we have gotten answers to many of our questions, but certainly \nnot all of them.\n  As the polls and phone calls reveal, the public is extremely wary \nabout this operation. They know this is a mission with an uncertain \noutcome, where American sons and daughters may lose their lives. They \nare worried that our troops will be dragged into a civil conflict, \ndespite our intentions to the contrary.\n  I have set aside extra time over the last several weeks to meet with \nand hear from constituents on this issue, many of whom have sons, \ndaughters, husbands and wives likely to be deployed in Bosnia. I have \nlistened to their fears and reservations. They are understandably \nworried--about landmines, snipers, civil disorder, undisciplined local \nfactions, hostage taking, and other risks inherent in this mission.\n  And like most Americans, my constituents wonder aloud why the nations \nof Europe have not been able to solve this crisis on their own. Knowing \nhow pressing the needs are here at home, they are weary of the constant \nneed for American leadership abroad. Many resent the U.S. in the role \nof global policeman--again.\n  I have also met with relief workers who have been working on the \nground in Bosnia, to learn from their perspective how much rebuilding \nlies ahead for the people of this war-torn nation. This is an extremely \nimportant issue, because the success of NATO's military mission will be \nmeasured against the gains made in the civilian sector to reestablish a \nviable economic and political life throughout Bosnia.\n  While it is important to point out that NATO's implementation force, \nor IFOR, will not be responsible for the conduct of humanitarian \noperations, the two operations will work to complement one another. But \nthe IFOR will not be a police force, and it will not conduct nation-\nbuilding. Nor will the IFOR address the numerous issues surrounding the \nreturn of refugees. Rather, IFOR's mission is simple and \nstraightforward --to keep the peace so that civilian and political \nleaders have an opportunity to rebuild Bosnian society.\n  Our military leadership has repeatedly reassured Congress that the \nlimited nature of this mission can be accomplished in 1 year's time, \nwith most of the military tasks contained in the agreement accomplished \nin the first 6 months. After that, IFOR's role will be to maintain a \nclimate of stability so that the civil tasks outlined in the peace \nagreement can take root. \n\n[[Page S18523]]\n\n  In the words of Secretary Perry, the goal is to ``break the cycle of \nviolence'' so that the civilian efforts--economic development, free \nelections, and the return of refugees--can have an opportunity to take \nhold. But regardless of what the situation looks like 1 year from now, \nthe Secretary has said that ``we must not be drawn into a posture of \nindefinite garrison.''\n  Mr. President, it is this very limited mission that I am agreeing to \nwith my vote today. I want to be clear--my support for this mission is \nqualified. I will be following developments closely in the weeks and \nmonths ahead. While I believe it is in our national interests to \nparticipate in a limited way in this operation, I feel very strongly \nthat once we have paved the way for the Bosnian people to make peace, \nour role will be over and we should leave.\n  Yes, we can provide the opportunity for peace. But if, after a year's \ntime, the Bosnian people themselves have not seized this chance, we \nshould and must leave.\n  Having said that, I do believe that what we are about to do is \nincredibly important. Certainly this deployment carries risks. But I \nbelieve those risks must be measured against the promise for peace this \nagreement contains. The conditions are right for peace in Bosnia. And \nlike Secretary Perry, I have concluded that the risks to the United \nStates of allowing the war to continue are greater than the risks of \nenforcing the peace.\n  I agree with the President, our Secretaries of Defense and State, and \nour Nation's top military leaders. The United States has critical \npolitical, economic and security interests in Europe, and the war in \nBosnia threatens those interests. The Dayton peace plan is the first \nopportunity we have had to end the war, and I believe we have to give \nit a chance.\n  In implementing the peace agreement, NATO will be embarking on its \nfirst land operation in history. Every NATO country with the exception \nof Iceland will be committing troops to this operation. The United \nStates will contribute one-third of the necessary troops for IFOR. The \nBritish will provide 13,000 troops, the French 8,000. In addition, more \nthan a dozen non-NATO nations have indicated a willingness to \nparticipate.\n  Our troops will be headquartered in Tuzla, where they will also have \nwith them a Nordic brigade of close to 4,500 troops. 1,000 of those \nNordic troops have been stationed in the Tuzla area for over a year, \nand will be able to provide our troops with important information on \nthe region and its risks. Perhaps most astonishingly, there will be a \nRussian brigade that will be a part of the American division, numbering \nseveral thousand troops.\n  The NATO mission, while carefully planned and trained for by our \nNation's best military leaders, faces many uncertainties. We owe our \ntroops no less than the finest training and equipment possible, and in \nthis regard we can take great reassurance. We know that the troops we \nare sending to Bosnia are strong, capable and ready. They have \nundergone thorough and intensive training over the past several months. \nThey have endured very rigorous and specific exercises, unique to the \nsituation they will face in Bosnia, including mine training and basic \ncombat proficiencies.\n  American troops will be heavily armed, and will have the authority to \nrespond with decisive force to any threat to their own safety. Our \ntroops will take their orders from the American General who commands \nNATO, General George Joulwan. For his part, General Joulwan has \ninsisted that the daily training scenarios that our troops are \nsubjected to be increasingly demanding, so that, in his words, ``the \nscrimmage should be harder than the game''.\n  Mr. President, one thing we do know for certain is that the nations \nof Europe have not been able to solve this crisis over the last 4 \nyears. In absence of any clear leadership, day after day the war \ndeepened, becoming a festering wound in the center of Europe. A quarter \nof a million lives have been lost to war, ethnic cleansing, and \ngenocide. A generation of children has been terrorized and traumatized. \nThousands of elderly have been cast from their homes and turned into \nrefugees with no place to go.\n  It has been American leadership that finally made a difference. \nAmerican leadership generated a cease fire. American leadership brought \nthe parties to the peace table. And now it will take American \nleadership to ensure that NATO remains strong enough to prevent the \npeace from collapsing.\n  Many Americans--including my own constituents--question the need for \nNATO as we approach the next century. The Soviet Union has collapsed. \nWhy, they ask, should America pay the money and put our troops on the \nline in support of an alliance whose time--in the eyes of some--has \npassed.\n  I believe we have a very direct national interest in ensuring that \nNATO remains an effective and credible security arrangement for the \nUnited States and our European allies. Ours is an alliance in support \nof democracy and freedom, and we are the leader of that alliance.\n  Now is not the time in history for America to question our leadership \nrole in the world. Continued American global leadership is in our \nnational interest, not only in the matter before us regarding Bosnia, \nbut more generally in this post-cold war era. Nations around the world \nare watching. If the aggression that has taken place in the Balkans \nover the past 4 years were to go without challenge, other nations will \ntake a lesson.\n  Congress gathered just yesterday to hear the moving speech of Israeli \nPrime Minister Shimon Peres, who faces the daunting task of keeping his \nNation on the path toward peace in the wake of former Prime Minister \nRabin's assassination.\n  Mr. Peres reminded us gently of the role America has played in this \ncentury, and the responsibilities we carry into the next. He urged us \nto accept what history has laid on our national shoulders. He reminded \nus that there are some things that only America can do. America alone, \nhe reminded us, can keep the world free.\n  We do not know who will be in charge in Russia, China, or Iran 10 \nyears from now. Those nations may be moving closer to democracy, or \nthey may be led by repressive regimes with nuclear capabilities. We \nsimply do not know today.\n  Because of the uncertainties we face in the world, we in the United \nStates can not afford to fall back to the approach we took after World \nWar I, when a weary nation said ``enough''. The vacuum was filled \npromptly, in that case with the most horrendous outcome.\n  Mindful of such history, I would echo the sentiments of President \nClinton when he says, ``My fellow Americans, in this new era there are \nstill times when America and America alone can and should make the \ndifference for peace.''\n  To my own constituents, and to Americans across this great Nation of \nours, I want to say: I know you are weary. But in my view, we do not \nhave the luxury of wishing away the world and tending our own garden as \nif events around the world have no effect on us. We must continue to \nlead, and in doing so, we are most certainly serving our own national \ninterests.\n  But you are right. This will be a difficult mission to undertake. The \nclimate in Bosnia at this time of year is brutal, the terrain \ndifficult, and the risks many. Even if all goes extremely well, we must \nbe prepared for casualties. This is an inevitable fact of life that \naccompanies every deployment. We should remember, for example, that \nduring Desert Shield, the staging phase before the Persian Gulf war \nbegan, we lost 84 American troops before even a single shot was fired. \nAnd although the situation we are entering in Bosnia is vastly \ndifferent, it is tragically unavoidable that accidents and mishaps will \nclaim the lives of some of those deployed. And so we must prepare \nourselves as a Nation for this consequence.\n  But we must remember that throughout this ``American century'', as it \nhas been called by some, the United States alone has set the standard \nto which so many nations now aspire. And in keeping with our vision as \na people, since the end of the cold war we have led the international \ncommunity in breaking new ground on behalf of democracy and the rule of \nlaw. In situations ranging from Cambodia to Haiti to Bosnia, we have \nhelped to secure peace and freedom.\n  I think we have to acknowledge up front that as we undertake these \nendeavors, we do not fully know yet what \n\n[[Page S18524]]\nmodel works, and under what circumstances. And that is what makes votes \nlike today's so difficult. But this is no excuse for this Nation or any \nother major world power to throw up our hands and walk away from the \ndifficult problems and challenges we face in this post-cold war era.\n  On this point, I think the observations of Lakhdar Brahimi, who heads \nthe U.N. operation in Haiti, are relevant. When asked what we have \nlearned in Haiti that may be relevant to Bosnia, he said:\n\n       . . . With operations like these (in Bosnia and Haiti), he \n     said, the international community is embarking on something \n     completely new for itself, and for which it does not yet have \n     all the skills. It isn't even sure what it wants an certainly \n     doesn't have all the money it needs to do it. So we take a \n     country by the hand and accompany it a little bit, while it \n     tries to stand on its own two feet. We don't do it perfectly, \n     but it's still useful, even if it doesn't create paradise. \n     But no one should kid themselves. It's a constant uphill \n     struggle.\n\n  And so we should sober our expectations, but not dampen our resolve. \nFor the sake of our own national interests and those of our allies, we \nhave to move forward--with prayer and conviction.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this body now debates again whether we support the \ndeployment of U.S. military forces into a European theater of war. We \nhave debated this proposition twice before in this century.\n  In World War I, we sent our troops to engage in ``the war to end all \nwars.'' After the slaughter, after the victory, America withdrew from \nthe European stage; and, before the century reached mid-point, we found \nourselves again debating whether it was the U.S. role to engage in \nEuropean wars.\n  The world was transformed by our historic decision to enter that war. \nThe world was transformed by our decision after the victory to remain \nengaged; and, for most of the rest of the century, this country stood \nfor the expansion of freedom and the containment of tyranny.\n  Perhaps some of us forgot that one of the reasons we were so \nmotivated after World War II was because this nation had been horrified \nby the scenes of depravity under the Third Reich and the Japanese \nempire. When we saw the horrors of the concentration camps, we \ndeclared, with commitment, ``never again.''\n  Generations of Americans raised after that great allied victory truly \nbelieved that never again would we tolerate genocide in Europe. The \nvery notion of civilization was redefined to include this idea--until \nthe war broke out in Bosnia.\n  For almost 4 years, we have witnessed the horrors of ``ethnic \ncleansing'' in central Europe. Up until a few months ago, we regularly \nsaw massacres of innocents, most often Muslims. ``Never again,'' came \nback to haunt us. ``Never again,'' became the hollow cry at the end of \na century, taunting us that we could never assume progress from \nbarbarity.\n  Many of us in this body believed we had to act. While we accepted \nthat we could not make a persuasive case that U.S. troops needed to \nenforce or protect a vital interest, we believed that the world's \nremaining superpower had the power, the means, and the moral \nresponsibility, to act.\n  We voted, again and again, to lift the immoral arms embargo on the \nyoung Bosnian state, which was largely unarmed, and was the target of \nthe barbarians of ``ethnic cleansing.''\n  This summer, we passed legislation, with a strong bipartisan 69 \nvotes, to lift the embargo.\n  The Administration, proclaiming concern for the Bosnians, argued that \nlifting the arms embargo would cause the Serbs to attack the eastern \nenclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica. For this grotesquely false reason--a \nreason bloodily refuted by the massacres in Srebrenica that occurred \nanyway--the Administration argued that we could not let the victims \ndefend themselves. The Administration argued--again and again--that \nlifting the embargo would spread the war and would require the use of \nthousands of U.S. forces to extract the U.N. and allied forces. And so, \nthe Administration argued that lifting the embargo was not an \nacceptable course of action.\n  Now, less than a month after the signing of the Dayton Accord, the \nAdministration is deploying United States troops to Bosnia to implement \nthe military annex of that accord.\n  There is a temporary truce in Bosnia. The killing has mostly stopped. \nThe ethnic cleansing has not. And, the administration believes, most \nsincerely, that the deployment of the NATO Implementation Force, now \nknown as IFOR, will, in the words of President Clinton, ``help create a \nsecure environment so that the people of Bosnia can return to their \nhomes, vote in free elections, and begin to rebuild their lives.'' The \nadministration expects this to take approximately 1 year.\n  Mr. President, I respect the President's prerogative in foreign \npolicy. I believe this is a principle we must respect if we are to \nconvey the proper influence and power of this great Nation overseas. I \nsupported this principle under previous Presidents, and I strongly \nobjected when the Members of the opposing party in this body sought to \nfrustrate Presidents Reagan and Bush.\n  I was disappointed when this body passed the resolution supporting \nPresident Bush's decision to deploy to Iraq by merely 52 votes. We had \na clear vital interest at stake then. And, had we waited, we now know \nthat our troops would have been subject to the weapons of mass \ndestruction Saddam Hussein was on the verge of using.\n  Mr. President, I respect the principle of the President's prerogative \nin making foreign policy, but I have grave reservations--grave \nreservations--about the Bosnia policy on which the President is \nembarking.\n  But, I wish to make one point exceedingly clear: I believe that the \nCongress must show our support for the U.S. military. This Senator will \nalways support American troops abroad.\n  I have recently learned that a Utah reserve unit will be among those \ntroops deployed to this region, and several other Utah reservists have \nbeen put on alert. There is no way that this Senator will not do \nanything and everything to make sure that those troops have the backing \nthey need in terms of equipment and materiel and moral support for what \nthey do to serve our country's objectives.\n  But, appreciation and support for how well our troops carry out our \npolicy does not mean we cannot question the policy itself as well as \nengage in some retrospective about U.S. policy.\n  I wish the President had taken a different approach on Bosnia 3 years \nago. Candidate Clinton said he would lift the arms embargo. As I have \nsaid, I believe it was immoral to maintain an arms embargo against \nBosnia while it was subjected to slaughter by a heavily armed \nYugoslavia. I must say that, with his record, there is a credibility \nquestion when the President asserts it is the ``right'' thing to now \nsend troops to Bosnia.\n  I believe that the Atlantic alliance is the most successful military \nalliance in the history of the world. The major democracies of the \nworld held together throughout the cold war, and Europe remained \nsecure. The world is still a dangerous place after the cold war, and I \nbelieve that NATO must remain relevant. I support the enlargement of \nthe alliance, because I believe the alliance promotes political values \nas well as enforces security, and I wish to support the democracies \nof central Europe.\n\n  But NATO's credibility has suffered greatly during the Bosnia \ndebacle. Tied by the dual key with the United Nations, the greatest \nmilitary alliance was ineffective while genocide occurred. NATO stood \nby while cities and towns were shelled, while humanitarian convoys were \nturned back, while helicopters violated a no-fly zone. A NATO F-16 was \nshot out of the sky this summer by Serbs using Russian military \nhardware.\n  The Administration argues that NATO credibility is at stake. But I \nmust ask: What happens if the I-For goes to Bosnia, and, after 1 year \nand the departure of I-For, the parties return to war? Will NATO be \nmore credible for having gone to Bosnia with great fanfare, but having \nreturned without success, or worse, with casualties we cannot justify?\n  This administration proclaims that this is a chance for peace in \nBosnia. I \n\n[[Page S18525]]\ndo not doubt the President's sincerity. And I do not doubt that the \nadministration is motivated by noble notions. I fear, however, that its \nideals are immature.\n  Peace is not the absence of conflict, Mr. President. We will always \nhave conflict. Peace, I believe, is the management of conflict, the \nmanagement of conflict so that it does not escalate into violence and \nwar.\n  And, when I look at the Dayton Accord, Mr. President, and the record \nof this administration, I fear that many issues about managing the \nconflict remain unaddressed.\n  The administration has spoken about a clear exit strategy, partly \nbecause we in the Congress have demanded it. But if we do not have a \nvision of how to manage the conflict after our mission expires, I see \nvery little reason to go in at all. We need a post-exit strategy, Mr. \nPresident, and I've heard very little of one.\n  A post-exit strategy--and the success of the I-For mission--depends \non a number of factors. I believe these include, but are not limited \nto: First, ensuring that the Bosnian Serbs do not pursue territorial \ngains beyond those they have won in this ignominious partition known as \nthe Dayton Accord; second, completing the agreement between Croatia and \nSerbia over Eastern Slavonia; third, building and maintaining a \ncooperative relationship between the Bosnians and the Croatians; and, \nmost importantly, fourth, maintaining the political and military \nviability of the Bosnian state.\n\n  Elements within the Bosnian Serbs have been proclaiming against the \nDayton Accord since the day they were signed. Demonstrations have been \nstaged almost every day. Are we to proceed while these rogue elements \nthreaten, with arms, to ignore the accord?\n  The administration tells us that it will rely on President Milosevic \nof Serbia to control these elements. President Milosevic has been very \ncooperative and effective, we are told.\n  President Milosevic, I recall, was the instigator of the war against \nBosnia and has reneged on his promises on numerous occasions over the \npast 4 years. Perhaps Milosevic has converted--and I believe in \nconversion--but I have doubts about the sincerity of those who convert \nafter a mild NATO bombing campaign.\n  Mr. President, I still do not know what the administration intends to \ndo if our U.S. forces are subject to mortar attacks from rogue \nelements.\n  For example, if we're attacked from a populated area by rogue \nelements that move freely within it, how will we respond? With a phone \ncall to Belgrade? How does President Clinton plan to hold President \nMilosevic accountable for keeping the Bosnian Serbs in line with the \naccord?\n  I am also greatly concerned about the agreement between Croatia and \nSerbia over eastern Slavonia. We should recall the brutal occupation of \nthat Croatian territory. We should recall the pictures of the city of \nVukovar, left a smoking rubble by the Serbs, complete with mass graves.\n  Since then the Serbian Army has occupied the area, cleansed it, and \nextracted its natural resources. The Croats and Serbs signed an \nagreement just before the Dayton Accord to return eastern Slavonia to \nCroatia. The agreement allows for 1 year to revert the territory to \nCroatia, but it has a 1 year extension clause, to be exercised by \neither party.\n  The implementation of the international force to monitor the \nterritory is already stalling. I predict here that the Serbs will ask \nfor that 1 year extension; and, 1 year from now, Eastern Slavonia will \nstill be occupied by the forces of Belgrade.\n  It is a powder keg. If we do not ensure the peaceful transfer of that \noccupied territory, there will be a war within 2 years, and that war \nwill spread to Bosnia, and the I-For mission, with its casualties, will \nhave been for naught.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that the administration has not \nfocused on this issue.\n  Mr. President, we need to do more to strengthen the ties begun with \nthe Washington Agreement last year to build the Croat-Muslim \nrelationship.\n  I have little expectation that the Serbian entity will ever \nparticipate in the unitary government of Bosnia-Hercegovina. But \nwithout the Croats and Muslims cooperating, Mr. President, we may end \nup participating in a three-way partition conducted by ethnic \ncleansing.\n  Since the beginning of this war, I have argued for a policy of lift-\nand-strike. Lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Croatia, and allow them \nto defend themselves against Serbian aggression. Use air power to \ndissuade the aggressors while the victims arm themselves.\n  We saw a version of lift-and-strike this summer, when the Croatian \nArmy, strong again, recaptured the Krajina and coordinated with the \nBosnians to deliver military defeats to the Serbs. Our NATO forces went \ninto the skies in August and September to force the Serbs to accept a \nchoice: more military defeats or a negotiated settlement. Lift-and-\nstrike worked, Mr. President, as we said it would.\n  Lift-and-strike was posited on the premise that a balance of power on \nthe ground would effect a real peace, a peace based on the cessation of \nviolence through deterrence.\n  Now that the President has decided to deploy the I-For, I believe \nthat it is essential that we ensure that Bosnia is able to defend \nitself. That, Mr. President, is the only way that we can guarantee that \nthe Bosnians shall not be subject to more ethnic cleansing, to more \ndeadly attacks--unless we plan to keep I-For there forever.\n  Mr. President, if we are not absolutely dedicated to arming the \nBosnian Government, we should be realistic enough to know that the war \nwill reignite shortly after IFOR departs. And then, Mr. President, \nwe'll ask, what was the point? For what did NATO expend its \ncredibility? For what did America risk its sons and daughters? A decent \ninterval to another war is not an acceptable answer, Mr. President.\n  So 5 years before the end of this bloody century, we debate again \nsending our troops to Europe. We didn't need to come to this point. The \nDayton Accord is abstract, the realities on the ground brutal and \ncomplicated. We didn't need to come to this point.\n  But America has given its word, and credibility of that word, we are \ntold, is at stake. Let me preface my final comments by saying that I am \nequally concerned about America's standing abroad and about maintaining \nour leadership in NATO.\n  But, our credibility is more threatened, I believe, by pursuing a \nmission with guaranteed casualties and uncertain goals, than it is by \ntelling our allies now that we do not support this policy, this \ndeployment, and that we will arm the Bosnians until they can defend \nthemselves.\n  But if this policy will be implemented--and already our troops are \narriving in Bosnia--we must try to improve it. If we are to effect any \npositive influence here, Mr. President, we must insist that we arm the \nBosnian government so that when we leave, we are not a few steps ahead \nof the next conflagration.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I support the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution \nopposing the President's decision to deploy, but strongly support the \nDole-McCain resolution commending U.S. troops and setting conditions \nfor the deployment which, I hope, will increase the possibility that \nthis mission will not have been a waste of blood, treasure, and, yes, \ncredibility.\n  Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his statesmanship in \nrecognizing that President Clinton is our President, that he does have \na right to put these troops there, a constitutional right, and once \nthey are there, we have an obligation, as patriots, to stand with them \nand to help them.\n  So I will support the Dole-McCain resolution, but I also support the \nHutchison-Inhofe resolution as well.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious thing. I have been over that land. I \nhave been over that territory. I have met with people on all sides of \nthese issues. I have read the histories of the last 600 years of that \narea. And I have to tell you, I think putting our young people there is \na tragic mistake. But once they are there, I am going to do everything \nin my power to support them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the debate over whether the United States \nshould contribute its troops to a NATO \n\n[[Page S18526]]\npeacekeeping force in Bosnia will be the focus of many speeches on this \nfloor in the coming days. It is a subject all of us have anticipated \nand pondered and wrestled with for some months now, and it is one of \nthose decisions that no one likes to make. It is fraught with \nuncertainties and the undeniable likelihood that Americans will be \ninjured or killed.\n  There will be many chances to speak on this, but having thought about \nit for some time and discussed it with the President and Secretary of \nDefense and others over the past weeks, and after listening to the \nPresident's speech last night and the responses of some of those who \noppose sending troops, I want to say a few words as the debate begins.\n  Mr. President, even before the peace agreement was signed at Dayton \nthe House of Representatives passed legislation to prevent the \nPresident from deploying United States troops to enforce a peace \nagreement without the consent of Congress. I believe the President \nshould seek the approval of Congress before sending troops to Bosnia, \nalthough I do not believe the Constitution requires it in this instance \nwhere the parties have signed a peace agreement. I felt it was both \nunhelpful and unnecessary for the House to pass legislation in the \nmidst of the negotiations and before a peace agreement was signed.\n  But just as President Bush sought congressional approval for sending \nUnited States troops to the Persian Gulf--although half a million were \nthere before approval was given--President Clinton has sought \ncongressional approval, and there will be ample time to debate it \nbefore the formal signing of the agreement.\n  The decision to send Americans into harms way is the most difficult \nand dangerous that any President has to make. It should be done only \nwhen a compelling national interest is at stake, and when there is no \nother alternative.\n  Like many or perhaps even most Senators, the majority of my \nconstituents, at least of those Vermonters who have contacted me, do \nnot believe that it is in our national interest to send Americans to \nBosnia. They genuinely fear another costly, drawn out quagmire like \nVietnam. Some of them fought in that war, or had family members who \ndied there. Others fear a debacle like Somalia, where in a matter of \ndays a well-intentioned humanitarian mission became a poorly-thought \nout, ill-prepared peacemaking mission that ended in tragedy.\n  It is the President's job to convince the American people that Bosnia \nis not Vietnam, it is not Somalia, and that our national interests \ncompel us to take part. He made a good start last night. There are \nstill important questions that need answers--the President said as much \nhimself--but I am convinced that the case for sending Americans to \nBosnia can be made, and I intend to help the President make it.\n  Mr. President, in the past 4 years, a quarter of a million people, \nthe vast majority defenseless civilians, have lost their lives in the \nformer Yugoslavia. We have all read the blood curdling reports of \nhundreds and even thousands of people being rounded up at gun point and \nsystematically executed or even buried alive.\n\n  Countless others have had their throats cut after being horribly \ntortured. Some have been made to eat the flesh and drink the blood of \ntheir countrymen. Thousands of women have been raped. Men have been \nforced to watch their wives and daughters raped and killed before their \neyes. All simply because of their ethnicity, or because they lived on \nland others wanted for themselves.\n  The war has produced two million refugees, victims of ethnic \ncleansing. Hundreds of thousands more have lived in squalor for years \nin the rubble of what remains of their homes, without electricity, heat \nor running water.\n  There are many, including myself, who believe that NATO should have \nacted much earlier and with far greater force to stop the genocide in \nBosnia. I opposed the use of American ground troops to try to win the \nwar, but we gave too much deference to those who said that airpower \nwould never compel the Serbs to negotiate peace. NATO should have been \ngiven the authority to use unrelenting force when UN resolutions were \nviolated time and again with impunity.\n  Our greatest collective failure was to put the United Nations in \ncharge of a peacekeeping mission where there was no peace to keep, and \nwhen it was unwilling or unable to back up its own threats. These \nfailures, which caused grievous damage to NATO's credibility, will \nhaunt us for years to come.\n  But the situation has changed dramatically since then. Sustained NATO \nbombing, coupled with gains by the Moslem and Croat forces on the \nbattlefield, have shown the Serbs that they cannot win what they set \nout to achieve. The exhaustion of the warring factions, coupled with a \nperiod of extraordinarily forceful American diplomacy, has created an \nunprecedented opportunity to end one of the most brutal wars the world \nhas seen in half a century.\n  There should be no mistake. The credibility of the United States \nGovernment is deeply invested in the success of the peace agreement, \nand success of the agreement depends absolutely on NATO's enforcement \nof it. The parties signed with that understanding. At the same time, \nNATO's own credibility and effectiveness depend on US leadership. \nIndeed, without US participation, there will be no NATO force, and the \npeace agreement will almost certainly collapse.\n  Mr. President, since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of \nthe cold war, NATO's future has been uncertain. Some have suggested \nthat NATO has outlived its usefulness. Others say that since the \nrationale for NATO--deterring a Soviet invasion of Europe--is gone, \nNATO should become a political alliance. Still others want to quickly \nexpand NATO to include all or most of Eastern Europe, and perhaps even \nsome of the former Soviet republics.\n  I mention this because NATO's future is one of the most compelling \nreasons why it is essential for the United States to participate in a \nNATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia.\n  I have been among the strongest supporters of assistance to Russia \nand the other former Soviet States. A democratic Russia is obviously a \nmajor foreign policy priority for the United States. Despite many \nsetbacks, there has been remarkable progress in Russia, Ukraine and \nelsewhere in the former Soviet Union. But who can predict the next \ndecade? Who can say that the fervent nationalism that remains strong \nthere will not increase to a point when it becomes threatening? It is \nsimply too soon to say what lies beyond this transitional period. I \nhave been reluctant to support the rapid expansion of NATO without a \nthorough discussion of the implications, for fear that it could fuel \nthe very nationalism in Russia that we seek to discourage.\n  But neither am I among those who see no role for NATO today. On the \ncontrary, the United States has an enormous stake in preserving NATO's \nstrength. While NATO's focus will undoubtedly shift over time, the \nfuture holds too many uncertainties, and there are too many areas of \npotential conflict around the world where important interests of the \nUnited States and our allies are at stake, to allow NATO's strength to \nerode.\n  There is no other alliance that comes close to NATO, in power, in \nreadiness, and in importance to the United States. NATO may not have \nsought the role of peacekeeper in Bosnia, but neither can it avoid it.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say whether this peace agreement will survive \nthe test of time. Perhaps no one can. There is ample reason to be \npessimistic, given the history of broken promises and ethnic hatred in \nthe former Yugoslavia. Since the agreement was signed, it has become \nclear than no party is completely satisfied, and some have expressed \ngrave misgivings with some aspects of it. If the agreement unravels, \nNATO Forces may be forced to withdraw, rather than be drawn into the \nfighting. Even withdrawal would be risky.\n  But virtually everyone knowledgeable about the situation there agrees \nthat this is by far the best chance for peace since the war began 4 \nyears ago. We and our European allies have an immense interest in \npreventing the continuation of a destabilizing war in Europe, and I \nbelieve we must take this chance.\n  The President has taken a courageous step, a step that reflects the \nbest of this country. Every American should \n\n[[Page S18527]]\nconsider the alternative. More mass murder. More towns shelled and \nburned. More starving children. More orphans. More horrifying \natrocities that are reminiscent of the dark ages. If this does not \ncompel us to help enforce an agreement we brokered to end this \ncalamity, what further amount of inhuman brutality would it take? \nShould we wait for the slaughter of another hundred thousand, or two \nhundred thousand?\n  The President is right. We have a moral responsibility to take part. \nThe Europeans were unable to end the war themselves. United States \nleadership was not the only factor, but without it there would be no \npeace agreement, and the war would go on indefinitely. We should be \nproud of it, and stand behind it.\n  Some have suggested that we can lead without sending troops. I \ndisagree. We cannot maintain our credibility as the leader of NATO if \nwe are not prepared to assume some of the risk. We should remember that \ntwo thirds of the NATO Force will be troops from our NATO allies and \nothers.\n  Mr. President, our troops are the best trained in the world, but we \ncannot eliminate the risks. There are 2 million landmines in Bosnia \nalone, hidden under mud and snow. Each one cost only a few dollars, but \none false step could mean the loss of any American soldier's legs or \nlife. The Pentagon says that landmines are among the most serious \nthreats our troops will face there.\n  This is ironic, since the Pentagon has been actively lobbying against \nmy efforts to show leadership by halting the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines, which claim hundreds of innocent lives each week. Two-thirds \nof the Senate voted for it, but the Pentagon refuses. In the past few \nmonths, several of our European allies have stopped their use and \nproduction of these indiscriminate weapons, but the Pentagon refuses.\n  A quarter of the Americans killed in the Persian Gulf died from \nlandmines. A quarter of American casualties in Vietnam were from mines. \nI can only wonder how many more Americans will needlessly lose their \nlegs or their lives from landmines before the Pentagon gets the \nmessage.\n  We cannot eliminate the risks, but President Clinton has established \nthe right conditions before U.S. troops can be deployed. If the mission \nis limited in time, clear in scope and achievable, as the President has \ninsisted, we should support it. Our troops must be backed by broad \nrules of engagement that enable them to defend themselves with whatever \namount of preemptive force is needed in any circumstance. That does not \nmean waiting to shoot until they are shot at.\n  Mr. President, I expect to speak again as the debate on this unfolds. \nI intend to support the President, and I expect there will be Senators \nI deeply respect who are on the other side. But at the end of the day, \nif Americans are sent to Bosnia as I believe they will be, I have no \ndoubt that we all will support them, and we will all be proud of them.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McConnell). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, there have been many eloquent speeches \ngiven today and last night. I am not sure that much new can be said. \nOver the last several years, we have debated the pros and cons of what \nto do about Bosnia, and I have begun to feel like Hamlet. If I could \njust review some of my thinking at this point, I would like to.\n  The tragedy in former Yugoslavia is truly momentous. Nobody will deny \nthat who has watched this occur over the last several years. We have \nwitnessed, in the past several years, atrocities in Europe that we \nvowed would never again be allowed. We have stood by while our most \nimportant and fundamental military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, that is a fundamental part of our Nation's security, \ntottered on the brink of disaster, its members squabbling and \nindecisive while war waged on Europe's doorstep. And we have struggled \nto understand the nuances of a conflict fueled by both ancient \nanimosities and a contemporary hunger for power, by both the collapse \nof communism and the friction of ethnic and religious hatred.\n  For most Americans, this is a distant war in an obscure land about \nissues that do not directly affect our interests. All that may be true. \nAnd, yet, we could not ignore it. For the past 4 years, we have feared, \nabove all, that it would spread and embroil the great powers, \nparticularly the United States and Russia, on opposite sides of a war \nneither of us wanted. We have felt deep compassion and remorse as this \nwar, like all wars, took its greatest toll on the innocents: in \nrefugees driven from their lands, in homes and towns and villages \ndestroyed, in a generation of children, Mr. President, whose lives have \nbeen shattered.\n  We have tried to avoid involvement because our direct national \ninterests were not at stake. This, we said, was a European problem. \nAnd, yet, because we understood that important national interests could \nbe put at risk if the fighting continued, we could not simply wash our \nhands of the matter.\n  So America and our European allies took a series of halting steps and \ntentative measures that over 4 years tarnished our image and called \ninto question our resolve. We imposed an arms embargo on Yugoslavia and \nlater came to regret it. We established safe havens and then failed to \nprotect them against assault. We promised to deliver food and \nhumanitarian supplies to refugees and displaced persons but then failed \nto use the force necessary to deliver.\n  Those efforts all failed. As a consequence of those failures, we had \nbecome involved in Bosnia. American credibility, prestige, and \nleadership, the intangibles that are so important to our national \nsecurity around the world, all were damaged. We found ourselves in the \nworst of situations. America put itself on the line in Bosnia, but we \nhad made no commitment to shaping the outcome.\n  Now we are at a crossroads. The issue before us is whether America \nshould help bring this war to a close. We should, and through our good \noffices and diplomatic leadership we have done so. I share President \nClinton's view that the United States should be a leader for peace. \nHowever, I also share the deep reservations of many and that have been \nspoken of many times today about sending American forces into the \nBalkans. In my mind, the key to the success of the NATO operation is \nnot the achievement of a military objective, but rather the commitment \nof the Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian leaders and their people to \npeace. Absent that strong commitment by the parties to make the Dayton \naccord work over the long term, no number of international troops will \nachieve peace. Mr. President, I am not convinced that the three parties \nto the Dayton accord will stand by their commitments and sustain the \npeace. We certainly would all pray for that result.\n  All three parties have incentives to sign now, but they do not have \nthe same incentive to keep the peace come spring or after our troops \ndepart. By setting an arbitrary 1-year timetable for the departure of \nour forces, we invite the parties to wait us out. The Dayton accord is \nfull of ambiguities with empty guarantees of peace, and that probably \nwould not have been possible.\n  Yet the reality is that our troops are going. They are already, many \nof them, there. Thousands more will follow in the coming days. Whether \nwe like it or not, the President's decision to deploy is behind us. The \nUnited States has made a commitment to this operation. Having made that \ncommitment, America must not cut and run. To do so would send a message \nof weakness around the world that would damage our national interests \nin a way that the Yugoslavian war itself never could. The reality is \nthat we are involved in Bosnia, and all Americans must do what we can \nto see this operation through to a successful conclusion.\n\n  The decision now before us, to my mind, should involve how best to \nbuild the prospects for success. I believe Congress has little choice \nbut to support our forces and the operation, because to do otherwise \nwould be to diminish our chances for success, and success is the task \nat hand. Today we are considering three approaches to the matter. Each \nis troubling, I suggest. One has already been rejected. I do not \nbelieve we should cut off funding with our troops already on the \nground. Provoking a constitutional crisis at this point would not serve \neither our troops or our national interests. I also do not believe \nexpressing support for our troops \n\n[[Page S18528]]\nbut opposing the President's decision to send them enhances the \nmission's prospect for success. That would send an unequivocal message \nthat America's support for this operation is shallow; a message that \nwould be heard, I think, loud and clear by the parties in former \nYugoslavia.\n  That leaves us with the approach of the Dole-McCain resolution. I \ncommend the authors of that resolution, who have struggled with the \nvery basic but difficult question left unanswered by the Dayton \naccords: How will we know when our mission is completed? Or put another \nway, how did we plan to accomplish a lasting peace in the region after \nour troops have gone?\n  I have serious reservations about the dual policy the Dole-McCain \nresolution advocates as a solution to this difficult question. On the \none hand, American troops would participate in ostensibly neutral \npeacekeeping operation to separate the warring parties. On the other \nhand, America would lead an effort to arm and train one of the parties, \nthe Bosnian Moslems. I have had reservations about this policy \narticulated by the administration, and I have deeper reservations about \nendorsing or even expanding that commitment in a congressional \nresolution. An American-led effort to arm and train, to put our troops \nin Bosnia at greater risk, could undermine provisions of the Dayton \naccord that obligate all parties to reduce their armed forces and could \nlay the foundation for an arms race in the Balkans. Any American effort \nto arm and train the Bosnian Federation also must recognize and deal \nwith the delicate and contradictory nature of the new Moslem-Croat \nalliance.\n  Finally, our European allies have serious reservations about a United \nStates-led effort to arm the Bosnian Federation. While many of my \ncolleagues have decried European leadership on Bosnia, I believe that \nas a member of NATO we have an obligation to coordinate our policies \nclosely with our allies. But despite these concerns, the Dole-McCain \nresolution is, to my mind, the only real option now before the Senate. \nI do support it because I firmly believe that Congress must go on \nrecord in support of this operation which already is underway.\n  The President has made clear that the operation will proceed with or \nwithout congressional support, but I am not sure it can succeed without \ncongressional support. With our troops at risk I believe success must \nbe our highest priority. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very \nimportant question of whether or not to authorize the deployment of \nUnited States ground troops to Bosnia. let me start with where I have \nbeen on this issue and continue with where I am today.\n  Mr. President, I have long believed that Bosnia itself is not a \nstrategic interest of the United States. I have agreed more with \nBismarck who said that the Balkans were ``not worth the loss of one \nPomeranian grenadier'' than I have with those European politicians who \nhave seen it as the contested terrain necessary to extend their \ncountries' reach to the middle East. In essence, the Bosnian conflict \nrepresents the conflict of Western Christendom, Orthodox Christendom \nand Islam and it flows from grievances passed on from grandparent to \ngrandchild over centuries.\n  While the United States has long had a vital interest in the security \nof Europe in general, there has been no indication over the past 4 \nyears that the conflict in Bosnia would spread in any significant \ndestablilizing way, notwithstanding the legitimate worries about \nKosovo, Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey. Further, while the United States \nhas humanitarian interests related to countering ethnic cleansing and \nother barbaric conduct, I do not think that it is possible for the \nUnited States to intervene and to stop every ethnic conflict in the \nworld. Why Bosnia and not Rwanda has never been answered by the \narchitects of our current policy.\n  The most striking thing about the Bosnian war is that virtually no \none, from the beginning, championed pluralism. Instead, we accepted the \npremises of the warring parties and lost the high ground.\n  I also believe that thee have been a lot of missed opportunities to \ncurtail the horrors during the four years of this conflict. Because we \ndid not seize them, we have been left with a much more difficult \nsituation. For example, in the Bush administration, the United States, \nfresh from the triumph in the Gulf, could have threatened massive air \npower to deter the Serbian President Milosevic from pursuing by force \nhis ambition to create a greater Serbia. We failed to do so and the \nconflict expanded exponentially into war.\n  Similarly, in the first 6 to 12 months of the Clinton administration, \nI believe that there was another opportunity for the United States to \nwarn Milosevic and then to act directly against him if he persisted. \nThe United States could have sent a high level emissary to apply \ndiplomatic pressure and to threaten air attacks to deter Serb \naggression. But the United States failed to act in any meaningful way \nand the war has continued for a period longer than the Korean war.\n  In the absence of U.S. action, I have supported equalizing the \nmilitary imbalance in the region. While certainly not a solution to the \nunderlying conflict, military parity is crucial to any last peace \nbetween the Gosnian Moslems, the Croats, and the Serbs. As a result, I \nvoted repeatedly for lifting the arms embargo. But once again, we \nmissed an opportunity and the embargo and military imbalance have \npersisted.\n  That is where I have been on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that some things have changed. We have a \npeace agreement initialed by Moslems, Croats, and Serbs. We have the \ncommitment of NATO to secure the military aspects of this agreement and \nwe have the commitment of President Clinton to deploy 20,000 United \nStates ground troops to Bosnia and another 5,000 troops to Croatia, as \npart of this agreement. Where Europe failed to get agreement, America \nsucceeded but the results put us in the middle of Europe's most \nvolatile region as not only a coguarantor, but the broker of the \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I recognize also that several things have not changed. \nThe ethnic enmity between the parties continues. The Moslem-Croat \nFederation remains fragile and divisions persist among the leadership \nof the various parties to the agreement.\n  As importantly, I still do not believe that Bosnia itself is a \nstrategic interest of the United States. Indeed, if there were no \ncounterbalancing factors, it would be my position that the United \nStates should not deploy United States ground forces to Bosnia.\n  One of the primary problems that we are facing is that we are left to \nmake this decision in a conceptual vacuum. Although the cold war has \nended, no one has provided a coherent vision of the post-cold war \nworld. Rather, ad hocism tends to rule the day.\n  This void is particularly pertinent for the United States. The United \nStates is the most powerful country in the world. With that power, \nhowever, comes certain responsibilities. There comes the leadership \nresponsibility to formulate a coherent vision of the world. Yet, no \none, including the administration and its predecessor, has defined the \nrole of the United States or NATO or their respective strategic \ninterests since the days of the cold war. But those days have ended. \nTime after time since 1990, we have looked in the rearview mirror \ninstead of ahead to the horizon of a new world. The retreat to a \nstrategy of ``cold war lite'' is reflected in bloated defense budgets, \nconfused priorities and a gradual erosion of American influence abroad.\n  I believe an administration's highest foreign policy priority is to \ndevelop a new conceptual framework and I believe a President's role is \nto first see that it is done and second, to articulate it often enough \nand persuasively enough so that the American people and the rest of the \nworld know where we are going in foreign policy and why.\n  The administration's proposal for United States troop deployment in \nBosnia is a prime example of the reigning ad hocism. And it brings with \nit, several grave problems:\n  To begin, how do we define success? The administration has not \nclearly stated how it will evaluate the success of the mission. \nFocusing only on the military mission, the administration has left \ngreat ambiguity, if not confusion, regarding the issues of refugees and \ndisarmament. The result is very dangerous because you cannot really \nhave an exit strategy unless you know \n\n[[Page S18529]]\nwhat it is you are supposed to achieve. For an exit strategy is not a \ndeadline, it is a process for continuously evaluation means against \ngoals.\n  By stating that the mission will not extend beyond a year, the \nadministration also invites delayed violations. As a mechanism of \ncontrol, a time limit leads to loss of control. A stated 1 year \ntermination of our involvement is a temptation for the contending \nparties simply to delay a showdown for a year.\n  In hoping for a limited mission that could simultaneously solve the \ndeeper conflicts, there has been an incomplete disclosure of where this \naction will lead. In a year from now, will United States troops be \nwithdrawn only to allow the Croats and Serbs to carve up Moslem Bosnia? \nWill we feel any better just because our military objectives have been \nostensibly achieved? Will the United States' leadership role be \nmaintained and NATO's role restored if Bosnia falls into renewed \nconflict upon the withdrawal of NATO? Unfortunately, I think the answer \nis no. Do the Croats yearn so much for economic ties to Europe and the \nSerbs fear so much the resumption of sanctions that they will restrain \nthemselves from conquering the Moslem enclaves once United States \ntroops leave? Again, I fear the answer is no. Once we are down the road \nand involved, the most likely outcome is for this mission to continue--\nfor NATO, with United States troops, to engage in the protection of \nBosnia enclaves for the indefinite future.\n  A related, but distinct problem is the disconnect between the defined \nmission and our objectives. If the administration is to be believed, \nour mission is only military and can be completed in 1 year. \nNevertheless, to justify the deployment of U.S. troops in this case, \nthe administration has defined certain humanitarian interests--to \nprevent ethic cleansing, to prevent a renewed conflict between the \nparties, and to create one federated Bosnian state. Neither the limited \nmilitary mission that the administration has laid out, nor the hoped \nfor year of ``breathing space'' will be able to accomplish those \nobjectives. The administration is taking the rhetorical high ground, \nbut its plan falls far short of delivering on the rhetoric.\n  No one is saying now that the Moslem enclaves are going to be the \nBerlins of the last years of the twentieth century with NATO forces \nplacing a tripwire around them and protecting them in a dangerous \nworld. Instead, the administration trumpets the brevity of the mission \nas if American forces 6 months on the ground is an inoculation against \nthe deep hatreds that caused the ethic cleansing in the first place. \nSuch an attitude, from my perspective, is naive and wrong. I think the \ntime has come for the administration to level with the American people \nabout the logical end result of this mission. Only a lasting peace will \navert us from being faced by Christmas 1996 with the choice of a longer \ncommitment or failure.\n  In addition, there has yet to be any sufficiently comprehensive \ndefinition of either the rules of engagement or contingency plans. What \nwill U.S. troops do in the case of cross-border conflicts, if the Serbs \nattack the Croats or the Croats attack the Serbs? What will United \nStates troops do if the French troops in Saragevo are directly attacked \nwith the resulting loss of many French lives? Under what if any \ncircumstances will U.S. forces be withdrawn prior to the completion of \nthe military mission. These are very important issues, but there still \nare no precise answers as there were not when the Bosnian Serbs took \nUNPROFOR hostage following NATO bombing.\n  Lacking a coherent vision, there also appears to be little \nrecognition of the implications of this 1 year decision and its \npotential outcome for our strategic interests throughout the world. If \nwe withdraw our troops and Serbs or Croats subjugate the Moslem \nenclaves, there will be, for example, significant repercussions in the \nIslamic world, in the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere. Again the 1 year \ntime horizon could put our withdrawal at a time of maximum uncertainty \nor danger in the Islamic world--a time when the old, well-known voices \ncould be replaced by more strident fundamentalists--who regard renewed \nBosnian horrors as a rallying cry and the United States as the villain \nwho promised and then reneged. Whether such repercussions are worth the \ninterests we are ostensibly saving have not, as far as I know, been \naddressed.\n  It is worth remembering the example of Ronald Reagan's Lebanon \nintervention. The Marines arrived, departed, returned after the Sabra \nand Shatila massacres and then spent over a year just hunkering down \nwith tragic results.\n\n  Finally, those who say that there is no alternative are posing a \nfalse choice and ignoring the last 4 years. One might choose deployment \nas the best of two bad choices. But that does not mean that there were \nno more choices. A policy of strength that proceeded from a new \nstrategic framework and was pursued from the beginning of the breakup \nof Yugoslavia was the alternative that no one talks about because it \nwas not developed.\n  Despite these and other problems with this ad hoc approach, I \nrecognize that there are counterbalancing concerns. Most notably, the \nPresident has pledged U.S. participation and the deployment of U.S. \nground troops. I have said twice that the United States has not \nstrategic interest in Bosnia itself. Paradoxically, because the \ndeployment decision proceeded ad hoc, it places more emphasis on the \ndownside of undercutting the solemn commitment of our President and of \nundermining the United States role in Europe where we do have strategic \ninterests. As a result, we in Congress have a new level of \nresponsibility. With all said, I believe that the word of the United \nStates and the ability of the President to lead and to make decisions \nas leader and Commander-in-Chief, are important elements of the United \nStates' world position. The decision to deploy, however poorly thought \nout, if carried through and maintained over time, will send a strong \nmessage worldwide. It will, for example, show the Chinese that the \nAmerican concern for human rights does not single them out, but is part \nof our worldview. It will say to the Japanese and other parties in \nNortheast Asia that an American President can deliver on his word. It \nwill say to the Islamic world that, as with the gulf war, a non-treaty \ncommitment made by the United States can extend to Islamic territory as \nwell as to Israel, and it will say to all of Europe that the United \nStates remains a European power.\n  Further, while not of major significance, there are benefits from \nUnited States and Russian forces working together in the same field. By \nengaging in a joint military mission that has very limited objective, I \nbelieve that we will be helping Russia to take positive steps in its \npost-cold war development and once again, it will have geopolitical \nvalue in Asia by showing that the United States and Russia are building \na new spirit of cooperation and friendship.\n  There are also potential benefits for NATO, although as I noted \nbefore, potential dangers as well. NATO has been searching for a \ndefining role since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This, the first actual \nNATO deployment, not just a patrol or reconnaissance mission, marks \nNATO's departure into peacekeeping. This mission will include troops \nfrom the new European democracies, thereby providing a more useful \nbridge into the West than the ill-conceived drive for immediate NATO \nexpansion. In addition, this mission has brought the French back into \nthe NATO command structure, making NATO a more complete European force. \nOne hopes, however, that the ambiguities in the agreement will not lead \nto alliance bickering and disagreements, even though the seeds have \nalready been planted--with disagreements already arising over refugees, \ndisarmament and the arming and training of the Bosnian Moslems.\n  Having weighed all of these considerations, I have reluctantly \ndecided that it is in the best interests of the United States to \nsupport the deployment of U.S. troops at this time. I believe, however, \nthat, contrary to administration rhetoric, this will be a very \ndifficult and long mission. I urge the administration to level with the \nAmerican people now and to do all within its power to improve the \ncircumstances under which U.S. troops are deployed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Jersey has \nexpired.\n  Under the unanimous-consent agreement, I would recognize a \nRepublican. \n\n[[Page S18530]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has been \nwaiting. We will yield him time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank you and I thank my colleague from \nTexas for her courtesy.\n  There are some basic questions. Why have an Armed Forces for the \nUnited States? Why have a Chicago Police Department? Or a Louisville \nPolice Department? One reason is to have stability, in a community and \nin the world community. And here, let me add that the great threat to \nthe world today, unlike 10 years ago, is instability. Ten years ago it \nwas nuclear annihilation.\n  The second reason for having an armed force and for having a police \ndepartment is to save lives. Are there risks? Yes. If there is a \nproblem in one part of the city of Chicago you may send in the police \ndepartment. And, if there are problems around the world, the United \nStates, along with the community of nations, may have to use the armed \nforce that we had. There are, however, for the Chicago Police \nDepartment and the U.S. Armed Forces, greater risks in not maintaining \nstability here.\n  Let me add, while I support the President in this endeavor, the one \nthing that does concern me is the talk about getting out in 1 year. I \nhope that can happen. I hope we can be out in 6 months. I think the \nprobability is, if our mission is to succeed--and it is important that \nit succeed--that we are likely to have to be there 2 or 3 years; maybe \nnot with 20,000 soldiers, but with a substantial armed force.\n  I was critical of George Bush for not moving early, when problems \nerupted. And I cheered, in August 1992, when Bill Clinton made a \ncampaign speech criticizing George Bush for not acting.\n  Then when Bill Clinton came in, I was critical of him for not acting. \nBut I think what he is doing now is right. It is right for stability \nbecause of the danger of the spread of war.\n  If we do not follow through on this peace--and it is a peace, tenuous \nas it is--if we do not follow through, this is inevitably going to \nspread to Macedonia and Albania. Macedonia has more ethnic Turks than \nany other country, and Turkey has made clear, if there are problems in \nMacedonia, Turkey is going to move in. Our friends in Greece have made \nclear, if Turkey moves in, they are going to move if--and this thing \nwill escalate very, very quickly. You will have hundreds of thousands \nof Americans--Armed Forces people--involved in a war, not 20,000 \nmaintaining a peace.\n  The second thing we should remember, there are not too many clear \nlessons in history, but one of the clear lessons of history is \nreligious wars spread very easily. What we have in Bosnia--nothing is \ncompletely clean there--but you have primarily a Moslem force, a Roman \nCatholic force, and an Orthodox Christian force. If anyone thinks that \nwhen Moslem forces in Bosnia are under attack that Moslems in Pakistan, \nSaudi Arabia, and Indonesia, and elsewhere are going to pay no \nattention to that, you are dreaming. Religious wars spread very, very \neasily.\n  In terms of saving lives, it is very clear we should act. We have the \nagreement reached in Dayton, to the credit of this administration, the \nState Department, and others who were participants. Bosnia is half the \nsize of Ohio. Bosnia has seen 250,000 people killed, 2 million people \ndisplaced.\n  We went into Desert Storm, invaded a country after a short time, and \nI do not know whether history is going to judge my vote against acting \nthat quickly, though I said I was for using economic sanctions first \nand then acting. But I feared, if we acted, we would simply perpetuate \nSaddam Hussein in power. But make no mistake about it: One of the \nreasons we acted was oil.\n  Are we willing to act to save oil but not save lives? I do not think \nthat is what America stands for.\n  I have heard on this floor reference to Somalia as a great disaster. \nLet me tell you. Somalia was George Bush's finest hour. Hundreds of \nthousands of lives were saved. The mistake was made, and I was at the \nWhite House when we worked out the compromise that we would have to \nleave before too long. And I see I am being signaled for time. I ask \nunanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Somalia saved lives. The mistake was in \npulling out precipitously. I fear we may make the same mistake in \nBosnia.\n  Finally, we have made a commitment to NATO. We have to live up--or we \nshould live up--to that commitment.\n  Then I would add one other point. That is a word of gratitude to \nSenator Bob Dole for being a statesman on this issue. He is not gaining \nany votes in Republican primaries in terms of the Republican \nnomination, but he is doing what a U.S. Senator ought to do, and that \nis look toward what is best for our country. What is best for our \ncountry right now is to back President Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes. If I could be \nnotified after 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, others have recounted mistakes and missed \nopportunities that have led us to this moment, a moment when 20,000 \nU.S. troops are either on their way or will shortly be on their way to \nBosnia.\n  I will not take the time of the Senate this evening to recount these \nfacts. They have been talked about in great detail already today.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, we are where we are. As we debate, and we \nhave debated three different resolutions today, the essential facts are \nas follows:\n  Fact No. 1: In 1993, the President made a commitment to deploy ground \ntroops in support of a Bosnia peacekeeping mission.\n  Fact 2: This guarantee was a condition or underlying understanding of \nthe entire Dayton peace agreement.\n  Fact 3: The President has now ordered these troops to Bosnia. Some \nhave already arrived.\n  Mr. President, the troops are going to Bosnia. They are going to \nBosnia no matter what this Congress does. They are going to Bosnia no \nmatter which resolution is approved or not approved. That is a fact.\n  Fact 4: There are clearly not sufficient votes in Congress to \noverride the President's veto of a bill that would prohibit funding of \nthe troops. In fact, earlier today, there were only 22 votes on this \nfloor--22 votes--to in fact cut off these funds.\n  Mr. President, with these facts in mind, what then should our \nobjectives be today as we debate these resolutions? What do we want to \naccomplish? What can we reasonably expect to accomplish?\n\n  Mr. President, the question before us today is I believe a rather \nnarrow one. Which resolution will be the most valuable in achieving our \nobjectives? What can Congress try to accomplish this evening?\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that we have three goals.\n  First, the most important, unconditionally support our troops.\n  Second, to enhance the odds of them leaving as scheduled within 1 \nyear.\n  And, third, to increase the chances of this mission being successful.\n  I believe the Dole resolution--Dole-McCain resolution--can help shape \nand help influence our Bosnia policy and can improve it. It does this \nin part by ensuring the training and arming of the Federation of \nBosnia, so that they can provide for their own defense after the NATO \ntroops leave.\n  Mr. President, the Dole resolution gives more support than any of \nother resolutions to our troops. The Dole resolution supports their \nmission and does so in clear terms. It ensures that America speaks with \na clearer voice.\n  Mr. President, for the above reasons, it is my intention this evening \nto vote in favor of the Dole-McCain resolution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, just 3 weeks ago, the warring parties in \nBosnia initialed a peace agreement in Dayton, OH. That announcement \nmarked the first real hope for an end to the tragic conflict in the \nBalkans which has left hundreds of thousands dead or injured and \nproduced over a million refugees. It was only with the dedication and \npersistence of U.S. negotiators present in Dayton that this accord was \nbrought to fruition. \n\n[[Page S18531]]\n\n  While everyone seems to agree that the administration deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for the success at the bargaining table, some \nquestion whether the United States should send troops to monitor and \nimplement the agreement. This is obviously a very serious question, and \nwe have an obligation in this Chamber to think through the implications \nof that decision.\n  The question arises, what are the United States national interests \nthat are at stake in Bosnia? The President addressed that issue in his \nspeech to the Nation on November 27. At that time, he made the case as \nto why this agreement serves America's interests, reflects American \nvalues, and requires American leadership.\n  There are many arguments that can be made about the ways that this \nagreement serves U.S. interests. For instance, that it will prevent the \nwar from spreading in a way that might lead to a much more costly and \ndangerous American involvement; that it will return peace and stability \nto a continent that is key to our economic and military security; and \nthat it reflects the United States moral and humanitarian interest in \nseeing an end to the bloodshed and violence.\n  All of these are very important considerations which should be \nweighed heavily.\n  Furthermore, choices are not always a matter of what is the best \ntheoretical option but what are the courses of action available to us \nat any particular moment in time. Right now, we have to decide between \nbacking the peace agreement, which we were instrumental in developing \nwith the undertaking of a U.S. military presence, or not taking part in \nthe NATO endeavor, which would mean no NATO endeavor and the breakdown \nof the peace agreement.\n  Viewing it from that perspective, I come to the conclusion that the \nrisks of missing this opportunity for peace are greater, significantly \ngreater than the risks of implementing it, although that course \ncertainly has its dangers. Let me discuss briefly the potential \nconsequences of not carrying through on the peace agreement.\n  First, I think the administration is correct in the view that without \na commitment of American troops as part of a NATO force, the peace \nagreement will not stand. Having helped the parties to reach this \npoint, the United States would completely undermine their confidence in \nthe agreement and their commitment to implement it if we do not \nparticipate. Should this happen, United States troops might well be \ncalled upon to evacuate United Nations protection forces in Bosnia, \nunder much more dangerous circumstances than our troops will face under \nthis agreement.\n  Second, it could seriously erode America's diplomatic strength. Our \nsuccess at conflict resolution is due not just to the skill and \ndetermination of our negotiators but also to the perception that the \nUnited States has the ability and the will to back up the agreements it \nmakes. This is not to say that the U.S. must contribute forces to every \npeace agreement it helps to negotiate. But in this instance, the U.S. \nundertaking was a major reason the agreement was reached.\n  Our decision on Bosnia, therefore, could have long-lasting \nimplications for the future of American leadership. It would be a major \nblow to U.S. world leadership if our failure to participate in this \ninstance undermined our ability to move the world in a peaceful \ndirection in other crises that might arise.\n  Third, it is imperative that a very clear distinction be made between \nthis operation and Operation Desert Storm, to which analogies have been \ndrawn. Let us remember that in the Iraqi situation the question was \nwhether to go to war--whether to undertake a military operation to \ndrive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. Here we are talking about helping \nto implement a peace at the invitation of all the parties to the \nconflict. That is not to say there are no dangers involved, nor that \nthe mission will be easy. But there is a major difference between going \nin to fight a war and going in to implement a peace.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the choices before us are difficult ones. We \nhave no assurances that, even with the participation of U.S. troops, \nthe peace in Bosnia will be successful in the long run. But it is clear \nnow that without our participation there will be no peace. The parties \nto the peace accord have made it plain that their confidence in a fair \nand evenhanded implementation of the agreement depends largely on \nAmerican leadership and on American participation in the peacekeeping \nforce.\n  Mr. President, consistent with our values and interests, we should \nexercise our leadership by supporting this opportunity for peace.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when I \nhave reached 6 minutes, if I reach that point.\n  Mr. President, I was not a Member of the Senate when the debate \noccurred on Desert Storm, but I was nevertheless glued to the \ntelevision watching every single person, back and forth across the \naisle, talking about their vote of conscience. I thought it was the \nSenate's finest hour. Now I find myself in the position of making a \nsimilar vote. Although we are not going to an actual war, we are \nnevertheless voting whether to send our troops into hostilities where \nthe President says we can expect casualties.\n  I feel so strongly, Mr. President, that this is the wrong decision. I \nfeel that it is the wrong decision and that the price that we might \nhave to pay for the mistake is too high. The cost of an American life \nis too high a price to support an erroneous decision.\n  I do not like not supporting the President in a foreign policy \nmatter. I think we should bend over backward to do that. But I look at \ntwo things. I look at my responsibility as a Member of Congress not to \nrubberstamp the President in the matter of going to war, and I cannot \ndo what I think is wrong when I also believe that we could have a small \nloss of face now to save a bigger disaster in the future.\n  We may lose a little face because we do something different from the \nactual commitment the President made. The President committed to 20,000 \ntroops on the ground for this peace agreement.\n  There were other things the President could have offered to help the \npeople of Bosnia keep a peace agreement. Arming and training the \nMoslems is the right thing to do. Although I cannot support the Dole-\nMcCain amendment, I do think they are right in insisting that the \narming and training of the Moslems happen; that it is consistent with \nthis Senate's vote time after time after time over the last 2 years to \nlift the arms embargo, because anyone who has been there, as I have \nbeen, believes that there will not be stability in that part of the \nworld until the three warring parties have some parity. That is what \nwill keep the factions from going after each other in the future.\n  So arming and training the Moslems could have been done without our \nhaving troops on the ground. That would have been a fair division with \nour allies, and it would have fulfilled the responsibilities of the \nUnited States. But that is not what the President did. The President \nsaid we will have troops on the ground. He raised the expectations, and \nnow we are voting whether to support that decision.\n  I wish to refer to an article that was written last month by James \nWebb, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the former \nadministration, the Bush administration. And he talks about the need \nfor strategic thinking, to determine exactly what our treaty \ncommitments are as we go into the post-cold-war era.\n  And he says: ``It is time that the United States had a global \nstrategy before it puts out any more fires.''\n  That really sums it up. We are running around the world putting out \nfires at the cost of billions of defense dollars and possibly hurting \nour long-term readiness for the future.\n  What he said we should be doing is absolutely correct. We should have \na set of principles from which we react to crises.\n  ``President Nixon,'' he quotes, ``was the last President that set out \na military policy, and it was fairly simple: Honor all treaty \ncommitments in responding to those who invade the lands of our \nallies.''\n  We have a NATO Treaty. If one of the NATO countries is invaded, we \nwould be obligated under that treaty to respond. \n\n[[Page S18532]]\n\n  This mission has expanded far beyond the NATO Treaty into a civil war \nin a non-NATO country, and yet we are being told NATO will fall if we \ndo not come through with troops on the ground. It does not hold water, \nand it does not adhere to that very good and sound principle.\n  The second principle: Provide a nuclear umbrella to the world against \nthe threats of other nuclear powers.\n  Mr. President, you know that we have debated theater missile defense \non this very floor within the last month, and it has been a bone of \ncontention. I strongly favor the theater missile defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 6 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, at the end of 4 minutes, I would like \nto be notified once again.\n  We must provide the theater missile defense that gives us the \numbrella to defend ourselves from the 16 countries that now have \nballistic missile capabilities. But sending troops into Bosnia is going \nto take $5 billion from our defense readiness and from the capability \nto provide that kind of technology in the future.\n  The third tenet set out is to provide weapons and technical \nassistance to other countries where warranted but do not commit \nAmerican forces to local conflicts. And that is exactly what we are \ndoing. These are principles of a superpower. These are principles that \nkeep the United States strong and uses our force when it is really \nnecessary to keep a threat to the security of our country from \nhappening.\n  Sending troops into Bosnia does not meet any of the tests of good, \nsound principles for our country, and we must make this President \nunderstand that there are many of us in Congress who do not believe he \nis within his power to go without consulting and asking the \nauthorization of Congress to commit 20,000 troops on the ground. That \nis why we must a adopt the resolution or get a good vote. I do not know \nthat it will be adopted. But I hope that there is a strong vote that \ntells the President that we need to sit down and have a strategy and \nthere is a difference between a U.S. security interest in which we \nwould put American troops in harm's way.\n  We all want to help the Bosnian people, and we can do it in many \nways. But troops on the ground, American lives at risk is not the right \nway.\n  Mr. President, finally, it has been said several times on the floor \nthat somehow it would not be supporting the troops to adopt the \nHutchison-Inhofe resolution. It is very clear. The resolution is \nsimple. Section 1 says:\n\n       The Congress opposes President Clinton's decision to deploy \n     United States military ground forces into Bosnia.\n\n  The second section says:\n\n       The Congress strongly supports the United States military \n     personnel who may be ordered by the President to implement \n     the peace framework.\n\n  We are supporting the troops. I think every Member of the U.S. Senate \nintends to support the troops. We are going about it in different ways. \nI believe supporting the troops is narrowing the mission, is saying \nthis is a mistake and, therefore, let us put a time limit on it, and if \nyou would consider changing your mind, that would be the best of all \nworlds. This is a dangerous mission, and we hope the President will \nhave every opportunity to reconsider this decision before it is too \nlate.\n  That is why we believe this resolution should be adopted to support \nthe troops by protecting them. Others may legitimately differ in \npassing the Dole resolution. Either way, we must support the troops, \nand I hope that we will adopt the resolution that opposes the President \nso that he will bring those troops home before the mass deployment \noccurs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, once again, this body is discussing the \ndifficult issue of U.S. policy toward Bosnia. I regret that we are \nstill here wrestling with this issue. I regret that American troops are \non their way to Bosnia. I regret that peace has yet to come to the \nformer Yugoslavia.\n  Americans have watched while some of the greatest atrocities since \nWorld War II have been committed in Europe. We have watched in despair \nas brutal strife has sundered families, neighborhoods, towns and \ncities, and the peoples of an entire region. We have recoiled in horror \nat the summary executions of draft-age-men, the rape and murder of \nwomen and children, and discoveries of mass graves. An inhumanity which \nwe thought long behind us has resurfaced with a shattering savagery.\n  It did not have to come to this. Ever since my first trip to the \nformer Yugoslavia in August 1992, I have been convinced that the U.N. \nor NATO needed to take a more aggressive role in enforcing U.N. \nmandates, protecting U.N. personnel and at certain critical moments, \nreducing Serb military capabilities through selective aerial bombing. \nYet, as we all know, international reluctance to take bold action, lack \nof consensus within NATO and the U.N. and political caution in Europe \nand the U.S. doomed any timely efforts to bring peace to the region.\n  I have also advocated lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia for \nseveral years. to me it is unconscionable that we would prevent Bosnia \nfrom defending itself against a vastly superior force, while at the \nsame time refusing to step in, or allowing others to step in, and stop \nethnic cleansing and the perpetuation of horrible atrocities against \nthe Bosnian people. This proved to be a disastrous policy with tragic \nconsequences. The only viable option seemed to me to be to lift the \narms embargo on Bosnia.\n  Over the last year, we have watched the European community struggle \nonce again to find a solution to this seemingly intractable problem. \nBut, as with past efforts, they fell apart in spite of strong U.S. \nsupport. It became clear to all involved that the only hope of ending \nthis tragedy was to have the U.S. take the lead in facilitating \nnegotiations between the parties. A belated but herculean effort by the \nClinton administration resulted in the Dayton discussions, and the \npersonal commitment of both the President and Secretary Christopher \nhelped bring the parties together at last. I applaud the \nadministration's intense efforts and believe the Dayton agreement \nprovides the proper framework for a viable peace if all parties to the \nagreement are committed to working for peace.\n  I continue to be reluctant to see U.S. ground troops sent to Bosnia. \nJust as we took the lead in Haiti, I believe the Europeans should take \nthe lead in the implementation of the Dayton agreement, particularly in \nproviding ground troops. The U.S. has been providing air cover and \nsurveillance for the past few years. And we provided much of the \nfirepower when the U.N. decided it would allow aggressive action \nagainst certain targets. I approved of these actions and believe we \nshould continue to play that role in the Dayton agreement \nimplementation force. I do not think that U.S. leadership at the \nbargaining table required us to assume responsibility for providing \none-third of all ground troops.\n  But the President made this commitment, and the option now before \nCongress is to support him at this stage in the process or perhaps \nprecipitate the collapse of the most promising chance for peace. Given \ncircumstances that we now cannot change, I do not believe there is \nreally a choice here. If we care about the moral principles on which \nthis Nation is built, if we care about the stability of Europe, for \nwhich we gave so many lives in two world wars, and if we take seriously \nthe full responsibility of world leadership, then we must act to \nsupport the President's commitment. He should have come to Congress \nearlier in the process. But he didn't, and this is not the time to \ndebate that issue further.\n  I am opposing the Hutchison resolution because I do not think \nanything productive comes from saying now that we oppose the commitment \nof U.S. troops. The time for such a statement has long passed. And \nstated in isolation from any constructive discussion about what our \nrole should be, I feel this approach is not helpful to resolving the \ntragedy of Bosnia.\n  I will support the Dole resolution, because I believe it moves us in \nthe right direction. I do this with reluctance on one point, however. \nThis resolution calls on the United States to lead an immediate \ninternational effort to provide equipment, arms and training to the \nBosnian Government Forces. I appreciate that this is seen as a way of \n\n[[Page S18533]]\naddressing the military imbalance that now exists between the parties. \nObviously, rough military parity is a critical requirement for a \nsuccessful NATO troop withdrawal. But I believe that balance ought to \nbe achieved by bringing down the level and sophistication of arms in \nthe region--not by raising it. Part of the problem in achieving peace \nand now enforcing it is that there are too many weapons in the region.\n  I am very concerned that focusing our efforts on arming the Bosnian \nGovernment instead of working to disarm and curtail arms flows into the \narea will merely stoke the fires for another explosion in Bosnia after \nwe leave. What good is rough parity if all it does is set the stage for \na resumption of the conflict after the withdrawal of the international \nforce?\n  After speaking today with Strobe Talbott, Acting Secretary of State, \nand Admiral Owens, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I am \nreassured that the administration is aware of the dangers of arming of \nthe region and that every effort is being made to draw down the \nquantity of arms in the region, not to build them up. I also understand \nthat General Shalikashvili is acutely aware of the potential danger to \nUnited States troops of direct United States involvement in arming, \nequipping, and training of the Bosnian Government Forces.\n  Tomorrow the President will witness the formal signing in Paris of \nthe Dayton agreement. It is crucial to American credibility that the \nU.S. Senate go on record supporting his efforts prior to that time. I \nhave received assurances that one area that will receive intense \nscrutiny in the coming weeks is this critical question of military \nbalance. The Dole resolution requests a plan from the administration in \n30 days. And it is critical to the safety of our troops that this issue \nbe successfully resolved in that time frame. Therefore, I will cast my \nvote today to advance this process--to Paris and the signing of an \naccord--with the support of the U.S. Senate.\n  Finally, let me say that none of this would be possible without the \nprofessionalism, dedication, and commitment of the U.S. Armed Forces. \nThe men and women who voluntarily serve under the Commander in Chief \nand who are now leaving their homes and families for a dangerous \nmission just before the holidays are the ones who make it possible to \nbring this hope of peace to Bosnia. We owe them a tremendous debt of \ngratitude and our hearts are with them. For it is they who put a face \non what America stands for, and who are willing to take risks to see \nthat others who want to live by these ideals are given a chance.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Hutchison-Inhofe \nresolution in opposition to the Clinton administration's decision to \nsend troops to Bosnia as part of the NATO Implementation Force, known \nas IFOR. I commend the Senators from Texas and Oklahoma and the other \ncosponsors of this resolution for their efforts in bringing it to the \nSenate floor. The resolution is brief, simple and to the point. It \nstates: ``Congress opposes President Clinton's decision to deploy \nUnited States military ground forces into the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina to implement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \nBosnia and Herzegovina and its associated annexes.''\n  Further, the resolution also states: ``Congress strongly supports the \nUnited States military personnel who may be ordered by the President to \nimplement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and its associated annexes.''\n  That is it. This resolution is the people's resolution, because it \naccurately reflects the views of the vast majority of the American \npeople. Most Americans oppose sending our brave soldiers to Bosnia. And \nfar more agree that, if the President insists on deployment, we must \nstand by our troops. Though we may disagree with our President, we must \nnot do so in a way that would put the lives of American soldiers in \nBosnia needlessly at risk.\n  Mr. President, debate on the use of United States troops should not \nbe put in terms of whether we support a peace agreement in Bosnia. We \nall want peace. No one disagrees with that. Few deserve the chance for \npeace and stability more than the families in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nWhat we have witnessed in the Balkans these past few years has been \nnothing less than tragic.\n  To his credit, the President has tried to achieve a negotiated peace \nframework. However, I am afraid that this peace agreement is fatally \nflawed in several respects. First, a large number of those responsible \nfor the atrocities--a level of mass slaughter unequaled since Hitler \nand Stalin--likely will go unpunished.\n  Second, the agreement assumes continued cooperation between the \nCroatia and Bosnian Moslem leadership. That is a dangerous assumption. \nThe fact is the Bosnian Moslems and the Croats often have been on \nopposing sides of this regional conflict. In fact, 2 years ago, Croat \nforces were launching attacks on Moslems in Mostar and the surrounding \ntownships.\n  This peace agreement and the President's plan to enforce it fly in \nthe face of history that dates back far longer than the last few years. \nThe recent atrocities we have witnessed are an intensification of a \nconflict that dates back at least five centuries. This is a regional \ncivil war. This is a civil war rooted in ethnic and religious \ndifferences. This is a civil war older than our own country. And at no \ntime in our history has this civil war represented a national security \nthreat to the United States. It was not a national security threat \nthen. It is not one now.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this is a flawed agreement because it does \nnot have the support of many in the affected regions. In the last few \nweeks, Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo have made it very clear they will not \nsupport this agreement and allow for Moslem control of Sarajevo. The \nresolve of the rank and file in Sarajevo to stand their ground brings \nimages and lessons to mind--of Beirut, Lebanon; Mogadishu, Somalia; and \nfrom my personal experience, of countless towns and villages in \nVietnam.\n  Mr. President, our troops represent the finest, best trained military \nforce on the planet. The fact is 20,000 of our finest soldiers cannot \nerase 500 years of hatred and bloodshed. Peace will not come from the \nresolve of American soldiers. Peace must come and must last from the \nresolve of the Bosnians, the Croats, and the Serbians to say and \nbelieve that more than five centuries of conflict is enough.\n  In fact, the injection of foreign troops into a civil war would only \nwork to prolong the conflict in the long term. Our own Civil War would \nhave lasted far longer and been far more devastating had Europe \nintervened. That was why President Lincoln worked tirelessly to prevent \nEurope's involvement. Though we will never know for certain, I believe \nLincoln's efforts and Europe's decision not to intervene ultimately \nsaved lives--American and European. Similarly, in the long run, I \nbelieve we could save more lives--American and European--by pursuing \nother means to achieve a lasting peace other than the limited \ndeployment of IFOR.\n  Mr. President, I know what it is like to serve my country in a \nmission that did not have the clear support of the American people. I \nam a Vietnam veteran, a former second lieutenant in the United States \nArmy. I am proud to have served my country in Vietnam. However, it was \nmy hope that this Nation learned a few lessons--lessons that would make \nclear that sending troops to Bosnia is a serious mistake.\n  It is my hope that the President will reconsider his decision to \ndeploy United States troops to Bosnia. However, my fondest wishes and \ncurrent reality are worlds apart. The President has demonstrated his \nresolve to defy the wishes of the American people and the clear history \nof the region and put our troops in harm's way. That being the case, \nand once the troops are deployed, it is my hope that we in Congress \nwill not do anything to jeopardize the safety of our troops. However, \nthat should not deter us from closely monitoring the situation in \nBosnia, just as we did in Somalia, and just as we did in Haiti. I \nintend to do so. The people of South Dakota, especially the families of \nthe soldiers who may be deployed there, deserve no less.\n  Finally, my thoughts and prayers are with the brave young men and \nwomen who have been called to serve in or in support of the Bosnia \nmission, as well as their families and friends. I know this is a very \ndifficult time. I know \n\n[[Page S18534]]\nwhat it is like to tell family members that I will be serving my \ncountry in a conflict half a world away. And now I know what it is like \nto learn that a member of my own family has been called to serve. My \nnephew Steve Pressler, son of my brother Dan and his wife Marcia, has \nbeen called to duty as part of an eight-member South Dakota National \nGuard unit that has been put on alert. It truly brings the matter home, \nboth for my family and the other families with members who have been \ncalled to duty.\n  Again, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison \nresolution--the people's resolution. The President needs to understand \nthat, as the people's representatives, we support the well-being of our \ntroops, but we cannot support a policy that puts the lives of our \ntroops on the line without a clear national security purpose. The \npolicy is wrong. Our troops should not go.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say to my colleagues that \nPresident Clinton's decision to send United States troops to monitor \nthe peace in Bosnia should not be a partisan issue. The President has \ndecided to send American troops on a NATO peacekeeping mission in \nBosnia; as Commander in Chief, the Constitution empowers him to do so. \nPresident Reagan exercised this power to send troops to Lebanon and \nGrenada; President Bush used this power to send troops to Panama and \nthe Persian Gulf. As a newly elected Member of the United States \nSenate, I supported President Bush in sending troops to Panama, and I \nwas 1 of 11 Democrats to vote for a resolution in support of Operation \nDesert Storm. I intend to support President Clinton as well, \nnotwithstanding any reservations I may have about sending troops to \nBosnia.\n  I do have serious misgivings about the deployment of American ground \ntroops in the Balkan region; I wish that the President had not \ncommitted them. This is a high-risk mission, and the American people \nneed to understand, as the President has stated, that casualties are \nalmost inevitable. Some months ago I supported lifting the arms \nembargo, an embargo which prevented the Bosnian Moslems from securing \nthe weapons necessary to defend themselves. Unfortunately, that embargo \nwas never lifted. If it has been lifted, the Bosnian Moslems would have \nhad the weapons they needed and American forces may never have been \ndeployed.\n  I have two primary apprehensions about the assignment of troops to \nBosnia; I am concerned that the mission need to be adequately defined, \nand I am concerned about the details of the United States exit \nstrategy. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have \nhad the opportunity to question closely Secretary of Defense Perry and \nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Shalikashvili when they appeared \nbefore the committee. They have assured me that the mission is narrowly \ndefined and is confined to (a) the marking of the cease-fire line, \ninter-entity boundary line, and zones of separation, and (b) the \nmonitoring and enforcement of the withdrawal of forces to their \nrespective territories within the agreed period. With this mission so \nnarrowly defined, I believe that we can avoid problems with mission \ncreep we have faced in the past where troops have been committed \nwithout careful thought to what the goals of the mission were. Somalia \nis a case in point. Both Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili are \nconvinced that the Bosnia mission can be accomplished in 1 year. \nFurthermore, U.S. troops are not going to be responsible for nation-\nbuilding, refugee relocation, or other humanitarian activities. They \nhave also assured me that the decision to leave the region will be up \nto the United States and the United States alone, and other NATO \ncountries have pledged to follow our lead.\n  I believe the United States has played a critical role in this peace \nprocess. Without U.S. diplomatic involvement, the peace talks in Dayton \nwould never have come about. Without the United States, this bloody war \nmay never have ended. We have brought the Balkan peace process along \nthis far, it would be terribly disingenuous for us to bail out now. The \nPresident has encouraged our allies to support this mission and all \nNATO countries with troops have pledged their support. It would be a \ntragedy for the United States to let the NATO countries down now, \nespecially since we have done so much to promote peace in Bosnia.\n  The Congress has taken responsibility in this process as well. We \nsought to define the mission and a bipartisan congressional coalition \nhas worked to insure that the mission is strongly defined and the exit \nstrategy is clarified. We have an obligation to insure that the mission \ncan be successfully executed. We know that the U.S. uniformed services \nare the best in the world, and we should stand proudly behind them.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose President Clinton's \nplan to send America's sons and daughters into Bosnia. On Monday \nevening, President Clinton asked Congress and the American people to \nsupport a policy that transforms the world's greatest fighting force \ninto a band of peace enforcers and nation builders.\n  Unfortunately, this President is a poor student of history. He has \nquickly forgotten the tragic lessons of Somalia and Beirut. I can \nassure you, Mr. President, the families of those killed in those \nfaraway places are reminded every day and will not soon forget the \nconsequences of this type of ill-conceived foreign policy.\n  President Clinton wants us to support an undetermined scheme to \nenforce a precarious peace between factions that have been at war for \nalmost 4 years and fighting each other for generations. He tells us it \nwill take 20,000 American troops and less than a year. Mr. President, \nless than a year to bring peace to a place that has not known peace in \nrecent memory?\n  President Clinton tells us that our troops will be peacekeepers and \nnot war fighters. They will be neutral brokers of an agreed upon \nsettlement between warring parties. The problem with this, Mr. \nPresident, is that we are not a neutral party in this conflict. \nPresident Clinton himself admits that we chose sides.\n  We imposed economic sanctions on Serbia and were an active \nparticipant in a sustained air assault on Bosnian Serb targets. To add \ninsult to injury, the administration also proposes that we train the \nBosnian Federation while we enforce the peace. Is there any doubt that \nthe Serbs will view our presence as something less than neutral?\n  Mr. President, why is this any different than Beirut or Somalia and \ncan we really expect a different result?\n  President Clinton said that we will send 20,000 of our troops. How \ndid he determine that we would need 20,000 troops to enforce the peace?\n  Earlier this year President Clinton imprudently promised to commit up \nto 25,000 U.S. ground forces long before there was peace, before there \nwas a plan, before there was a mission, and before we had any idea \nwhether it would be necessary to become involved at all. Recently, the \nPresident told us that he still has not seen the plan.\n  As yet, there is no clearly defined mission, no attainable military \ngoals and no way to measure success. However, President Clinton knows \nthat we will send 20,000 of our troops to implement this unknown plan. \nMr. President, without well-defined and achievable military goals, I \nfear that the world's finest fighting forces are about to be used as \nglobal hall-monitors, sitting ducks for disgruntled belligerents.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that the administration has yet to establish \nany credible case for this deployment.\n  President Clinton also tells us that the United States must lead when \nNATO is involved. Of course the United States must lead, but the \nPresident has equated leadership with American ground troops.\n  American ground forces offer no tactical or operational advantage to \na Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for our \nreluctant European allies. The Balkans are historically a matter of \nconcern to Western Europe. If they do not believe the problem is \nimportant enough to solve--then we certainly should not.\n  President Clinton apparently believes that the United States must \ndeploy troops in Bosnia to preserve NATO and that NATO is the proper \nvehicle for peace in Bosnia. Mr. President, by any measure this would \ngreatly expand the alliance's mandate to include missions never even \nremotely contemplated by NATO's founders.\n\n[[Page S18535]]\n\n  NATO was intended to be a military alliance to deter a Soviet attack \non Western Europe. There is no doubt that the United States has a vital \ninterest in the continent's security. President Clinton proposes, \nhowever, that we transform the basic mission of NATO from an \norganization that guards Western Europe from attack, into an \norganization that intervenes in civil disputes and parochial conflicts \nof nonmember states.\n  Mr. President, we should never seek to preserve an alliance unless \nthat alliance serves the purposes for which it was crated. NATO was not \ncreated to be the arbiter of civil disputes nor should it seek to \nbecome one.\n  What did President Clinton not tell us? He did not tell us how our \ntroops will get out. He told us that it should last only 1 year, but as \nformer Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified before \nthe Armed Services Committee, ``An exit date is not an exit strategy.'' \nTo compound the problem, the administration will be under enormous \npressure to succeed. Especially in an election year.\n  Without clearly defined military missions and goals, mission creep is \ninevitable. As President Clinton expands the mission he will be \ncompelled to escalate American military efforts to meet the \nrequirements of new missions. This sounds very familiar, Mr. President.\n  President Clinton also did not tell the American people how much this \nwill cost them. Some estimates run as high as $2 billion and that is \nbased on a best-case scenario. Mr. President, military planning must \ntake into account the worst-case scenario. Our fighting forces must be \nprepared for any contingency.\n  Again, I fear that this administration has not prepared for \nunexpected events which are inevitable in any military operation. This \ncould be critical not only to the financial cost of the operation, but \nto the incalculable human cost as well.\n  President Clinton asked the American people to choose peace. Mr. \nPresident, the American people do choose peace. We hope for a lasting \nend to the Bosnian civil war that has raged for so long. The American \npeople and this body will support the President in his efforts to end \nthe fighting, but we will not commit our fighting men and women when we \nhave no vital national interest at stake. Just saying we have a vital \ninterest, Mr. President, does not make it so. President Clinton has \nfailed to make the case to the American people, and this body should \nnot support a deployment of American troops to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about the \ndeployment of American troops in Bosnia. I certainly have concerns \nabout the stability of the peace accord reached in Dayton. I have \nconcerns about the potential disruption that Bosnian Serbs and other \nantipeace factions of the various affected parties may create. And I \nhave no illusions about the vulnerability of Americans--our Nation's \nmen and women who will be part of the Peace Implementation Force in \nBosnia--to innumerable dangers as a result of this deployment. But \nleadership is not risk-free, Mr. President.\n  It is clear that even as we are debating this issue, United States \ntroops are participating in the NATO effort to implement the Bosnia \npeace agreement. Every nation in Europe--in Western Europe and Eastern \nEurope, even Russia--is deploying troops as part of the peace accord. \nThe achievements that were reached after painstaking negotiations \nbetween Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Croatian President Franjo \nTudjman, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with support and \nfacilitation by United States representatives, particularly Secretary \nof State Christopher and Assistant Secretary of State Richard \nHolbrooke, have generated the best chance yet of achieving a stable \noutcome for the Baltic region. It is clear that U.S. support of this \nNATO effort is essential if we are to maintain our leadership role in \nthe world, and if the peace enforcement effort is to succeed.\n  The November 21 peace agreement calls for the creation of a 60,000 \nmember implementation force [I-FOR], which will be comprised of 30 \ncountries. I-FOR's mission is not to side with the combatants, but is \nrather to monitor and enforce compliance with the military aspects of \nthe settlement. I have listened carefully to testimony from defense and \nforeign policy experts on the use of military forces to enforce a peace \nregime. None of them has identified this as an easy mission and all \nhave concerns. While I feel there are many risks which may potentially \ndisrupt NATO's efforts to secure peace in the region, I agree with \nformer National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft that ``disaster is \ncertain if the U.S. backs out of the situation now.''\n  Mr. President, I do not support an open-ended time frame to \nmaintaining peace indefinitely in the region. I think that the debates \nthis Chamber has had, the testimony that has been provided to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, and the dialog that many here have had \nwith the President and Secretary Perry have underscored the critical \nsignificance of limiting the scope of our mission in Bosnia. I am \nconfident that the President is committed to the 1-year time frame and \nis committed to the limited objectives he has presented--namely, \nseparating the parties and maintaining the cease-fire. And I have been \nassured that those who attack our forces or impede this process will be \ndealt with swiftly and decisively.\n  Mr. President, our troops are on the ground today in Bosnia; we are \nthere, and we need to support our men and women. Congress should not \nwithhold funds that are needed to support our troops, and we should not \ntie the President's hands during this time when American leadership \nmatters so very much. My vote is to approve of U.S. participation in \nthe NATO initiative.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what the Senate is faced with amounts \nto a shotgun wedding. The Congress and American troops find themselves \nconfronting an unfortunate mistake, but one which we are now obliged to \nmake the best of. Our decision--each Senator's choice--is whether we \nrespond to the situation with a sense of honor and accountability or \nwhether we abandon our principles and responsibility.\n  I am not happy with our choice. I don't think any one of us welcomes \nthe prospect of sending American soldiers into Bosnia. I share the \nMajority Leader's view that we would not have been presented with this \ndecision if the administration had worked as methodically to lift the \nembargo on Bosnia as it did to advance the deal in Dayton. But, at this \nstage it matters less how we got here--it is of far graver consequence \nhow we proceed.\n  Why should we look forward and not back?\n  Because we do not have the option or choice to change the course of \nevents. The agreement has been signed, now we must decide what kind of \nmission we will carry out and how we will assure it succeeds.\n  We are now presented with two unambiguous facts--the first being that \nthe Dayton agreement would not have been reached without aggressive, \nrational U.S. leadership. This is not, after all the Tashkent Treaty. \nLeaders from many other nations have tried repeatedly to negotiate a \nsettlement, but it was largely American diplomatic efforts which \nproduced results.\n  And, just as the U.S. role meant the difference between a settlement \nand continued blood shed, so too, the immediate parties to the \nagreement and our allies in Europe believe we have a unique authority \nand capability to guarantee the accord's successful implementation.\n  But, the second fact is more important and that is that the President \nof the United States has made the commitment to deploy 20,000 Americans \nin support of a NATO Implementation Force to secure the accord. Whether \nwe like it or not, those troops are going, indeed some are on the \nground. To deny our support for Operation Joint Endeavor, flatly \nrepudiates our long standing NATO security obligations and undermines \nour troops committed to the effort.\n  The credibility of American leadership and American treaty \ncommitments are the interests which are very much at stake if we now \nfail to fulfill the President's decision. Just after the President's \nOval Office address, Henry Kissinger observed, ``if we do not honor the \nPresident's words, the threat to our security would be greater because \nnobody would believe we are capable of conducting serious foreign \npolicy.'' \n\n[[Page S18536]]\n\n\n  President Bush, who so capably led this country beyond deep anxieties \nabout committing our Nation to war in the Persian Gulf echoed that \nsentiment. He pointed out, ``If it is seen that the President does not \nhave the support of the Congress--our standing as leader of the free \nworld and the standing of NATO would be dramatically diminished. That \nmust not happen.''\n  Now, we must make certain that our troops have the means to succeed. \nWe must guarantee they are assured every conceivable operational \nadvantage and the unqualified support of both the public and Congress.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe this Nation is by nature indifferent \nto international concerns--there is no inherent isolationist point of \nview. But the public is clearly troubled by this decision--they now \nseem at best divided and at worst deeply opposed to the President's \ndecision.\n  I attribute the confusion to 3 years of flip flops, reversals, and \nirrational foreign policy inconsistent with our national interests. The \npublic has little reason to believe that this time the administration \nwill stay on track with a limited mission that protects our Nation's \ninterests and our soldiers lives.\n  That is why I think it is incumbent on Congress to assure absolute \naccountability regarding the scope of the mission, the costs and the \nstrategy for withdrawing our forces. We have a clear and compelling \nresponsibility to the troops we are deploying to guarantee they are \nwell equipped and are carrying out limited, achievable goals.\n  Unfortunately, there are already contradictions and uncertainties \nemerging which will only plague the administration's desire to \nstrengthen public support. Last week, Secretary Perry testified before \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that our financial burden would \nbe limited to support for our troops. Within a matter of days, the \nDefense Department submitted a letter notifying Congress of the \npossibility of transferring $300 million in defense articles and \nservices to nations participating in I-For. Apparently, DOD anticipates \nreimbursement for this support, but those of us who monitor the United \nNations have serious reservations about the reliability of these \npromissory notes.\n  The administration cannot afford to allow any ambiguity to creep into \nthe public debate about the scope of our responsibilities. One of the \nreasons I support the resolution drafted by the leader is the \nrequirement that the administration provide a full accounting of the \nmission, rules of engagement, command arrangements, goals, compliance \nwith the agreements and all costs to all agencies involved in this \nendeavor. The leader's resolution is the best protection our troops \nhave that their government will not fail them as they carry out their \nduties with skill and honor.\n\n  But, the real key to success and the heart of my support for the \nLeadership resolution is the requirement that the United States lead an \nimmediate effort to provide equipment, arms, training and related \nlogistics to enable Bosnia to provide for its own defense.\n  Mr. President, I do not think it is wise to establish an arbitrary \ndate for the exit of American troops. That only guarantees a cooling \noff period before fighting resumes. We have seen the destructive \nconsequences of just such an approach in Somalia. Knowing our departure \nwas imminent, the warlords bided their time. Somalia today is \nindistinguishable from the chaos and anarchy which preceded our \narrival.\n  That must not happen in the Balkans.\n  Our mission can only be deemed a success if we contribute to a \ndurable solution, securing a lasting regional stability and peace. \nStability and peace demand a military balance between the Serbs and the \nBosnian-Croat Federation.\n  I realize that there are members with major misgivings about the \npossible consequences of lifting the embargo and arming and training \nthe Bosnians. They want to allow the so called arms build down process \nto have time to take affect. Unfortunately, there are far too many \nunanswered questions about the arms reduction program to risk Bosnia's \nfreedom and long term prospects for stability.\n  At this point it is entirely unclear who will assume the \nresponsibility for enforcing arms control. As the Dayton agreement is \nconstructed, the immediate reach of the disarmament regime is limited \nto the NATO patrolled cease-fire zones of separation. This makes \nobvious sense for the security of our soldiers, but offers no iron clad \nguarantees for the reduction of massive Serb stockpiles within the \nboundaries of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  Let me add one final historical observation on arming the Bosnians. I \nthink a majority of members in this chamber would share the view that \nit was not SALT or START agreements which brought about the demise of \nthe Soviet Union. Arms control initiatives may reduce risks, but any \nlevel headed assessment of the Cold War reaches the conclusion that it \nwas the credibility of our military power which guaranteed our security \nand global stability. So too, in the Balkans--only a credible military \nbalance will minimize the risk of the war reigniting.\n  Mr. President, in 1990 the American public was ambivalent about the \nnotion of sending Americans to war in the gulf. We all know just how \nclose the vote was in the Senate.\n  From a parochial perspective, 20,000 soldiers deployed from \nKentucky--if my memory serves me it was the largest contingent from any \nState. George Bush faced formidable opposition from families in \nKentucky, but he was able to overcome their concerns by exercising \nleadership. In the words of his Secretary of State, ``The U.S. had in \nGeorge Bush a leader who was consistent, principled, decisive and \nstrong.''\n  Those have not been the words most of the members of this chamber \nwould use to describe the President's record in foreign policy so far. \nI think it is worth noting very few Kentuckians have been called up for \ndeployment in Bosnia--a handful compared to the gulf. Yet, there is \nmore pronounced, stronger opposition to the President's decision to \ndeploy U.S. troops to secure peace than there was to Bush's decision to \nwage war.\n  President Clinton has made the decision to deploy American troops to \nend the suffering, stop the war from spreading, and to build a Europe \nat peace. He has argued that this can only be achieved if the United \nStates continues to lead. I take this pledge seriously.\n  Congress and American troops now stand at an altar--let us all hope \nand work to assure that it is not one which involves the unnecessary \nsacrifice of American lives. But as we proceed, let us share the \nunderstanding that there are crucial U.S. interests at stake. The lives \nof American soldiers and the credibility of American leadership and our \nsecurity commitments to NATO now hang precariously in the balance. We \nmust speak with one voice and honor the President's pledge.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the role of the United States in the world \nis unique. America has played a historic role in opposing tyranny, and \ngiving hope to people denied their freedom. Similarly, our military has \nplayed a central and unparalleled role in the world. Only the U.S. \nArmed Forces combine the ability to achieve enormous and complicated \nmilitary objectives with the commitment to use this force in pursuit of \nthe values that made our Nation great--freedom, justice, democracy, and \nthe protection of basic human rights.\n  Despite a great deal of theorizing about the so-called new world \norder, our role in the world should remain the same as it was \nthroughout the cold war. Certainly, our interests remain the same. Even \nwhen not pitted against the Soviet Union and its Communist expansionism \nwe can identify our interests clearly.\n  In Bosnia, they were deterrence of aggression, support for the right \nof self defense, abhorrence of ethnic cleansing, and support for multi-\nethnic democracy. President Clinton's 1992 campaign emphasized all of \nthese issues. His policy as President has reflected none of them.\n  Since early on in the conflict, I supported lifting the embargo on \nthe Bosnian Government and helping the Bosnian people to defend \nthemselves. In my view this was required on moral grounds. It was also \nthe strategically and militarily sound course. But most of all, it was \nbased on the right of individuals and nations to defend their freedom.\n  The embargo condemned the people of Bosnia to a slow death, carried \nout not only by military engagements but also by savage attacks on \ncivilians.\n\n[[Page S18537]]\n\n  Serbia came to the war with a massive advantage in arms and \nthroughout the war was able to acquire the arms it needed from other \nsources. The Bosnian Government's forces were at an extreme \ndisadvantage. Aligning the United States with the embargo and the \ndenial of Bosnia's right of self-defense was a disgrace. If this \nadministration had pursued a policy of lifting the arms embargo and \nallowing the Bosnians to defend themselves, negotiations would have \nbeen conducted from a position of strength and U.S. troops would not \nhave been required.\n  Instead, this administration favored negotiation, compromise, and \nconcession even when it was painfully obvious that only the threat of \nforce and the willingness to use it by the Bosnians would allow any \nhope of democracy and freedom in Bosnia.\n  Ironically, the President now has found a use for force, not to \npromote freedom, but to try to enforce an unjust agreement. President \nClinton has committed U.S. troops and credibility to implement an \nagreement which, as this resolution says, ``ratifies the results of \nethnic cleansing and territorial aggression.''\n  This agreement is the inevitable result of the administration's \npolicy of refusing to allow the Bosnian Government to defend itself \nand--let's be frank--its sentences the people of Bosnia to a peace of \nsubservience and domination.\n  Peace has many forms. There is the so-called peace of the former \nSoviet bloc where the ever present threat of force subjugated the \nnations of Eastern and Central Europe. Bosnia and the countries of the \nformer Yugoslavia were supposed to have escaped that domination. \nInstead, another venal and dangerous threat arose.\n  In the former Yugoslavia, the threat was complicated by historical \nrivalries and ethnic and religious differences. The administration \nseized on the complexity of the situation and used it as an excuse to \ndo nothing. ``There are no good guys,'' the administration said. Or \n``it's a civil war.''\n  The peace being imposed on the people of Bosnia is the peace of \ndomination and fear. Unless the Bosnian Government is given the means \nto defend itself now, we can expect that the war will continue.\n  We should not be in this position. It was avoidable. However, the \ndecision to commit U.S. troops and prestige has been made by the \nPresident in his constitutionally prescribed role as Commander-in-\nChief.\n  The Congressional role in providing funds for military operations is \nalso set forth in the Constitution. Congress could exercise its \nconstitutional power to deny the funds to carry out this or any other \nmilitary mission. The President would certainly veto such a measure. \nWithout the votes to override, ultimately, he would prevail.\n  Nothing would be served by undercutting the men and women of our \nArmed Forces at this late date. U.S. troops have already begun arriving \nand more are on the way. A strong vote against the deployment would \ndemoralize our troops and embolden those who would like to see the \nDayton settlement collapse.\n  Congress must back our troops unconditionally and work to make \ncertain they have everything they need to carry out their mission. If \nwe learned anything from Somalia, it is that no corners can be cut \nwhere our troops are concerned. Their rules of engagement, their \nequipment, their training, everything about their mission, must be \ndesigned to remove all unnecessary risk. We can and we must achieve \nthis for the young men and women serving their country.\n  This resolution allows the President to fulfill his commitment to \ndeploy U.S. forces to implement the General Framework Agreement so long \nas the mission of the United States forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nlimited to enforcement of the military provisions of the Dayton \nAgreement, that the exit strategy includes establishment of a military \nbalance enabling the government of Bosnia to defend itself, and that \nthe U.S. will lead an immediate international effort to provide \nequipment, arms, training and related logistics assistance of the \nhighest possible quality to the Bosnian government.\n  These determinations are essential. In the last few weeks, the \nadministration has made contradictory statements about U.S. intentions \nto help equip and train the Bosnian Government. On the one hand, the \nadministration said it will help train and equip the Bosnian side. On \nthe other hand, officials have said arming the Bosnian Government \nforces would not be necessary because provisions in the Dayton \nAgreement call for negotiated arms limitation agreements.\n  That sends exactly the wrong signal. This war was made possible by \nthe inability of the Bosnian Government to defend itself. Late \nyesterday, the President made the commitment to lead the effort to arm \nand train the Bosnian Government forces. In light of the \nadministration's recent ambivalence about arming and training the \nBosnian Government forces, I expect that the administration will show, \nstarting today, concrete steps toward fulfilling this commitment to the \nUnited States Congress and to the Bosnian Government, including getting \na commitment of support from our allies. The Congress expects that \ncommitment to be kept as a condition for passing the Dole-McCain \nresolution.\n  There is very little satisfying about the peace agreement reached at \nDayton. As President Izetbegovic of Bosnia said, ``this may not be a \njust agreement but it is more just than the continuation of war.'' That \nis little to go on for the people of Bosnia, but it will have to do.\n  Our role in brokering this settlement makes it incumbent upon us to \nhelp enforce it. Our role in the world, and the unique role our \nmilitary has played as a force for freedom requires that we work to \nestablish a military balance which will protect Bosnia from future \naggression. Therefore I support our troops as they endeavor to carry \nout the United States military mission in Bosnia.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I rise to speak about American \nparticipation in enforcing the Bosnian peace agreement to be signed in \nParis this week, I want to begin by making clear my firm belief that \nU.S. participation in this action is the wrong thing to do.\n  I would note here a few of the many reasons for taking this position:\n  The Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, and others in the region have been \nfighting for hundreds of years, creating generational hatreds which no \n``piece of paper'' is going to stop.\n  There are many elements in the region, not least the Bosnian Serbs--\nthe main belligerents--who are unhappy with this settlement and will do \neverything they can to upset it, including by attacking our forces.\n  There is no clear national interest in our involvement in this \nendeavor other than, to some, the preservation of our leadership in \nNATO.\n  However, the question then is: ``is this the issue upon which the \nfuture of NATO should be decided?'' I certainly hope not.\n  U.S. troops will be in the middle of a situation fraught with \nantagonism and hatred. They will have to be arbiters, for example, of \nwho lives where, who gets trained, who is ``right'' in the inevitable \nthousands of disputes which will arise.\n  Inevitably, they'll become participants, and in that part of the \nworld that means they'll be victims of the violence they are supposed \nto prevent.\n  The map to which the parties have agreed is a disaster and creates \nungovernable nations which the parties will, long after this incident \nis over, inevitably begin to fight about again.\n  There is no realistic ``exit strategy'' because there is no \nlikelihood that these incredibly difficult problems are going to be \nresolved in 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, or even 100 years.\n  Mr. President, there are countless other reasons why this is the \nwrong thing to do. My colleagues will be discussing them at great \nlength, so there is no reason for me to note them here.\n\n\n                the issue of congressional authorization\n\n  Rather I would like to discuss another aspect of this issue.\n  Mr. President, eventually the constitutional issue of whether the \nPresident must have authorization from Congress to participate in such \nventures will be decided in the Congress' favor.\n  However, in the meantime, we have a reality, a sad reality: the \nPresident can make this deployment even without congressional \nauthorization or support.\n  He's going to do so without congressional authorization or even \ncongressional support. In fact he's going to do it even if the Congress \ndisapproves.\n\n[[Page S18538]]\n\n  This is unfortunate, and I think the President will regret acting in \nthis way at a time when the Congress and, I believe, the overwhelming \nmajority of the American people, have serious doubts about this policy.\n\n\n                     We have to support our troops\n\n  Mr. President, that is the reality.\n  We in Congress have to deal as best we can with that reality--that \nour troops are going to Bosnia, to Croatia, to Hungary, and elsewhere \nin the Balkans--by doing everything in our power to support our \nmilitary men and women.\n  In short, our forces are going into a situation with many risks, with \nmany dangers, with the potential for many of them to be injured or \nkilled during their tour of duty. As they do so, we have to do several \nthings: Make sure they have rules of engagement which allow them to \ndefend themselves and deal with threats to themselves, including by \nforce; make sure they have sufficient back up, including support forces \nin the region and air support to deal with threat; and, most \nimportantly, make sure they know that no matter what the political \ndifferences at home, they have the 100 percent support of all \nAmericans.\n  In sum, Mr. President, no matter how much we oppose this policy, and \nno matter how the situation evolves in the Balkans, we have to be \nprepared to show our forces, in every way possible, that they have our \nfull and unequivocal support.\n\n\n                               The future\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that it is essential that \nthe Congress, with its oversight responsibilities, watch very carefully \nhow this situation evolves, how our forces are treated, and how this \ncomplex and convoluted peace agreement is implemented.\n  As we do so, we must be prepared to take appropriate action if what I \nfirmly believe are the overly optimistic predictions of the \nadministration do not come true.\n  That too is an absolutely essential part of our support for our \ntroops as they face this risky, dangerous, unprecedented, and, in my \nview, unfortunate endeavor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the decision on Bosnia is extremely \ndifficult. But I believe our responsibility is clear.\n  The United States is being asked to participate in a peacekeeping \nmission by all the parties to the dispute in Bosnia. They say that \nwithout our participation, there will be no chance for peace.\n  It is important to remember that we are being asked to enforce an \nagreed upon peace. We are not being asked to wage war.\n  It is in our interest to help prevent the spread of this conflict to \nthe rest of Europe. And it is morally right to help stop the slaughter \nand atrocities that have repeatedly occurred.\n  However, I have always thought that Bosnia was primarily the \nEuropean's responsibility. This conflict is in their backyard. It most \ndirectly affects their interests.\n  I also have serious doubts whether peace can be secured in 1 year. \nThe history of the region is one of strife and struggle. There has been \nconflict in the Balkans for hundreds of years. For 45 years after World \nWar II, the differences were suppressed by Marshal Tito. But when he \npassed from the scene, the old enmities resumed as violently as before.\n  Despite these serious doubts, I am persuaded we ought to help give \nthe parties a chance to build the peace they say they want. They have \nsaid they are tired of war, and asked us and 25 other nations to give \nthem the opportunity they need to try to craft a lasting peace.\n  Most importantly, I believe we must send a strong message of support \nfor our troops, who are helping to create an opportunity for peace in \nBosnia. Anything less will add to the risks that the brave men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces will face.\n  I have therefore decided to support the Dole-McCain resolution \nsupporting our troops and limiting the mission they are expected to \nfulfill.\n  I will continue to carefully monitor our involvement to ensure that \nthis mission does not expand beyond the limited one being authorized \ntonight.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nDole-McCain resolution regarding the deployment of United States troops \nin Bosnia.\n  I would like to begin my remarks by commending the respected majority \nleader for his skill and leadership in this sensitive and vital area. I \nemphasize the word ``leader,'' because true leadership has been \nrequired here and has been much evident.\n  There is, I believe it is fair to say, a great amount of shared rich \nfeeling here in the Senate about this deployment. There is a palpable \nfeeling of trepidation about this mission, on both sides of the aisle. \nFew in this body are certain that sending troops is the right thing to \ndo, and for that reason, would not have voted to do it. At the same \ntime, there is considerable sentiment here that we should do eveything \npossible to fully support our troops once they are there, and to avoid \nany appearance of undercutting our Commander in Chief. To undercut our \ncommand structure while American troops are in harm's way is something \nthat most Senators earnestly wish to avoid.\n  I believe that the Senate has plaintively wished to give voice \nsimultaneously to these two conflicting impulses. The majority leader's \ninitiative has made it possible for us to do so.\n  Turning that shared feeling into a constructive statement of policy \nis a tremendously difficult task. It requires not only considerable \npolitical skill and courage, but a detailed recognition of the factors \nconfronting our forces in Bosnia, and confronting our President.\n  First, I do believe that there is broad agreement here about the \nPresident's constitutional authority, as Commander in Chief, to deploy \nU.S. forces to defend U.S. interests abroad. We in Congress do have the \nconstitutional right and duty to be involved in fundamental decisions \nof war and peace. But the principal ways in which we do this are--\nfirst, to declare war ourselves, a congressional prerogative, and \nsecond, to use our power over the purse to limit the military operation \npursued by the President. We do retain that power. But otherwise, we \nrecognize that it is the President, not the Congress, who has the \nauthority to command the Armed forces, within the limits of what \nCongress is willing to fund.\n  Earlier today, we voted as to whether to forbid the President to use \nDOD funds to support a deployment in Bosnia. Buy a 77 to 22 vote, we \ndecided that we would not curtail such funding. Thus I believe that it \nis now incumbent upon the Congress to maximize the chances of success \nfor the mission which the President has seen fit to initiate.\n  The President's decision to deploy U.S. forces is associated with his \ncommitting the United States to do its share in upholding a peace \nnegotiated between the warring parties. I have my own grave doubts \nabout whether this peace will hold. It may indeed hold, but I do not \nbelieve that it will hold simply because United States, British, \nFrench, or other NATO forces are present. If the warring parties in \nBosnia are not satisfied with the terms of the peace, they will take \nout their hostilities on whichever forces are in this way. I believe \nthat the historical record in that regard is so very clear.\n  It is possible that the peace will indeed hold, if an equilibrium has \nbeen reached there. If the various parties are satisfied with the \nterritory over which they have been given jurisdiction, then there may \nindeed be peace. I would say, however, that there are troubling signs \nthat this will not be the case in Bosnia. I am certain that my \ncolleagues have read and heard about many instances of aggressive \nbehavior in the last few days. One involved the touching of a town, by \nBosnian Croats, which was slated to be turned over to the Serbs. Can we \nassume that these horrible actions will not meet with reprisals? Will \nthe Serbs be satisfied that a town allotted to them under the terms of \nthe peace agreement has been destroyed? Will vengeance not be sought at \nanother time and place? I believe it would be highly naive to assume \nthat these activities will cease the moment that United States troops \ntake up their positions in Bosnia.\n  So it should be clear that I am most troubled by the President's \ndecision to send troops to Bosnia. However, I would also say that we do \nnot add to the safety of our troops by withdrawing support from our \nPresident at this \n\n[[Page S18539]]\ntime. We know from our own tragic experience that no good comes from \npublic disunity between the President and the Congress at such a time \nas this. To tell the world that America's commitment is soft, that it \nwill be undone once the Congress can prevail over the President in such \na matter, is to invite attacks upon our troops, and thereby upon our \nresolve. Certainly, any potential enemies will seek to test American \nresolve in Bosnia. ``We must not,'' I say to my colleagues, lay any of \nthe groundwork for those detractors by making it harder for the \nPresident to stand by his decisions.\n\n  The majority leader's resolution, I believe, recognizes that our \ndesire to support our President does not mandate that we simply offer \nhim a blank check to proceed in Bosnia in any which way. This \nresolution incorporates the insights of our able Majority Leader and \nothers as to the reality that our troops can only safely and profitably \nbe withdrawn once Bosnia can stand on its own without resort to the \npresence of American support. This requires the training and equipping \nof aviable Bosnian army. Much of the negotiations between the Congress \nand the President as to the substance of this resolution have turned on \nthis point. I am pleased to see that we have received a commitment from \nthe White House that America will assume a leading role in training the \nBosnian army there.\n  That is the factor which can make it possible for the President to \nclaim this mission as a success upon its conclusion; otherwise we run \nthe risk of simply delaying whatever bloodshed would otherwise occur \nuntil the United States withdraws. If we have simply a target date for \nthe hostilities to resume, and we will have accomplished nothing. The \nwork of the majority leader in this area could help to ensure that this \nmission is not in vain, and that a lasting peace in Bosnia is possible, \nwithout a sustained and indefinite American presence.\n  So I commend the resolution offered by Senator Dole and the intrepid \nand courageous McCain and I urge my colleagues to support it. I trust \nthat my colleagues will agree with me that the task before us--once \nsuch a mission is undertaken--is to ensure that it has the greatest \npossible chance for success. I believe that in this instance, we \naccomplish this by defining and limiting the nature of the mission in \nBosnia, and by providing a strategy leading toward the orderly \nwithdrawal of United States troops from this part of the world. The \nDole-McCain resolution surely accomplishes this, and I urge the Senate \nto adopt it.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the \nresolutions related to Bosnia, I would like to express my unequivocal \nsupport for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. I can \nthink of no greater act of patriotism and devotion to this country than \nto enlist in the military and devote one's professional life to the \ndefense of our Constitution. It is made even more profound by the \nrealization that these brave men and women do not have a say in how, or \nwhere, they will be employed. They go where they are told to go, fight \nwhere they are told to fight, and do so better than any other military \nforce in the world. Throughout their service they must spend months, \nsometimes even years, away from their home and family. Children are \nborn and start growing up while their parent is away in the service of \ntheir country. Few of us in America today realize the tremendous \nsacrifice these men and women make so that we may enjoy the fruits of \nliberty. It is time we honor their sacrifice.\n  But such sacrifice is not limited to our active duty forces. I have \nbeen informed that four Michigan National Guard and Army Reserve units \nwill be deployed in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. To the \nofficers, men and women of the 1776th Military Police Company, the \n210th Military Police Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, both \nfrom Taylor, MI, the 415th Civil Affairs Battalion in Kalamazoo, MI, \nand the 415th Military Intelligence Detachment in Ann Arbor, MI, I wish \nyou God speed and a safe deployment. I have also been informed that one \nof my own staff, a Naval Reservist, may be recalled to active duty to \nsupport these military operations. May you all return quickly and \nsafely. I commend your patriotism, your bravery, and your devotion to \nduty. You exemplify all that is worthy and noble in Michigan, in our \nmilitary, and in the United States. I'm sure all my colleagues here in \nthe Senate join me in saluting your valor.\n  Now Mr. President, I would like to specifically address the issue of \nAmerica's interest and involvement in Bosnia. This issue has \nimplications for our foreign and defense policy that will reverberate \nlong after this operation is completed.\n  America has always been viewed as a light to all nations, guiding \nthem to peace, freedom, and self-determination. We are a nation \ndedicated to certain principles and ideals, and we take those \nprinciples and ideals seriously enough that we include their very \npreservation and advancement as part of our national interest. But we \nmust never lose sight of the fact that a nation's first responsibility \nis to its own people.\n  We, in this body, must never develop a foreign policy that loses \nsight of that primary responsibility, and that the lives and safety of \nour troops, whether they be volunteers or conscripts, are just as much \na vital national security interest as are the lives of our civilian \ncitizens. In practice then, we should commit our forces only when, \nwhere, and to the extent appropriate, to meet our stated national goals \nand to protect our national interests.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the level of our commitment to a particular \nundertaking should be concomitant with the level of the threat to our \nnational interests. Some situations threaten our very existence, while \nothers only marginally affect us. Many will lie somewhere in the \nmiddle. Where such threats to our national security are significant and \ndefinite, like those we faced in World War II, we must respond \ndecisively and with all available military force. But in those cases \nwhere our national interests lie somewhere between the extremes, as I \nbelieve is the case in the Balkans, it is not necessary to respond with \nthe same level of absolute commitment and force that we would use \nagainst those definite threats to our vital national security \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, we must also examine not only what our chances of \nsuccess will be in a particular undertaking, but also what will be the \npotential costs--in the lives of America's soldiers and in our national \nprestige. Just as the level of our interests will lie somewhere along a \nbroad scale, so too will the potential benefits and costs. Every effort \nmust be made to assess and decide whether the potential benefits in \nadvancing our national interests justify the costs.\n  Mr. President, in my view, the United States has an interest in long-\nterm stability and peace in the Balkans. The war has consumed the \ninterests of Europe for the past 4 years and has increasingly become an \nitem of disagreement and discord between the United States and our NATO \nallies, an alliance where continued U.S. leadership is vital to our \ninterests. Former adversaries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, \nwith whom we previously thought we were developing new and friendlier \nrelations, are using this war as an opportunity to expand their \ninfluence and control. Our leadership in NATO, and with the emerging \nEuropean democratic states, will be pivotal to what Europe will look \nlike for generations to come. We must remain engaged with these states, \nand must accept that their problems, more or less are our problems too. \nFurther, old divisions between East and West are exacerbated by this \nconflict because of the critical role the mixing of Eastern and Western \nreligions play in the continued hatred and strife of the region. These \nconflicts undermine stability and therefore directly impact upon U.S. \nnational interests.\n  Finally, and certainly not least, the United States has a very real \ninterest in putting an end to the atrocities and carnage that has \nshattered this region. At the end of World War II, we said we would \nnever again allow another Holocaust. Where we have an opportunity to \nend mass and indiscriminate killing, which will live in our memories \nfor generations to come, we must seize such opportunities where we \nlegitimately believe we can succeed.\n  Mr. President, while there is a definite U.S. interest to be advanced \nin this situation, it is only worth acting if \n\n[[Page S18540]]\nwe employ a strategy that both ensures the conditions for a genuine \npeace and which establishes a rational strategy for the eventual \nwithdrawal of our troops. Therefore, I believe any strategy for peace \nand stability in the Balkans must, in part, be based upon addressing \nthe fundamental military imbalance between the Serbs and the Muslim-\nCroatian Federation. If we had previously lifted the arms embargo, we \nwould not be debating this deployment today. Yes, the conflict would \nhave probably intensified at first, but I believe the Muslim-Croatian \nFederation would have then been able to develop a credible military \ndeterrent, and there would be no need for 60,000 troops to implement \nthe peace. Now, again, a balance must exist or peace will evaporate as \nsoon as the Implementation Force withdraws. The current administration \npolicy fails to set in motion a plan to achieve this balance.\n  It is also clear to me that any strategy based upon the deployment of \nUnited States ground troops to Bosnia must include a definition of what \nwill be the conditions for declaring final success in this venture. A \npitfall we must avoid in achieving that success is to utilize our \ntroops in the inappropriate mission of nation-building. I understand \nsuitable political structures must be in place to allow the ballot to \nreplace the bullet as the agent of change, but the role of our troops \nmust be strictly limited to establishing the necessary military \nstability so as to allow the civilians the opportunity to develop the \nnecessary political institutions.\n  When we have defined our criteria for success, we must also have in \nplace a definite withdrawal plan that clearly establishes the \nconditions and terms for the termination of this mission. In my view, \nthe current administration plan is based upon the faulty assumptions \nthat our mere presence in Bosnia is the goal, and that peace under any \nterms is preferable to battling for a just victory.\n  Mr. President, short of committing ground troops to Bosnia, I believe \nthere are several roles which the United States can and should fill to \nadvance the cause of a just and stable peace in the Balkans. Among \nthose roles which I feel are appropriate for the United States include \ncontributing significant air and naval forces to the NATO operation in \nthe Balkans, providing a large part of the logistical and financial \nresources for this operation, and participating in efforts to provide \nmilitary assistance and training to the Muslim-Croatian Federation.\n  However, the President's decision to deploy United States ground \ntroops directly into Bosnia and Herzegovina is, in my view, a grievous \nmistake. As I stated earlier, I believe it is in America's interests to \nadvance the cause of peace, justice, and stability in the Balkans. But \nit is not such an absolute or vital national interest that it justifies \nthe extremely high risk of deploying ground troops to the region.\n  Mr. President, I believe U.S. troops are particularly ill-suited for \npeacekeeping missions of this type because they present such a ripe \npolitical target. Whether rightly or wrongly, a dead American soldier \ncaptured on TV cameras will be broadcast around the world. I doubt the \nsame can be said for the soldiers from traditional peacekeeping \ncontributors. And that is exactly what a belligerent wants; that \nintense media coverage and scrutiny that covers American troops. That \nis why our troops have rarely been used as peacekeepers. Look at what \nhappened in Somalia. U.S. forces were specifically targeted, and \nsubsequently drawn much further into the conflict than originally \nplanned, because of the significant political position they occupy for \nno other reason than that they were American soldiers. Therefore, I \nbelieve peacekeeping is best conducted by smaller countries not \nperceived as having any vested interest in the outcome of a conflict, \nand therefore can undeniably claim to be neutral.\n  The question of U.S. leadership does not rest on the end of an \ninfantryman's rifle barrel. The United States can maintain, even \nadvance, its international credibility, its preeminence in the NATO \nalliance, and its role as the world's sole superpower, without having \nto contribute a disproportionate share of the troops on the ground. \nIndeed, I believe it is imprudent to claim that the sole measure of \nUnited States leadership and commitment to peace in the Balkans can \nonly be measured by the number of troops we commit to the \nImplementation Force.\n\n  Were a more vital United States interest at stake in the Balkans, and \nwere not it clear that the United States can still participate \nsignificantly in implementing this peace accord without using its \nground troops, my views may be different. But given the extreme risk to \nwhich I believe they will be subjected, and the clear availability of \nfor other countries to provide these peacekeeping troops, I believe \nplacing our forces on the ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nunjustified.\n  In light of the foregoing analysis, I concluded that I could not \nsupport H.R. 2606, which would prohibit the expenditure of funds for \nthe deployment of United States troops to Bosnia absent a specific \nCongressional appropriation. Limiting the expenditure of funds at this \nstage of the operation will unduly jeopardize our troops in the field \njust at the exact time that they most need Congressional support. I \nwould also refer to the arguments made by the Majority Leader, himself \na distinguished veteran, who related the incredible damage done to the \nmorale of our troops serving in Vietnam when this Congress debated \ncutting off the funds for our troops involved in that war. We should \nnot, in my judgment, place our troops in that position.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, our interests in the region are \nnot so great that they warrant placing United States ground troops \nunder the extraordinary risk they would face in Bosnia. Therefore, I \nwholeheartedly support the Hutchison-Inhofe-Craig-Nickles resolution \nopposing the deployment of U.S. ground troops. This Sense of the Senate \nResolution expresses, on the record, our disagreement with the \nPresident's decision to deploy ground troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Unfortunately the President is, in fact, deploying U.S. ground \ntroops. Mr. President, this deployment is a fait accompli, initiated \nunilaterally by the President over the strongest and repeated \nobjections of both Houses of Congress, and one which the President will \ncontinue no matter how strongly we protest. Thus, even though many of \nus oppose this deployment, I believe we have an opportunity, and an \nobligation, to clearly define the limits under which the President can \ncarry out this imprudent deployment.\n  It is in this light that I have decided to support the Dole-McCain \nresolution. I want to thank the sponsors for incorporating language \nthat I had recommended making clear that the Congress is simply \nacquiescing to the fact that this deployment is a fait accompli. With \nthis language, the resolution clearly states our misgivings, and I \nquote: ``Notwithstanding reservations expressed about President \nClinton's decision to deploy United States Armed Forces to Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. . . The President may only fulfill his commitment [and I \nstress this is the President's commitment] to deploy United States \nArmed Forces. . . subject to the conditions'' of this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I can't speak for others, but my vote for this \nresolution in no way constitutes an endorsement, authorization, or \napproval of the President's decision to send United States ground \ntroops into Bosnia. In fact, the language I submitted distinctly helps \nseparate this resolution from any endorsement of the President's \nactions by citing our reservations and placing the origin of this \ndeployment clearly with the President.\n  As I just quoted, this resolution further states that, in light of \nthe President's decision to deploy U.S. troops, he may quote, ``only \nfulfill his commitment,'' unquote if he meets the conditions \nestablished to safeguard our troops and further the success of the \nmission. Mr. President, I believe that point needs to be repeated. This \nis the President's decision, a commitment the President made over our \nrepeated objections. Therefore, under the Dole-McCain resolution, he \nmay only, and I stress only, fulfill quote ``his'' unquote commitment, \nif meets the following conditions.\n  First, the resolution recognizes the extreme danger in which U.S. \ntroops will be placed, and establishes rational conditions for their \nsafe withdrawal and limited military employment. The Dole-McCain \nresolution establishes \n\n[[Page S18541]]\nclear and unequivocal language that requires the President to take all \npossible measures to protect our forces, and to periodically report to \nCongress the success of those specific measures.\n  It also builds upon the recognition that the Muslim-Croatian \nFederation must be further armed, trained and strengthened if a \ncredible and stable military balance is to be established in the \nregion. We cannot simply accept the President's assurances that he will \nfind some way to make this happen. If the United States forces withdraw \nonly to see an out gunned Bosnian-Croatian Federation quickly overrun \nby a patient aggressor, our troops' sacrifice will be for naught. We \nhave the power to give meaning to their sacrifice, and this resolution \ndoes just that.\n  Last, the Dole-McCain resolution will strictly limit the operations \nof our forces to legitimately military tasks. We have repeatedly seen \nthe inefficacy of using U.S. military forces for nation-building \nexercises. The General Framework Agreement is, in my opinion, fraught \nwith pitfalls that will draw the Implementation Force fully into the \ntasks more clearly the purview of the civilian High Representative's \nauthority. This body has the opportunity to protect our troops from \nbeing needlessly employed in such dangerous non-military tasks, and \nthis resolution does so.\n  This is, in my opinion, far from a perfect response to the situation \nthe President has presented this Congress. I believe the President has \nacted hastily, and that his policy places our troops in the \nunnecessarily dangerous role of vulnerable peace implementors. However, \nwhen presented with the reality that our troops will go to Bosnia, \nregardless of our actions, I believe we must act where we can to \nconstrain the imprudent strategy of the administration. The Dole-McCain \nresolution does not approve, endorse or authorize the President's \npolicy. However, it clearly constrains the conduct of this operation so \nas to better protect our troops in Bosnia, and to better ensure \nmission's ultimate success.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Dole-\nMcCain resolution.\n  As each of us decides whether or not to support U.S. involvement in \nthis military operation, we must consider that we are sending young \nsoldiers overseas and that their lives are possibly on the line.\n  As I evaluated our involvement in this effort, I reflected on my own \nsituation during World War II. When I enlisted in the Army, my father \nwas terminally ill and my mother was about to become a widow. I recall \nthe letters that I wrote from Europe to my mother, who, like the \nparents of those soldiers being sent to Bosnia, prayed every day for my \nsafe return. Those were not easy times. But I also recall the deep \npride that I felt and the moral good that ultimately came from ending \nHitler's fascist conquests.\n  Mr. President, like many Americans, I have been troubled by the \nprospective costs in human lives of the war in Bosnia. With America's \ndiplomatic support, the warring parties have negotiated a truce and are \nprepared to sign a peace agreement and are requesting the assistance of \nAmerica's military to help monitor and enforce it.\n  I do not agree with those who argue that our country has no national \ninterest in helping to enforce a peace agreement. We must, if we \npossibly can, prevent the further spread of this tragic conflict, in \npart, because further conflict threatens the stability of, perhaps, the \nwhole of Europe. If the war spreads, America runs the risk of being \nenveloped in a much larger conflict. By committing a small number of \nsoldiers now, we may reduce the likelihood that more American troops \ncould be required in Europe later on.\n  As the architect of the peace agreement, and as the leader of NATO, \nonly the United States can lead this effort and put an end to this \nsenseless bloodshed that has taken 250,000 lives, torn that country \napart, and displaced 2 million refugees.\n  Mr. President, sending American troops seems to be the best option \navailable to the United States to help guarantee peace in Europe. While \nthe Dayton peace agreement is far from perfect, it is the only peace \nagreement that the parties in the conflict have agreed to implement. If \nsuccessfully implemented and coupled with the arming and training of \nthe Bosnian Moslems before IFOR departs, the agreement holds a promise, \nin the long run, of ending the violence that has terrorized the people \nof Bosnia. The alternative is unacceptable--to let the war resume. If \nthe international community does not step in now, it is obvious that \nmore lives will be lost and more refugees will be displaced, and there \nwill be more bloodshed and carnage, and America's credibility as an \ninternational leader is also on the line. Our leadership brought the \nparties to the negotiating table, and our leadership was requested by \nthose parties to help enforce the agreement.\n  I understand the view that the Congress should have been consulted \nmore closely before the decision to send troops was made. But forcing \nAmerica to back away from the President's commitment is not the \nsolution. To do so would undermine the morale of our fighting force. \nEven more, it would diminish our credibility in the international \ncommunity and send a message to aggressors worldwide that they have \nnothing to fear from America.\n\n  I know that U.S. participation in this endeavor is not risk-free. \nPassions run high in an area where weapons are plentiful. Millions of \nlandmines lay just below the Earth's surface, and weather conditions \nare likely to be unfriendly. I am persuaded, however, that General \nShalikashvili and Secretary Perry have assiduously worked to minimize \nthe risks, and they believe that the risk level has been reduced to its \nbarest minimum level, and that the mission has clear objectives, a \nsufficiently potent force, an effective command and control structure \nunder American leadership, no-nonsense rules of engagement, a clear \ntime limit, and the cooperation of the various factions.\n  American troops will have well-defined rules of engagement. They \nwill, as President Clinton said, fight fire with fire, and then some. \nOur troops will have a clearly defined military mission and will not \nparticipate in nation-building tasks. Once again, they will be under \nAmerican command.\n  Our soldiers will have the firepower, training, explicit \ninstructions, and authorization necessary to defend themselves and \nothers. They have been trained to deal with every major threat, \nincluding landmines, civil disorder, and snipers. I have been assured \nby General Shalikashvili and Secretary Perry that our troops have the \nappropriate level of training and are prepared and ready for this peace \nenforcement mission.\n  Mr. President, though it is always painful to send American soldiers \noverseas, I believe the goals of this limited deployment are \nappropriate. While it is our solemn responsibility to make wise \ndecisions about sending American troops abroad, I have been assured by \nour military leaders that the members of our All-Volunteer force are \nprepared for this mission.\n  America can make a difference in securing the peace in Bosnia. We \nought to remain engaged in that endeavor. I hope, Mr. President, that \nmy colleagues will support the Dole-McCain resolution and our troops. I \nwish them well on this peace mission.\n  Mr. President, I support America's troops as they head off to Bosnia \nto help enforce and implement the peace agreement.\n  As each of us decides about whether or not to support U.S. \ninvolvement in this military operation, we need to be mindful of the \nfact that we are sending young soldiers overseas and that their lives \nare possibly on the line.\n  As I evaluated America's involvement in the international effort to \nenforce a peace agreement in Bosnia, I have reflected on my own \nsituation during the Second World War. When I enlisted in the Army, my \nfather was terminally ill, and my mother was about to become a widow.\n  While she tended to my father's minute-to-minute needs and also to \nsee that my 12-year-old sister met her \n\n[[Page S18542]]\nschool and personal commitments, I was in uniform.\n  As I considered America's involvement in this military operation in \nBosnia, I recalled the letters I wrote from Europe to my mother in New \nJersey, who like the parents of those soldiers being sent to Bosnia, \nprayed every day for my safe return.\n  I recalled the deep pride I felt serving my country, and have \nreflected on the values American soldiers fought for during that \nconflict and the moral good that came from bringing an end to Hitler's \nfascist conquests.\n  Like many Americans, I have been deeply troubled by the cost--in \ninjury and human life--of the war that raged on in Bosnia for the last \n3\\1/2\\ years. And I have been haunted by all-too-familiar photographs \nfrom the war in the Balkans.\n  Terrified children left orphaned after slaughter. Moslem women raped \nby their Bosnian Serb captors. Innocents lying dead in the street. U.N. \nsoldiers chained to poles as human shields. Reports of mass executions \nand graves.\n  To their credit, the warring parties have agreed to end these \natrocities and open a new chapter in their history.\n  With America's diplomatic support,they have negotiated a peace \nagreement which holds the promise of ending the brutality that has \ninflicted so much pain on their people for so many years. Now that a \npeace agreement has been negotiated, the parties to the conflict are \nrequesting the assistance of America's military to help monitor and \nenforce it.\n  There are many reasons why I believe the Congress should support U.S. \ninvolvement in a NATO-led international peace enforcement operation.\n  I do not agree, Mr. President, with those who argue that the United \nStates has no national interest in intervening to enforce a peace \nagreement to end this conflict.\n  The United States does have a national interest in supporting a \npeaceful end to the bloody conflict in Europe. We must prevent the \nfurther spread of this tragic conflict, not only because of its impact \non the people of Bosnia, but because further conflict threatens the \nstability of Europe.\n  If the war spreads and more countries are drawn into the conflict, \nAmerica runs the risk of being enveloped in a much larger conflict. By \ncommitting 20,000 American soldiers to this international peace \nenforcement operation now, we may reduce the likelihood that more \nAmerican troops could be required in Europe later.\n  While I also understand the view of those who believe Bosnia is a \nEuropean problem that the Europeans should enforce and monitor the \npeace agreement on their own, the reality is that without the \nleadership and direct participation of the United States in this \ninternational effort, the peace agreement would go nowhere. The \nEuropeans, through NATO, will be engaged as our partner in this peace \nenforcement mission.\n  But as the architect of the peace agreement and as the leader of \nNATO, only the United States can lead the effort to enforce the peace \nagreement and put an end to the senseless bloodshed and loss of \ninnocent lives. Only our Nation can lead the way in enforcing the peace \nagreement which will stop the carnage that has taken 250,000 lives, \ntorn the country apart, and displaced 2 million refugees.\n  Sending American troops to help enforce and monitor this peace \nagreement is the best option available to the United States to help \nguarantee peace in Europe. While the Dayton peace agreement is far from \nperfect, it is the only peace agreement that the parties to the \nconflict have agreed to implement.\n  It will not reunite Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it will, if given a \nchance to succeed, restore peace, calm, and civility to the region. It \nwill not bring back the lives of those senselessly slaughtered by \nperpetrators of war crimes, but it will guard future atrocities and \nensure that such perpetrators are prohibited from serving in \ngovernment.\n  If successfully implemented and coupled with the arming and training \nof the Bosnian Moslems before IFOR departs, it holds the promise, in \nthe long run, of ending the bloodshed and violence that have terrorized \nthe people of Bosnia for so long.\n  Mr. President, the alternative to sending U.S. troops to help \nimplement and enforce this peace agreement, is to let the war resume. \nIf the international community does not step in now to enforce this \npeace agreement, more lives will be lost.\n  More refugees will be displaced. More children will be orphaned. \nThere will be more bloodshed and carnage. There will be a greater \nlikelihood that the United States will need to intervene at a later \ntime.\n  America's credibility as an international leader is also on the line. \nOur leadership brought the parties to the negotiating table, and our \nleadership was requested by those parties to help enforce and monitor \nthe peace agreement.\n  I understand the view of many that the Congress should have been more \nclosely consulted before the decision to send troops was made. But I do \nnot believe that forcing America to back away from the President's \ncommitment is the solution in this case. To do so would invite attacks \non our troops by those opponents of peace who hope to force the \ninternational community out of the Balkans. It would undermine the \nmorale of our troops.\n  Even more, it would diminish our credibility in the International \ncommunity. It would send a message to aggressors worldwide that they \nhave little to fear from America. It could be perceived as a green \nlight for the North Koreans to march south. It could be perceived as a \ngreen light for Sadaam Hussein to do the same.\n  To be sure, it would also undermine America's role as NATO's leader.\n  I know, Mr. President, that U.S. participation in this mission is not \nrisk free.\n  The parties to the conflict have been fighting for years, and \npassions run high in an area where weapons are plentiful. Millions of \nlandmines lay just below the Earth's surface, and adverse weather \nconditions will, no doubt, create difficulties for our soldiers.\n  But I do not believe these difficulties are insurmountable. Nor do I \nbelieve they should keep America from joining the international \ncommunity in enforcing a peace agreement aimed at stopping the worst \natrocities on European soil since the Second World War.\n  I am persuaded that General Shalikashvili and Secretary Perry have \nassiduously worked to minimize those risks. They believe the risk level \nhas been minimized and that the mission has clear objectives, a \nsufficiently potent force, an effective command and control structure \nunder American leadership, no-nonsense rules of engagement, a clear \ntime limit, and the cooperation of the various factions.\n  American troops participating in this international peace enforcement \noperation will have well defined rules of engagement. Unlike the \nlightly armed U.N. peacekeepers previously stationed in Bosnia, \nAmerican soldiers will be permitted to use force--including deadly \nforce--in cases of self-defense or to protect against a hostile act or \nhostile intent. They will, as President Clinton said, ``fight fire with \nfire, and then some.''\n  Out troops will have a clearly defined military mission. They will \nmonitor the cease-fire line, the zones of separation, and, when needed, \nenforce withdrawal from the zones of separation. They will not \nparticipate in nation-building tasks.\n  They will be under American command.\n  Our soldiers will have the firepower, training, explicit \ninstructions, and authorization necessary to defend themselves and \nothers. They have been trained to deal with every major threat, \nincluding landmine, civil disorder, and snipers.\n  I have been assured by General Shalikashvili and Secretary Perry that \nour troops are well trained, prepared, and ready for this peace \nenforcement mission.\n  Though it is never easy to send American soldiers overseas, I believe \nthe goals of this limited deployment are meritorious. While it is our \nsolemn responsibility to make wise decisions about sending American \ntroops, I have been assured by our military leaders that the members of \nour all volunteer force are prepared for this mission.\n  America can make a difference in securing the peace in Bosnia, and we \nought to remain engaged in that endeavor. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport the Dole-McCain resolution and \n\n[[Page S18543]]\nour troops. I wish them well on this peace mission.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wonder if the Chair could outline \nthe current situation in terms of time allocation so that I might speak \nfor a few minutes if it is available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 34 minutes remaining; the \nmajority has 29 minutes. If there is no objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I know the occupant of the \nchair is a very thoughtful Senator and reviews each situation that \ncomes before him very carefully. We shared a trip to Croatia a couple \nyears ago and had the opportunity to see just on the periphery what \nhappens when the hatred and the venom is unleashed to deal with \nproblems, as those who are there saw fit. We were shocked to learn \nabout the murder of neighbors by other farm neighbors, using farm \nimplements to do the killing and the maiming, and the story about the \nwomen locked in a gymnasium after they had been raped by then-renegade \nrogue Serbian soldiers and made to stay in that facility so they could \nnot dispose of those pregnancies in any way but to deliver a child not \nof their choice, one that the enemy, their enemy, decided would be an \nappropriate way of fathering another race.\n  It recalls for all of us a time just over 40 years ago when it was \ndecided by another Fascist that there would be a super race put upon \nthis Earth, and by artificial insemination, rape and coercion, women \nwere made pregnant to carry members of that super race. It was \nintolerable. When we learned about it we were shocked and horrified. \nNow we saw similar things taking place. The world stood by--an \nunacceptable condition--in a world purportedly civilized, and thusly \nwhen we debate the issue here, Mr. President, about whether or not we \nhave a national interest, we have a global interest, we have a human \ninterest.\n  Yes, it is true that America cannot be the police force around the \nworld, and the questions are raised, why did we do it in this place and \nwhy did we not do it in that place? One of the reasons is we were not \nwelcomed by anybody. We saw what happened when our young people were \nsent to Somalia with an indefinite engagement in front of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I see my colleague from Florida is \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague, Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Catherine and Crosby \nDawkins of Jacksonville, FL. The letter read in part:\n\n       We cannot see any compelling reason for risking the lives \n     of United States servicemen in a centuries old dispute, even \n     though we grieve for the plight of the women and children. If \n     European countries believe the conflict will spread, they \n     should take action.\n\n  Mr. President, like many of us, I have received hundreds, possibly \nthousands of communiques similar to this--deep felt concerns about the \nrisk of American soldiers in Bosnia. These thoughtful letters deserve a \nresponse. I take this opportunity to address not only my colleagues in \nthe Senate but also my fellow citizens of Florida who have been so \ngenerous and so thoughtful in their letters.\n\n  Mr. President, this raises an issue of the United States military \ntroops in Bosnia, a fundamental question of what are the options of the \nUnited States in this post-cold-war era? For half a century, the United \nStates knew with clarity and with national unity what its objectives \nwere. Its objectives were to suppress the totalitarianism of Nazism. \nThe goal was to restrain the imperial impulses of the Soviet Union.\n  Now the United States is charting a new course of action. We have \nessentially limited options. One of those options, Mr. President, in \nthe post-cold-war era is to stand on the sideline, to essentially be an \nobserver of the world, as we were for much of our Nation's history.\n  The second option is to be the world's defender, to be prepared to \nintervene in every conflict.\n  The third option is to carefully assess our interest and, when a \nsituation begs our involvement, to work within our capabilities to \nbuild international coalitions to respond to the conflict. I strongly \nfeel that that third option is the option which is most appropriate and \nmost applicable to the situation that we face tonight in Bosnia.\n  In assessing the question as to whether our interests in Bosnia are \nsufficient to beg our involvement, I suggest that our interests do \nrequire our involvement. This is not a complete list, but I believe a \ncompelling list of those reasons. The United States has a deep interest \nin human rights. One of the things that distinguishes our country from \nthose nations which preceded it is that we believe that the purpose of \ngovernment is to protect and advance the rights of individuals. We \nfound that not only to be a guiding principle in our domestic policy \nbut also in our foreign policy.\n  One of the great initial disputes in this Nation was over the \nquestion of whether the United States should become involved in the \nFrench Revolution. Many said that the United States should stand apart, \nthat we were too small to be effective, and too distant to be \neffective.\n  Thomas Jefferson said we meant those words in the Declaration of \nIndependence not just to stand for Americans, or for English \ncolonialists, but they were universal principles of human rights, and \nthat we had not only been given by God certain inalienable rights but \nalso by God, responsibilities to defend those rights wherever they were \nin jeopardy.\n  That principle of America's special role in the world that from the \nvery beginning of our Nation has so shaped our culture, is at risk \ntonight.\n  We also have some more immediate interests. We have an interest in \npreserving the international coalition which we know as NATO, a \ncoalition which has served us well in terms of deterring the Soviet \nUnion and which, in all likelihood, will serve us well in the unknown, \nuncharted future into which we move in the post-cold-war era. If we \nwere to retreat from our commitments to NATO on this, the eve of the \nsigning of the peace agreements in Paris, I think that institution \nwould be forever shattered.\n  We also have the opportunity by acting tonight to avoid the potential \nof this horrendous strife, which has taken a quarter of a million \nlives, rendered 3 million people as refugees, from spreading--spreading \nfirst throughout the former Yugoslavia and then throughout the Balkans \nand then, as we have seen twice in this century, throughout Europe.\n  We have a deep stake in avoiding having to do what this country has \ndone twice in this century, and that is send American men and women, \nnot as peacekeepers, but as combatants in a war in Europe.\n  Finally, I think we have a strong interest in demonstrating to the \npeople of the world that our concern for human rights is not limited to \npeople who look like us, attend the same religious institutions as we \ndo, have our same cultural background. There is today an emerging \nfundamentalism within the Islamic religion. That fundamentalism is \nreceiving support and reassurance from what they see Western Europeans \nhave done, including the United States of America, in Bosnia today.\n  I believe it is important that we, by our actions now, indicate that \nwe are prepared to stand for the cause of human rights, and protect \nthem wherever our interests indicate that it is appropriate to do so; \nthat we, by so doing, will send a signal that we are prepared to \nsupport the responsible elements of the Islamic religion and Islamic \nnations.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by citing what we heard just a few hours \nago in the House Chamber, the statement made by the Prime Minister of \nIsrael, Shimon Peres.\n  Mr. President, less than 24 hours ago, Shimon Peres addressed the \nCongress and the American people on the need \n\n[[Page S18544]]\nfor American leadership in the 21st century. He said:\n\n       Even in this very day, as Bosnia reels in agony, you \n     offered a compass and a lamp to a confused situation like in \n     the Middle East. Nobody else was able or was ready to do it. \n     . .\n       America, in my judgment, cannot escape what history has \n     laid on your shoulders . . . You cannot escape that which \n     America alone can do. America alone can keep the world free \n     and assist nations to assume the responsibility for their own \n     fate.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what is at stake in the decision that we will \nmake this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is very difficult to make an \nimportant statement with a limited time, but I want to say that I \nsupport the President's peacemaking initiative and the Dayton accord \nand I support the NATO operation in Bosnia. I support the President \nbecause I believe that it is our patriotic duty and the right thing to \ndo. I believe that we have an obligation to nurture the peace and to \nconvince warring nations, whenever possible, that the United States \nwill make an effort to help them resolve their conflicts.\n\n  This decision was not made easily.\n  I have, for a long time now, differed with the President on Bosnia \npolicy. Specifically, I have favored the lifting of the arms embargo \nagainst the Bosnian Moslems--a policy change that would have assisted \nthe Moslems in defending themselves.\n  My decision was made only after meeting with the President and his \nmilitary advisers, carefully considering their views, and deliberating \nthe pros and cons of a U.S. peacekeeping role.\n  It has been complicated by the fact that the State of Illinois has \nthe largest number of reservists being called up to support our troop \ndeployment to Bosnia. Moreover, I have an 18-year-old son whom I would \nnot want to see put in harm's way should the situation in Bosnia take \nan untoward turn.\n  Like most Americans, I am concerned about the risks involved in \nsending United States ground troops to Bosnia. I want to be sure that \nthe Administration has thought through and addressed all the important \nquestions before United States forces are committed to Bosnia. These \nquestions include the rules of engagement, command structure, the \nlength of our commitment, our exit strategy, and our contingency plans \nshould the peace plan start to unravel, or the warring factions fail to \nmake good on their promises.\n  But the President has satisfactorily answered each of those concerns, \nand he has made a strong case on why Congress and the American people \nshould support his decision to send United States peacekeeping forces \nto Bosnia.\n\n  First, the NATO mission is clearly defined, limited, and achievable. \nIt is to implement the military aspects of the peace accord to monitor \nthe cease-fire, to control the airspace, and to patrol the exclusionary \nzone separating the former combatants. It does not involve ``nation \nbuilding'' or acting as a police force. Moreover, it is not the kind of \nvague undefined ``presence'' that led to the United States tragedy in \nLebanon. Most important, there is no danger of the kind of ``mission \ncreep'' that occurred in Somalia.\n  Second, U.S. troops will not be passive, lightly armed peacekeepers \nas the U.N. forces have been. They will be heavily armed and have the \ntanks, the artillery, and the air power necessary to respond forcefully \nto any threat or challenge.\n  Third, the rules of engagement are clear, aggressive and unambiguous. \nThey are designed to maximize the safety of our troops. Specifically, \nU.S. forces will have the authority to meet any threat or violation of \nthe peace agreement with ``immediate and decisive force.''\n  Fourth, our commitment is not open-ended. It is planned that United \nStates forces will be deployed in Bosnia for about a year. Military \nexperts suggest it may be less than that.\n  Fifth, NATO peacekeepers will be under the command of Adm. Leighton \nW. Smith, Jr., and U.S. soldiers will only take orders from American \ncommanders.\n  Finally, I have been informed that an effective exit strategy and a \ncarefully constructed contingency plan have been developed, should the \npeace accord begin to unravel.\n  No one is underestimating, nor have we any illusions about the \ndifficulties, dangers, and risks of this peacekeeping operation. \nSending 20,000 of America's finest young men and women to Bosnia to \nimplement the military provisions of the general framework for peace in \nBosnia and Herzegovina is a risky proposition. The conflict there has \nbeen long-standing and brutal. The weather is inhospitable and the \nterrain is treacherous. There are more than 6 million land mines \nscattered throughout the country. Renegade bands have openly stated \ntheir opposition to provisions of the Dayton accord with which they \ndisagree. Finally, all previous cease-fire agreements have ended in \nfailure. Viewed separately, each of these factors imperils the safety \nof our soldiers; viewed as a whole, the possibility of American \ncasualties is unfortunately very real.\n  However, we also have to consider the consequences of a failure of \nUnited States leadership in Bosnia. If we retreat now on the commitment \nthe President has made, the Dayton agreement would collapse. The war \nwould likely reignite. The slaughter of innocents would begin anew.\n  'Even if there were no Dayton agreement to go back on, however, \nfailure to act would have the most serious kinds of consequences for \nthe United States. A failure by the United States to lead now could \nwell represent a turning point for the entire NATO alliance, and NATO \nis the cornerstone of United States national security policy abroad. \nThe United States is NATO's leader. If we fail to lead on an issue of \nsuch great importance to NATO, we must expect that kind of failure to \nhave serious consequences for the United States, both in Europe and \nelsewhere around the world.\n  Moreover, a failure to act in Bosnia could well lead to broader \nconflict, one that could have far greater consequences for the United \nStates down the road. If the current conflict is not at least \ncontained, the losing side may well seek allies to redress its defeats \non the battlefield. As more parties are drawn in, the conflict becomes \never more larger and ever more serious.\n  We have already seen that in Bosnia. We have already seen this \ndynamic at work, the conflict became much larger in the last year, with \nmore parties, and more forces involved, than were engaged 4 years ago. \nSimply letting the parties fight it out, and watching the conflict \ncontinue to grow, is therefore not an acceptable option.\n  For all its weakness and risks--and the risks are substntial--the \nDayton peace agreement still represents our best chance for a durable, \nlasting peace. It preserves Bosnia within its present borders, provides \nfor free elections, and gives refugees a right to return to their \nhomes.\n  The Dayton accord calls on NATO to implement the provisions of the \nagreement. As the unquestioned leader of NATO, U.S. participation in \nthe proposed NATO peacekeeping operation is essential. Without a \nstrong, visible American participation, the hard won negotiated peace \nin Dayton will unravel and be lost.\n  For these reasons I did not support H.R. 2206 and will not support \nthe Hutchison-Inhofe resolutions. The Dole-McCain resolution at least \nacknowledges the leadership role of the United States in NATO and the \nnecessity of our participation in the NATO peacekeeping operation. It \nalso acknowledges many of the essential provisions of the Dayton \naccord. Finally, the Dole-McCain resolution unequivocally supports our \nmen and women in the military. For these reasons, I will vote in favor \nof the Dole-McCain resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, problems in Europe have twice led to world wars this \ncentury. Problems in Europe caused the United States to fundamentally \nchange its foreign policy posture. Since the end of World War II, the \nUnited States has made a conscious decision to stay politically, \neconomically, and strategically engaged in Europe. During the cold war \nwe spent trillions of dollars and based hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican troops in Europe to protect these interests. Clearly the \npeace, security, stability, freedom, and prosperity of Europe are still \nvital national interests for the United States, and the vehicle for \nachieving those interests is NATO.\n\n[[Page S18545]]\n\n  There is no more difficult--or unpopular--decision an American \nPresident can make than to put U.S. armed forces in harm's way. The \nPresident has exercised his constitutional prerogative as Commander in \nChief, and American troops are being deployed to safeguard vital \nnational interests. Our troops are well-trained for the challenges that \nawait them, and they are prepared to do their duty. They are cognizant \nof the risks of their chosen profession and are more than willing to \nmake the necessary sacrifices to bring peace and freedom to a war-torn \nland. All they ask is to know the parameters of their mission in \nadvance, which the President has done, and that Congress and the \nAmerican people stand behind them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, none of us in the U.S. Senate, as is clear \nfrom the quality of this debate, takes lightly the responsibility of \nsending American troops into the potential of harm's way. But as each \nof us decides whether or not to support the President's decision to \ndeploy American troops in Bosnia, I think we need to keep two essential \npoints in mind.\n  The first is--and it must be reiterated again and again and again--\nthe President is not sending American troops, nor are we ratifying the \nsending of American troops to Bosnia for the purpose of fighting a war. \nOn the face of it, that may seem like an obvious point. But as I talk \nto citizens in my home State and listen to people across the country, \nmany Americans do not yet understand what the mission is about or how \nit may be performed.\n  We are not sending--nor do I intend to send or want to send--American \nforces to Bosnia to fight a war. We are not sending American forces to \nBosnia to crush enemy forces the way we did in World War II. We are not \nsending American soldiers to Bosnia to roll back communism the way we \ntried to in Vietnam, nor are we sending them there to repeal aggression \nas we did in the Persian Gulf.\n  The President is asking us to approve sending American troops to \nBosnia at the request of parties to a peace agreement, at the request \nof parties to a conflict who are asking us and other nations to join \ntogether to help them to implement a peace that they have stated they \nwant.\n  To be sure, war has raged in Bosnia for 4 years, but it is not raging \nnow. A cease-fire has been in place since October, and the parties to \nthe conflict have exhausted themselves. And, for the first time in 4 \nyears, they have opted for peace over war.\n  This Senator contemplates only keeping troops in Bosnia for so long \nas the parties continue to opt for peace over war. It is their \nchallenge now, not ours, to ensure that all of the elements under their \ncontrol, under the control of each of them individually, are prepared \nto accept the peace.\n  Recent events, such as the destruction by Bosnia and Croat troops of \ntowns to be turned over to the Bosnian Serbs and the stated opposition \nof Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo to the peace accords, suggest that even \nafter 4 years of fighting it will indeed take some time to convince \nthose on the ground that this peace agreement is in their interest and \nthat the risks for doing that are real. But that is precisely why this \nNATO force is needed and is so critical. And it is precisely why we \nmust participate in that force, only if we are to try to give them the \nchance to make the peace they say they want. In no way should we \ncontemplate making that peace ourselves.\n\n  The second critical point we need to keep in mind, Mr. President, is, \nas I listen to the debate, some Members assert that there is no vital \nnational interest in Bosnia, and I have heard throughout this debate \nsort of a standard of vital strategic interest, vital national \ninterest. Mr. President, that is the wrong test to apply to Bosnia.\n  Our vital national interests are our territorial integrity, our \npolitical system and ideology, our economic security, and our way of \nlife. We have gone to war four times in this century with the belief \nthat we were protecting them. But let us say clearly up front, in this \nconflict, in this effort, in this mission, they are not at stake. That \nis not what is at issue here, and no one pretends that is why we should \nbe involved. That is not what we are doing. We are not going to war to \nprotect a vital national security interest. We are not even sending \ntroops for a vital national security interest.\n  Whether vital national security interests are at stake is the right \nquestion to ask, Mr. President, if you are deciding whether or not to \nsend troops to war, it is not the right question to ask when you are \nbeing asked to participate in a multilateral, internationally \nsanctioned effort to help keep a peace which parties have said they \nwant. And we should remember that we are not being asked to do this \nalone. We are doing this in conjunction with perhaps 30 other \ncountries.\n  In many ways, Mr. President, Bosnia is the prototype of the kind of \nconflict the international community will face in the years ahead as \nforces, once held in check by superpower politics, are unleashed and, \nwith them, the potential for conflicts all across the globe.\n  I think it is vital for us to understand that the test is really \nwhether or not there are interests, whether or not there are important \ninterests, that outweigh the risks of our participation.\n  Mr. President, I have heard colleagues talk about the issue of \ncredibility. Some are going to suggest that the only reason they are \nprepared to vote to send these troops is to uphold the credibility of \nthe country or the credibility of the President.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, with searing memories of Vietnam, that is \nnot a reason to send our young military people into harm's way. I \nremember the phrase, ``I will not be the first President to lose a \nwar,'' and we lost tens of thousands of young people over the issue of \npride, over the issue of unwillingness to do anything except to sustain \nsomebody's credibility as people saw it. Credibility has to have an \nunderlying notion. It is not an abstract concept which merits the \ntaking of the life of a young American or the giving of a life of a \nyoung American. Credibility has to be based on some underlying interest \nwhich puts your credibility at stake.\n\n  I believe, Mr. President, that that vote--the credibility--is a hedge \nagainst a willingness to commit to this President's vision of what \ncredibility might be at stake here.\n  I believe there are legitimate interests for taking the risk of \ntrying to uphold the peace--not to fight a war, but to try to uphold a \npeace.\n  First, how could we as a nation avoid the moral interest in ending \nthe worst atrocities in Europe since World War II? Whoever thought that \nafter World War II Europe would again be the site of human beings being \nraped as a policy of war, tortured, murdered, separated from families, \nor thrown out of their homes simply because of ethnic background?\n  Who will forget quickly the stories recently that drove us to feel \ncompelled to simply leave them to fight for themselves--headlines such \nas ``Bosnia's Orphans of Rape; Innocent Legacy of Hatred,'' ``Mass \nGraves Probed in Northwest Bosnia,'' ``Anybody Who Moved or Screamed \nWas Killed: Thousands Massacred on Bosnia Trek in July,'' ``Srebrenica: \nThe Days of Slaughter''?\n  Who can forget the imperative of the words that we memorialize in \nWashington and elsewhere in this country, ``Never again''?\n  That is an interest, Mr. President.\n  Twice in this century Europe was engulfed by war, and the United \nStates fought to save it. We have already invested our blood in the \nstability and in the prospect of democracy and the future of Europe.\n  That is an interest, Mr. President.\n  The conflict in Bosnia has the potential for spillover--and could \nbecome a wider war--to areas where ethnic tensions are high: Kosovo, \nAlbania, Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey.\n  That is an interest, Mr. President.\n  So we have an interest in ensuring that those things do not happen. \nWe also have an interest in the risks to American forces and to NATO, \nand the cost of ensuring a peace in Bosnia now will inevitably be less \nthan if we would have to respond to a wider conflict in the future.\n  Finally, we do have an important interest in demonstrating leadership \non an international community level that we have the capacity and the \nwill to lead in the post-cold war world.\n  For far too long American policy toward Bosnia was vague, vacillating \nand \n\n[[Page S18546]]\nineffective. Now, to the credit of this administration, to our country, \nwe have changed that. And now we are trying to join together with our \nEuropean allies in an effort to provide the strong response that \nstopped the Bosnian Serb attacks, that did try to provide a \nhumanitarian corridor, that upheld the notion of international law, and \nthat was willing to try to enforce the concept of safe areas.\n  Having led the effort--an extraordinary effort by the President, \nSecretary Christopher, and Assistant Secretary Holbrooke--having led \nthat effort, Mr. President, how do we not have an interest that goes \nbeyond mere credibility in trying now to implement the settlement which \nwe ourselves have instigated and helped put together?\n  As President Clinton has said, if we do not participate in this \noperation, there will be no NATO force and the war in Bosnia will begin \nagain. Our moral and political interests in Bosnia and our sense of \nresponsibility demand that we not let that happen--and that we not be \nultimately dragged in.\n  So Mr. President, it is because credibility is based on real \ninterests that I support the President's decision to send our forces to \nBosnia but I believe just as firmly the President owes it to the \nAmerican people and Congress to ensure that the operation is limited in \nterms of the mission, limited in terms of the goals we set for success, \nand limited in duration.\n  As defined by the Dayton peace agreement, the mission of our troops \nand others participating in IFOR, the Bosnia Peace Implementation \nForce, is to monitor and enforce compliance with the military aspects \nof the peace agreement--that is, enforcing the cease-fire, supervising \nthe withdrawal of forces to agreed lines, establishing a zone of \nseparation between them, and returning troops and weapons to \ncantonments. Recognizing that they may need some help in making the \ntransition from war to peace, the parties asked for a strong, NATO-led \nforce. That is what they are getting and that is what they agreed to in \nthe Dayton peace agreement.\n  Our troops will take their orders only from the American general who \ncommands NATO and they will have the authority to meet any threat to \ntheir safety or any violation of the peace agreement with immediate, \ndecisive force.\n  When American peacekeepers in Somalia embarked upon what turned out \nto be an ill-fated mission to apprehend warlord Mohammed Aideed, they \nlacked the equipment and other elements necessary to ensure success.\n\n  From what our military officials have told us, this scenario will not \nbe repeated in Bosnia. Our forces are going in well-trained, well-\nequipped, heavily armed, and with robust rules of engagement.\n  I still remain concerned about the potential for so-called mission \ncreep. Under the terms of the peace agreement, I-For has the authority \nto ``help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other \ntasks associated with the peace settlement, including free and fair \nelections;'' to ``assist the movement of organizations in the \naccomplishment of humanitarian missions;'' ``to assist the UNHCR and \nother international organizations in their humanitarian missions;'' to \n``observe and prevent interference with the movement of civilian \npopulations, refugees, and displaced persons, and to respond \nappropriately to deliberate violence to life and person;'' and to \n``monitor the clearing of minefields and obstacles.''\n  True, these are authorities not obligations as Secretary Christopher \nhas pointed out. True, the mission is defined by the NATO plan and \nthese elements are not in the NATO plan, as Secretary Perry told the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Nevertheless, these authorities create the potential for expansion of \nthe mission beyond the military tasks cited by administration officials \nand for increased risk to our troops and those of other nations \nparticipating in the operation.\n  They also create an expectation on the part of the local populations \nand civilian organizations on the ground that I-For will protect and \nassist them.\n  If refugees are being attacked, can our troops really stand by and \nwatch? Would we want them to? If UNHCR ask I-For to help resettle \nrefugees in a given area, will I-For feel compelled to assist? If \nCatholic Relief Services asks French troops in Sarajevo to protect a \nconvoy of humanitarian aid going into the city, are they bound to \nassist?\n\n  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] is \nresponsible for organizing elections in Bosnia in the next year. What \nexpectations does OSCE, or the parties for that matter, have about \nIFOR's role in this process?\n  I remain concerned that IFOR's role in assisting the civilian \noperations that are to occur in the next year is still somewhat \nambiguous. I understand that NATO military planners wanted IFOR to have \nthese authorities to avoid the situation U.N. peacekeepers often found \nthemselves in in Bosnia--that is, standing by and watching as terrible \natrocities were committed against innocent civilians.\n  I agree that our soldiers must act if civilians are under attack or \ndirectly threatened. However, the operative word in responding to any \nof these situations must be ``limited.''\n  IFOR commanders from General Joulwan on down must understand that the \nAmerican people and Congress will not support a broadened definition of \nthe mission that has American forces serving as the constant protectors \nof civilian populations. That is not our job; the parties to the \nagreement must do this by fulfilling the commitments made in the \nagreement.\n  Much concern has been expressed in this debate about the exit \nstrategy for American troops. Any exit strategy must be composed of \nmore than a date; it must include criteria to determine whether or not \nthe mission has been successful. I believe that that criteria must be \nlimited solely to the military tasks that IFOR has set out to \naccomplish.\n  The civilian tasks that must be undertaken in the next year such as \nrefugee repatriation and resettlement, elections, establishing \ngovernmental structures, monitoring human rights, apprehending alleged \nwar criminals, are daunting. They must not become the criteria by which \nwe determine success of the IFOR mission.\n\n  The President has stated that the mission which we are asking our \ntroops to undertake will be limited to a year. Undoubtedly during this \nyear, there will be violations of the Dayton agreement.\n  However, if there is a pattern of violations which indicates that the \nparties are not truly committed to this agreement, then American forces \nshould be withdrawn. Our soldiers are there to keep the peace, not to \nfight a war or to prevent a war if the parties want to return once \nagain to being combatants. If it becomes clear as the end of the year \napproaches, that the duration of the IFOR mission needs to be extended \nbecause success is within reach but not yet achieved, the burden of \nthat mission must be shifted away from the United States and more to \nour European allies.\n  We must make it clear that we do not intend to stay in Bosnia \nindefinitely. Bosnia is first and foremost a European problem. If the \npeace implementation operation must be extended beyond a year, the \ncountries of Europe must be prepared to share more of the \nresponsibility and to replace our forces with theirs as we transition \nout. In other words, our troops must be out within the limited \ntimeframe the President has set out.\n  The peace agreement provides for a build-down of the parties' \nmilitary forces with the goal of achieving military parity by the end \nof the year, when IFOR is to withdraw. Administration officials have \nindicated that build-down may not be enough to ensured stability and \nthat the United States will ensure that the Armed Forces of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina are equipped and trained.\n  While I agree that military imbalance at the end of a year could be a \nserious threat to peace, I am concerned about the risk that this \nprocess could pose for American forces on the ground. Even though \nAmerican participants in I-For will not be arming or training \nFederation forces, they could be targets for Bosnian Serbs who object \nto the lack of neutrality on the part of the United States.\n\n  Beyond the risk factor, it is not at all clear to me, at least, when \nand \n\n[[Page S18547]]\nwhere build down ends and build up begins and who is going to do the \nbuilding up.\n  Notwithstanding these concerns, I believe our overall interests in \nBosnia warrant the sending of American troops to help keep the peace. \nCertainly there are risks associated with this operation, but every \neffort has been made to minimize those risks by ensuring that our \nforces are well-trained and well-equipped, and that the rules of \nengagement are robust in order that they may defend themselves against \nany life-threatening situation.\n  I recognize that many Americans and indeed some in this body do not \nbelieve that we should participate in this mission. As a Vietnam \nveteran, I know the pain and the difficulty of fighting without the \npolitical support of the American people and their representatives.\n  We are not sending our soldiers to Bosnia to fight a war, but we are \nasking them to undertake a military mission in the name of peace that \nis not without risk. No matter what concerns we may have about this \nendeavor, we owe them our full support. We should demonstrate that \nsupport by endorsing the President's decision to send them to Bosnia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I believe we \nmust support the President, but let me say that with caution. This must \nbe limited, limited, limited. It must have a clear strategy that does \nexit us at the end of the year, and we must define success in the \ncontext not of the civilian political success but only in the military \nseparation of the forces and the giving of them the opportunity to make \na peace.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the remaining order under the \nunanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 26 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Followed by?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And then the majority leader will speak after that. Is \nthat the unanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement to that effect, but that \nis the assumption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, like all other Senators who have spoken today, I wish \nthis debate were not necessary. I agree with those Senators who have \nsaid that they would not have undertaken the commitment made by the \nPresident of the United States to deploy American ground forces to \nBosnia to implement the tenuous peace that now exists there. But that \nis no longer the central question of our deliberations this evening. \nThe President did so commit and our obligation now goes beyond \nexpressing our disagreement with that decision.\n  Many of us did disagree, as is abundantly evident by the number of \nSenators who support the resolution offered by Senators Hutchison, \nInhofe, Nickles, and others, yet we all recognize that the President \nhas the authority to make that decision.\n  The troops are going to Bosnia, and any prospect that Congress could \nprevent that deployment disappeared in the overwhelming vote in \nopposition to prohibiting funding for the deployment, the only \nconstitutional means we have to reverse the President's decision.\n  Our troops are going to Bosnia. Congress should do everything in our \npower to ensure that our mission is truly clear, limited, and \nachievable; that it has the greatest for success with the least risk to \nthe lives of our young men and women. That is our responsibility, as \nmuch as the President's.\n  The resolution that the majority leader and I have offered does not \nask Senators to support the decision to deploy. It asks that you \nsupport the deployment after the decision had been made. It asks you \nfurther to condition your support on some important commitments by the \nPresident which I will discuss in a moment.\n  I intend to give that support, and I commend the majority leader for \nexercising extraordinary leadership in trying to influence both the \nnature and security of our mission Bosnia as well as the outcome of the \npeace process there, to which we have made such a profound commitment. \nI believe Senator Dole has significantly helped to improve both the \nsecurity of our forces and the likelihood that the cause they have been \nasked to serve--peace in Bosnia--will endure beyond the year our forces \nwill be stationed in that troubled country.\n  He has accomplished these important objectives by securing assurances \nfrom the administration that our soldiers will only be expected to \nperform those tasks for which they are trained, and will not be ill-\nused in nation-building exercises. Moreover, he has secured the strong \ncommitment from the President that the United States will lead efforts \nto establish a stable, military balance in Bosnia which is the only \nundertaking that can be realistically expected to secure a lasting \ncease-fire there. Those commitments were well worth our efforts, and, \nagain, I am grateful to the distinguished majority leader for his \nhonorable and effective statesmanship in this effort.\n  Mr. President, what we should all strive to avoid is giving anyone--\nanyone--in Bosnia the idea that the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives are so opposed to this deployment that the least \nprovocation--violent provocation--will force the President to withdraw \nour forces. I do not want a single terrorist, a single Majahidin or \nBosnian Serb sniper to think that by killing an American, they can \nincite a political uproar in America that will compel the President to \nbring our troops home.\n  That is my first reason for supporting this deployment. I want our \nenemies to know that America--not just the American force in Bosnia--\nbut all Americans are in deadly earnest about this deployment. Attacks \non the safety of those troops should, and I believe will, be met with a \ndisproportionate response. That response will not include abandoning \nthe mission. We must begin now to impress upon all parties in Bosnia \nthat any assault on the security of our soldiers would amount to \nnothing more than an act of folly on the part of the assailant.\n  Mr. President, opponents of the President's decision often claim that \nthere is no vital United States security interest in Bosnia that would \njustify the risk of American lives to defend. I have long agreed that \nthere was no such interest. But there is now. There are the lives of \n20,000 Americans to defend. And anyone who thinks they can achieve \ntheir own political ends by threatening our troops should be forcefully \ndisabused of that notion, and should not be encouraged in their action \nby the misperception that the American people and the U.S. Congress are \nnot united in steadfast support of our troops, their safety, and the \nmission they are now obligated to undertake.\n  There are other important American interests involved in this \ndeployment. All the parties to the Dayton agreement have stated \nunequivocally that should the United States renege on its commitment, \nthe peace will collapse and hostilities will resume. We will then watch \nBosnians suffer again the mass murder and atrocities that have repulsed \nall people of decency and compassion.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, abjuring our commitment now would do \nconsiderable damage to NATO, the most successful defensive alliance in \nhistory. Many Americans may wonder why we need to be concerned about \nNATO in the wake of the Soviet Unions's collapse. But, Mr. President, \nthe world still holds many dangers for our security, and our enemies \nare far less predictable than they once were. We will need our friends \nin the future, as much as they need us now.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I want to talk about the relationship between \nthe Nation's credibility and the credibility of its chief executive. In \nan earlier statement on this question, I asked my Republican colleagues \nto place as high a premium on this President's credibility abroad, as \nthey would place on a Republican President's.\n  I asked this because the reliability of the President's word is of \nenormous strategic value to the American people. The President's voice \nis the voice of America. When the world loses faith in the commitments \nof our President, all Americans are less safe--and somewhere down the \nline American vital interests and American lives will be lost. \n\n[[Page S18548]]\nThe credibility and authority of the President of the United States, \nand the security of American soldiers, compel our support of their \ndeployment. They are vital interests worth defending whatever our \ncurrent political differences may be with the President.\n  Again, by supporting the deployment, I do not confer my approval of \nthe decision to deploy. As I have already stated, I would not have \ncommitted American ground forces to this mission, had that decision \nbeen up to me. But the decision has been made, by the only American \nelected to make such decisions--the President of the United States. And \nI have construed my responsibility in these circumstances as requiring \nmy support for efforts to maximize the prospects for success of the \nmission and minimize its obvious risks.\n  My support, and the support I urge my colleagues to give this \ndeployment by voting for the resolution before us, has been \ncharacterized by the media as grudging. Fair enough. But let me be \nclear, I do not want to feed the cynicism of the public--or any members \nof our free press who might succumb to cynicism from time to time--\nshould they conclude that by our resolution, and our votes preceding \nthis one, that we are trying to avoid speaking clearly in support or \nopposition, and evade any responsibility for our own actions.\n  I know what I am doing. I know that by supporting this deployment, if \nnot the decision, I must share in the blame if it ends disastrously. I \nwill accept that responsibility--not happily, but honestly, just as \nSenators who supported the prohibition on funding for the deployment \nwould have had to accept the blame for the problems that would have \noccurred if they had been successful in preventing the deployment.\n  The President will be accountable to the families of any American \nsoldier who dies in service to his country in Bosnia. He will have to \nanswer for their loss. But so will I. I fully accept that in my support \nof the deployment, and my efforts to influence its conduct and its \ntermination, I incur this obligation.\n  Beyond offering expressions of sorrow and regret, we will have to \ntell those families that they bear their terrible loss for the sake of \nthe country. Nothing--absolutely nothing--is harder than that. Just \ncontemplating such a responsibility makes me heartsick.\n  This may be the hardest vote I have cast as a Member of Congress. It \nmay be the hardest vote I will ever cast. To send young men and women \ninto such evident danger is an awful responsibility. I don't envy the \nPresident. Nor do I envy the Senate.\n  I was once on the other end of the relationship between the military \nand their civilian commanders. I served with brave men who were sent by \nour leaders into a calamity--a war we would not win. We were ill used \nby our political leaders then. We were ill used by many of our senior \ncommanders. I saw good men lose their lives, lives that were just \nsquandered for a lost cause that the dying believed in, but that many \nof the living did not. Their cause was honor, their own and their \ncountry's. And they found their honor in their answer, not their \nsummons. I will never forget that. Never. Never.\n  If I have any private oath that I have tried to abide by in my public \nservice it is that I would never ask Americans to serve in missions \nwhere success was not defined, the commitment to achieve it uncertain, \nand its object of less value than its price.\n  I pray today that I have kept my oath. I will pray so every night for \nas long as this mission lasts. I wish the people of Bosnia peace. I \nwish them peace because they deserve that blessing, but even more \nimportantly because the lives of many fine young Americans have been \nransomed to that peace. I know that these Americans will perform \nmagnificently, under very difficult circumstances, to secure the \nobjectives of their mission. They will reflect, as they always do, \ngreat credit on themselves and on the United States, as they seek again \nto secure the peace and security in which another people may secure \ntheir rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Mr. President, I learned about duty, its costs and its honor, from \nfriends who did not come home with me to the country we loved so \ndearly, and from friends who overcame adversity with far more courage \nand grace than I possessed. I have tried to see my duty in this \nquestion as they would have me see it.\n  In the difficult decision--and it is difficult for reasons greater \nand more honorable than political advantage or disadvantage--our sense \nof duty may lead us to different conclusions. I respect all of my \ncolleagues for seeking to discharge their solemn responsibilities in \nthis matter after careful deliberation and with honest reasoning.\n  But I want to make one last point to those Americans--and I do not \ninclude any of my colleagues in this category--who oppose this \ndeployment and this resolution because they resent the costs of \nAmerica's leadership in the world. The burdens that are imposed on the \nUnited States are greater than the burdens borne by any other nation. \nThere is no use bemoaning that fact or vainly trying to avoid its \nreality. This reality will be so for as long as we remain the greatest \nnation on earth. When we arrive at the moment when less is expected \nfrom our leadership by the rest of the world, then we will have arrived \nat the moment of our decline. We should accept that burden with \ncourage. We cannot withdraw from the world into our prosperity and \ncomfort and hope to keep those blessings. We cannot leave the world \nalone. For the world will not leave us alone.\n  So I will support this mission, with grave concern and more than a \nlittle sadness. I will support my President. I will, I believe, support \nmy country and the men and women we have asked to defend us. I give my \nfull support, whatever my concerns. And I accept, fully, the \nconsequences of what I do her today. I ask my colleagues to do so as \nwell.\n  I ask all Senators to support the Dole resolution, irrespective of \ntheir views over the policy that brought our soldiers to Bosnia. I ask \nfor your vote as an expression of support for the American soldiers \nwho, summoned to duty in Bosnia, will find their honor and ours in \ntheir answer. I ask for your vote to help reduce the threats to their \nwelfare, and increase the chances that the cause for which they risk so \nmuch may succeed, and endure long after they have come home to a \ngrateful nation.\n  And I ask God to bless the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who \nwill render their Nation this great service; to bless the President; to \nbless the Congress; and to bless the United States. We are all in great \nneed of His benevolence today.\n   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this evening, President Clinton is \ntraveling to Paris to sign the Bosnia peace agreement. The first of \n20,000 American troops are on their way to Bosnia to help implement \nthat agreement. And we in the Senate are being asked to make a choice. \nA choice with profound--even life-and-death--consequences.\n  Will we give our troops going to Bosnia our full and genuine support? \nOr will we burden them with the weight of conflicting messages?\n  In the more than 3\\1/2\\ years since war broke out in the former \nYugoslavia, more than a quarter of a million people --including tens of \nthousands of innocent children--have been killed.\n  The Bosnian people are weary of war. They have negotiated a peace \nsettlement. They are merely asking us to help them implement it.\n  Some may ask: Why us? Why must the United States become involved in \nthis ancient conflict? I believe there are three answers.\n  First, it is in our national interest. Peace and stability in Europe \nare vital to the United States. Twice in this century, we have seen \nwhat horrors can occur when aggression in Europe is allowed to spread \nunchallenged and unchecked. Twice in this century, Americans have died \nto keep Europe free of such aggression. To turn our back on Bosnia now, \nespecially after the President has committed American troops, would be \nto deny what we have learned, and what those earlier generations \nsacrificed. It would weaken American leadership in NATO. And it would \nundermine our credibility as a world leader. \n\n[[Page S18549]]\n\n  Second, we have a moral obligation in Bosnia. For nearly 50 years, we \nbelieved that we would never again see concentration camps in Europe. \nWe would never again see men and boys made to dig their own mass graves \nand then be machine-gunned into them. We were wrong. This is happening \nin Bosnia, and our national conscience demands that we take a strong \nstand against it.\n  In 1948, 3 years after the end of World War II, the French writer and \nphilosopher Albert Camus appealed to the monks of a French monastery to \nhelp the children who had been injured and orphaned in that war. \n``Perhaps we cannot prevent this world from being a world in which \nchildren are tortured,'' Camus said. ``But we can reduce the number of \nchildren who are tortured. And if you don't help us, who else in the \nworld can help us do it?''\n  That brings me to the third reason we must help implement this \nagreement. The United States must help bring peace to Bosnia because no \none else in the world can. The leaders of all three factions--Serbs, \nCroats, and Moslems--have made it clear that they will not participate \nin the peace process unless we are involved.\n  I commend President Clinton and all the members of the negotiating \nteam who worked so hard in Dayton to get us to this point. They \naccomplished what many said was impossible, and their leadership is \nalready saving lives. Without the commitment of this President to peace \nin the Balkans, there would be no debate tonight, for we could not be \non the verge of peace.\n  I also want to commend the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Nunn, and all the senators in our Bosnia working group \nfor the leadership they have shown in negotiating a resolution that \nsays unequivocally to our troops, ``We support you.''\n  That mission will give the Bosnian people an opportunity to build a \ndemocratic society. Bosnia-Herzegovina will be preserved as a single \nState with a unified capital of Sarajevo. The Bosnian people will be \nallowed to hold free elections, and those who have been driven from \ntheir homes through fighting and other forms of terrorism will be free \nto return.\n  Our mission is clear, limited, and achievable. We are sending our \ntroops to maintain a ceasefire. They will take their orders from an \nAmerican general. And they will have full authority to respond to \nthreats to their safety with immediate and overwhelming force.\n  Again, the critical question is, are we going to give our troops our \ngenuine support as they seek to carry out their mission? Or are we \ngoing to burden them with conflicting messages?\n  Mr. President, I believe the Hutchison amendment is gravely misguided \nand even dangerous. It claims to support our troops, but, in fact, it \nundermines them. How can we support our troops if we condemn the \nmission for which they are risking their lives? Have we learned nothing \nfrom our own history?\n  Sending such a contradictory message would badly undermine the morale \nof our troops and jeopardize their safety.\n  It would also undermine U.S. credibility--our commitment to peace, \nand our commitment to our NATO allies.\n  Finally, sending such a conflicting and wrong-headed message would \nundermine the peace agreement itself, and efforts to implement it.\n  The responsible vote is a vote for the bipartisan resolution offered \nby the majority leader.\n  This resolution supports our troops unequivocally. It commends them \nfor their professionalism and patriotism and bravery. It assures that \nthey will have all the resources and authority they need to protect the \npeace--and protect themselves.\n  It recognizes the vital interests our Nation has in preventing the \nspread of the Bosnian conflict and ending the bloodshed. It preserves \nAmerica's leadership within NATO, and it preserves our credibility with \nour allies.\n  And it requires the President to certify two important conditions. \nFirst, that the NATO implementation force is limited to implementation \nof the peace agreement and protection of NATO troops. And second, that \nthe United States objectives in Bosnia are to maintain the peace and \nestablish a military balance that will allow the Bosnian Moslems to \ndefend themselves when NATO withdraws.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma noted earlier tonight, the Hutchison/\nInhofe and Dole/McCain resolutions are contradictory. The Hutchison \nresolution, although it is non-binding, sends a dangerous and \nconflicting message that will undermine and endanger American troops.\n  The Dole/McCain resolution is binding legislation that asserts \nCongressional authority and responsibility and sends a clear message \nthat we support our troops and the cause for which they are risking \ntheir lives. It is the right thing to do.\n  To echo the words of Camus, the United States cannot prevent all \nwars, everywhere. But we can reduce the number of children and adults \nkilled in Bosnia. Our national security, and our national conscience, \ndemand that we try.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18515-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18549-S18552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send my resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 44) concerning the deployment \n     of United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. That resolution will be the second vote. The first vote \nwill be on the Hutchison resolution.\n  Mr. President, let me indicate at 10:05 p.m. our time, and 4:05 in \nthe morning in Bosnia, where many Americans are now and where hundreds \nand thousands more will be on the way, I think we have to understand \nwhat we are about to vote on here. We are not voting on a decision to \nsend American troops to Bosnia. That decision has been made. It was \nmade 2 years ago by the President of the United States. Without \nconsulting Congress, the President of the United States made that \ndecision.\n  So we say to those soldiers who may be on early duty there at 4 a.m. \nin the morning, in the bitter cold--from those of us in the warmth of \nthe U.S. Senate, free from any danger--we are about to cast a vote. We \nare about to cast a vote, Sergeant Jones or Private Smith, whoever it \nis, to indicate that we support your efforts there. They may have some \nmisgivings about why they are there, and we may have some doubts. I \nlistened to the eloquent statement of Senator McCain, and I listened \nlast evening to the final speaker of the evening, Senator Cohen from \nMaine, but this is not about politics. This is not about a Democratic \nPresident and a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. This is about a \nlot of frightened young Americans who are in Bosnia, or on their way to \nBosnia. I assume they may not have thought of it directly, but I \nbelieve they will think of it one of these days; they are going to be \nlooking back to see if they had the support of those who represented \nthem in the Congress of the United States. They may not be thinking of \nthat at 4:10 a.m.\n\n  So this is a very difficult debate for Members of Congress. It is a \ndifficult debate because Congress was not part of the decisionmaking \nwith respect to sending troops. Congress was not consulted. Congress \nwas told of the President's commitment to send troops after the \ncommitment was made. And then we were faced with the dilemma of \nundermining that commitment or acquiescing in a military mission with \nserious flaws. And make no mistake about it, the President has said he \nmade this decision and he takes responsibility. It was his decision to \nsend troops and his decision alone.\n  A lot of Members of Congress, some on both sides of the aisle--in \nfact, 69 of us voted the last time to lift the arms embargo to give the \nBosnians an opportunity to defend themselves--which is precisely the \nreason we are here tonight--so that we would not be sending American \ntroops or making that decision. But the President rejected that. That \nwas bipartisan in the House and \n\n[[Page S18550]]\nin the Senate. We opposed the arms embargo. As I said, we repeatedly \nvoted to lift it. Some of my colleagues were concerned about that.\n  We have two resolutions before us tonight. I understand that a number \nof Senators support the resolution offered by the Senator from Texas; \nthe Senators from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe and Senator Nickles; and a \nnumber of others. That resolution emphasizes very clearly that we \noppose the decision to deploy troops. No doubt about it. We disagree, \nwe oppose. It is his decision, and he said as much as recently as, I \nthink, Sunday on ``60 Minutes.''\n  However, a vote on this resolution does not provide our troops, who \nare now in Bosnia at 4:08 in the morning, and the other thousands who \nwill be there tomorrow, or next week, or next month--I think it makes a \npoint, but it does not make a policy. It does not effect a policy. It \ndoes not make the job our forces have to do any safer or any easier, \nnor does it provide a plan to achieve a military balance in Bosnia or \nincrease the chances for successful completion of our mission.\n  I assume most of our colleagues will vote for that resolution. If \nthey do, I wish they would follow up their signal to President Clinton \nby voting ``yes'' on the Dole-McCain-Nunn resolution. I want to be \nclear about what that resolution does and does not do. This resolution \ndoes not endorse the President's decision. It does not endorse the \nagreement reached in Dayton. It does support our men and women in \nuniform.\n  It does limit the mission to military tasks only and requires a \nrealistic exit strategy based on the goal of Bosnian self-reliance. To \nput it simply, President Clinton has a plan to get us into Bosnia; this \nresolution shows us a way out.\n  It sets three conditions on the deployment of American forces: No. 1, \nit limits the mission to implementing military provisions of the \naccord. No Somalia-style nation building, for example. It insists on an \nexit strategy linked to military balance so Bosnia can defend itself. \nSomebody said that is bad policy because if they are armed and trained \nwe may have to stay longer. I do not understand that argument. We have \nbeen debating on this floor for 2 years that we ought to arm and train \nthe Bosnians and lift the arms embargo so they can defend themselves. \nThat is precisely what we wish to do here. No. 3 also provides U.S. \nleadership on an immediate effort to provide Bosnia that means to \ndefend itself. I think if these conditions are met they will help \nenhance the safety of our forces and assure that they can withdraw in a \ntimely manner and without triggering a resumption of hostilities.\n  Let us be clear, setting a date is not an exit strategy. In fact, \nmany will argue that if we set a date nothing will happen until that \ndate expires, and then hostilities will recur.\n  I suggest that I think we have been able to perform a valuable \nservice here for our colleagues regardless of their feelings about the \ndecision. I did not agree with it. You do not agree with it--maybe some \ndo agree with the decision. The decision has been made. The deployment \nstarted. Our goal should be a Bosnia that is self-reliant, able to \ndefend itself without depending on the United States or any outside \nforce.\n  I want to emphasize just a few points on this critical issue. First, \nthe word ``lead'' is essential. Without U.S. leadership, this will not \nhappen. Leading does not mean going it alone but it does mean acting \nlike the sole remaining superpower. Second, our language makes it clear \nthat the efforts to arm and train will take place separate and apart \nfrom NATO, IFOR; no United States military forces in NATO operation \nwill be involved enabling Bosnia to defend itself. Finally, this \nresolution states that the Bosnians should be provided with assistance \nof the highest possible quality--American where necessary--and that of \nother countries when sufficient.\n  I also point out this resolution requires the President report \nextensively on his plan to enable Bosnia to provide for its own defense \nand on all aspects of the military and civilian aspects of the \noperation.\n  I want to say a few words about Senator McCain and his leadership on \nnational security issues. From his sacrifice during Vietnam--and I know \nI was not standing here; I was not in leadership, I was standing back \nthere somewhere. I was wearing a John McCain bracelet, proudly--a POW \nbracelet--and arguing with my Democratic colleagues on the other side \nnot to cut off funding in the Vietnam war. I led debate on this floor \nfor 7 weeks in an effort to derail those who would cut off funding \nwhile John McCain was in a little box over there in prison and there \nwere thousands like him and thousands and thousands of Americans.\n  The theory was just cut off funding. The war will end. That is not \nthe way it works.\n  So John McCain came back, others came back, and others did not come \nback as Senator McCain said earlier. Then he became a freshman \nCongressman and opposed the deployment in Lebanon in 1983. It seems to \nme, not that I have any more insight than anybody else in this body, \nbut there is something about a relationship that you build up in the \nservice and you understand one thing: How important support is from \nAmerica--whether it is your family, whether it is your little hometown, \nwhether it is your State, whether it is the Congress of the United \nStates.\n\n  I say to Senator McCain and many others who were prisoners of war in \nVietnam, no one works any harder on the issues of war and peace. I did \nnot agree with Senator McCain on normalizing relations with Vietnam, \nbut he was there and I was not. No one takes his responsibility more \nseriously. We could not have reached this agreement without his almost \nminute-by-minute involvement.\n  Let me say one other thing about leadership: It is not easy. The \neasiest vote is no, no, no. I recall being on the floor in this \nposition in January 1991, the 10th, 11th, and 12th, when we had troops \nin the gulf. President Bush had decided to come to Congress and ask for \nsupport. I remember at the time we had a very good debate--3 days of \nit--Democrats and Republicans, and I do not question anybody's motives. \nThe thing that struck me as I looked at it at the time and as I look \nback at it now, not a single member of the Democratic leadership in the \nHouse or the Senate would stand up on this floor or the House floor and \nsupport President Bush. They did not have to agree with President Bush. \nI do not agree with President Clinton. But the troops were there. I \nthought that was a tragic mistake. You pay a price for leadership. Some \nwill have short-term political gain and some just truly feel we should \nnot be doing anything and that the only vote is no.\n  I ask my colleagues, it is now 17 after 4 o'clock a.m. in Bosnia, and \nAmericans are there, so if we cut off funding this morning, I do not \nknow what would have happened. If we pass the Hutchison resolution, I \ndo not know what will happen. I hope if we pass the Dole-McCain-Nunn, \net al., resolution that we will have provided an exit strategy, a way \nto extricate Americans by arming and training Bosnians, so that they \ncan be an independent force and so we can go home, so that those \nAmericans who are there today at 18 after 4 o'clock a.m. in the morning \nwill not be there next Christmas.\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is not easy. I have had a \nlot of mail, a lot of phone calls, from a lot of people, who I do not \nthink understand the issue. The issue we are voting on tonight is not a \ndecision to send American troops. Let me conclude with that. We can \nposture and complain about the President's decision. I do not like it. \nHe knows I do not like it. I told him I do not like it. I said publicly \nI do not like it. If we had our way, we would have lifted the embargo \nand we would not be talking about sending troops. That is our argument. \nI think it would have been correct.\n  I guess our decision is whether we are going to send a message to all \nthe families in America, to all the troops who are on the way to \nBosnia, plus all the other American forces who someday may be engaged \nin some conflict, because we do have a responsibility from time to \ntime. They will ask themselves, do we have the support of the American \npeople, of our families and of our representatives? I think that is \nwhat this debate is all about. I hope that is how it is received by the \npeople who watch or listen or read the Record or listen to each other.\n  I ask my colleagues to think very carefully. We are going to be \ndebating this. I assume this is just the first debate. A month from \nnow, 2 months \n\n[[Page S18551]]\nfrom now, 3 months from now, 4 months from now, something happens, \nthere will be other debates and other efforts made. But this is the \nimportant, this is the first step. This is a signal to the American \nforces that we support you. We support you, as we should.\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \nexchange I have had with the President on his assurances that the \nBosnians will be provided with arms and the training they need. I think \nthe letters are very important. It is part of the legislative history, \nbecause the President has given his word that that training will be \nprovided and arms will be furnished. And, again, that is very \nimportant. It may be lost on someone now, but it is going to be very \nimportant not a year from now, as the Senator from Maine said last \nnight, 9 months from now, 9 months from now is when it starts. If they \nare not trained, and if we have to wait 6 months, it may be lost.\n  So, it is up to us. If not now, when? This is the time to support \nAmerican forces.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                               Washington, DC., December 10, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I want to set forth for you the \n     Administration's policy with respect to military \n     stabilization measures in Bosnia.\n       The Bosnian Serb advantage in heavy weapons relative to the \n     defense capability of the Bosnian Federation has been a major \n     reason for the fighting in Bosnia and remains a potential \n     source of instability. We believe that establishing a stable \n     military balance within Bosnia by the time IFOR leaves is \n     important to preventing the war from resuming and to \n     facilitate IFOR's departure.\n       The Dayton Agreement has strong arms control provisions \n     which provide for a ``build-down'' of forces. We intend to \n     pursue these vigorously. An arms restraint regime obviously \n     can help contribute to a stable balance.\n       Even with arms control, we anticipate there will be a \n     deficiency on the part of the Federation. Accordingly, we \n     have made a commitment to the Bosnian Federation that we will \n     coordinate an international effort to ensure that the \n     Federation receives the assistance necessary to achieve an \n     adequate military balance when IFOR leaves.\n       Because we want to assure the impartiality of IFOR, \n     providing arms and training to Federation forces will not be \n     done by either IFOR or U.S. military fordes. The approach we \n     intend to pursue is for the U.S. to coordinate the efforts of \n     third countries.\n       Our efforts in this connection already have begun. An \n     assessment team to evaluate the needs of the Federation has \n     just returned from Bosnia. We will proceed with this effort \n     in a manner that is consistent with the UN resolution lifting \n     the arms embargo and the relevant Dayton Agreement \n     provisions, which allow planning and training to proceed, but \n     restrict actual transfers during the initial six months, in \n     particular of all arms for 90 days, and heavy weapons for 180 \n     days, after the Agreement enters into force.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to seek clarification on \n     several critical issues raised in your December 10 letter \n     regarding your administration's policy on arming and training \n     Bosnian Federation forces. In our view, it is essential to \n     clarify these matters--which are integral to the U.S. exit \n     strategy--prior to moving forward with Senate consideration \n     of your administration's decision to send U.S. ground forces \n     to implement the Dayton agreement.\n       You acknowledge the Bosnian Serb military advantage and the \n     need to establish a stable military balance within Bosnia by \n     the time the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) leaves. In your \n     address to the nation, you justified American participation \n     in IFOR by stating the need for American leadership. However, \n     your letter does not indicate that the United States will \n     lead in the critical effort of ensuring the Bosnians can \n     defend themselves. We are seeking your confirmation that the \n     United States will lead in coordinating and providing the \n     Bosnians with the means for self-defense. Without an \n     American-led effort to rapidly provide the Bosnians with the \n     best possible quality arms, equipment, and training, we \n     believe that the Bosnians will not be able to adequately \n     defend themselves within a year.\n       Also in this regard, while we understand that the arming \n     and training program should be conducted separately from the \n     IFOR peacekeeping operation, to state that no U.S. military \n     forces will be involved--as your letter does--is a guarantee \n     that such a program will be wholly ineffective and may not \n     even occur. A strict prohibition on all U.S. military \n     involvement outside the territory of Bosnia would severely \n     cripple American efforts to ensure that the Bosnians are \n     provided with the weapons and training they need. Military \n     planning, coordination, information-sharing, or even Bosnian \n     participation in the International Military Education and \n     Training (IMET) could not occur under such a prohibition. It \n     seems that so severely limiting our flexibility would not be \n     in our national interest.\n       Finally, we urge you to focus on what the United States can \n     do, rather than what we cannot do under the U.N. Security \n     Council resolution lifting the arms embargo. For example, \n     training can begin immediately--presumably outside of Bosnia. \n     Also, an array of defensive weapons could be provided to \n     Bosnian Federation forces on day 91 consistent with the U.N. \n     resolution--as could any weapon not classified as ``heavy'' \n     under the terms of the U.N. resolution.\n       We hope that you will clarify these matters as soon as \n     possible so that we may proceed with consideration of the \n     Dole-McCain resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing in response to your December \n     12 letter on equip and train. You raise several questions to \n     which I would like to respond.\n       First of all, the United States will take a leadership role \n     in coordinating an international effort to ensure that the \n     Bosnian Federation receives the assistance necessary to \n     achieve an adequate military balance when IFOR leaves. As in \n     all things related to our effort to bringing peace to the \n     region, U.S. leadership has been critical.\n       As I stated in my December 10 letter to you, I want to \n     assure the impartiality of IFOR. In the view of my military \n     advisors, this requires minimizing the involvement of U.S. \n     military personnel. But we expect that some individual \n     military officers, for example, working in OSD, DSAA or other \n     agencies, will be involved in planning this effort. We also \n     will offer the Bosnians participation in U.S. programs such \n     as IMET. I agree that maintaining flexibility is important to \n     the success of the effort to achieve a stable military \n     balance within Bosnia. But I will do nothing that I believe \n     will endanger the safety of American troops on the ground in \n     Bosnia. I am sure you will agree that is my primary \n     responsibility.\n       I want to assure you that I am focusing on what the United \n     States can do. That is why I sent an assessment team to the \n     region to properly evaluate the needs of the Federation. \n     Training programs and provision of non-lethal assistance can \n     begin immediately after the peace agreement enters into \n     force; and provision of small arms can begin after three \n     months. We intend to move expeditiously.\n       I have given you my word that we will make certain that the \n     Bosnian Federation will receive the assistance necessary to \n     achieve an adequate military balance when IFOR leaves. I \n     intend to keep it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n       EXPRESSING OPPOSITION OF CONGRESS TO PRESIDENT CLINTON'S \n     PLANNED DEPLOYMENT OF GROUND FORCES IN BOSNIA\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 44\n\n       Whereas beginning on February 24, 1993, President Clinton \n     committed the United States to participate in implementing a \n     peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina without prior \n     consultation with Congress;\n       Whereas the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been \n     unjustly denied the means to defend itself through the \n     imposition of a United Nations arms embargo;\n       Whereas the United Nations Charter restates the ``the \n     inherent right of individual and collective self-defense,'' a \n     right denied the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina whose \n     population has further suffered egregious violations of the \n     international law of war including ethnic cleansing by \n     Serbian aggressors, and the Convention on Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, to which the United \n     States Senate gave its advice and consent in 1986;\n       Whereas the United States Congress has repeatedly voted to \n     end the United States participation in the international arms \n     embargo on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the best \n     way to achieve a military balance and a just and stable peace \n     without the deployment of United States Armed Forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \n     Republic of Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     initialed the General Framework Agreement and Associated \n     Annexes on November 21, 1995 in Dayton, Ohio, after repeated \n     assurances that the United States would send troops to assist \n     in implementing that agreement;\n       Whereas three dedicated American deplomats--Bob Frasure, \n     Joe Kruzel, and Nelson Drew--lost their lives in the \n     American-led diplomatic effort which culminated in the \n     General Framework Agreement;\n       Whereas as part of the negotiations which led to the \n     General Framework Agreement, the United States has made a \n     commitment to ensure that the Federation of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina is armed and trained to provide for its own \n     defense, and that commitment should be honored;\n       Whereas the mission of the NATO Implementation Force is to \n     create a secure environment to provide Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     an opportunity to begin to establish a durable peace, which \n     requires the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be able \n     to provide for its own defense;\n       Whereas the objective of the United States in deploying \n     United States Armed Forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina can only \n     be successful if the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \n     armed and trained to provide for its own defense after the \n     withdrawal of the NATO Implementation Force and the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas in deciding to participate in implementation of the \n     General Framework Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     President Clinton has cited American interests including \n     maintaining its leadership in NATO, preventing the spread of \n     the conflict, stopping the tragic loss of life, and \n     fulfilling American commitments;\n       Whereas on December 3, 1995, President Clinton approved \n     Operation Joint Endeavor and deployment of United States \n     Armed Forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina began immediately \n     thereafter: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       The Congress unequivocally supports the men and women of \n     our Armed Forces who are carrying out their missions in \n     support of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina with professional \n     excellence, dedicated patriotism and exemplary bravery, and \n     believes they must be given all necessary resources and \n     support to carry out their mission and ensure their security.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Senior \nCitizens' Freedom to Work Act with my colleagues, Senators McCain and \nRoth.\n  This bill would provide long overdue relief for our senior citizens. \nIt would remove a significant impediment that deters seniors from \ncontinuing to work. Under the bill, seniors could earn up to $30,000 by \nthe year 2002 without affecting their Social Security benefits.\n  I intend to work for enactment of the legislation this year to begin \nimmediately lifting the unreasonably low earnings limit. We will phase \nin the increase over the next 7 years from the current level of $11,280 \nto $30,000.\n  This legislation is important for the economy. Continuation of the \ncurrent policy, which does not utilize the experience and productivity \nof our seniors, is wasteful and short-sighted.\n  This legislation is also important for the protection of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds. The bill clarifies that the \nSecretary of the Treasury is not authorized to under invest and/or \ndisinvest Social Security and Medicare trust fund monies in Federal \nsecurities or obligations in order to avoid the limitations on the \npublic debt.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this effort. \nSpecifically, I urge my colleagues on the Finance Committee to join \nwith me to report the bill out of committee tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18553-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18553-S18554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE NEW READY OR NOT PROGRAM TO COMBAT UNDERAGE DRINKING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every day in Congress, we tackle some of \nthe most pressing problems facing our nation. But sometimes, the best \nsolutions don't come from the Capitol. They come from homes and schools \nand community organizations that you find in every town and city, all \nacross the country. That's what a new program called ``Ready or Not: \nTalking with Kids About Alcohol,'' is all about.\n  If you have kids, you know that telling them to ``just say no'' to \nalcohol doesn't always work. Kids want to know why they should say no. \n``Ready or Not'' is a new video educational program that's designed to \nhelp parents and other adult supervisors answer that question for kids \nbetween the ages of 10 and 14.\n  ``Ready or Not'' is a joint effort of the Boys & Girls Clubs of \nAmerica and the Century Council, an organization funded by the alcohol \nindustry. It was introduced just after Thanksgiving, and it's already \nmaking an impact. I want to congratulate the Boys and Girls Club and \nthe Century Council for all the time and energy they've invested in \nthis important program.\n  I also want to commend my 36 colleagues in the House and Senate who \nhave joined me in officially endorsing this life-saving project.\n  A recent survey of America's pre-teens--pre-teens--shows that about \nfour in 10 expect to have problems handling situations involving the \nuse of alcohol. Another survey by the University of Michigan found \nthat, in 1994, more than a quarter of America's eighth-graders reported \ndrinking alcohol in the last month. And, more and more kids are \nbecoming ``binge drinkers.''\n  We know from our experience in combating teen smoking that if you \nreach kids early and tell them the truth, they're far more likely to \nmake good decisions about their health. ``Ready or Not'' will help us \nreplicate that success, we hope, with teen drinking.\n  There are two reasons that ``Ready or Not'' targets kids between the \nages of 10 and 14. First, that's when many ``problem drinkers'' first \nstart experimenting with alcohol. Second, and more important, parents \nand other adults still have a lot of influence over kids at that age. \nWith the help of ``Ready or Not,'' we can reach kids who are in danger \nof abusing alcohol, and prevent problems before they start.\n\n[[Page S18554]]\n\n  The last thing a developing mind and body needs is to be stunted with \nalcohol. ``Ready or Not'' will help parents and teachers and other \nadults make that case convincingly to America's young people. It fills \na critical need, and I'm proud to lend my name to help support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18553-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SHOULD THERE BE FEDERAL FARM PROGRAMS?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past decade most of the debate on \nfarm programs has centered around only one question:\n  ``How much should we spend on farm programs?''\n  Four months ago, I took to the floor to address this issue and noted \nthat the debate has shifted to whether there should be any programs \nthat provide benefits to farmers.\n  Now, the Republican majority has reported a bill that again only \nanswers the ``how much'' question. It will give $55 billion of the \ntaxpayers funds to farmers over the next 7 years.\n  The fundamental question is not answered. Should there be farm \nprograms at all?\n  Farm programs have never been welfare programs.\n  They have been a contract with the American people.\n  Here is a copy of the contract that the farmers signs each year with \nthe American taxpayer.\n  No farmer is required to sign this contract. Each farmer signs \nvoluntarily.\n\n\n                 historical rationale for farm programs\n\n  Historically, the contract was a ``price and production \nstabilization'' contract--as it says here at the top of this document. \nThe taxpayers paid farmers to set land aside in order to stabilize \nconsumer prices as well as stabilizing farm income.\n  In 1985, the Republican Senate added a new term to that contract. \nFarmers were also paid to be stewards of the land. Again, no farmer was \nrequired to become a land steward--to be a good neighbor. Each farmer \nmade that decision voluntarily.\n  Now, the Republican budget farm bill changes the terms of the farm \ncontract. It no longer offers American farmers a ``price and production \nstabilization'' contract. Thus, for the $35 billion the taxpayers give \nfarmers over the next 7 years, consumers get no price stability \nbenefit.\n  Do I mourn the loss of a farmer-taxpayer contract based on a price \nstabilization rationale?\n  No, I do not. At one time regulations that required farmers to manage \nsupplies also helped stabilize some food prices. By and large, there is \nno longer much, if any, consumer benefit from the supply management \naspects of farm programs. Today, supply management programs function \nonly to control the budgetary costs of the program.\n  This history brings us back to the basic question. Should there be \nany Federal farm programs?\n\n\n                   unique natural resource challenges\n\n  The answer is yes. For one overriding reason. It is this. Only \nfarmers can give the American people what they want from private lands.\n  Let me put it very simply. Americans cannot get the environmental \nbenefits they want unless farmers and ranchers are active willing land \nstewards.\n  Before we reviewed a little history--now a little--or should I say--a \nlot of geography. Farms and grazing lands make up 50 percent of the \ncontinental United States.\n  Let me say that again--Farmers and ranchers own or manage 50 percent \nof the continental United States.\n  It is impossible to successfully regulate such a vast area--even if \none wanted to--which I do not. To successfully protect and enhance \nnatural resource values on private lands, farmers must be a willing \npart of the solution.\n  The 1985 and the 1990 farm bills show that the taxpayers are willing \nto pay farmers to protect drinking water, cleanup lakes and rivers, and \nto be stewards of the soil.\n  As the executive director of the National Rifle Association states, \n``Congress has had the foresight to create these unique mechanisms \nwhich wed agricultural goals with conservation goals.'' For example, no \nlonger were farmers paid to destroy wetlands. Instead, farm programs \nbegan to protect wetlands.\n  Today, some farm groups favor destroying his harmony. They even go so \nfar as to say that farm conservation should only be funded if there is \nany money left after farm subsidies and exports subsidies are paid for.\n  It does not make sense to the public. There is no reason a farmer \nshould be richer than a machine shop owner, even though there is a \nrationale for farmers being protected from unexpected market shifts.\n  So this is the time for testing.\n  It comes down to this question--Is this Republican package the \nbeginning of the end of farm programs, the last 7 years of ``market \ntransition payments,'' or is it a new beginning for farm programs--\nwhich builds on the stewardship contract that the American farmer made \nwith the American people beginning in 1985.\n  In 1990, as chairman, I confirmed and deepened the land stewardship \ncontract between farmers and the American public. One of my proudest \nmoments as chairman was when I stood in the White House while the \nPresident praised the 1990 farm bill as ``one of the most important \nenvironmental legislative accomplishments of his Presidency.''\n  But the Republican budget package leaves the basic question \nunanswered. The Republican proposal says that it will continue to make \n``adherence to existing conservation compliance and wetland protection \nregulations'' a condition of receiving farm payments. It also launches \na new program, the ``Livestock Environmental Assistance Program'' which \nprovides the same kind of financial assistance to livestock farmers and \nranchers that crop farmers have received. It is a great idea--of which \nI am the proud author. This press release seems to affirm and expand \nthe stewardship contract of the 1985 and 1990 farm bills.\n  But, the Republican agricultural leaders have also called for \ndropping the wetlands protection contract term in the farmers contract \nwith the American taxpayer.\n  So what is real?--the press release or their legislation?\n  The Republicans are not being straight with either the taxpayers or \nthe farmers.\n  If the Republicans tear up the contract between the farmers and the \nAmerican people--then the Freedom to Farm contract is a one way \ncontract in which the taxpayers will pay $35 billion to farmers for the \nnext 7 years and the taxpayers will get nothing in return.\n  It will be just a welfare payment--for a group of Americans whose \nincome is seven times higher than a typical family on food stamps.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Wallace Stevens once wrote: ``After the final `no' there comes a \n`yes,' and on that `yes' the future of the world depends * * *.''\n  Saying no to failed policies of the past makes all the sense in the \nworld. Saying yes to a stewardship contract between the American \ntaxpayer and the American farmer is the only future on which the farmer \nand the taxpayer can depend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18554-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to commend \nthe hardworking people of South Dakota for making Sioux Falls--South \nDakota's largest metropolitan area--the sixth most successful \nentrepreneurial spot in the country. I am proud to say the pioneer \nspirit still thrives in South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, it is not Fortune 500 companies alone that form our \ncountry's economic base. Rather, the hard work and dedication of self-\nemployed entrepreneurs and small business owners are responsible for \nmuch of our Nation's economic activity. The business of South Dakota is \nsmall business, from the family farm to the corner drug store. I am \nproud to represent such an ambitious and successful constituency--\npeople who are willing to work hard in order to get ahead. \n\n[[Page S18555]]\n\n  Some South Dakota small businesses have grown to become regional and \nnational success stories. A prime example of entrepreneurial spirit in \naction is Gateway 2000, a mail order personal computer (PC) corporation \nstarted 10 years ago in a farmhouse. Because of South Dakota's \nexcellent business climate and a solid work ethic, Gateway 2000 has \nbecome the tri-state metropolitan area's second largest employer and \nthe largest mail-order PC vendor in the United States. Gateway 2000 is \na testimonial to what can be achieved with a vision and a strong work \nethic.\n  When I travel home to South Dakota, I always marvel at the continued \ndevelopment my home State has undergone. Entrepreneurial South Dakotans \nhave helped South Dakota evolve into a diverse industrial breadbasket. \nNow, with the designation of Sioux Falls, SD, as an international port-\nof-entry, the success of South Dakota will extend to new markets around \nthe world. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nrecent article from the Sioux Falls Argus Leader which details South \nDakota's economic boom. I am sure all who read it will be impressed \nwith South Dakota's recent surge of economic development.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Entrepreneurial Spirit Cited in City's High Rating\n\n                        (By Brenda Wade Schmidt)\n\n       Sioux Falls' ranking as the sixth best hot spot for \n     entrepreneurs shows that programs to help business people get \n     started are working, two economic development experts said \n     Wednesday.\n       The city moved up 26 spots among small metropolitan areas \n     over last year's ranking done by Cognetics Inc. of Cambridge, \n     Mass.\n       Las Vegas, Nev., was in the top spot of the 134 areas for \n     the second year in a row.\n       ``It could be an indication that the entrepreneurial-type \n     programs are starting to take effect a little bit,'' said Dan \n     Scott, president of the Sioux Falls Development Foundation. \n     ``That spirit still exists here.''\n       There are so many entrepreneurs that agencies aren't able \n     to help them all, Scott said. Many people come with business \n     ideas but lack the planning and finances to implement their \n     dream.\n       The Small Business Development Center, with offices across \n     the state, assists many businesses.\n       ``We see the entrepreneurial spirit as being alive and well \n     because of the number of people that come to us for \n     assistance,'' said Bob Ashley, state director. ``Starting a \n     business is hard work. Hard work is not a stranger to the \n     people of South Dakota.''\n       Scott said the increase probably is the result of two \n     improvements.\n       ``The entrepreneurs are getting more help, and financing \n     has become more readily available,'' he said. ``What keeps \n     most entrepreneurs out of business is the inability to \n     attract financing.\n       Among rural areas, South Dakota ranked 61st out of 89 \n     places, up five spots from last year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18554-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO REV. RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate is holding a memorial \nservice to remember Rev. Richard C. Halverson, our friend and our \nChaplain from 1981 to March of this year, who passed away two weeks ago \nafter a long illness. To each of us, whatever our individual religious \nbeliefs, Reverend Halverson was someone special. To some of us, he was \na confidant; to others, a counselor; and to still others, a pastor in \nthe more traditional sense of the word. To each of us, he was a friend.\n  The Senate is, in many ways, a small community with many of the same \ndynamics inherent in small communities across our Nation. We work in \nclose quarters and all know each other very well. Each of us have \nforged great friendships here, and each of us has seen great rivalries \ndevelop among colleagues. We are all public figures whose lives are all \ntoo often an open book. We come from widely different backgrounds, and \neach of us brings to the Senate a different set of values we hold \ndearly and ideals to which we are firmly and determinedly committed. \nAnd out of all of that, out of all the differing backgrounds and \ncompeting philosophies, out of the individual strengths and weaknesses, \nand out of the personal friendships and political rivalries, this \ncommunity of one hundred men and women must produce public policy that \nensures the well-being of more than two hundred and fifty million of \nour fellow Americans. That is an awesome responsibility.\n  As much as any of us, Reverend Halverson understood both the sense of \ncommunity and the awesome responsibility of the Senate. Each morning, \nin his opening prayer, he would try to remind us that the sense of \ncommunity, collegiality, and comity that has always been the trademark \nof this body is vitally important to carrying out the tasks that are \ndemanded of us. He would remind us that the Senator on the other side \nof a heated debate is just as committed a public servant as we are. \nThat no political party has a monopoly on compassion, or patriotism, or \nintegrity. That the American Dream is neither conservative nor liberal. \nAnd that at the end of the day that sense of community, as Senators and \nas Americans, must prevail if we are to meet the responsibilities that \nhave been entrusted to us.\n  Reverend Halverson understood that as Senators, our lives--official \nand often personal--are open to more scrutiny than most Americans would \ntolerate. He understood that not only our votes and our speeches, but \nour families and our lifestyles are often open to public review. As \npublic officials we have accepted that. Nonetheless, Reverend Halverson \nunderstood that that scrutiny does take a human toll, reminding us that \nas we would like to be treated with understanding, so we must be \nunderstanding ourselves. And reminding us that for all of the public \nscrutiny of our lives and our conduct, for all of the public criticism \nthat we sometimes receive for our votes and our political and \nphilosophical beliefs, for all of the questioning of our motives that \nwe must sometimes endure, the work that we do is so important to so \nmany people that we must persevere.\n  Reverend Halverson always understood that election to public office \ndoes not take away the pressures that face every other American man and \nwoman; work-related stress, family concerns, health concerns, or the \nself-questioning that every individual faces from time to time \nthroughout their lives. Similarly, he understood that election to \npublic office does not bestow skills or talents that we did not possess \nbefore; nor does it eradicate any personal weaknesses we possessed \nbefore our election. But Reverend Halverson was always there to remind \nus that deep within each of us is the ability to meet every challenge \nthat our careers and our lives present.\n  A few years ago, I was quite ill. I left here one February night with \na headache and did not return until late in the summer. During those \nmonths, as he was during all of his 14 years here, Reverend Halverson \nwas there for me. I have never forgotten that, and my family has never \nforgotten that.\n  Throughout his 14 years as the Senate Chaplain Rev. Richard C. \nHalverson was a committed public servant and a friend to each of us. We \nshall miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18555-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I ask unanimous \nconsent that my letter to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt regarding this issue \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Reed Hundt,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I wrote you almost one year ago \n     concerning the proposed Global \n\n[[Page S18556]]\n     Partnership between Sprint Corporation, Deutsche Telekom and France \n     Telecom. At that time, I asked that you rule fairly and \n     promptly on this matter.\n       It is my understanding the Commission may consider a \n     proposal that appears to have little to do with traditional \n     foreign ownership concerns having to do with the acquisition \n     of undue leverage over domestic companies. Specifically, the \n     FCC would artificially ``freeze'' Sprint's communications \n     capacity between the United States and Germany and France, \n     while placing no such restrictions on any of its major \n     competitors.\n       Given that the Justice Department has already signed off on \n     the partnership, many believe there is no legitimate foreign \n     investment concern. Even if excessive leverage could be \n     obtained under this partnership, an arbitrary limitation on \n     communications capacity would not alleviate it. In short, it \n     appears the Commission will answer the wrong question with an \n     equally wrong solution. If this were to occur, Sprint would \n     be at a competitive disadvantage with other international \n     competitors.\n       I look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18555-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LIMITED PROVISIONS IN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most serious defects of the \ncurrent stopgap funding for the Federal Government is its treatment of \nLIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, that helps needy \nfamilies pay their winter fuel bills. Under that program, States \nreceive most of their full-year LIHEAP allocation in the 2 months of \nOctober and November so that they can prepare for the winter, set \nbenefit levels, and deal with emergencies.\n  It is bad enough that the current stopgap bill cuts these needed \nfunds by 25 percent from last year--25 percent from last year. Even \nworse, it pays out those funds on a basis that is prorated on a full \nyear, so that the States are receiving far less than the usual share in \nOctober and November. By this time last year, Massachusetts had \nreceived $32 million of its $54 million allocation. This year, however, \nMassachusetts has only been allowed to draw down $9.5 million.\n  In fact, all States had received $800 million of last year's $1.3 \nbillion LIHEAP appropriation by December of last year. Under the \nstopgap bill, there is a 71-percent cut, although the bill is only \nsupposed to impose a 25 percent cut at most.\n  This chart demonstrates very clearly what the problem is. First of \nall, I think everyone across this country understands the extraordinary \ndrops in the temperature in the most recent days. This is playing havoc \nin many families in Massachusetts, up in Boston, the North Shore, all \nover Massachusetts and the Berkshires and otherwise. By December 15 of \n1994, some $800 million had been distributed. By December 15, 1995, \nonly $230 million under the continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, this has to be addressed in the continuing resolution. \nUnless it is, there will be hundreds of Americans whose very health and \nrisk of freezing will be very, very real. This was a nonintended result \nof the fact of these continuing resolutions, and it is an emergency. It \ncries out for action.\n  We hope that the House of Representatives will take action. \nOtherwise, I know, under the leadership of Senator Wellstone and \nothers, an amendment will be offered to try and reach this emergency \nsituation.\n  Massachusetts energy agencies have said that they will respond only \nto cases where a utility terminates services, or where homes have less \nthan one-eighth of a tank of fuel oil. The State has cut annual LIHEAP \nbenefits from $430 to $150 per household to ensure that they have \nenough funds for emergencies throughout the winter.\n  In Gloucester, the agencies have been faced with a choice of spending \nnonauthorized LIHEAP funds or letting some families freeze to death.\n  In Salem, the local government has dipped into its own scarce funds \nto provide needed assistance.\n  In Springfield, Patricia Nelligan, the fuel assistance director for \nthe New England Farm Workers' Council, said that unless more LIHEAP \nfunds are made available soon, their program will have to shut down by \nthe end of next week.\n  It may not officially be winter yet, but winter has already arrived \nwith a vengeance in many parts of the country. For the 6 million \nrecipients of LIHEAP assistance across the Nation, it will be a \ndesperate Christmas unless more aid is available.\n  Some 95 percent of the households receiving LIHEAP assistance have \nannual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18 \npercent of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented the heat or eat \neffect, where higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-\nincome families to spend less money on food. The result is increased \nmalnutrition among children.\n  The study also found almost twice as many low-weight and \nundernourished children were admitted to Boston City Hospital's \nemergency room immediately following the coldest month of the winter. \nNo family should have to choose between heating and eating.\n  But it is the poor elderly that will be at the greatest risk if more \nLIHEAP funds are not made available, because they are the most \nvulnerable to hypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted for more \nthan half of all hypothermia deaths in 1991.\n  In addition, the elderly are much more likely to live in homes built \nbefore 1940 which are less energy efficient and put them at greater \nrisk.\n  Low-income elderly who have trouble paying their fuel bills are often \ndriven to rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and wood-burning \nstoves to save money. Between 1986 and 1990, such heating sources were \nthe second leading cause of fire deaths among the elderly. In fact, \nelderly citizens were up to 12 times more likely to die in heating-\nrelated fires than adults under 65.\n  Over 50 Senators have signed a letter urging the budget negotiators \nto allow States to draw down LIHEAP funds at the up-front rate if a \nfurther stop-gap funding bill is enacted. I urge the Senate to support \nthis provision, so that families can receive the urgent assistance they \nneed.\n  Christmas is approaching, and in many parts of the country, \ntemperatures have dropped to levels close to those at the North Pole. \nBut Santa Claus does not release LIHEAP funds to the States--Congress \ndoes, and we must act quickly to avoid tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18556-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18556-S18557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DEATH OF THE FORMER CHAPLAIN OF THE SENATE, THE REVEREND DR. \n                          RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, with sadness, tempered by gratitude, I \nrise today to mourn the passing of the late Chaplain of the Senate, the \nRev. Richard C. Halverson. Recently he left this Chamber and this \nworld, but the impression he left is all around us.\n  Mr. President, we all know that national politics is often wracked by \ndeep disagreement. The task of steering history's most civilized Nation \non a wise course through democratic means arouses strong passions. Only \nspiritual guidance and divine grace could steady this Chamber during \nthe tempests of every age, and we are fortunate to debate in soft \ntones, and to determine great questions as a civilized community. For \nthe last 14 years, America herself was blessed to have Dr. Halverson, \nthe Senate's Christian humanist, to keep our civilization decent.\n  Whenever a member of out little civilization lost a loved one--or \ngained one--the Chaplain's office was a proven source of consolation \nand hope.\n  I took the oath here not too long ago, and I remember, among a flood \nof invitations, one from the good Chaplain asked to come to the weekly \nSenate prayer breakfast. There are many bipartisan meetings in the \nCapitol, but the calm communion of Catholics, Jews, and Protestants was \ntripartisan as well as profoundly contemplative. I treasure those \nWednesday morning gatherings as occasions to make deep and abiding \nfriendships with my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, John Stuart Mill wrote that ``one person with a belief \nis a social power equal to ninety-nine who have only interests.'' Here \nin this Chamber, one Chaplain with unshakeable belief was a social \npower equal to all 100 of us, each with a host of interests and \nbeliefs. He calmed our fears, he kept us together, and every morning he \ncalled us to prayer.\n  Now, as he taught us, I join my colleagues in praying for his soul.\n  \n[[Page S18557]]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18556-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting withdrawals \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18557-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE FARMINGTON WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 103\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I take pleasure in transmitting the enclosed report for the \nFarmington River in the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The \nreport and my recommendations are in response to the provisions of the \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act, Public Law 90-542, as amended. The \nFarmington River Study was authorized by Public Law 99-590.\n  The study was conducted by the National Park Service, with invaluable \nassistance from a congressionally mandated study committee. The \nNational Park Service determined that the 11-mile study segment in \nMassachusetts and the 14-mile study segment in Connecticut were \neligible for designation based upon their free-flowing character and \nrecreational, fish, wildlife and historic values.\n  The 14-mile Connecticut segment of the river has already been \ndesignated as a Wild and Scenic River pursuant to Public Law 103-313, \nAugust 26, 1994. The purpose of this transmittal is to inform the \nCongress that, although eligible for designation, I do not recommend \nthat the Massachusetts segment be designated at this time due to lack \nof support by the towns adjoining it. If at some future date the towns \nshould change their position and the river has retained its present \ncharacteristics, the Congress could reconsider the issue. Also, for 3 \nyears from the date of this transmittal, the Massachusetts segment will \nremain subject to section 7(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. \nSection 7(b) prohibits licensing of projects by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and Federal or federally assisted water resource \ndevelopment projects that would have a direct and adverse effect on the \nvalues for which the river might be designated. Finally, the report \nincludes the Upper Farmington River Management Plan that is referenced \nin Public Law 103-313 as the plan by which the designated river will be \nmanaged.\n  The plan demonstrated a true partnership effort of the type that we \nbelieve will be increasingly necessary if we are to have affordable \nprotection of our environment in the future.\n                                                  William J.

And imagine how this horror \nand devastation becomes compounded by senseless Government regulations \nwhich hinder their efforts to locate their children.\n  Consider the tragic experience of Claudine and Don Ryce, the parents \nof Jimmy Ryce, a 10-year-old Florida boy who disappeared on September \n11 of this year. Jimmy disappeared somewhere in the three square blocks \nbetween his school bus stop and his home.\n  Tragically, Jimmy's body was found late last week. I extend my \ndeepest sympathy, and my most sincere condolences, to his family.\n  I want Jimmy's parents to know that I heard about the frustration \nthey encountered as they searched for their son. I want them to know \nthat Congress will do something to rectify this. Today, I want to break \ndown one barrier that they encountered in their vigilant efforts to \nlocate their son.\n  Jimmy's parents tell the story of how simple tasks, such as posting \nnotices in Federal buildings with Jimmy's picture on it, were \nfrustrated by senseless Government regulation. They tell of how, with \nthe assistance of the FBI, they would post these notices in one Federal \nagency building, only to have them removed by employees of another \nagency. Imagine how frustrating this must be to parents of missing \nchildren. How frustrating this must be, especially since photographs of \nmissing children are the most effective tool we have for locating these \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, far too many children are missing in this country. A \n1990 study by the Department of Justice--the most recent study on this \nissue--found that in 1988 there were as many as:\n  114,600 attempted abductions of children by non-family members;\n  4,600 abductions by non-family members reported to the police;\n  300 abductions by non-family members where the children were gone for \nlong periods of time or were murdered;\n  354,000 children abducted by family members;\n  450,700 children who ran away; and\n  438,200 children who were lost, injured or otherwise missing.\n  Moreover, the National Crime Information Center reports that \napproximately 60,000 children are missing at any given time.\n  The legislation that I introduce today is designed to help the \nparents of these missing children by eliminating one barrier that \nJimmy's parents faced in their search for their son.\n  This legislation amends the Protection of Public Property Act, which \nempowers the General Services Administration [GSA] to set rules \ngoverning Federal property under its control. Currently, Federal \nregulations issued by the GSA prohibit the posting of materials on \nFederal property. My bill directs the GSA to make a very important \nexception to these rules, and requires the GSA to draft regulations \nallowing the posting of notices designed to locate missing children. It \nalso ensures that Federal employees cannot needlessly remove these \nposters.\n  As Jimmy's father said, ``There are things the Government can do, \nsimple things, that would make it easier to publicize'' that a child is \nmissing. He also said that we need to ``turn these agencies into our \nallies.''\n  Well, Mr. Ryce, you are correct, and I believe that this legislation \nwill do just that.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1474. A bill to provide new authority for probation and pretrial \nservices officers, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S18560]]\n\n\n\n          probation and pretrial services officers legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would grant \nFederal probation and pretrial services officers authority to carry \nfirearms, when approved by the appropriate district court, under rules \nprescribed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  To add that new authority, the bill amends 18 U.S.C. 3603, which sets \nout the duties of probation officers, and 18 U.S.C. 3154, which \nestablishes the functions of pretrial services officers. The change \nwill permit those officers to carry firearms as they perform their \nimportant and frequently dangerous duties.\n  State law currently governs whether Federal probation and pretrial \nservices officers may carry weapons; that law is inconsistent from \nState to State. Research by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts shows that only three States give specific authority to Federal \nprobation and pretrial services officers to carry weapons. Forty-four \nStates authorize Federal probation officers to carry firearms based \neither on statutory authority given to State probation officers or \npeace officers, or on State attorney general opinions. Although some of \nthose States similarly authorize Federal pretrial services officers to \ncarry firearms, at least 14 of them have neglected to extend that \nauthority to those officers.\n  More important, certain States prohibit Federal probation and \npretrial services from carrying weapons even where the officer has \ncourt approval to do so. Officers in those jurisdictions are left \nvulnerable to serious harm or death. A 1993 study undertaken by the \nFederal Probation and Pretrial Officers Association revealed that, in \nthe Federal and local systems, 1,818 serious assaults and 792 attempted \nassaults against probation and pretrial services officers occurred \nbetween 1980 and 1992. The study acknowledges that those numbers \nprobably understate the actual figures since some jurisdictions did not \nrespond the association's study.\n  In my view, the risks faced by Federal probation and pretrial \nservices officers cannot be overemphasized. These officers risk their \nsafety and their lives every day, often supervising violent offenders \nin situations that place them and others at risk of bodily harm. We \nshould ensure that, wherever those officers are, they are authorized to \ncarry a firearm.\n  Not only does this bill address problems faced by officers who work \nout of jurisdictions in which they are not permitted to carry a \nfirearm, but it addresses difficulties faced by officers who must cross \nState lines in the performance of their duties. Under current law, even \nofficers who are authorized under one State's laws to carry weapons may \nstill run afoul of another State's laws when they cross State lines. \nWithout a Federal statute authorizing officers to carry firearms, they \nmay be acting illegally when they cross State lines to perform their \nduties. Many Federal officers supervise offenders near a State border \nand must travel interstate to carry out their duties. An offender may \nhave a nearby job in an adjacent State, for example, and the officer \nmay need to travel to the job site to verify the offender's employment.\n\n  Problems may also arise for officers who live in one State and work \nin another. For instance, officers who live in Wisconsin and work in \nMinnesota are not allowed to obtain a gun permit from Minnesota. \nSimilar situations arise in other States. Officers may be unable to \nobtain licenses from the State in which they reside even though they \nmay work in a neighboring State that permits some of it residents to \ncarry firearms.\n  These officers work in inherently dangerous environments. The Federal \nProbation and Pretrail Officers Association wrote to me on September \n15, 1995:\n\n       Under enhanced supervision practices, we supervise in the \n     field, in the most crime-infested areas of urban environments \n     as well as in the most remote rural areas of urban \n     environments as well as in the most remote rural areas. [I]f \n     enacted, [the bill] would give all officers a significant \n     measure of support and protection which they certainly \n     deserve.\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree.\n  This bill will correct the current intolerable situation. The \nsecurity of Federal probation and pretrial services officers should not \nbe left to the vagaries of State law.\n  Of course, these Federal officers will be fully trained and closely \nsupervised in their use of firearms. Under the bill, probation and \npretrial services officers will be permitted to carry firearms only \npursuant to regulations promulgated by the Director of the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. courts. The Administrative Office has \ninformed me that these regulations would include extensive training and \nsafety requirements, and that most of them are already in effect for \nthose officers authorized to carry firearms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide an antitrust exemption for persons engaged \nin the fishing industry and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  THE FISHING INDUSTRY BARGAINING ACT\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fishing \nIndustry Bargaining Act, a bill to provide antitrust immunity to \nfishermen and fish processors which would allow them to collectively \nagree on the prices paid to fishermen and on the minimum price fish \nprocessors will accept for the sale of processed fish products.\n  Senator Murkowski joins me as a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  We are introducing the bill because the Alaska State Legislature \nenacted a State law to confer identical antitrust immunity on Alaska \nfishermen and processors.\n  The changes to Alaska law will only have effect if the changes we are \nproposing to Federal law are enacted.\n  Our bill would add a new section to the act approved on June 25, \n1934, which authorizes producers of aquatic products to form \nassociations, to allow fishermen and fish processors to collectively \nagree on prices.\n  The bill would prevent fish processors from agreeing on prices unless \nfishermen participated in the agreement and are party to the agreement.\n  This antitrust exemption would apply to fishermen and fish processors \nin all parts of the country, not just in Alaska.\n  We look forward to hearing from the Alaska fishing industry and from \nthe fishing industry in other parts of the country about the \nlegislation.\n  If there is support, we would hope to enact the bill sometime next \nyear.\n  I ask for unimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1475\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fishing \n     Industry Bargaining Act''.\n       (b) Amendment to Act of 1934.--The Act approved June 25, \n     1934, authorizing associations of producers of aquatic \n     products (15 U.S.C. 1521 et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     after section 2 the following new section:\n       ``Sec. 3. Persons engaged in the fishing industry as \n     fishermen, including fishermen acting through associations \n     allowed under section 1, may collectively agree with fish \n     processors, including fish processors acting through \n     associations of processors, on (1) the \n\n[[Page S18561]]\n     price paid to the fishermen for aquatic products, and (2) the minimum \n     price that fish processors will accept for the sale of \n     processed aquatic products. Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to allow fish processors to agree among themselves \n     on the price paid to fishermen or the minimum price that fish \n     processors will accept for the sale of processed aquatic \n     products if fishermen did not participate in the making of \n     the agreement and are not a party to the agreement.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1476. A bill to establish the Boston Harbor Islands National \nRecreation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n       boston harbor islands national recreation area legislation\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nKennedy in introducing legislation to establish the Boston Harbor \nIslands National Recreation Area. Our bill is the companion legislation \nto H.R. 2763, introduced yesterday by Congressman Gerry Studds and \nPeter Torkildsen. I especially want to acknowledge the enormous \nleadership efforts of Congressman Studds in preparing this initiative \nand I look forward to working with him and others in the months ahead \nto enact this legislation.\n  Thirty-one islands sprinkled throughout Boston Harbor and the \nsurrounding waterway would comprise the national recreational area. Our \nlegislation is based upon a special resource study completed by the \nNational Park Service in 1994 which found that the Boston Harbor \nIslands and surrounding area meet the Service's criteria for inclusion \nin the National Park System. However, trying to balance the need for \nfiscal restraint with the importance of protecting our national \nheritage, our bill is a much-scaled-down version of the one envisioned \nin the study. Our bill would fully utilize a unique partnership among \nthe Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector and \nwould require that at least 75 percent of the operational expenses for \nthe park will come from non-Federal funding.\n  Boston has a rich and diverse history and has been and remains the \neconomic and cultural center of New England. Today, Boston is \nnationally and internationally renowned in fields such as higher \neducation, health care, technology, transportation, and trade. \nBeginning centuries ago, Boston Harbor has played a significant role in \nshaping the city's and the region's direction and growth, and the \nharbor area contains some of the oldest and most significant historic \nsites in the Nation, dating from precolonial times.\n  The islands themselves are rich in historical diversity, containing \nnumerous military and maritime sites. In addition, there are important \narchaeological sites which chronicle the use and settlement of the \nharbor by native Americans from at least 9,000 years ago through the \n17th century. With its proximity to the city, the park would provide an \nexcellent opportunity to thousands of people to enjoy its outstanding \nnatural, historic, scenic, recreational, and educational values.\n  As a National Recreation Area, the Boston Harbor Island and \nsurrounding area would enhance the National Park System by promoting \nthis nationally significant history while providing leisure attractions \nto the public. The park is projected to attract to the area an \nadditional 500,000 visitors annually, create 700 new jobs, and bring an \nadditional $200 million into the region's economy.\n  In 1970, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts began to acquire the \nislands of Boston Harbor for the benefit of the public. Since that \ntime, a significant effort has been made to clean up the waters of \nBoston Bay to again make it attractive to boating, fishing, and other \nrecreational and commercial activities. During the 1980's, the citizens \nof the Greater Boston area have undertaken what may prove to be the \nlargest water infrastructure project in North America which is intended \nto guarantee that the Boston Bay's ecological health will be good for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  The bill we are introducing would establish the Boston Harbor Islands \npartnership to coordinate the activities of Federal, State, and local \nauthorities and the private sector in developing and implementing an \nintegrated management plan for the islands. In addition, an advisory \ncouncil would be established to provide representation for interested \ngroups and organizations. This council would make recommendations to \nthe partnership on issues including tourism, transportation, natural \nresources, cultural and historic resources, and fundraising.\n  Finally, our legislation would require a ratio of at least three non-\nFederal dollars for every Federal dollar spent on the park. Using \nlimited Federal resources to leverage a significant local effort is a \nconcept that merits support. By creating a national recreation area, we \nwill preserve an important piece of our American heritage, give it the \nprominence and honor it richly deserves, accomplish all this with the \nFederal Government covering only a fraction of its cost, and facilitate \nthe efforts of the Boston area to preserve its history and enhance \nrecreational opportunities for its citizens and visitors.\n  I am sure Senator Kennedy and I will be joined by the Massachusetts \ndelegation and others as we work for passage of this important \nlegislation. I am hopeful that the Congress will look favorably upon \nthis initiative which would bring an important, historically \nsignificant addition to our National Park System without imposing great \nnew financial burdens on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Kerry \ntoday in sponsoring a bill to establish the Boston Harbor Islands \nNational Recreation Area in Massachusetts. This legislation is part of \na bipartisan effort with Congressmen Gerry Studds and Peter Torkildsen, \nwho introduced an identical bill yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The legislation follows a comprehensive study by the National Park \nService, authorized in 1992 and completed last year. That study reached \nthe strong conclusion on the 31 islands clustered in Boston Harbor that \n``[t]heir proximity to a large urban population and their special \ngeological, prehistoric, historic, and natural features qualify them \ncollectively as an outstanding example of a nationally significant \nrecreation area. Their configuration, their assemblage of significant \nnatural and cultural features, and their proximity to a major \nmetropolitan area create a resource that has no parallel in the United \nStates.''\n  The islands are just a short boat trip from downtown Boston. They \noffer abundant opportunities for visitors to enjoy surroundings of \nexceptional natural beauty. With rocky shores, sand beaches, and tidal \npools full of marine life from horseshoe crabs to starfish and seals, \nvisitors enjoy swimming, fishing, clam-digging, berry-picking, bird and \nwhale watching, boating, camping and hiking on well-maintained trails. \nHistory lovers can explore national historic landmarks, such as the \nRevolutionary War-era fort that later housed Confederate prisoners in \nthe Civil War, and the Nation's first lighthouse--the only lighthouse \nstill operated by lighthouse keepers in the old tradition. They can \nhunt for pirate relics, and dig further back in time for archaeological \nartifacts from 10,000 years ago and rare geological formations dating \nto the glacial age. All of the islands offer spectacular views of the \nmodern Boston skyline and the Atlantic Ocean.\n  But these assets have gone largely unnoticed until recently. The Park \n\n\n[[Page S18564]]\nService study has helped catalyze a growing recognition that the Harbor \nIslands deserve protection, as a unique resource that can greatly \nexpand recreational opportunities for families in the Boston area and \nfor visitors from across the country. Already, more than 25 million \ntourists visit Massachusetts each year, with 10 million visiting the \nBoston area annually. Fulfilling the potential of the Harbor Islands \nwill strengthen tourism and significantly benefit the local economy, as \nwell as enhance the experience of visitors to the area.\n  As recommended by the Park Service study, to fulfill that potential, \nwe must improve public access to the islands and adopt a coordinated \napproach to their management. This legislation calls on the National \nPark Service to work closely with State and local governments and \nnonprofit organizations to preserve the natural and cultural resources \nof the islands and make them more accessible to the public through the \nuse of a public water transportation system. The bill establishes a \npartnership among the various levels of government, and requires a \ncommitment of non-Federal funds on at least a three-to-one matching \nbasis with Federal funds. It does not involve any substantial purchase \nof land by the Federal Government; instead, it authorizes the Park \nService to develop cooperative agreements with the State, local and \nprivate owners of the islands to ensure their protection and expanded \npublic use.\n  The Boston Harbor Islands will be an exceptional addition to the \nNational Park System. Their natural beauty and historical significance \neminently merit this protection and preservation. The partnership \napproach will keep Federal costs to a minimum and assure the success of \nthis effort for generations to come. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM:\n  S. 1477. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe Public Health Service Act to improve the regulation of food, drugs, \ndevices, and biological products, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe food and drug administration performance and accountability act of \n                                  1995\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I introduce the Food and Drug \nAdministration Performance and Accountability Act of 1995. This \ncomprehensive reform bill is designed to ensure that Americans continue \nto enjoy and our Nation continues to lead the world in the development \nof new, life-saving and life-enhancing pharmaceuticals and medical \ndevices and wholesome, abundant, and affordable foods by reforming the \nrole of the Food and Drug Administration in the testing and review of \nnew products.\n  Over the years, the FDA's requirements for clinical testing and its \npremarket reviews of new products have grown increasingly complex, \ntime-consuming, and expensive. From the 1960's to the 1990's, for \nexample, the time required to complete clinical trials for new drugs \nhas grown from 2\\1/2\\ years to nearly 6 years. From the beginning of \nthe process to the end, it takes an average of 12 years and costs $359 \nmillion to bring a new drug to market. By law, the FDA is required to \nreview and act on applications to market new drugs and devices within \n180 days. Today, however, it takes the agency on average 649 days to \ncomplete its review of new devices and 570 days to complete its review \nof most new drugs.\n  These increasing FDA demands on new product development and delays in \nnew product reviews are reducing incentives for research and \ndevelopment, encouraging American companies to locate abroad, delaying \nAmericans' access to new pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and \ncosting American jobs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to correct these \nproblems. First, the bill makes clear that a prime mission of the FDA \nis facilitating the rapid and efficient development and availability of \nsafe and effective products that will benefit the public. It puts the \nagency on notice that Congress and the American people expect it to \nallocate its time, energy, and resources accordingly.\n  Second, the bill puts teeth into statutory deadlines for agency \naction. The FDA commissioner is required, in consultation with patient \nadvocacy groups and the regulated industries, to establish and meet \nyearly performance standards that will bring the agency into compliance \nand keep it in compliance with statutory deadlines for action on \npremarket approval applications. The commissioner will be required to \nreport yearly on the agency's performance and, if the agency is out of \ncompliance, to contract with outside experts for product reviews.\n  Third, to ensure that desperately ill and suffering patients have \naccess to promising new therapies, the bill will expand access to \ninvestigational new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. To ensure that \nphysicians are as fully informed as possible about these new therapies \nand about new uses for already approved therapies, the bill will ease \nthe agency's current severe restrictions on the dissemination of \ninformation about them.\n  Fourth, the bill establishes a collaborative clinical testing and \nreview process. It requires the agency to meet with companies in the \nearly stage of the clinical testing to establish the parameters for \ntesting and avoid last-minute changes in protocol designs once testing \nis underway. Once testing has been completed and the agency receives an \napplication for product approval, the agency would again be required to \nmeet with companies to better ensure the smooth and timely review of \nthe application.\n  Fifth, the bill provides the agency with the statutory flexibility it \nneeds to make changes in its clinical testing policies and product \nreview procedures. For example, it modifies current law, which appears \nnow to require two or more clinical studies, to permit the agency to \nbase its approval on one well-designed clinical study when appropriate. \nAs further examples, the bill updates outmoded statutory requirements \nfor the regulation of biological products, reduces the number of \nmedical devices that the agency is required to review, and makes it \neasier for the agency to use national and internationally recognized \nperformance standards in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of \ndevices.\n  In these and in a number of other ways, the FDA Performance and \nAccountability Act of 1995 will transform the FDA from a growing \nbarrier to innovation into an active partner in innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18559-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18564-S18565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 581\n\n  At the request of Mr. Faircloth, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Grassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 581, a bill to amend the \nNational Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to repeal those \nprovisions of Federal law that require employees to pay union dues or \nfees as a condition of employment, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 981\n\n  At the request of Mr. Exon, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of S. 981, a bill entitled \n``Truck Safety and Congressional Partnership Act''.\n\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1030, a bill entitled the \n``Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1995.\n\n\n                                S. 1212\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coats, the name of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1212, a bill to provide \nfor the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine \nthe social, civic, psychological, and economic effects of providing to \nindividuals and families with limited means an opportunity to \naccumulate assets, and to determine the extent to which an asset-based \nwelfare policy may be used to enable individuals and families with low \nincome to achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from Maine [Mr. \nCohen] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1392, a bill to impose \ntemporarily a 25 percent duty on imports of certain Canadian wood and \nlumber products, to require the administering authority to initiate an \ninvestigation under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to \nsuch products, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S18565]]\n\n\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Snowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1419, a bill to impose \nsanctions against Nigeria.\n\n\n                                S. 1470\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1470, a bill to amend title II of the Social Security \nAct to provide for increases in the amounts of allowable earnings under \nthe Social Security earnings limit for individuals who have attained \nretirement age, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 43\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Joint Resolution 43, a joint resolution expressing the sense of \nCongress regarding Wei Jingsheng;

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a vital, \nbicameral effort to combat drugs in this country. The Task Force on \nNational Drug Policy, of which I am a proud member, was announced today \nto work to solve a serious problem: narcotics.\n  Despite efforts by Congress to curtail the flow of drugs into this \ncountry and its use by Americans, it seems as though the results have \nbeen lost with this administration. The intent of this task force is to \nfocus the White House on a problem that is far from being resolved, and \nwhere much attention needs to be paid.\n  This is particularly important in light of recent studies that have \nindicated a growing trend in illicit drug use among teenagers. Studies \nindicate that, despite a decline in drug use among teens during the \n1980's, drug use has risen sharply in the past few years. Cocaine use \nby high school students increased 36 percent since 1991-92, which was \nthe period of lowest use. Marijuana use increased as well. Between the \n1990-92 school year and 1994, marijuana use among junior high school \nstudents rose 111 percent and rose 67 percent in high schools. Now, one \nin three high \n\n[[Page S18566]]\nschool students admit to smoking marijuana.\n  Even without being armed with these statistics, Americans see the \nrise of drug use in their communities. It is on their streets and in \ntheir schools. Understandably, citizens view narcotics as one of the \nmost pressing problems facing our country. According to a Gallup poll \nreleased yesterday, 94 percent of Americans see drug use as a serious \nproblem or a crisis.\n  These recent reports are a wake-up call to the administration to take \naction. It has served as the impetus for this Task Force on National \nDrug Policy to set a framework for policy and establish strategic plans \nto combat the drug epidemic. This, in turn, should move the White House \nto realize that this is a pressing issue that they can no longer \nneglect. Action must be taken now. Our children cannot afford to wait \nany longer.\n  Efforts must be stepped up to get at the drug suppliers, especially \nthe drug kingpins. They are profiting while the rest of us suffer. \nThere presence is being tolerated and should not be tolerated anymore.\n  In order to control the proliferation of illegal narcotics, law \nenforcement efforts must play a leading role in the Federal strategy. \nLaw enforcement agencies, experts in this field, have been able to \ndevelop innovative techniques to respond to the spread of drugs in our \ncommunities. They are on the frontlines of this war against drugs and \nhave the knowledge to fight its recent rise.\n  The members of this task force have the ability to establish policy \nand to take the initiative through legislative action. An example of \nthis could be the implementation of a system such as the Automated \nFingerprint Identification System [AFIS]. Using this biometric system, \ndrug smugglers will not be able to repeatedly enter this country using \nfictitious identification with anonymity and impunity. Recidivistic \ndrug felons could be immediately identified, detained, and prosecuted \nor deported before their heinous acts impact upon our children, \nfamilies, and communities. This is at least one way to reduce the flow \nof drugs over our borders.\n  Another way to deter drug dealers is to raise sentencing guidelines \nand enact mandatory minimums to guarantee longer sentences. These will \nalso act as a deterrent to potential offenders. We should be attacking \ntheir trade, not ignoring their presence.\n  It is evident that the illegal drug trade has profited with the focus \nshifted away from their activities. But this task force will change \nthat. With the emphasis placed back on narcotics and the harm it \nspreads, this task force may be able to concentrate efforts to rekindle \nthe decline of drug use that was noted prior to this administration.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues \nfor their leadership and initiative in the effort to control illicit \ndrugs in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18565-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TO HELP THOSE LIVING ON THE EDGE\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most dynamic people I \nhave had a chance to meet in my years in public life is a Roman \nCatholic priest by the name of Father George Clements.\n  He has stirred controversy from time to time by his championing of \ncauses that sometimes are unpopular but always, in my opinion, reflect \nfavorably on his faith and his humanitarianism.\n  Recently Parade magazine had a story concerning his program of ``One \nChurch-One-Addict'' which I ask to be printed in full in the Record.\n  What a great thing for this Nation it would be if every church in the \nNation were to follow this simple admonition.\n  Many churches would find that they have been unable to help people, a \nleast not immediately. But many others would find they have been the \ndifference in keeping people from going over the edge.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    To Help Those Living on the Edge\n\n                         (By Marie Ragghianti)\n\n       The only major institution not dealing with substance abuse \n     is the church,'' the Rev. George Clements told me. ``Look at \n     our prisons and universities--they're fighting drugs. We can \n     do no less.''\n       For many years, Father Clements has been inspiring others \n     to action through both his words and his deeds. In 1980, from \n     his parish in Chicago, he started a program called One \n     Church-One Child. His idea--for every church to place one \n     homeless child with a family--eventually grew into a national \n     program, and it has helped find homes for more than 50,000 \n     children. In a controversial move, Clements himself adopted \n     four youngsters. (The Vatican eventually supported him.) In \n     1987, a TV movie told his story.\n       Now, the 63-year-old priest has an even more ambitious \n     mission: to help recovering addicts find support in their \n     religious communities. Clements' new program is called One \n     Church-One Addict, which he founded with the American \n     Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a nonprofit \n     organization based in Washington, D.C.\n       ``If Jesus was walking around today, he'd be working in the \n     area of substance abuse,'' Clements says when he speaks to \n     religious groups around the country. ``Jesus lived on the \n     cutting edge and helped others. We must do the same.''\n       One Church-One Addict is ecumenical: All faiths are asked \n     to do something about drug addiction and/or alcoholism in \n     their communities. Volunteers are trainged to give counseling \n     and support. They meet with clients in one-on-one sessions, \n     helping them learn how to live without drugs or alcohol. \n     Clients usually enter the program upon leaving a \n     rehabilitation center or clinic. They receive support for \n     about nine months, although no time limit is set.\n       I asked Father Clements how he got involved in helping \n     recovering addicts. It began, he said, with a child he once \n     knew who lived near his church--the Holy Angels Catholic \n     church, in the drug-plagued housing projects of Chicago's \n     South Side.\n       ``I wouldn't be in this work today if it wasn't for \n     Tommy,'' Clements explained. ``Tommy was valedictorian of his \n     eighth-grade class. He was a great football player and had \n     won an academic scholarship to attend an excellent high \n     school. He wanted to be an obstetrician. One evening, he \n     asked if I thought he could make it. `Of course you can, \n     Tommy,' I told him. `I have no doubt.'\n       ``That night, after I was in bed, the phone rang. It was \n     the emergency room a local hospital. A kid was dying. He was \n     unconscious and didn't have any identification, but they \n     could make out the words `Father Clements.' I raced to the \n     hospital. When I arrived, I found Tommy lying on a slab, dead \n     of a drug overdose.\n       ``After the funeral, I sat at my desk and couldn't stop \n     crying. How could I not have known? That day, it was as if a \n     force grabbed me by the back of the neck, and I knew I had to \n     do something.''\n       Shortly after Tommy's death, Father Clements took a walk \n     through his neighborhood. What he saw outraged him: Drug \n     paraphernalia littered the streets and, to his astonishment, \n     was being sold in the area's small liquor stores, pharmacies \n     and candy shops--many of which were frequented by children. A \n     few months later, Clements decided to organize protests. He \n     went to a large wholesaler of drug paraphernalia and held a \n     revival in the parking lot. The 1989 event was covered by \n     regional media and prompted the Illinois Legislature to pass \n     a law banning much of the paraphernalia.\n       For Clements, however, that victory was only the beginning: \n     He decided that the church could no longer ignore the problem \n     of drugs in the community. After five years of planning, One \n     Church-One Addict was born in 1994, receiving funding through \n     seed grants provided by nonprofit groups. Since then, 715 \n     churches in 31 states have signed on; more than 2000 people \n     have been helped by its network of support.\n       How does Father Clements compare the two programs he \n     founded?\n       ``I feel that One Church-One Addict is a natural outgrowth \n     of One Church-One Child,'' he said. ``People are much more \n     sympathetic to kids than to addicts. But I tell people that \n     I'm not excusing or defending addiction. We say, `Love the \n     addict, hate the addiction.'

Mr. President, I did not support the effort \nyesterday to begin writing exceptions into the first amendment of our \nConstitution. The first amendment protects the right of free speech, no \nmatter how unpopular or offensive that speech is. The Court interprets \nthis to include the right of people to burn a flag if a person so \nchooses. Presumably, the Court would reach the same conclusion with \nregard to a person's right to burn the Constitution or even the Bill of \nRights itself.\n  Modern technology has given us the ability to see political protest, \nincluding the burning of flags, as it occurs around the world--in \nTiananmen Square, in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and in South \nAfrica. We are not only able to see the political protest, we are also \nable to see those governments step in to prevent that expression, to \nlimit that speech, and to silence dissent and criticism aimed at those \nin power.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment would sanction that same type \nof \n\n[[Page S18567]]\nrepressive action by our own Government. And such repression would not \nbe permitted only when people are disturbing the peace, but also when \nthey are trying to dramatize their strongly held political views. Like \nmost citizens, I might find many of those political views offensive. \nBut I am not willing to amend the Constitution to permit States and the \nFederal Government to restrict the expression of those views.\n  It distresses me to see the symbol of our great Republic mocked and \ndesecrated.\n  But I am not so foolish as to mutilate those values themselves. The \nstrength of our country is in large part due to the fact that we \ntolerated the expression of unpopular views. It does not strengthen us \nas a nation to begin, by constitutional amendment, to restrict the \nright of political expression. It does not protect our Nation to \ndiminish the very liberties which have made us the envy of all mankind.\n  Mr. President, it seems that this issue surfaces every 4 or 5 years \nusually before Presidential elections. We spoke about this issue before \nthe last Presidential election and we debate the issue again now.\n  Mr. President, one point which has come home to me time and again \nsince I have been in the Senate, is that the Framers of our \nConstitution did a marvelous thing when they wrote that document and \nwhen they added to it the Bill of Rights. Not only did they produce a \ndocument embodying our most precious values and a system of government \nto advance and protect those values, they also had the wisdom to \nanticipate the very type of effort to silence unpopular expression. \nThey anticipated it, and they guarded against it by requiring changes \nin the Constitution to be accomplished only by a two-thirds vote of \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives, and then by the \napproval of three-quarters of the legislatures of our States.\n  Those requirements have served us well in the present debate. I am \nglad that the necessary two-thirds vote to approve this amendment was \nnot achieved in this Senate. I am heartened to hear the strong \nstatements of many of my colleagues against the amendment.\n  What about the public reaction to all of this? Recent polls show that \na majority of Americans favor such a constitutional amendment and \nindicate that they would be inclined to vote against a Representative \nor Senator who opposed it.\n  I would like to believe that, given time for additional reflection, \nmost Americans would have a different view. I would like to believe \nthat those of us in public life have a responsibility and opportunity \nto persuade our fellow citizens on this issue.\n  Time will tell whether my beliefs are well-founded.\n  I cast my vote against this proposed amendment with the satisfaction \nof knowing that I have done what is clearly right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18566-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18567-S18568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FROM POLITICS TO PARANOIA\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently The Washington Post had an op-ed \npiece by one of the finest people I have met in my four decades of \npublic service: Abner J. Mikva.\n  He served in the House, served in the federal judiciary and served as \ncounsel to President Clinton. In all three areas he served with great \ndistinction.\n  I believe we should reflect on his recent op-ed piece ``From Politics \nto Paranoia,'' which I ask to be printed in full in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Along with Senator John Glenn and Senator Jeff Bingaman, I voted \nagainst the authorization of another million dollars for further \nWhitewater investigations by the Senate committee.\n  I believe it will turn out to be a waste of money. I have been \nappointed to that committee, perhaps because of that vote.\n  But much worse than the conduct of congressional committees have been \nthe excesses of the independent counsels that have been appointed.\n  If I were to vote again today on that creation, I would vote against \nit.\n  I read recently that the Whitewater independent counsel is now \ninvestigating two contributions to Bill Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial \nrace. And the independent counsel has now spent almost $25 million in \npursuing every little remote lead.\n  Our laws should be enforced and we need independence.\n  My own feeling is that we should establish certain standards for the \nOffice of Attorney General and then not have an independent counsel.\n  Janet Reno is independent. President Gerald Ford's appointment of Ed \nLevi as Attorney General was not an appointment of a close friend but \nrather someone genuinely independent.\n  Unfortunately, we have had examples of Attorneys General being \nappointed who are too close to the President.\n  But to have independent counsels that run amuck is not in our \nnational interest.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 1995]\n\n  From Politics to Paranoia--Misguided Ethics Laws Have Given Us More \n                           Mistrust, Not Less\n\n                          (By Abner J. Mikva)\n\n       It probably was inevitable that after a year as White House \n     counsel some in the media and politics would speculate that I \n     left my job because I ``know something'' I don't want to \n     defend. That suspicion is dead wrong. I left because I am \n     physically tired--but in good health and humor, and I intend \n     to stay that way.\n       The long hours were draining, though worth it. But far more \n     demoralizing was what I came to see as a profound loss of \n     faith by the American people in the government they've \n     created. I leave public life at a time when America has grown \n     unusually distrustful of its government and its leaders. Too \n     many of us expect and believe the worst about government, \n     even when no evidence exists to justify our doubts. And I've \n     come to think that some of our intended solutions to this \n     over the years have become the cause of the problem. We need \n     changes in the independent counsel law and others we've \n     created with perhaps the best of intentions.\n       Healthy skepticism is necessary to the continuation of our \n     democracy. When it turns to paranoia, it becomes destructive. \n     American history has alternated between the two--from the \n     Watergate reformers and the anti-Federalists who opposed the \n     new Constitution of the 1780s to the paranoia of the ``Know \n     Nothings'' of the mid-1800s to the ``I hate Washington'' \n     crowd of today.\n       What seems paradoxical about today's lack of trust is that \n     never have people in government been obliged to disclose more \n     about themselves. Ethics laws, freedom of information laws, \n     conflict of interest laws and others have made public \n     officials live in the clearest goldfish bowl ever. Federal \n     agencies have inspectors general and designated ethics \n     officials whose job it is to ferret out any unethical \n     behavior, whether it is by a Cabinet secretary or a mail \n     clerk. The independent counsel laws provides a mechanism \n     whereby the attorney general must refer out any evidence of \n     criminal wrongdoing by high government officials.\n       Yet public confidence in government--the ostensible goal of \n     ethics legislation--is at an all-time low. Indeed the \n     accounting often seems to further the problem by allowing \n     critics to magnify minor blemishes into major defects.\n       For instance, there has been a regrettable willingness by \n     politicians and activists in both of our major political \n     parties to use even a hint of ethical misconduct as a \n     political weapon against the other side. Negative political \n     advertising has become an art form for almost every political \n     campaign. Add to this a tendency in the public arena to \n     exaggerate claims of impropriety, and it sometimes becomes \n     difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate \n     and illegitimate charges.\n       The media has added to the excesses. The desire of the \n     electronic media to use sound bites rather than reportage \n     lends itself to the name-calling and the sensationalism that \n     exists. The desperate nature of competition for the print \n     media had caused many newspapers to reach for scandals and \n     follow the lead of the most yellow-journalism rivals.\n       Most of the investigations that I dealt with during my time \n     as White House counsel--Whitewater, Waco, the Travel Office, \n     the Mexican peso crisis--were a dismaying waste to time for \n     Congress, for the administration and for the media who kept \n     looking for a nonexistent smoking gun.\n       The investigations showed that some people in government \n     made mistakes, used bad judgment, passed the buck and \n     displayed other human fragilities that may be worthy of \n     comment but hardly of an inquisition. In the Waco tragedy, \n     for example, the Department of Justice and the Treasury \n     Department each issued candid reports on the events, \n     including an assessment of blame for the mistakes. The \n     congressional investigations added nothing to the public \n     awareness except to beat up on the agencies. The same is true \n     of the congressional Whitewater investigations where an \n     independent counsel operation has been spending a lot of time \n     and resources to determine whether any governmental officials \n     engaged in wrongdoing.\n       I am not an apologist for human shortcomings. Once a \n     government official steps over the ethical line, he or she \n     should be dealt with firmly. The public must know \n\n[[Page S18568]]\n     that we will not tolerate ethical lapses, whatever the personal \n     consequences to the violator. But government cannot daily \n     prove its rectitude to the cynic convinced of government's \n     corruption. A nation where cynicism toward government \n     prevails cannot function effectively.\n       Of course, a government that merely implores voters to \n     ``trust me'' will not gain that trust, nor should it. But if \n     our eternal rounds of inquisition and calumny tear down the \n     public trust, and make government out to be a cesspool, if \n     our remedies make public service so unattractive and \n     distasteful as to lose the capacity to recruit new and good \n     people to government--we lose the whole ballgame. We have \n     spent so much time accusing, finger-pointing and exposing, \n     that we have forgotten why we formed a government in the \n     first place. We make it impossible to be governed.\n       And yet we are proposing additional ethics reforms, based \n     not on what they can achieve, but rather on the political \n     perception that something must be done. In an attempt to \n     ``out-ethic'' the political opposition, we only make matters \n     worse.\n       For example, we already require the filing of too many \n     forms. Every year all of our senior officials spend countless \n     hours preparing financial disclosure forms. Candidates file \n     extensive reports on how they raise and spend their campaign \n     money. The reports are so complicated that most reviewers \n     can't understand what they are reviewing, but they do serve \n     as wonderful traps to snare the unwary official.\n       We have lobbying laws on the books that do precious little \n     to expose the difference between legitimate lobbying and \n     improper use of money and favors to gain desired results. \n     There are proposals to add further forms--ones that will do \n     nothing to break the link between lobbying and money. We \n     ought to concentrate our efforts on gift banning and campaign \n     finance reform.\n       We ought to evoke the principle that applies to federal \n     judges, who cannot accept anything of value from any party \n     who has an interest in a case before that judge. The judge \n     either refuses the gift or recuses himself from the case. \n     It's a simple principle. Judges understand it; lawyers and \n     their clients understand it; everyone obeys it. In the rare \n     cases where judges violate the rule, they go to jail. What \n     the principle does is break the link between the giving and \n     the ruling. You can give but you cannot buy. Applied to \n     Congress, which recently has banned gifts such as meals and \n     trips, the principle would end the seamy business of members \n     asking for contributions (and getting them) from person most \n     likely to be affected by the member's actions. Obviously, \n     such a plan would necessitate a whole new campaign finance \n     structure, but that is long overdue anyway.\n       We ought to reconsider the independent counsel statute. \n     Some may smirk that I of all people would suggest changing \n     it, since I voted for it while in Congress and have had to \n     live with its consequences during this past year. But fewer \n     and fewer people in either political party now believe that \n     it really works. The original purpose of preventing Richard \n     Nixon and his friend and close adviser Attorney General John \n     Mitchell from investigating themselves in the Watergate \n     scandal has been achieved. Since then, 17 independent \n     counsels have been appointed. Their mandates have ranged \n     all the way from investigating whether a White House aide \n     sniffed cocaine in a New York nightclub to whether a \n     cabinet official understated how much money he paid to a \n     woman with whom he had an affair. One investigation--the \n     five-year-old probe of Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development officials--has gone on for so long that the \n     independent counsel announced that the main target had \n     grown too old to pursue. One can question whether even the \n     Iran-contra case or the Whitewater affair wouldn't have \n     best been handled the normal way by Justice Department \n     prosecutors.\n       We can do better. We need to amend the statute to provide \n     for qualifications for the independent counsel that guarantee \n     political independence. The counsel ought to be appointed on \n     a full-time basis for a limited period of time. Extensions of \n     the original period of appointment should be allowed only \n     under very limited circumstances. The threshold for seeking \n     an independent counsel should be raised further--to limit the \n     appointment only to cases where it is clear that normal \n     authority is insufficient. The selection process for the \n     special court which appoints and supervises independent \n     counsels should be changed to ensure both the reality and the \n     perception of nonpolitical appointments.\n       From the outset, our founders recognized the tension \n     between governing effectively and the elimination of all \n     potential for abuse. George Washington wrote: ``No man is a \n     warmer advocate for proper restraints and wholesome checks in \n     every department than I am; but I have never yet been able to \n     discover the propriety of placing it absolutely out of the \n     power of men to render essential services, because a \n     possibility remains of their doing ill.''\n       If we have all these codes of ethics and all of these \n     disclosure laws and all of these investigating institutions \n     and less trust with each addition to the pile, we must be \n     doing something wrong. We need some remedies that will \n     restore the faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18567-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18568-S18570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JULIE McGREGOR\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, frequent staff turnover is a fact \nof life in the Senate. In this regard, I have always considered myself \nexceedingly lucky. I have had many key staff members who stayed with me \nfar beyond the average tenure and I, and the people of Oregon, have \ngreatly benefited from their institutional knowledge and experience. \nBut, inevitably, the day arrives when even those diehard staffers feel \nit is time to move on. For Julie McGregor, that day has arrived.\n  And so I rise to bid farewell to a longtime and valued staff member. \nI find it difficult to take so many years of loyalty, dedication, and \nfriendship and wrap it into a neat one page package. Words alone simply \nseem inadequate to express what Julie has meant to me, to my family, \nand to my office.\n  Julie came to my office 13 years ago as an eager, bright, and \nintelligent intern. She departs today a wise and competent sage. In \nthat time, Julie's role evolved from that of student to mentor. No \nmatter how busy, she always took the time to encourage and guide less \nexperienced colleagues. Members of the Appropriations Committee staff \nas well as my personal staff have relied on Julie's counsel and valued \nher perspective as much as I did.\n  One of Julie's greatest assets is her intuitive ability to cut to the \nheart of the matter. She thoughtfully and fairly examines all sides of \nan issue, but remains unerringly firm in her convictions. Even in the \nmost emotional discussions or difficult issues, Julie is a calm voice \nof rationality and reason. In fact, those who don't know her well might \nbe deceived by Julie's quiet manner or seemingly shy nature. They \nshouldn't be. She is extraordinarily tenacious. If you are staking a \nposition or fighting a battle, you definitely want Julie on your side.\n  Julie grew up in small southern Oregon community, and those roots \nhave served her well here. While adapting well to the rough and tumble \npolitical world in Washington, she has always kept clearly in mind the \nindividual human beings whom we serve. She is both politically astute \nand compassionate, a combination of qualities that is so rare it is \nalmost an oxymoron. Aware of the realities and limitations of the \npolitical process, Julie is unwavering in her belief that the \nGovernment can and should use its powers to improve the human \ncondition. This is a belief that we share and one that has guided many \nof our legislative efforts.\n  While Julie, at one time or another, handled nearly every legislative \nissue in my office, her true calling was one that is closest to my own \nheart. First as a legislative assistant and later as my director of \nInternational Policy, she became an advocate for peace and a champion \nfor humanitarian concerns. Julie's work on arms control, human rights, \nand nuclear proliferation issues, among others, leaves a lasting legacy \nin the Senate and has had an impact on us all.\n  Julie played a key role in one of the legislative accomplishments of \nwhich I am most proud. In 1992, we were successful in enacting \nlegislation establishing a moratorium on nuclear testing by the United \nStates. This nuclear test ban continues today and the United States' \nleadership on this issue has prompted much of the rest of the world to \nfollow suit.\n  Julie has spent her entire professional career in public service, in \nservice to the State of Oregon and to the U.S. Senate. I know that the \npeople of Oregon, and my colleagues in the Senate, join me in \nexpressing our gratitude for many years of exemplary work.\n  While we are sad to see Julie leave us, we are also excited for her \nas she begins a new phase in her life. This weekend she leaves \nWashington to join her finance, Michael Britti, in New Mexico. There \nwill be many wonderful opportunities and adventures as Julie moves on \nwith her career, and as she and Mike begin to build a life together.\n  Julie is, and always will be, a member of the Hatfield family. \nAntoinette and I send her off with our love and our best wishes for a \nfuture full of happiness and success.\n\n[[Page S18569]]\n\n\n  SCHOOL FACILITIES AND THE NEW GAO REPORT SCHOOL FACILITIES: STATES' \n                 FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT VARIES\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to announce the \nresults of a study conducted by the General Accounting Office on \nStates' efforts to improve the condition of our public school \nfacilities.\n  Infrastructure needs are not cosmetic--they go directly to the \nsafety, the suitability, and environment for learning that directly \naffects American students' performance in the classroom.\n  The GAO found that many States are doing little to address the \ndeterioration of our schools--and what is being done varies widely from \nState to State. Only thirteen States take a comprehensive approach to \ntheir school infrastructure needs--by providing ongoing funding for \nschool improvement projects, offering technical assistance to local \nofficials, and maintaining up-to-date information on the condition of \ntheir facilities.\n  The GAO has documented that our schools are falling apart.\n  They are not ready for the Information Age because of inadequate \ninfrastructure. More than 60 percent lack sufficient phone lines. \nThirty-five percent don't even have enough electrical power to operate \ncomputers.\n  Last week, the Washington Post ran an article that described the \ncondition of the bathrooms in some of the District's schools. The Post \nreported that many of the restrooms are in violently foul condition--\nunhealthy and unusable.\n  One parent said she could not believe the bathroom in her children's \nschool was in the United States. I have that article and would like to \nsubmit it for the Record.\n  We have seen these problems in school buildings all over the \ncountry--in Chicago, Baltimore, New York, and Los Angeles--in rural \ncommunities, as well as in urban centers.\n  America cannot compete if our students cannot learn, and our students \ncannot learn if our schools are falling down.\n  Earlier this year, the GAO released a report--entitled School \nFacilities: The Condition of America's Schools--that looked at the \nfacilities that millions of our children walk into every morning. In \nthat report, the GAO documented that 13 million students attend schools \nthat need to be extensively repaired or replaced.\n  The GAO estimates that it will cost $112 billion to upgrade our \nschool facilities to a good, overall condition. This cost is growing. \nThe longer infrastructure needs are ignored or deferred, the greater \nthe cost will be. The situation is like that facing the owner of a \nhome. If the roof leaks, and you find the leak early, you can patch the \nroof. But if you wait a few years, you find you'll need to tear out the \nwalls or rebuild the foundation. The message couldn't be clearer--delay \nequals additional cost.\n  In the report released by the GAO today, we find out that many States \nare not even bothering to assess the damage or call in the building \ninspector.\n  The GAO says State support is limited and varied. In fiscal year \n1994, States provided a total of $3.5 billion in grants and loans for \nschool facilities construction--only 3.1 percent of the total funding \nneeded.\n  The sum of $3.5 billion may sound like a lot, and indeed, if your \nchild goes to school in Alaska, it is. The State of Alaska spent almost \n$275 million--$2,254 per pupil--in fiscal year 1994 on school \nconstruction projects. On the other end of the spectrum is my home \nState of Illinois. Illinois, along with 10 other States, provides no \nongoing support for school facilities construction or improvement.\n  Today's report documents an alarming lack of knowledge about the \nconditions of our schools. More than half of the States have no recent \ninformation on the condition of school buildings in their States.\n  I mentioned a newspaper report on decaying children's bathrooms. \nGerald Sigal, a major construction contractor, also read that article. \nHe was so upset that he is forming a coalition of business leaders to \nfix the problem. Mr. Sigal responded to the public school bathroom \ncrisis because he found out about it.\n  But most schools seldom have a major newspaper to do their reporting \nfor them, and the only people that may know about the brown tap water \nand broken plumbing are the children.\n  Last year, Congress took a monumental step toward fixing our school \nfacilities problem when it enacted and funded the Education \nInfrastructure Act. This year, however, Congress took away the money.\n  Mr. President, if our children do not have computers, or if they \ncannot see the blackboard because it has fallen off the wall, or if \nthey cannot go to the bathroom because it stinks of sewage, or if they \ncannot keep warm because the heaters are broken, they cannot \nconcentrate, and they cannot learn.\n  This new GAO report is essentially a report card that measures State \nsupport for education infrastructure. Very few States get a passing \nmark. But the schools are still falling apart. The time has come for us \nto step in and heal our Nation's schools.\n  The problem goes beyond what many local communities can handle. Many \nDistricts cannot find more revenue because they have already been \nstretched to their local limits in bonding and other ways to raise \nmoney for education.\n  The GAO looked at whether technical assistance is available from the \nStates to local school officials--whether local officials can count on \nStates for help in advice and planning. Again, great disparities exist.\n  Florida has the equivalent of 72 people who provide guidance on \nplanning, construction, and maintenance. New York gives workshops and \npublishes articles on facilities planning. But 34 States have less than \n6 full time people available for this kind of assistance.\n  Repairing our schools is in the national interest. We must provide \nassistance to strapped local school districts in a way that directly \nbenefits children. Federal support for education infrastructure allows \nus to help local school districts create a suitable environment for \nlearning, without violating the tenet of local control over public \neducation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to take a close look at this new GAO \nstudy, and decide how much longer they want to leave the problem of our \ncrumbling public school facilities to someone else.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 8, 1995]\n\n  In D.C. Schools, It's Tough Going--Students Find Themselves Without \n                     Soap, Toilet Paper or Privacy\n\n                           (By Sari Horwitz)\n\n       Children in public schools across the District often use \n     dirty bathrooms that lack private stalls, soap, paper towels \n     and even toilet paper.\n       The restrooms in even some of the city's most highly \n     regarded public schools are in such poor shape that parents \n     fear they are unhealthy for children, and educators say they \n     are interfering with learning.\n       One of those schools is Horace Mann Elementary in well-to-\n     do upper Northwest Washington, a school that has won awards \n     from the U.S. Department of Education. Many days, second-\n     grader Peter Joyce and his schoolmate Joe Takesuye won't use \n     the boys' bathroom because of the filth and overpowering \n     stench of urine. They hold it until they get home.\n       ``The bathrooms really smell,'' said Peter, 7. ``They are \n     dirty. There's paper towels all over the floor, spitballs on \n     the walls and the water from the sink is like, brown. It \n     looks gross.''\n       Horace Mann Principal Sheila Ford said she doesn't have the \n     money to improve the 64-year-old building's plumbing. But \n     she's looking for resources because the bathroom problem is \n     spilling into her classrooms as the odors creep into her \n     halls.\n       ``When I need to use the lavatory and I'm away from one, my \n     concentration is eliminated.'' Ford said. ``It is the same \n     for children.''\n       Dirty, dilapidated school bathrooms are a problem in urban \n     schools across the nation and are worsening as buildings age \n     and resources for maintenance diminish, according to \n     officials. Almost one-third of the nation's school buildings \n     were built before World War II.\n       In a world where educational dollars are getting stretched \n     ridiculously thin, bathrooms stand at the end of the line,'' \n     said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of \n     Great City Schools, which represents the nations largest \n     school districts. ``They've really fallen off the radar \n     screen in terms of priority.''\n       The bathroom problem, however, does not appear to be as \n     serious in other school systems in the Washington area as it \n     is in the District, according to parent activists in Fairfax, \n     Montgomery and Prince George's countries.\n       Open the door to the only bathroom for 140 little boys in \n     127-year-old Stevens Elementary in downtown Washington, and \n     the \n\n[[Page S18570]]\n     stench of urine is overwhelming. The dank bathroom with rusting, \n     corroded pipes is in the basement, and the windows remain \n     shut for security reasons.\n       ``It kind of holds the odors in,'' said the school's new \n     principal, Gloria Henderson, who has been trying \n     unsuccessfully to have a hole cut in the wall and an exhaust \n     fan installed.\n       The bathroom problem in D.C. schools is not all old age.\n       Parents and educators said that in many schools, clean , \n     fully stocked and functioning bathrooms are simply not a \n     priority in a school system saddled with other problems and \n     budget woes. Hundreds of D.C. students still do not even have \n     textbooks.\n       This fall, parents at Watkins Elementary School, on Capitol \n     Hill, were stunned to discover there were no working sinks in \n     the girls' or boys' bathrooms on the first, second and third \n     floors, in some cases since last January, according to parent \n     Samuel Brylawski.\n       ``Here you have a school full of kids who don't wash their \n     hands after they go to the bathroom,'' Brylawski said. ``It \n     took parents nine months to be informed. Fundamental sanitary \n     practices were not a high priority.''\n       Some repairs were made after Brylawski wrote a letter to \n     the superintendent and the public health commission, he said.\n       Mary Levy, counsel to Parents United, a parents advocacy \n     group, said the low priority for maintaining bathrooms \n     reflects officials' lack of concern of children. ``Every door \n     should be taken off the stalls of the buildings with elected \n     officials until they fix the doors for children,'' she said.\n       Bathroom water is the issue at Langdon Elementary School, \n     in Northeast Washington. PTA president Vivian Whitaker said \n     only cold water comes out of the bathroom sinks, and it's \n     dirty brown.\n       ``I wouldn't recommend the children wash their hands,'' \n     Whitaker said.\n       School officials said it's hard to maintain heavily used \n     bathrooms, especially when students dirty them or break \n     equipment. Parents said students are less likely to violate \n     clean, working restrooms.\n       At schools where bathroom repairs have been made, such as \n     Wilson High School and J.F. Cook Elementary, it has made all \n     the difference, they said.\n       Three years ago, D.C. public schools hired a consulting \n     firm to study its buildings. The firm found serious problems \n     in bathroom piping and toilets, including old sewage pipes \n     rusted beyond repair, poor lighting and missing or defective \n     toilet stalls and urinals.\n       In seven schools, the plumbing was called ``hazardous.'' \n     The plumbing system at Francis Junior High, with ``extensive \n     leaking and clogged pipes'' was called ``unacceptable.'' At \n     Browne Junior High, the report called for ``immediate \n     replacement'' of all the plumbing. As of July, 75 D.C. \n     schools needed repairs, including new or fixed sinks, \n     according to a school document. An additional 13 schools \n     needed toilet partitions so students could use them with \n     privacy.\n       At one on that list, Duke Ellington School of the Arts in \n     Georgetown, student Zavi Ball, 16, described the bathrooms \n     last week as ``disgusting, horrible.''\n       ``There's never any paper towels or soap,'' she said. \n     ``There's no warm water to wash your hands. There's hardly \n     ever toilet paper. There's dirty feminine products on the \n     floor and roaches. Whenever guests come, they clean the \n     bathrooms up. But when it's just us, they don't care. When I \n     come to school at 8 in the morning, the bathroom is already \n     dirty.''\n       Facilities and Management Director William McAfee did not \n     return phone calls. But school spokeswoman Beverly Lofton \n     said building repair funds were very tight.\n       With a more than half-billion-dollar budget, the District \n     spends $7,673 a year for each of its students, one of the \n     highest per-pupil operating costs in the country. But most of \n     the capital funds for building upkeep and repairs have been \n     used for repairing fire hazards, Lofton said.\n       ``We don't want our kids going to schools that don't have \n     functioning bathrooms,'' Lofton said. ``We want them to have \n     the best of everything, including partitions and sinks that \n     work. But there is a lack of capital money to repair \n     everything that breaks when it happens.\n       ``We do recognize we have problems with bathrooms in the \n     school systems'' she said. ``Bathrooms are a priority for the \n     coming year.''\n       Principal Rosalie Huff of Anthony Bowen Elementary School, \n     in Southwest, tired of waiting. When the school system hadn't \n     replaced her broken toilets and missing partitions in 12 \n     bathrooms by the beginning of this school year, she bought \n     five new toilets and partitions herself.\n       ``I had a situation that was really awful,'' Huff said. \n     ``It didn't allow any type of basic human dignity for the \n     girls. You were just sitting out if you had to use the \n     toilets.''\n       Consumer advocate Ralph Nader wants the Appleseed \n     Foundation, a public interest law center he helped create, to \n     work to improve the District's school bathrooms. He got fired \n     up about dirty, dysfunctional restrooms after listening to \n     complaints from students at Alice Deal Junior High. ``They \n     said their bathrooms were filthy,'' Nader said. ``There was \n     no soap, no privacy and no toilet paper. And they said they \n     held it. But the faculty restrooms were immaculate. It's so \n     disgraceful.''\n       A visit to Deal last week revealed boys' and girls' \n     bathrooms missing doors on the stalls and partitions between \n     toilets, sinks that don't work properly and boys' restrooms \n     filled with an overwhelming stench. A school worker said the \n     odor came from toilets that leak and sewage that sits in \n     rusty, corroded pipes.\n       At Horace Mann, PTA president Jane Joyce said she was so \n     fed up with the bathrooms that she raised the issue at the \n     first parents meeting in September. About 30 parents \n     volunteered to come in on a Saturday and scrub the floors, \n     bring in toilet paper and make repairs.\n       That helped for a while. A few weeks ago, parent Joan \n     Murray ventured into one of the school bathrooms to see if it \n     really was as bad as her two children described.\n       ``I wouldn't use it,'' Murray said. ``It was more than \n     horrendous. It was disgusting. There were paper towels \n     everywhere, no flushed toilets and no soap. The water didn't \n     come out of the spigots. And it smelled. I couldn't believe \n     it was in the United States.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18568-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18570-S18571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMBASSADOR JOSEPH VERNER REED'S ADDRESS TO INTERPARLIAMENTARY \n                               CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in October, Ambassador Joseph Verner \nReed represented U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali at the \n94th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Bucharest, Romania.\n  At the Conference, Ambassador Reed delivered an exceptional speech \nconcerning the current financial crisis at the United Nations. As a \nlongtime friend and supporter of the United Nations, I can think of no \nissue more important to the U.N.'s future. Moreover, the United \nNation's fiscal health has critical implications for our own country's \nforeign and domestic agenda.\n  In his address, Ambassador Reed--formerly one of the United States' \nmost accomplished diplomats and now a high-ranking U.N. official--made \na compelling argument about the necessity for resolving this crisis. I \ncommend the speech to my colleagues and ask that excerpts be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The excerpts of the speech follows:\n\n       Mr. President, the fiftieth anniversary of the United \n     Nations has arrived at one of the turning points in modern \n     history.\n       The United Nations is the only machinery we have for \n     collective cooperation among all Nations. It is the only \n     global tool for promoting peace and security. It is the only \n     worldwide institution for furthering development. It is the \n     only universal mechanism for protecting human rights. It is \n     the only shared framework for strengthening international \n     law.\n       But today I feel compelled to share my distress with you on \n     a subject which is unavoidable, the survival of the United \n     Nations. For almost four years, we have tried to convince the \n     governments of member states of the United Nations to pay \n     their assessments on time. For four years we have warned of \n     the financial consequences of the failure to pay assessments. \n     We have argued, we have pleaded.\n       The organization has cut expenses. We have streamlined \n     operations. We are working hard to reduce waste, duplication \n     and overlap. Peace-keeping is expensive. The operation in the \n     former Yugoslavia costs five million dollars per day.\n       In Every major statement and document of the Secretary-\n     General, he has drawn attention to the financial crisis and \n     proposed steps to remedy it. In meeting after meeting with \n     foreign ministers and heads of state over these years, he has \n     pleaded with them to address this deteriorating situation.\n       As of October 1995, 70 countries had not paid their regular \n     budget assessment. Today, the United Nations is owed a total \n     of $3.4 billion by its member states.\n       I appeal to you as parliamentarians to help me resolve this \n     crisis. I ask you to try to convince your governments to pay \n     their arrears, and to pay future contributions on time, and \n     in full.\n       I make this appeal to you because the United Nations is \n     your organization. I make this appeal here because without \n     peace, and without the global efforts of peace, and without \n     the global efforts of the United Nations, all your efforts \n     for development will be to no avail.\n       The United Nations is not one of the luxuries of \n     international life. The work of the United Nations is of \n     vital, critical importance:\n       Saving children from starvation and disease.\n       Providing food, clothing and shelter for refugees.\n       Delivering humanitarian relief to devastated areas.\n       Working to stop the cycle of natural disasters in lands \n     repeatedly afflicted by them.\n       Countering the new international threats of crimes, drugs, \n     disease.\n       Defending human rights in individual cases as well as \n     through international commitments.\n       Advising, training, monitoring and institution-building in \n     countries seeking to democratize.\n       Maintaining ceasefires, preventing conflicts from erupting, \n     peacemaking between \n\n[[Page S18571]]\n     adversaries and peace-building in devastated countries.\n       These activities are going on now. They are being conducted \n     on the ground in locations all over the world. They are \n     carried out by dedicated, hard-working national and \n     international staff members.\n       The financial crisis is being felt on the frontlines of all \n     these efforts. If emergency measures to restore the financial \n     health are not taken quickly, human suffering will \n     dramatically increase. People will die. The structural \n     ability of the United Nations to continue this work will be \n     damaged. It will not soon or easily be reconstructed, if \n     ever.\n       Unless substantial assessment payments are received by the \n     end of November 1995, the Secretary-General will have no \n     choice but to request that an emergency special session of \n     the United Nations General Assembly be convened immediately \n     to consider the financial crisis--and future of the \n     organization.\n       The financial crisis of the United Nations is now \n     destroying its very foundations. We can no longer pretend \n     otherwise. That is why we appeal today to you--the world's \n     parliamentarians for assistance. You must be our voice. You \n     must be our advocate. You must be the protectors of our \n     common future.\n       Mr. President, this is an emergency--the Secretary-General \n     and all of us in the secretariat believe that positive change \n     can be achieved, and he is convinced that this change can be \n     the vehicle for fulfilling the aims and aspirations of the \n     charter. He is convinced that working together in partnership \n     we can save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; \n     we can enhance the dignity and worth of the human person; and \n     we can promote social progress and better standards of life \n     in larger freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18570-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18571-S18572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               POLLS GET IN THE WAY OF WASHINGTON'S WORK\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Post and Courier, a Charleston South \nCarolina newspaper, recently had an op-ed piece by our colleague from \nSouth Carolina that is typical in its Fritz Hollings' bluntness, but \nalso typical in its Fritz Hollings' wisdom.\n  Two points in his op-ed piece need to be stressed over and over \nagain. One is that you cannot lead by taking polls.\n  You lead by studying the issues and having some conviction and doing \nsomething. Leadership that simply follows the polls is leadership in \nname only.\n  At all levels of government, we need much more leadership of \nconviction. If we believe we are going to satisfy the public and turn \naway their cynicism by some of the gimmicks that we use, we are only \nfooling ourselves. I agree with the limitations on lobbying and I favor \na much improved system of financing political campaigns, but if these \nthings happen but we continue to govern by polls rather than by looking \nat the national needs, we will get nowhere.\n  The second part of this statement is a recognition that we need to \nget additional revenue for the federal government.\n  He says accurately, ``We have fiscal cancer and nobody wants to talk \nabout it.'' He goes on and says bluntly, ``To put a tourniquet on this \ndeficit-debt hemorrhage, we need spending cuts, spending freezes, a \nclosing of tax loopholes, denying new programs and tax increases.''\n  Our highways are deteriorating compared to those in Western Europe \nwhen not too many years ago it was the other way around.\n  We have a much higher percentage of our children living in poverty \nthan any of the Western Europeans countries.\n  We are the only western industrialized country that doesn't protect \nall of our citizens with health care insurance.\n  These things take revenue, and people in this body and in the \nAdministration ought to be talking much more candidly to the American \npublic.\n  I commend our colleague, Senator Hollings, for being blunt and \ntelling us the truth in this article which I ask to be printed in full \nin the Record. The article follows:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, Nov. 15, 1995]\n\n               Polls Get in the Way of Washington's Work\n\n                    (By Senator Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       The silent scandal that permeates Washington is the \n     pollster charade. As in Newsweek's Conventional Wisdom Watch, \n     today's Washington is based on who's up and who's down in the \n     polls. Everyone--the president, Congress and the media--\n     participates. The result? Nothing gets done and no one really \n     expects anything to get done. Meanwhile, the nation's real \n     needs are ignored. There is no genuine plan to guide us. And \n     plans to put us on a pay-as-you-go basis are simply pollster-\n     driven budget schemes fashioned to get politicians past the \n     next election.\n       John F. Kennedy started it all 35 years ago in West \n     Virginia. Lou Harris' polls identified hot-button issues of \n     concern and Jack Kennedy played them like a Stradivarius. \n     Political polling immediately became the order of the day. \n     Now even the media wittingly are the engines behind the \n     oppressive reliance on polls. No longer do reporters bow to \n     the who, what, where, when, how and why of fact and accuracy. \n     Instead, they kowtow to pollsters to elicit pithy partisan \n     responses that stem from polls.\n       The pollster begins each day with ``divide and conquer.'' \n     Voters immediately are divided into age, sex, race, \n     education, working or retired, married or single, veteran or \n     military, city, suburb or rural. No one is considered an \n     American. They have to be Asian-American, African-American, \n     Irish-American.\n       Division is the pollster mentality, but dissembling is the \n     pollster's art. No pollster has served a day in office. But \n     they'll tell you in a minute that you can't break the Sacred \n     Code of the Pollster. If you want to get--and stay--in \n     office:\n       Never take a firm position. If you do, you'll divide \n     voters.\n       Favoring a proposition will put you at odds with those who \n     oppose.\n       Opposing will separate you and those who favor.\n       To influence the most voters possible, firmly say that \n     you're ``concerned'' about any issue so you appear \n     understanding and appease both sides.\n       Aha! Now any way you slice it, you've identified with the \n     voter. With this kind of soundbite mentality permeating the \n     airwaves, it's easy to understand why there is no \n     leadership in Washington.\n       Lee Atwater taught that negative politics is the positive \n     path to political victory. As a result, one of the first \n     ``musts'' for a candidate today is to order negative research \n     on opponents--and himself. Why? To have a prepared answer for \n     any past mistakes or inconsistencies and to be able to unload \n     on an opponent at the end of the campaign when voters finally \n     are interested and there's no time to respond.\n       Pollsters also teach both incumbents and challengers to \n     preach change. That's why all candidates sound the same. \n     Republicans and Democrats are all for cutting spending and \n     against taxes; for prisons and against crime; for jobs and \n     against welfare; for education and the environment. And, of \n     course, everyone is for the family. With this emphasis on \n     change and negative politics, the logic of the pollster \n     paradigm is that government is the enemy and problem, not the \n     solution. As such, everyone serving in government must be \n     ousted. Thus, there's the cry for term limits.\n       The media's job is to expose this nonsense. But instead of \n     living up to this responsibility, the media have joined the \n     scam. They feast on polls and partisanship. Rather than \n     reporting the news of the day, they make the news with their \n     own polls. Questions by reporters don't delve into an issue \n     but focus on the poll or partisan aspects of the issue. What \n     they want is conflict.\n       These days, the pollster charade in the media continues \n     with the ludicrous notion that spending cuts alone can \n     eliminate the deficit. Or worse--that cutting taxes can \n     eliminate the deficit. Nothing could be further from the \n     truth. Since Ronald Reagan's ``voodoo'' that tax cuts could \n     bring in more revenue and eliminate the deficit, the national \n     debt quintupled from less that $1 trillion to almost $5 \n     trillion. And instead of eliminating waste in government, we \n     created the biggest waste of all--$348 billion a year in \n     interest costs. Since we can't avoid paying interest costs, \n     we borrow a billion dollars daily, which automatically \n     increases spending a billion, increases the debt a billion \n     and increases interest costs. Every day the cycle starts \n     again.\n       Both President Clinton's and Speaker Gingrich's budget \n     plans to get rid of this waste are mere ruses to get past \n     next year's election. But Washington politicians figure--who \n     cares? Who will be around seven years from now? And the \n     media lets them get by with it. Our 1995 budget was $1.52 \n     trillion. The 1996 Clinton budget is $1.63 trillion. The \n     1996 Gingrich congressional budget is $1.60 trillion. Both \n     budgets increase spending. Neither keeps up with the $1 \n     billion daily increase in the national debt. Over the \n     seven years, spending exceeds revenues by more than $1 \n     trillion. The media know this yet continue to report ``a \n     balanced budget by the year 2002.''\n       Now comes the bogus proposal to balance the budget by \n     reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security and by \n     raiding Medicare. By law, Social Security funds are in trust \n     and are not to be used to offset the deficit. Similarly, the \n     Medicare trust fund for hospital costs is in the black, but \n     may go into the red by 2002. In other words, both Social \n     Security and Medicare are paid for and in surplus. What is \n     not paid for this minute is defense, education, farm \n     subsidies, environmental protection, veterans' benefits, law \n     enforcement--general government. We readily increase billions \n     for defense and other programs but are unwilling to pay for \n     it. Thus continues the borrowing, spending and downward \n     spiral that increases the deficit. We have fiscal cancer and \n     nobody wants to talk about it.\n       To put a tourniquet on this deficit-debt hemorrhage, we \n     need spending cuts, spending freezes, a closing of tax \n     loopholes, denying new programs and tax increases. But \n     proposals to do this go unreported. As such, the \n\n[[Page S18572]]\n     public believes spending cuts alone will do the job. And the media \n     validate bogus plans to cut taxes as serious moves to balance \n     the budget. That we really are broke is ignored.\n       Rather than being pollster pawns, the media should serve as \n     an institutional memory to give up perspective. With the Cold \n     War over, it's time to rebuild our economy. More than ever, a \n     strong government is needed--for education, job training, \n     research, housing, transportation, technical development and \n     inner-city needs.\n       But the media treat government as the enemy.\n       In a silent conspiracy with pollsters and Washington \n     politicians, the media masquerade opinion polls as fact and \n     validate the politics that any tax increase is poison. All \n     the time, the rebuilding of America goes wanting and neither \n     the Clinton nor the Dole/Gingrich forces can talk sense. The \n     train wreck is a media production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18571-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Madam President, as I came over here tonight for the vote, \nI could feel the light snow and the chill of the wind. It made me think \nof the weather that the young men and women who we are sending to \nBosnia will experience during their Christmas--the 19- and 20-year-old \nyoung men and women who love their country, and they will give their \nvery lives if called upon to serve. They will spend this Christmas \nthousands of miles away from home, in the outskirts of Tuzla, Bosnia--\nand they will do it gladly.\n  In the idealism of youth, they will know that they are serving their \ncountry, and they will carry with it an enthusiasm that tells them they \nwould do anything to serve this Nation and to preserve our freedom.\n  I cannot help but remember the words of a movie that perhaps some \nhave forgotten, a movie that some of the critics laughed at. Sylvester \nStallone played the part of a man trying to free POW's in Vietnam. When \nhe came back from the mission that some of the leaders had tried to \nthwart, he was asked by his commanding colonel what in the world he \nwanted. The words he spoke in the movie were: ``I want what every man \nwho served in Vietnam wanted; I want my country to love me as much as I \nlove my country.''\n  Tonight we have decided to send young men and women into harm's way, \nand into a cause that is not clearly defined, and into a mission that \nis full of risk. But they will go, and they will go gladly. They will \nmake us proud.\n  Madam President, that love of country and that willingness to serve, \nto go anywhere and do anything for us, deserves more than a casual \ncommitment from the leaders in this country; it deserves leaders that \nlove those men and women as much as they love us. It deserves a \ncommitment from us that is comparable to theirs. It is a commitment we \nshould not take lightly. We should not send young men and women to \ntheir death without being fully resolved that what they might die for \nis worth the price.\n  I do not believe that the mission that has been outlined is worth \nthat price, and I do not believe that our leaders have that commitment. \nBut the decision has been made. Those young men and women go with our \nprayers, and I will think of them this Christmas, away from home and \nfacing what may be the saddest part of anyone's life--the chance of \ngiving their lives for a mission that their country may not care about. \nThat surely is the toughest burden that any young man or any young \nwoman may ever have to face. I only pray, now that the decision is made \nand the troops are on the way, that we will not forget them, that we \nwill stand beside them, that we will not deny them the weapons they \nneed, that we will not refuse to go after the people who shoot after \nthem, and that we will spare no effort.\n  My heart was filled with joy when I heard the reaction of the French \nPresident when the French pilots, who had been taken prisoner, were not \nreturned. He made it very clear that France would not accept their men \nnot being returned in any way, or under any circumstances. Because he \nstood firm, those boys were returned. He stood up for his troops and he \nstood beside them.\n  I only pray that this Nation will have the courage to do as much for \nthose young men and women whose lives we put on the line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18572-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENDING TROOPS TO BOSNIA IS A MISTAKE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I would like to say that I feel very \nstrongly that the basic decision to send troops to Bosnia, under the \ncircumstances, is a mistake. I voted today for the Hutchison \nresolution, and I did so as a Vietnam veteran, as one who served in the \nArmy in Vietnam. I feel strongly that we have made a mistake by sending \ntroops to Bosnia.\n  Certainly, all of us want our troops to be well cared for and well \nequipped, but I oppose the basic decision to send troops there. Indeed, \nfrom my State, in the National Guard callup, 1 of 8 people who have \nbeen called up so far, probably to go to Bosnia, is a nephew of mine. \nAnd he will willingly serve his country, just as I did. But I disagree \nwith the basic decision to send troops there and have so voted today.\n  Those were not easy votes, and I feel that the last vote was more or \nless papering over the whole decision, so I voted against that \nresolution. I feel very strongly, and my constituents feel, that we are \nengaging in an adventure from which we will not be able to get out of \neasy, and if we do get out of it, it will be with a large foreign aid \nbill.\n  There has been fighting in that country since the 15th century, and \nit has continued largely because foreign armies have come every time \nthey have had a civil war, and it has never been resolved. That will \nprobably be the case again.\n  So, Madam President, I wish to state that, certainly, we all care a \ngreat deal for our troops. One of them is going to be my nephew. I make \nmy decision based on experience as a lieutenant in the Army in Vietnam. \nI just do not think this will work. That is the reason I voted as I did \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18572-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1977\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] for Mr. Simpson, for \n     himself, and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 3098.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (7) In section 18, strike ``contract, loan, or any other \n     form'' and insert ``or loan''.\n       (8) In section 12(b)(1), strike ``7'' and insert ``6''.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I rise, along with Senator Craig, to \noffer an amendment to H.Con.Res. 116, the resolution to make technical \ncorrections to the recently-passed lobbying reform legislation, S. \n1060. We understand that our amendment is acceptable to the managers of \nthe lobbying reform legislation, Senators Levin and Cohen, and we are \ngrateful to each of them for their cooperation.\n  In explaining our technical amendment, we note that three versions of \nthe Simpson-Craig lobbying reform amendment have passed the Senate. The \nfirst was our amendment to S. 1060, banning all forms of Federal fund \ntransfers, including contracts, to organizations described in Internal \nRevenue Code section 501(c)(4) who also engage in lobbying activities. \nPart of the rationale for this amendment was that those organizations \nshould not simultaneously enjoy the benefits of exemption from \ntaxation, unlimited expenditures on lobbying, and Federal funding \nsupport.\n  However, learning of a quirk in the legislative history of 501(c)(4) \norganizations, we found that many insurance companies are still \ntechnically organized as 501(c)(4) organizations, even though they are \nnow fully taxable. Many of these, along with other health care \nproviders that are also 501(c)(4) organizations, handle Federal \ncontracts under Medicare, the Federal employees health system, and \nCHAMPUS. We believe that our colleagues would concur that such groups \nlie outside the scope of the intended reach of a cutoff of grant money \nto organizations which enjoy the benefits of 501(c)(4) status.\n  It is for this reason that we redrafted our amendment, during \nconsideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, to correct \nfor this and to exclude contracts from the prohibition on Federal \nfunding assistance. That amendment passed the Senate by voice vote on \nJuly 24 of this year.\n  The third version of this provision to pass the Senate was included \nin a broader version of grants reform, which was the Simpson-Craig \namendment to the provision authored by Representatives Istook, \nMcIntosh, and Ehrlich that the House had included in House Joint \nResolution 115, the second FY 1996 continuing resolution. In the \nlanguage in that amendment affecting 501(c)(4) organizations, we also \ntook out the ban on contracts and other forms of funding, other than \ngrants.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Senator Simpson has pointed out the important fact that \nversions of the Simpson-Craig lobbying reform amendment have been \napproved by the Senate three times this year. I commend Senator Simpson \non his leadership in this area and am happy that the Simpson-Craig \namendment, along with the rest of the lobbying reform bill, is on the \nverge of being signed into law.\n  The first version of our amendment, added to S. 1060, had a scope and \nimpact on some insurance and health care providers, uniquely classified \nas 501(c)(4) organizations, that the authors and the Senate never \nintended. This problem was corrected in the second and third versions \nof the Simpson-Craig amendment. Therefore, the Senate twice approved \nthe very change in our 501(c)(4) organizations language that we are \nproposing again today.\n  For reasons totally unrelated to this change, the House of \nRepresentatives struck the second and third, perfected, Simpson-Craig \nlobbying reform amendments from the Treasury-Postal bill and the \ncontinuing resolution. The House was seeking, instead, to promote its \nbroader Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich language. However, even in that House \nlanguage, 501(c)(4) organizations were never barred from receiving \ncontracts.\n  So, Madam President, the intent of the Senate is clear throughout the \nevolution of floor votes on three bills, and the intent of the House is \nclear in two floor votes on a related provision. Neither body intends \nthat all 501(c)(4) organizations who lobby should be barred from \nreceiving Federal contracts. But because the earliest version of either \nbody's position on lobbying and grant reform was the one preserved in \nS. 1060 as cleared by the House, the clear intent of both bodies on \n501(c)(4) organizations is not reflected in that bill.\n  That is all we are proposing in our technical amendment today, that \nthis technical corrections resolution adjust S. 1060 to reflect the \nclear intent of both the Senate and the House, as expressed in the \nrelevant votes taken in both bodies.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] is correct. While we \nare pleased that the House passed lobbying reform legislation with the \noriginal Simpson-Craig language intact, we also believe that Congress \nwould want to take the opportunity, in the form of this technical \ncorrections resolution, to acknowledge the unique status of certain \n501(c)(4) organizations, as we did in our redrafted amendment to the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill and the second continuing \nresolution. We therefore submit our amendment to eliminate the terms \n``contracts'' and ``any other form'' to the Senate, trusting that the \ncorrecting language will more closely conform to the intentions of the \nCongress in passing our original amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is one additional provision in our amendment, at the \nrequest of the bill's managers, to simplify and expedite the process of \nhandling this resolution. This provision would correct, in section \n12(b)(1) of the bill, a cross-reference to the definition for \nrepresentation of a foreign entity. This same change was already made \nin section 12(c), and the change in section 12(b)(1) simply makes it \nconsistent and correct, clerically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3098) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be \nconsidered and agreed to, as amended, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the concurrent \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 116), as amended, was \nagreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18572-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORRECTION OF ENROLLMENT OF S. 1060\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 325 just received from \nthe House. \n\n[[Page S18574]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 325) to amend the Clean Air Act to provide for \n     an optional provision for the reduction of work-related \n     vehicle trips and miles traveled in ozone nonattainment areas \n     designated as severe, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, H.R. 325 is a short, simple bill that \nseeks to maintain our clean air standards while giving States greater \nflexibility in how they achieve them. It does this by removing the \nrequirement that the 14 cities in 11 States with severely polluted air \ndevise a program to reduce work-related travel by employees. But the \nbill reaffirms that those cities must still meet the health-based air \nquality standards contained in the Clean Air Act. Thus, these cities \ncan now develop alternative methods to achieve the goal of cleaner, \nhealthier air.\n  This is a narrow bill that responds to a particular problem by \ngranting States greater flexibility while, at the same time, \nmaintaining progress toward improving our Nation's air quality. I \nsupport both those efforts. Over the years we have learned that clean \nair will not be ours without careful vigilance.\n  There are some in Congress who would turn back the clock on our \nefforts to protect air quality. Those same people say we have gone \noverboard. That the health-based standards contained in the Clean Air \nAct are too difficult to achieve. That the time has come when we must \nrelax the laws and regulations that have been responsible for improving \nour air quality.\n  Well, I disagree. And the American people disagree. The Clean Air Act \nhas successfully delivered on its promises. Let me cite some examples.\n  In the 5 years since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, \nover half of the cities that did not then meet the air quality standard \nfor urban smog now meet that standard.\n  Over three-quarters of the cities that did not meet the air quality \nstandard for carbon monoxide in 1990 now meet that standard.\n  Emissions of toxic air pollutants have been reduced by 1.6 billion \npounds per year, more than six times the reductions achieved in the \nfirst 20 years under the original Clean Air Act.\n  Sulphur dioxide emissions, the principal cause of acid rain, have \nbeen reduced by 2.6 million tons since 1990.\n  And U.S. production of chemicals that deplete the stratospheric ozone \nlayer has been reduced by over 90 percent since 1990.\n  Despite these successes, we cannot rest on them. Nearly two-thirds of \nAmerican sampled in a poll this past summer believed that our current \nair pollution control laws are not strict enough.\n  So we must not weaken our resolve to achieve clean air. Nor can we \nput the special interests of some ahead of the public interest. Where \nwe can work together to develop better, more efficient and more \neffective ways of achieving our environmental goals, we should. That is \nwhat this bill does, and it is why I support it. But where there are \nefforts to roll back our standards, to weaken the protection of human \nhealth and the environment, then we must stand firm against such \nchanges.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise to support the passage of H.R. \n325, which was received from the House of Representatives this \nafternoon. As the original Senate sponsor of this bipartisan \nlegislation, I commend the distinguished chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for his support and prompt assistance in \nobtaining unanimous consent to take up and pass this measure.\n  H.R. 325 repeals a costly and bureaucratic mandate, known as the \nEmployee Trip Reduction Program [ETRP], which was imposed as part of \nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Under the law, States are \nresponsible for establishing the program in regions considered to be in \nsevere nonattainment for certain air pollutants. Individual employers \nin these areas must develop plans to show how their employees will curb \nautomobile use. Although this program was initially viewed as a means \nof encouraging ride-sharing and mass transportation in areas with \nsevere air quality problems, it has proven very complicated and \nexpensive to implement.\n  Some studies have set the cost of ETRP as high as $1,000 per employee \nannually, and the Environmental Protection Agency projected that it \nmight cost employers $1.2 to $1.4 billion nationwide. When \nCongressional Research Service looked at this requirement, the report's \nauthors estimated that ETRP would only reduce volatile organic \ncompounds by 0.5 to 0.8 percent over current levels. Moreover, the \nfailure to establish a plan and ensure employee compliance could expose \nbusinesses to fines as high as $25,000 per day.\n  Although I have serious questions about whether ETRP can be \nimplemented successfully, I must stress that this legislation does not \nremove the trip reduction program from the Clean Air Act entirely. \nInstead, it replaces the law's one-size-fits-all mandate with language \nmaking this program voluntary. In crafting this legislation, it was our \nspecific goal to leave the trip reduction program in place as a tool \nfor States to use in meeting their overall air quality goals. In this \nway, it would leave States the option of electing a car-pooling program \nwhen, and where, it will have the greatest benefits.\n  The measure was further amended in the House Commerce Committee to \nmake clear that states will still be responsible for achieving the \npollution reductions allotted for the ETRP program, and I believe that \nthis change will help to ensure that the environmental objectives of \nthe Clean Air Act are not weakened.\n  The need for this measure is clear. In the Philadelphia metropolitan \narea, the looming threat of a forced car pooling program earlier this \nyear sent hundreds of employers scrambling to establish ride-sharing \nprograms. For some firms in the Center City area where mass \ntransportation options are prevalent, such plans could be set up \neasily. Many companies in the surrounding counties or employers with \nirregular shifts, however, found that they could not meet the law's \nrequirements without taking costly and extraordinary steps to \nrestructure work schedules.\n  Thankfully, both the EPA and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shelved \nplans for implementing the ETRP before the law was to take effect. \nNevertheless, the law itself has remained in place, exposing all \ninvolved to the possibility of legal action to enforce its \nrequirements. Twice this year, Congress has passed legislation \ncontaining a prohibition on enforcement of the ETRP. By passing H.R. \n325, we will achieve a small measure of common sense regulatory relief \nand finally close the books on this unnecessary mandate once and for \nall.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his support of H.R. 325, and I look \nforward to seeing this measure signed into law quickly.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, H.R. 325 makes amendments to the Clean \nAir Act to fix a provision that has not worked. The 1990 Amendments \nrequired each State with a severe ozone nonattainment problem to adopt \nmeasures that would increase vehicle occupancy rates during the rush \nhour. Businesses and other organizations employing more than 100 people \nin nine major metropolitan regions were expected to encourage \ncarpooling and the use of mass transit to reduce the number of vehicles \ntravleing to and from work each day.\n  This provision of the 1990 Amendments was modeled on a program that \nwas being implemented in Los Angeles. As more and more employers have \nrelocated to the deep suburbs where mass transit is impractical and \nhave built large parking facilities for their workers, metropolitan \nareas have experienced a dramatic increase in the number of cars on the \nroad and the distances that commuters travel to their jobs. This \nincrease in trips and miles traveled has, to some extent, offset \ndramatic gains in emissions reduction that have been achieved through \ncatalytic converters and other pollution control devices on \nautomobiles. The employer trip reduction program was intended to \naddress this troublesome side of the air quality problem. \n\n[[Page S18575]]\n\n  But evidence accumulated since the 1990 Amendments were enacted \nindicates that ridesharing programs are not a cost-effective option in \nthe short-term to control air pollution. The effort necessary to \nconvince commuters to get out of their cars and into carpools or buses \nor trains is quite expensive compared to other steps that would achieve \nthe same emissions reductions in the short-term. It may be that over a \nvery long period, a requirement like this would convince major \nemployers to make locational decisions that encourage the use of \ntransit and other ridesharing options. But in the short-run, the \nemissions reductions achieved do not justify the great difficulties \nthat would be experienced by the States and by employers to carry out \nthe trip reduction program.\n  This requirement of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has engendered \nmuch opposition in the legislatures of the several States that are \nsubject to. EPA made it clear earlier this year that the Agency would \nnot aggressively enforce the requirements. And even in Los Angeles, the \nprogram that served as a model for the 1990 federal program has been \ndiscontinued. All seem to agree that this is a measure that should not \nbe mandated.\n  H.R. 325 does not entirely repeal the employer trip reduction \nprogram. It makes it voluntary with the States. It will remain as \npotential avenue for emissions reductions for the States that choose to \nuse it. And the bill does not rollback the Clean Air Act in any sense. \nAll States will continue to bear an obligation to achieve healthy air \nquality by the same deadlines that are currently in the law. The bill \nmakes clear that States that choose not to carry out the trip reduction \nprogram must find equivalent emissions reductions from other sources.\n  Madam President, we have a responsibility to act quickly to fix \nFederal programs, such as this one, that have proved unworkable. So, I \nhave urged that the Senate act on this bill immediately and send it to \nthe President without further delay. I would note that the National \nHighway System bill that the President recently signed corrected \nproblems with EPA regulations for the vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance program under the Clean Air Act. Where legitimate problems \nwith implementation of the Clean Air Act have been discovered, we are \nmoving to correct them.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 325) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/13/senate-section/article/S18573-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ROOSEVELT HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Res. 43) expressing the sense of \n     the Congress regarding Wei Jingsheng; Gudhun Choekyi Nyima, \n     the next Panchen Lama of Tibet; and the human rights \n     practices of the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection, to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, citizens all over the world are \nprotesting--and after all major Western countries have complained to \nthe Chinese Government--about the mistreatment of a courageous Chinese \ncitizen named Wei Jingsheng because Wei has spent most of his life \ntrying to bring democracy and decent human rights to his 1.2 billion \nfellow Chinese citizens.\n  In return, the Chinese Government has sentenced him to another 14 \nyears in a jail after a trial that lasted 6 hours and to which no \nofficials representing the United States Government were allowed to \nattend.\n  The Wei Jingsheng trial follows on the heels of last week's Communist \nChinese Government's announcement that for the first time in Tibetan \nhistory, Red China has selected a successor to the Panchen Lama, the \nsecond \n\n[[Page S18576]]\nhighest-ranking official in Tibetan Buddhism, His Holiness the Dalai \nLama being the No. 1, of course.\n  Madam President, these significant events deserve the attention of \nall Americans and other citizens around the world. Senate Joint \nResolution 43 is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution objecting to the \ntreatment of Wei Jingsheng, who, by the way, is known as the father of \ndemocracy in China. Senate Joint Resolution 43 expresses regret \nconcerning the Chinese Government's decision to name its own Panchen \nLama of Tibet for the first time in Tibetan history. The resolution \ncalls upon the United States Government to sponsor, and aggressively \npush for, passage of a resolution at next spring's meeting of the U.N. \nHuman Rights Commission condemning Red China's human rights record.\n  In drafting this resolution, I decided that it is important to \nhighlight both the plight of Wei Jingsheng and the Chinese Government's \ninvasion into the religious freedoms of the Tibetan people. Both \nissues--religious freedom and political freedom--are human rights \nissues and should therefore be linked.\n  This is not the first linkage of these two issues. In fact, when \nPresident Clinton and Jiang Zemin met in New York, it was emphasized to \nthe Chinese leader that it is imperative for China to make progress on \nthese two human rights issues. In fact, at that meeting, the Chinese \nwere requested to give special attention to the fate of Wei Jingsheng, \nand of other political prisoners.\n  Did the Chinese believe that charging Wei Jingsheng with attempting \nto overthrow the government and sentencing him to 14 years in jail was \nwhat was when the United States specified special attention? Of course \nnot; the Chinese actions are mere examples of the in-your-face attitude \nof the Beijing government.\n  Madam President, Senate passage of this resolution is vital. If the \nSenate fails to make a clear definitive statement protesting these \nactions, the Chinese will decide that the American people don't care.\n  That, of course, is simply not the case. If the U.S. Congress does \nnot act now on Wei Jingsheng's behalf, we will be forfeiting the \nopportunity to make a difference.\n  I further understand the Clinton administration is to decide in the \nnear future, whether the United States should support a China human \nrights resolution at the next meeting of the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission in Geneva. We have supported a China/human rights resolution \nfor the past 3 years.\n  This year should not be different. I encourage the President to think \nlong and hard about that decision. President Clinton has said over and \nover that the best way to pressure the Chinese on human rights issues \nis to pursue them in international arenas. The U.N. Human Rights \nCommission is an opportunity that should not be missed.\n  Some Senators maintain that quiet diplomacy will work better than a \ncongressional resolution. I differ. Since July, the United States \nCongress, and effectively the United States Government, have engaged in \nquiet diplomacy and has shied away from strong statements about events \nin China. Look where those efforts have gotten us on issues about which \nwe care deeply.\n  That brave young man fighting for democracy in Communist China and \nthat poor 6-year-old boy and his parents who have disappeared because \nhe was chosen as the next Panchen Lama of Tibet need our help.\n  I encourage Senators to support this resolution and say a prayer for \nall Chinese citizens who one day could be mistreated just as these \nyoung men have been.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, on Monday the distinguished chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee introduced Senate Joint Resolution 43 \nrelative to two recent moves by the central government in the People's \nRepublic of China which are of great concern to me as the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs: the formal charging \nand trial yesterday of Chinese human rights activist Wei Jingsheng, and \nthe selection by the central authorities in Beijing of a new Panchen \nLama. I am an original cosponsor of that legislation, and rise today to \nexpress my full support for it.\n  Wei Jingsheng is known as the father of the PRC's modern democracy \nmovement, and has spent a good deal of his adult life in prison as a \nresult of his beliefs. Wei was first arrested in the spring of 1979 for \nallegedly ``providing foreigners with confidential military information \nand engaging in activities which pose a threat to state security and \ndesigned to overthrow state power;'' the fact that the ``secrets'' had \nbeen previously published in a widely-circulated government journal was \napparently seen as immaterial. His true offense was participating in \nthe ``Democracy Wall Movement'' by penning a work entitled ``Diwu \nXiandaihua--The Fifth Modernization.'' That piece argued that the \nCommunist Party's ``Four Modernizations'' program--to modernize \nindustry, agriculture, science/technology, and the armed forces--would \nbe incomplete without a ``fifth modernization:'' democracy. In \naddition, he had circulated an article warning that Deng Xiaoping was \ndeveloping Mao-like dictatorial tendencies. For this, he was sentenced \nto a loss of political rights for 3 years and 15 years in prison of \nwhich he served 14\\1/2\\ years.\n  As part of its bid to host the 2000 Olympics, the PRC released a \nnumber of political prisoners in a quid pro quo attempt to influence \nthe choice of the selection committee. As a result, Wei was paroled in \nSeptember 1993 but was kept under constant surveillance since that \ntime. Upon his release he resumed his prodemocracy activities, writing \narticles and speaking with foreign journalists and government officials \nin support of democracy in China.\n  On April 1, 1994, just a few weeks after he had met with Assistant \nSecretary of State John Shattuck to discuss human rights in the PRC, \nWei vanished. While it was known at the time that he had been arrested, \nno warrant had been issued for his arrest; no formal charges were \ninstituted against him; members of his family were never notified of \nhis arrest or subsequent whereabouts, and the authorities would not \neven confirm he was being held. Inquires as to his status from \norganizations and leaders outside of China were rebuffed.\n  On November 21, of this year, 20 months after first being arrested \nand held without charge, the Xinhua News Agency announced that Wei was \nbeing formally charged with ``activities to overthrow the government.'' \nAlthough the exact nature of his ``crimes'' was left nebulous, the \ncharge carries the death penalty in the PRC. The PRC, which seems to \nhave learned a thing or two about public relations over the years, \nconveniently timed the announcement to occur after the completion of \nthe recent APEC meetings in Osaka, Japan, and after the announcement of \nthe 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for which Wei had been nominated; both \nevents would have provided an uncomfortable forum for international \ncriticism of the charges. Instead, they have until the next meeting of \nthe U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva next March to try and \nconvict Wei and the hope that any international uproar will die down.\n  A Xinhua report this last Sunday noted that Wei's trial would begin \ntoday (late yesterday, Beijing time) in the Beijing Intermediate \nPeople's Court. As of 48 hours before the trial was scheduled to begin, \nWei's attorney--Zhang Sishi--had still not received written notice of \nthe charges against his client, nor had he been allowed to meet with \nhim. Although it has been announced that the trial will be--somewhat \nuncharacteristically--``open,'' that means only that some of Wei's \nfamily members may be allowed to attend along with other individuals \npicked by the government. Late yesterday, after a 6-hour trial, Wei was \nsentenced to a 14 year term of imprisonment.\n  I am deeply concerned with the use of the Chinese criminal code to \nsilence those who peacefully advocate democratization and who exercise \ntheir rights to free speech. I am equally worried by the response, or \nshould I say lack of response, from the Clinton administration. \nCandidate Clinton was long on talk about Republicans ``coddling \ndictators,'' and how he would make human rights the foundation of his \nforeign policy. But as we have seen with so many other issues, he \napparently did not mean what he said; as far as I can tell, that \nfoundation is cracked. The Clinton administration has been slowly \nceding ground on this issue with the Chinese since he took office. \nInstead of high-level reactions to \n\n[[Page S18577]]\nthe Wei arrest and trial, I have seen only low-level, lukewarm, \nnoncommittal expressions of concern from Foggy Bottom.\n  In 1986, in a speech urging his fellow party leaders to take a hard-\nline on domestic critics of the government, Deng Xiaoping used Wei as \nan example:\n\n       Didn't we arrest Wei Jingsheng? We arrested him and have \n     not let him go, yet China's image has not suffered.\n\n  Whether Wei's predicament is to be a bargaining tool for the March \nU.N. meeting, or signals a shift towards the conservatives in the party \nhierarchy, President Clinton's lack of response at this time can only \nembolden China, and place at risk the freedom of others in the \ndemocracy movement such as student leader Wang Dan, activist Li Guotao, \ntrade unionist Liu Nianchun, academician Yuan Hongbing and religious \nactivist Xiao Biguang. All have disappeared in the last 2 years.\n  Turning to the issue of the Panchen Lama, it is a central belief in \nTibetan Buddhism that certain deities take human form in the bodies of \nimportant lamas to lead believers toward enlightenment. It is believed \nthat the souls of these lamas are reborn shortly after their deaths \ninto the bodies of newborn infants in order to continue their task on \nearth. Known generically as tulku, the two most important of these \nlamas are the Dalai Lama, the temporal and spiritual head of Tibet, and \nthe Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama is believed to be a reincarnation of \nthe Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light. Because he wields \nthe highest temporal as well as spiritual authority, the Dalai Lama is \nconsidered preeminent to the Panchen in the lamaist hierarchy.\n  Since the occupation of Tibet beginning in the late 1940's, the \nChinese have sought to coopt the Panchen Lama in an attempt to counter \nthe role and authority of the Dalai Lama. When the Chinese invaded \nTibet and overthrew the legitimate government, the Dalai Lama fled to \nnorthern India where he established a Tibetan government-in-exile. The \n10th Panchen Lama remained behind however, effectively becoming over \nthe years the Vidkun Quisling of Tibet, assisting the Chinese in the \n``peaceful liberation'' of Tibet. As reported in the November 11 \nedition of Xzang Ribao:\n\n       In March 1959, Tibet's upper-level reactionary clique \n     launched a counter-revolutionary armed revolt in a vain \n     attempt to undermine the motherland's unification. Great \n     Master Panchen [the Panchen Lama] immediately cabled Chairman \n     Mao and Premier Zhou [Enlai] to express his support for the \n     State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local \n     government and to quell the rebellion. At a rally held by \n     people of all circles of Xigaze [Shigatse], he urged all \n     monks, ordinary people, and patriotic people of Tibet to \n     clearly distinguish right from wrong and good from evil, to \n     draw a clear line between them and the reactionary clique, \n     and, under the party's leadership, to unite in resolutely \n     assisting the People's Liberation Army to quell the \n     rebellion. Since September 1987, a small number of separatist \n     elements have created disturbances and made troubles in \n     Lhasa, but the Great Master Panchen always maintained a firm \n     stand, held high the banner of patriotism, and unequivocally \n     and resolutely upheld the motherland's unification and \n     national unity.\n  He became a member of the Chinese-installed Communist government, and \nregularly called on Tibetans to submit to the new order. In frequent \nstatements he praised the new Communist government, and over the years \ngave legitimacy to the Chinese occupation. Although he apparently had a \nchange of heart at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, for which \nhe was jailed for nearly a decade, after his rehabilitation in 1978 he \ncontinued to refuse to back calls for Tibetan independence.\n  Since the death of the Panchen Lama in January 1989, observers have \nexpected a clash between the Tibetans and the Chinese over the choice \nof the lama's reincarnation. The reason is simple: this conflict is not \nsimply some arcane religious tussle, but is part of the ongoing \ncollision of interests over who really rules Tibet. For the first time, \nthe Chinese were presented with the opportunity of hand-picking and \nshaping in their own political image from his youth a traditional \nleader of the Tibetan people. With the prospect of grooming a credible \nand more compliant alternative leader for the Tibetan people, few \nbelieved that the Chinese would acquiesce to the rightful authority of \nthe Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy in the choice.\n  Soon after the Panchen's death, negotiations took place between the \ncentral government and the group charged with searching for his \nreincarnation, the monks of Tashilhunpo-- ``Mass of Glory''--Monastery \nin Shigatse, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama. The compromise \nreached provided that the monks would look for the reincarnate lama \nonly in China and Tibet, thus precluding a candidate being found among \nthe Dalai Lama's Tibetan supporters in exile in India. In return, the \nmonks were promised that they could use traditional procedures to \nselect the reborn lama.\n  A committee of monks from the Tashilhunpo began to search for the \nreincarnate lama by consulting religious oracles and searching for \nomens in the reflective waters of a lake high in the Himalayas. The \ncommittee then visited children in villages around the country who were \nreported to have certain physical and mental indications of being \nreincarnate. The committee spent more than 5 years examining various \ncandidates. As they finalized their choice, to the chagrin of the \nauthorities in Beijing word was leaked from the search committee to the \nDalai Lama of the identity of the candidates. This allowed the Dalai \nLama, who the Chinese for the first time had excluded from his \ntraditional role in the process, to act preemptively and announce on \nMay 14 that the search committee had found the reincarnation of the \nPanchen Lama in the person of 6-year-old Gedhum Chokyi Nyima in the \nTibetan village of Nagchu, Lhari District, north of Lhasa.\n  Their loss of control over the process infuriated the Chinese, who \ndenounced the proclamation in predictably Communist rhetoric. The \ngovernment press labelled the Dalai Lama's action ``splittist'' and \n``illegal and invalid,'' and condemned him for ``his vicious intention \nof disrupting Tibet's stability and undermining China's national unity \nthrough religious means.''\n  Having been beaten to the punch by the Dalai Lama, the Chinese \ngovernment attempted to regain the initiative. The Dalai Lama's \ncandidate disappeared, and is said by authoritative sources to be held \nunder house arrest in Beijing with his parents. Moreover, the Chinese \nlaunched an unprecedented media campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama \nand his choice, and to justify their brazen interference in the \nselection process. The complete irony of a secular atheist Communist \ngovernment completely usurping such a purely religious issue as the \nchoice of a reincarnated soul should be lost on no one. The Chinese \nhave spent years attempting to destroy Tibetan Buddhism as a remnant of \nthe ``feudal, oppressive past,'' and as a competitor to Communism; it \nis, after all, a central tenant of Marxist-Leninist thought that \nreligion is the opiate of the masses. Thousands of Buddhist monks and \nnuns have been arrested and imprisoned since the annexation of Tibet; \nthousands of monasteries and temples have been destroyed, and countless \nworks of religious devotion such as statues have been melted down or \nshipped out of the country. Yet the government in Beijing has devoted a \nsignificant amount of press and other resources to the reincarnation \nquestion. The cover and many of the articles in a recent issue of the \nBeijing Review were devoted to it; countless articles have appeared in \nofficial party newspapers such as Renmin Ribao. For example, for over a \nweek the front page of the party daily in Tibet, Xzang Ribao, carried a \nlengthy and detailed series called ``Questions and Answers Regarding \nthe Reincarnated Child of the 10th Panchen.''\n  The attacks have extended to the Dalai Lama himself. For example, a \nfour-part series on Lhasa Tibet People's Radio Network broadcast over a \nperiod of 4 days vilified His Holiness and exposed his so-called \n``crimes.'' He has suffered similar attacks from Gyatsen Norbu, the \nChairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government, the \nCommunist-controlled Executive Council of the Buddhist Association of \nChina, and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous \nRegion Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The official \nmedia have also done everything to slander and tarnish the Dalai Lama's \nchoice for Panchen, including accusing the boy's parents of having bad \nreputations among their \n\n[[Page S18578]]\nneighbors, and the boy of killing a dog by drowning it--an thoroughly \nun-Buddhist act.\n  The amount of coverage the issue has received in the communist media \nhas reached the point of overkill, even for the Chinese press, and has \nrisen to the level that it indicates that the government in Beijing \nbelieves that if they repeat something enough it will eventually become \nthe truth. I am reminded of the line from Act III of Shakespeare's \n``Hamlet'', which I paraphrase: ``The government doth protest too much, \nmethinks.''\n  Coincident with the increase of official propaganda, the Chinese \ncontinued to try to regain control of the process. In September the \nChinese ousted Chadrel Rinpoche--the head abbot of the Tashilhunpo \nMonastery and head of the search committee--and replaced him with their \nown candidate, Sengchen Lobsang Gyatsen. Chadrel Rinpoche is believed \nto be in detention with several other noncompliant monks from the \nmonastery. Three new names for finalists --Gyaltsen Norbu of Nagchu, \nTsering Wangdu of Nagchu, and Ngawang Namdrol of Lhasa--were then \nidentified by the Chinese government, which announced that the finalist \nwould be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn, a procedure used \nonce in 1792 by a Qing dynasty emperor. Chinese television showed State \nPresident Jiang Zemin meeting with the monks remaining on the \ncommittee, urging them to complete their work as soon as possible in \norder to ``ensure stable development in Tibet.''\n  On November 6, the Chinese government convened a meeting of senior \nlamas at the Jingxi Guest House in Beijing to finalize the selection \nprocess. On November 10, Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee \nof the Central Political Bureau and Chairman of the National Committee \nof the Chinese People's Consultative Conference, addressed the meeting \nand gave it its marching orders. At the end of November, the Chinese \nchose 6-year-old Gyaltsen Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama; he was \nenthroned in Lhasa on December 8. In its haste to put the official \nimprimatur on the child, the Chinese brushed aside the several years of \nmonastic training usually afforded a candidate before his enthronement. \nSenior monks were required to attend the ceremony at Lhasa's Jokhang \nCathedral, and those supportive of the Dalai Lama and feigning illness \nin order to avoid attendance were warned on the consequences of such \naction. State Councilor Li Tieying oversaw the ceremony, delivering a \nmessage from Jiang Zemin for the boy to ``safeguard the motherland and \nwork in the interests of the people.'' In reply, the boy reportedly \nresponded by ``express[ing] his gratitude to the central government, \nPresident Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and representatives of the \nState Council * * * and saying that he loves the motherland [China] and \nthe Tibetan religion.''\n\n  The blatant interference in a purely religious Tibetan affair is of \ngreat concern. Without getting bogged down in a detailed and somewhat \nesoteric discussion of the historical precedents, let me just outline \nsome of the objections to the Chinese position. First, it completely \nignores the Dalai Lama's centuries-old right to participate actively in \nthe choice of the Panchen Lama. By eschewing the Dalai Lama's \ntraditional role, the Chinese are completely flouting the historical \nprecedent they claim they are upholding. The confirmation of either the \nDalai or Panchen Lama is not complete until mutually recognized by the \nother. Chinese scholars, whom the government is so fond of quoting, \nhave previously reiterated this requirement. For example, Ya Hanzhang, \nin his Biographies of the Tibetan Leaders Panchen Erdeni, wrote:\n\n       By Tibetan tradition a reincarnation of the Panchen could \n     not be religiously legal without the Dalai's recognition, and \n     the same was the case with the Dalai.\n\n  Thus, the exclusion of the Dalai Lama renders the validity of \nBeijing's choice void ab initio.\n  Second, for the first time in history it puts the Chinese government \nin the place of the Dalai Lama. In the past, Beijing's role was one \nlimited to nominal approval of the selection already made by the \nTibetans. There existed a unique relationship between the high lamas of \nTibet and the Chinese imperial court; it was called ``priest-patron.'' \nThe Chinese emperors looked to the lamas as spiritual advisers. In \nreturn for that advice, the Chinese offered gifts to the high lamas and \nmilitary protection to the region. Therefore, any involvement by the \nChinese in the choice of a Dalai or Panchen Lama during the Qing \ndynasty, under Emperors such as Kangxi and Qianlong, stemmed not from a \ndesire to dictate the outcome from Beijing but because those Emperors \nwere fervent followers of Tibetan Buddhism.\n  Mr. President, I can already predict with certainty the Chinese \nreaction to this joint resolution. The Foreign Ministry is sure to \ndeclare both issues solely within the purview of China's internal \naffairs which are, ipso facto, none of the rest of the world's \nbusiness. In fact, in response to world criticism of the Wei arrest \nShen Guofang, the Ministry spokesperson, has already stated:\n\n       The case of Wei Jingsheng is not a human rights affair. On \n     the contrary, it is those people and organizations who try to \n     interfere in China's judicial procedures that have actually \n     violated international standards by interfering in China's \n     internal affairs.\n\n  Rather than rehash this old human rights/internal affairs song and \ndance, then, let me take a new approach an give the PRC another reason \nwhy these issues are important to us and should, consequently, be \nimportant to them. The Chinese have made a great deal of noise lately \nabout being allowed to assume their rightful place among important \npowers on the world stage, and have complained vociferously that the \nWest is unfairly trying to prevent them from that place.\n  I and several of my colleagues have tried to make it clear to Beijing \nthat there is not some organized plot attempting to keep them from \ndoing so. Rather, what we have emphasized to them is that a place at \nthat particular table is not a right free for the taking, but a \nprivilege which comes with it a panoply of responsibilities. Foremost \namong those is to adhere to international norms of conduct and to \ntreaty and similar legal commitments.\n  If the PRC does not live up to its present commitments, then they can \nbe sure that the rest of the world is going to be hesitant to enter \ninto any others with it; and the problem is, they are not. Beijing says \nthat it is fully living up to all its obligations. However, as the \nChinese are fond of saying, words are fine but only if followed up by \ndeeds. An examination of their deeds, unfortunately, shows that these \ndo not match their words. In the case of Wei Jingsheng, the maximum \namount of time a criminal suspect can be detained without charge is \ntwelve months; yet he was held for over twenty. China is a signatory to \nthe universal Declaration of Human Rights, yet the handling of Wei's \ncase clearly violates Article III of that document. Finally, the \nlanguage of the Xinhua announcement of the charges against Wei noted \nthat his actions ``were in violation of the criminal law and \nconstituted crimes;'' an article in the December 11 Beijing Review \nnotes that his actions leading to this arrest ``[were] in violation of \nthe Criminal Law and constitute crimes.'' This, and the fact that his \ntrial took only 6 hours, seems to me to indicate that his guilt had \nbeen determined long before his trial began. This presupposition of \nguilt also runs counter in international standards of justice.\n  As for the Panchen issue, the PRC's constitution guarantees freedom \nof religion and freedom from being discriminated against on the basis \nof religious belief. Yet thousands of Tibetans have been persecuted for \ntheir religious faith over the years. Moreover, Beijing's manipulation \nof the selection of the Panchen Lama is clear meddling in a purely \nreligious issue for political gain, and violates the religious rights \nof believing Tibetans. Similarly, as Senator Feinstein mentioned \nyesterday in a meeting of the full Foreign Relations Committee, she has \nbeen repeatedly assured over the years by officials in the highest \nlevels of the Chinese Government that Tibet ``is entitled to manage its \nown cultural and religious affairs.'' The actions regarding the Panchen \nLama would seem to contradict that assertion.\n  Time and time again China calls into question its commitment to the \nrule of law and to international norms, whether it be in regards to \nagreements on intellectual property, the enforcement of international \narbitration awards, or the proliferation of nuclear or other \n\n[[Page S18579]]\nweapons. The cases of Wei Jingsheng and the Panchen Lama are just two \nmore unfortunate examples. If as a result the rest of the world is a \nbit reticent to enter into other agreements with the PRC--for example, \nthe WTO agreement--for fear that the Chinese will continue to say one \nthing but do another, then before it points the finger of accusation at \nus for denying it its ``rightful place'' in the world, it should \nrealize that it has no one to blame but itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senate Joint Resolution 43, and thank \nthe distinguished Chairman and ranking member of the Committee for \ntheir leadership on these important issues.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent the joint resolution be deemed \nread a third time, passed, the amendment to the preamble be agreed to, \nthe preamble as amended be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that the statements relating to the resolution be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 43) was deemed read the third time \nand passed.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas on November 21, 1995, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China formally arrested Wei Jingsheng, \n     who is known internationally as the father of the democracy \n     movement in China;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has held Wei Jingsheng incommunicado and without charge since \n     April 1994 and has rebuffed international calls to release \n     him;\n       Whereas Wei Jingsheng has spent all but 6 months of the \n     last 16 years in detention because of this unwavering support \n     for freedom of speech and the development of democracy in \n     China;\n       Whereas at an October 1995 meeting in New York between \n     President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China, the \n     Administration urged the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China to release political prisoners and specifically \n     included Wei Jingsheng and others among such prisoners;\n       Whereas the treatment of Wei Jingsheng by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China raises concern over the future \n     of other jailed dissidents in China, including Wang Dan, a \n     student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement in China;\n       Whereas on May 14, 1995, His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     announced recognition of 6-year-old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as \n     the next Panchen Lama;\n       Whereas recognition of the successor to the Panchen Lama in \n     Tibet has always been within the authority of the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas for the first time in Tibetan history, the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has imposed on \n     Tibet its own candidate for a new Panchen Lama and has \n     rejected the new Panchen Lama selected by the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family have been \n     missing for 6 months and are reported being held \n     by authorities of the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China;\n       Whereas Chatrel Rinpoche, who is the head of the original \n     search committee for the new Panchen Lama and who refused to \n     denounce the Dalai Lama's selection of the new Panchen Lama, \n     is also missing and believed to be held by authorities of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the Panchen Lama is one of the highest-ranking \n     religious official of Tibetan Buddhism;\n       Whereas the rejection of the Dalai Lama's selection of \n     Panchen Lama by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China, and the selection of its own candidate for Panchen \n     Lama, is seen by many Tibetans as politicizing a purely \n     religious affair and as a violation of fundamental Tibetan \n     human rights;\n       Whereas since the invasion of Tibet in 1949, the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China has taken any expression by \n     the Tibetan people of their distinct religious or cultural \n     identity as a direct challenge to that government's political \n     control of Tibet;\n       Whereas Chinese officials have repeatedly maintained that \n     the Tibet Autonomous Region is entitled to manage its own \n     cultural and religious affairs, and the intervention of \n     Chinese government authorities in the selection of the next \n     Panchen Lama is a clear violation of that principle;\n       Whereas for 3 consecutive years, the United States has been \n     a primary sponsor of resolutions criticizing the human rights \n     practices of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     in China and Tibet at the annual meetings of the United \n     Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva;\n       Whereas these resolutions call upon the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China to take measures to ensure the \n     observance of all human rights, invite that government to \n     cooperate with all special rapporteurs and working groups, \n     and request the Secretary General of the United Nations to \n     prepare a report for the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission on the human rights situation in China and Tibet;\n       Whereas at the March 1995 meeting of the United Nations \n     Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the resolution lost by \n     only 1 vote;\n       Whereas it is important to maintain international pressure \n     on the Government of the People's Republic of China in order \n     to induce that government to respect internationally-\n     recognized standards of human rights; and\n       Whereas in May 1994, the President of the United States \n     pledged strong support for efforts at international forums to \n     criticize the human rights practices of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     United States Government should--\n       (1) press for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     Wei Jingsheng and other political prisoners by the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China;\n       (2) urge the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to respect the wishes of the Tibetan people by supporting the \n     selection of the new Panchen Lama by His Holiness the Dalai \n     Lama;\n       (3) work to ensure the safety of the new Panchen Lama as \n     selected by the Dalai Lama; and\n       (4) sponsor and aggressively push for the passage of a \n     resolution regarding the human rights situation in China at \n     the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission in Geneva scheduled for March 1996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
