Mr. President, a week ago Friday, just prior to the \nrecess, I introduced in the Senate, along with the cosponsors, Senator \nByrd from West Virginia, Senator Campbell from Colorado, and Senator \nHeflin from Alabama, a piece of legislation called the NAFTA \nAccountability Act. I want to talk briefly about that this morning. I \nunderstand that the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, will come \nto the floor and also provide some discussion about it.\n  Not many people know what NAFTA is. It is an acronym that describes \nthe North American Free-Trade Agreement. Not many people know much \nabout it or much about how it affects them, their lives, or their jobs. \nBut it is a significant piece of trade legislation that had its 2-year \nanniversary, or second birthday, about a week or so ago.\n  It is time for the Congress, when you pass legislation like NAFTA, to \nstop and assess its impact and decide whether it did what it was \nadvertised to do. \n\n[[Page S 17514]]\n\n  A week ago today I drove to the Canadian border, a border town named \nPortal, ND, between North Dakota and Canada, along with some farmers. \nOne of the farmers, Earl Jensen and his wife, brought along a 1984 \norange International grain truck with 240 bushels of hard red spring \nwheat, and we drove to the Canadian border last Monday.\n  A number of other farmers came along and they brought some durable \ngoods, dry goods, clothes, a clothes washer, several cases of beer, and \nsome other products to try to understand what you could get into Canada \nunder this North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  All the way to the border that morning we were meeting these \nsemitrucks, double tandem semitrucks, filled with Canadian grain, \ncoming south. We knew they were filled with grain because as they came \nsouth--and there was a pretty good wind--the grain came up against the \nwindshield as these huge semitrucks came whipping on by us going south.\n  We arrived at the Canadian border and Earl drove up with his orange \ntruck filled with 240 bushels of hard red spring wheat and told the \nCanadian Customs that he was going to take the truckload of United \nStates wheat to Canada to sell at a country elevator.\n  We know that millions and millions of bushels of Canadian wheat are \ncoming across our border, coming south, truckloads, every single day. \nBut Earl was stopped at the border and told, ``You cannot take that \nwheat into Canada. You must have an end use certificate.''\n  Well, Earl Jensen and his wife sat in his little orange truck. They \ndid not have an end use certificate. It turns out you have to get one \nfrom Canada. If you apply, you cannot get one because you cannot sell \ngrain at a country elevator in Canada because you are hauling United \nStates grain.\n  The fact is millions of bushels of wheat pour south from Canada into \nthe United States, and Earl Jensen and his wife cannot drive north to \nCanada with 240 bushels of hard red spring wheat.\n  Why is that important? It demonstrates the problem of unfair trade on \nthe border. A fellow who brought three cases of beer felt, because \nthere was a flood of barley coming south, you can turn barley into beer \nand take the beer back in cases. He learned you cannot take three \ncases, you can take one, and if you stay more than 24 hours you have to \npay duty, $12.50 duty, on a case. Another fellow discovered the \ncombined duty was over 20 percent for his products.\n  Why do I take time to describe this? We have problems on the border. \nWe have a free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that is \nfundamentally unfair to our country. It is called NAFTA.\n  I want to describe what has happened in our own country with the \ntrade deficits. I know you might think this chart is upside down, but \nit is not. The red represents trade deficits. You can see in this \ncountry we had trade surpluses through a series of trade acts, and then \nwe had the Trade Reform Act in 1974, Tokyo round, the Uruguay round, \nNAFTA, and now GATT.\n  Look what has happened. We will have a larger merchandise trade \ndeficit in this country than a fiscal policy deficit. There is a lot of \nnail biting and wrist wringing about the fiscal policies deficit, and \nthere should be. The budget deficit is a serious problem. But the trade \ndeficit is larger and a more serious problem for this country.\n  What has happened with respect to Canada and Mexico? Well, we have a \ntrade deficit with Mexico now as a result of NAFTA, or at least partly \nas a result of NAFTA. Prior to negotiating a trade agreement with \nMexico and with Canada, we had decent trade numbers with Mexico. We had \nnearly a $2 billion surplus.\n  Now, 2 years later, after 2 years of the trade agreement with Mexico, \nwe will probably have--this says $15 billion; it is probably a $16 to \n$18 billion deficit. Let me say that again: We will have gone from a $2 \nbillion surplus to a $16 to $18 billion deficit after 2 years of a new \ntrade agreement with Mexico.\n  The situation is similar with Canada. There we started with a \ndeficit. Now that deficit is nearly going to double. Some of us believe \nthat this country ought not continue to get taken advantage of and get \nthe short end of the stick on trade issues.\n  I mentioned the Canadian problems. At least from the standpoint of \nsomeone who represents a rural State, the major problems are \nagricultural. A flood of grain is coming into our country, undercutting \nprice, undercutting our family farmers. Yet, you cannot get one little \norange truck across the border going north with 240 bushels of grain. \nThat is the fundamental unfairness of the situation at our border up \nnorth with respect to grain.\n  What is the circumstance at the border down south? What we have down \nsouth, as one Presidential aspirant described it a couple years ago, is \na giant sucking sound of American jobs heading south. There is no \ndisagreement about the impact of the deficit that we now have with \nMexico. It means wholesale movement of American jobs to Mexico.\n  We have introduced legislation in the Congress called the NAFTA \nAccountability Act. It was introduced in the House and the Senate as of \na week and a half ago. It has, I believe, 32 original cosponsors in the \nHouse. We have four in the Senate and we intend to add to that.\n  We say we want a couple of things to happen. We want to set a date \nfor withdrawal from NAFTA unless certain conditions are met. If NAFTA \nis fixed and the conditions are met, that is fine. If it is not, we \nshould withdraw from this trade agreement.\n  We do not need a trade agreement that someone calls free that is not \nfair to our country. That is the circumstance we have now.\n  At least we should require some balance in trade. Should we have a \n$30 to $35 billion trade deficit with our two neighbors? Of course not. \nWe also have big problems with Japan and China and others. I understand \nthat. But a trade agreement as a result of the Canadian Free-Trade \nAgreement and the North American Free-Trade Agreement that leaves us \nwith $30 to $35 billion combined deficit, is that in our country's \ninterest? Of course not. We ought to change it.\n  Our Accountability Act also deals with trade deficits. There ought to \nbe some balance. When that balance is thwarted, then you ought to \ndecide to kick in some measures, tariffs if necessary, to come to some \nsort of balance in trade between our countries.\n  We ought to deal with currency exchange rates. When you negotiate \naway a 10-percent tariff with Mexico and then you have a 40-percent \nchange in the value of the peso, what have you done? What you have done \nis injured the interests of the United States.\n  We would provide for some remedy to the agricultural trade \ndistortions. We would also require the certification of progress in a \nrange of other areas. There are eight conditions all told.\n  Let me describe why a number of us have decided to offer this \nlegislation. When NAFTA was debated in the Congress, here was the \npromise: The promise was more than 220,000 new American jobs.\n  Well, we had economist after economist around this country doing work \nfor the business groups, the Clinton administration and others, who \nwanted this to be passed in the Congress. They all made these wild-eyed \npromises about all these new jobs in our country.\n  Well, take a look at what has happened. It is projected this year not \nthat we will have 220,000 more jobs in our country but that, in fact, \nwe will have lost about 220,000 jobs as a result of NAFTA.\n  Let me show you one of the promises. One of the leading studies that \nwas done was a study called the Hufbauer-Schotts study, and everyone \nused it in the House of Representatives and Senate in debate. Mr. \nHufbauer, the study's economist, said there would be 130,000 new \nadditional jobs in 5 years in the United States. That was the promise.\n  Here is the reality. The same fellow who made that promise of 130,000 \nnew jobs in the United States, now says in April of this year, 1\\1/2\\ \nyears later, ``The best figure for the jobs effect of NAFTA is \napproximately zero. The lesson for me is to stay away from job \nforecasting.'' Gary Hufbauer, Wall Street Journal, April 17.\n  There is an update, October 26: ``The surging trade deficit with \nMexico has cost the United States 225,000 jobs.''\n  I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional minutes. \n\n[[Page S 17515]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The same fellow who predicted massive quantities of new \nAmerican jobs with this trade agreement is now saying not only has that \nnot happened, but the trade deficit with Mexico has cost us 225,000 \njobs.\n  You have seen some of the press stories in this country about what is \nhappening. Fruit of the Loom is closing six plants, laying off 3,200 \nworkers. Where are many of the jobs going? To low-wage countries, \nincluding Mexico. That is what NAFTA has been--an opportunity, a \nmagnet, for jobs that used to be here but now go there.\n  Tri-Con Industries is moving its car seatcover plant, 200 jobs, to \nMexico. Ditto Apparel, Colfax, LA, lays off 215 workers. Says the \nfellow from Ditto Apparel, ``I'm telling you, NAFTA and GATT are the \nnails that are going to be in the coffin of the apparel industry in \nthis country.'' They are laying off 215 workers.\n\n  I wanted to show my colleagues, in the Record today, what has \nhappened just with automobiles, because we were told that any jobs that \nwould go to Mexico as a result of the agreement would be low-skilled \nlow-wage jobs. The fact is different. Take a look at automobiles. Our \ndeficit with Mexico is from automobile parts, electronics, electronic \nparts. This is the result of high-skilled jobs that used to be in this \ncountry. Take a look at automobiles. This is an example of what you \nread in the papers that leads people to the wrong conclusion.\n  In 1993, just before NAFTA, we exported nearly 3,000 cars from the \nUnited States to Mexico. Now we export nearly 18,000 cars from the \nUnited States to Mexico. If you simply read that figure, people would \nsay look, we have gone from 3,000 automobiles manufactured in the \nUnited States, exported to Mexico, to 18,000. That is a sixfold \nincrease. How on earth can you describe that as anything but progress?\n  Let me show you the rest of the story. The imports of automobiles \nmade in Mexico to the United States, sent to the United States, has \ngone from 237,000 to 405,000. So, what you see is a nearly 180,000 \nincrease in automobiles manufactured in Mexico, sent into our market to \ndisplace automobiles that used to be made here. That is the rest of the \nstory. The story on automobiles is a dismal story of failure, of jobs \nleaving America, going to Mexico.\n  We have introduced legislation in the Congress, not because we do not \nvalue our relationship with our neighbors, not because we believe there \nshould never be free trade agreements, but because many us believe our \ntrade agreements have undermined the American economy, have actually \ncreated conditions that attract American jobs to go elsewhere, have set \nup circumstances to weaken the American manufacturing job base. We do \nnot think that is in this country's interests.\n  One can hardly look at the graphs that I have shown today, especially \nthis chart, the chart of what has happened in American trade, that \nshows an alarming trend of ever-increasing deficits, sufficient so that \nin this year the merchandise trade deficit in this country will exceed \nthe budget deficit in fiscal policy. We are going to talk a lot about \nthe deficit, and we should. But we also want to talk a lot about this \nred ink. This is red ink that can only be repaid by a lower standard of \nliving in this country.\n  You can make a case--not a very good one, in my judgment--that the \nfiscal policy budget deficit is money we owe to ourselves. Because the \ndebt is so unequally distributed that is probably an unfair comparison. \nBut, you cannot make the case with the trade deficit that is money we \nowe to ourselves. It is not. It is money we owe to others, others who \nlive outside of our country, and which will be repaid, inevitably, \nthrough a lower standard of living in our country.\n  That is why this is a crisis. There are many other areas of trade we \nmust deal with--China, Japan--to mention a few. But NAFTA, the most \nrecent trade agreement has now resulted in a circumstance where we are \nbeing smothered with a combined trade deficit with our two closest \nneighbors. It does not make any sense. Our country ought to insist on \ntrade policies with other countries that are fair.\n  When I speak of this and when others on the floor of the Senate speak \nof this, immediately the editorial writers and others call us \nxenophobes and isolationists and folks who want to build walls of \nprotection around our country. Not at all.\n  I want our country to be able to compete. I want our businesses to be \nlean and able to compete all around the world. But I want the \ncompetition to be fair. I do not want someone who starts a factory in \nSouth Carolina or North Dakota or Colorado or New York to have to \ncompete against someone else who has a factory in Malaysia or Indonesia \nthat is hiring 14-year-olds, paying them 14 cents an hour, working them \n14 hours a day. That is not fair competition and it is not competition \nwe should aspire to be involved in.\n  The same is true with respect to Mexico. I do not expect our \nproducers and our workers in our country to be able to compete against \na country that devalues its currency by 40 percent, that has \nsubstantially different enforcement on air and water pollution, \nsubstantially different enforcement on the hiring of children, a \nsubstantially different wage base than ours, where the minimum wage is \nso much below that in the United States. I do not expect that is fair \ncompetition for any producer in our country.\n  I want our trade agreements to stand up for the economic interests of \nour country. I just do not want trade agreements any longer to be \nnegotiated with other countries in which we do not require that the \nrules of trade, the rules of exchange between our countries be fair. \nWhen we fail to require that circumstance, then in my judgment we \nweaken our country.\n  When Earl Jensen and his wife, in a little orange truck, drove to the \nCanadian border a week ago today, I watched the Canadians at the \nCanadian customs say to Earl and his wife, ``You cannot bring 240 \nbushels of hard red spring wheat into Canada,'' despite the fact I have \nseen truckload after truckload of Canadian wheat come into our country, \nEarl and his wife have every right to be upset about a trade agreement \nthat is unfair.\n  When you go to the southern border of our country and you see a \ncompany that can hardly afford not to move its manufacturing plant to \nMexico because of lower wages, because of less strenuous enforcement of \npollution standards and child labor standards, you understand what has \nhappened on the southern border is unfair as well--unfair to the \nAmerican workers and unfair to the American manufacturers who stay \nhere.\n  We must, it seems to me, ask Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, each of them, when they negotiate trade agreements, to \nstand up, finally, for the economic interests and the economic well-\nbeing of our country; not to protect us against real competition, but \nneither should they subject us to unfair competition that we cannot \npossibly expect to win.\n  That is the reason a number of us have introduced legislation, hoping \nit will lead to a thoughtful debate about the values of the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. We think it needs to be changed because \nwe think it does not at this point represent the best interests of our \ncountry.\n  Changing it does not mean we do not believe in freer trade or we do \nnot believe in expanded or open trade. It simply means we believe there \nought to be required fair trade rules between countries with which we \nare engaged in day-to-day commerce and exchange.\n  As I indicated, Senator Byrd from West Virginia will, I believe, \ntoday be making some comments about this legislation. We will be, now, \ncirculating among the Members of the Senate, a ``Dear Colleague,'' \nseeking cosponsors. There are four of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nwho have introduced this legislation and we hope for bipartisan support \nof this legislation so we can have a thoughtful trade debate in the \nmonths and the years ahead.\n  I would like to make one additional comment. I introduced an \namendment a couple of weeks ago, that was defeated on the floor of the \nSenate. I am going to introduce it again at some point, I feel so \nstrongly about it. We not only have trade rules that are so unfair, we \nhave a tax law, a tiny little thing, that says to companies: If you \nclose your manufacturing plant in America and move that plant and its \njobs to a tax haven country and then \n\n[[Page S 17516]]\nmake the same product and ship it back to America, we will give you a \ntax break. It is called deferral.\n  The company that stays here and makes a profit, pays income taxes. \nThe company that leaves here, makes the same product and makes a profit \nand ships it back here, pays no taxes unless they repatriate the \nprofit. As long as they keep the profit in that foreign plant, they \nnever pay taxes in the United States. That is a loophole that ought to \ngo, a loophole that says if you move jobs outside the country we will \ngive you a tax break. If we cannot close that tax break, we cannot ever \nclose a tax break in the Internal Revenue Service Code.\n  Although I was unsuccessful in an amendment to close that loophole, I \nintend to offer it again in coming Congresses, during this Congress and \nthe next Congress, in the hope that one day we can begin to change the \nlaws, both taxes laws and trade laws, that I think augur against the \ninterests of those who invest here, those who build manufacturing \nplants here, and, yes, those who work in those plants who expect us to \nhave at least the rules of trade and the rules of the Tax Code be fair \nto American interests.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his \nindulgence, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Are we in morning business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to proceed then as in morning \nbusiness for a period of up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17513-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17516-S17517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENDING AMERICAN SOLDIERS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as the President tonight begins the process \nof trying to convince America that we should put American soldiers' \nlives at risk on the ground in Bosnia, I think it is appropriate to \ntake a look at some of the other foreign policy activities of this \nadministration in the terms of what they represented as being when they \noriginally proposed it and what has occurred in reality.\n  Probably the most significant example of this administration \npresenting a policy in one form and having it executed in another form \nis today being seen in Haiti. When the President decided to go into \nHaiti--and he did this on a unilateral action, as much as his policies \nin Bosnia so far have been unilateral--he stated to us that the purpose \nof this was to restore democracy, to put back in place the elected \nleader of a government that had been replaced by a military coup of \nsorts, and to allow the nation of Haiti to reestablish economic \nstrength and have the capacity to pursue a peaceful and democratic and \neconomically prosperous future.\n  He told us that our troops would be there briefly and that the cost \nwould not be excessive. I think we need, however, now to take a look at \nwhat has actually happened in Haiti, whether or not the policies of the \nadministration as represented have actually come to pass.\n  First, let us look at the issue of who they have put back in power in \nHaiti, Mr. Aristide. Has Mr. Aristide turned out to be a democratic \nindividual? I think it would be hard to put that identification on him. \nHe has been an individual who has had a history of being violently \nanti-American, of being a proponent of Marxist philosophy, of being an \nindividual who has historically proposed the use of violence against \nhis political enemies.\n  Did he change his way when he was put in as President by us as a \nnation, using our military? It does not appear he has. In a meeting \nwhich took place--it was not a meeting, it was a ceremony of mourning \nfor a person who had been unfortunately killed by violence in Haiti--\nabout a week and half ago, Mr. Aristide called on his supporters to use \nviolence. This is the President of the country, someone who has been \nput in place by American forces, someone who is protected by American \nsoldiers, calling for the use of violence against the citizens of his \ncountry, mob violence against the citizens of his country.\n  As might be expected, the people of Haiti responded to this call from \ntheir President for mob violence with mob violence. It is estimated \nthat many people died, maybe as many as 11; homes were burned, looting \noccurred, and the streets were on fire. The words that he used to \ncounsel this violence were reported as being, ``Go to the neighborhoods \nwhere there are big houses and heavy weapons, and retaliate against the \nbig men,'' inciting the mob to violence. That is the leadership of the \nindividual who we have put the American imprimatur of authority on, who \nthis White House has chosen as their leader in Haiti.\n  Has he also accepted the fact that elections should occur in \nDecember? We are not sure of that. In another recent meeting just a few \ndays ago, there was a nonbinding resolution put forward by his \nsupporters which called on him to remain in office beyond the election \nfor another 3 years. Such action would be inconsistent with, should he \nundertake it, the constitution, which he is allegedly functioning under \nin Haiti, which says he cannot succeed himself, and his term is up in \nFebruary.\n  What was his response to that nonbinding resolution which was put \nforward by his own people and which you have to presume he laid a hand \nin authoring, at least his people did, with his countenance? He said to \nthe delegates, ``If you want me for 3 years, I will walk with you. I \nthink what you think,'' a pretty clear statement that he has no great \ninterest in the elective process or in his own Constitution, which he \nis allegedly sworn to support.\n  In addition, of course, the election, which is coming up on December \n17, is a fraud and has been made so by President Aristide's party. Four \nof the five opposition parties have decided not to participate. We know \nthat it is going to essentially be a nonelection election, the purpose \nof which will be simply a ballot-box-stuffing event for the \nconfirmation of the Aristide party.\n  The opposition parties have been crushed both through mob violence \nand through use of a controlled press, and there is very little in the \nform of what anyone would arguably call democracy occurring in Haiti \ntoday. And at what price has this occurred to the American taxpayers \nand American military?\n  First off, as I said, we have used our military to basically prop up \na dictator in Mr. Aristide. In doing that, we have undermined, in my \nown estimation, the credibility of American military force, which is \nnot supposed to be used for the purposes of promoting dictatorships but \nclearly is.\n  In addition, it is costing us, the taxpayers of this country, \napproximately $2.2 billion, or at least that is the best number we can \nestimate. I think personally that is low, but that is still a lot of \nmoney. And $2.2 billion is all the taxes that are paid by the folks \nthat I represent in New Hampshire in any given year. Somehow I think \nthose folks would have preferred to have their money go to better \nschools or better environment or better roads somewhere in our country, \nthan to go into the coffers of Mr. Aristide in Haiti.\n  What has that $2 billion purchased the people of Haiti? It has \npurchased them Mr. Aristide back in power, that is correct, but not a \ngreat deal more. In fact, as a result of the policies of this \nadministration, we put in place sanctions, which was a mistake to begin \nwith, as I said earlier, when they were put in place, sanctions which \nended up terminating essentially the private sector in Haiti. The loss \nof jobs was dramatic; tens of thousands of jobs which were in the \nprivate sector which existed in Haiti were lost as a result of the \nsanctions.\n  Have we seen those jobs restored? Has there been a return to \ndemocracy, to a market economy in Haiti? Has there been any expansion \nof the private sector in Haiti? Marginal at best. In fact, Mr. \nAristide, who prior to being put back in power as a celeb in residence \nof this administration when he was here in Georgetown, stated rather \naggressively his views that he believed \n\n[[Page S 17517]]\nin a socialist approach to government and since being the President has \nrefused to privatize a number of the state-controlled activities which \nit was understood he was going to privatize as part of getting the \neconomy going again. And so not only were the jobs lost, and they have \nnot been re-created, as a result of the sanctions, we are seeing an \nadministration in Haiti which has accomplished very little in the \neffort to create a market force in Haiti. So all in all, it is not a \ngreat success story.\n  But what is really of significant concern--even I think should be of \nconcern for the American people as we go down the road toward the \nBosnian debate--is the gap between what was represented was going to \nhappen and what was represented would be and what has occurred, the gap \nbetween how Mr. Aristide was defined by this administration and who he \nreally is, which is dramatic, the gap between what then was told to us \nwas going to cost us and what it eventually has cost us, the fact that \nwe may have American soldiers on the ground there well past February \nwhen we are supposed to have them out, another example.\n  And so, as we move down the road on the decision on Bosnia, I think \nthe American people have the right to ask the serious and difficult \nquestions of this administration and to be a little suspicious of the \nanswers and presentations as to what this administration's views and \ndecisions are in Bosnia.\n  We just recently read--I did not read it, but we heard synopses of a \nbook published by Robert McNamara, who was the Secretary of Defense \nunder John Kennedy and under Lyndon Johnson, and who now states rather \nopenly that he knew the war in Vietnam was wrong, that it was a mistake \nfrom a public policy standpoint, but that because of the need to \nprotect, basically, the political position and ego of the Presidency, \nthey continued to pursue the war in Vietnam--truly one of the more \ndisconcerting revelations to come forward from a leader of this \ncountry, certainly in this half century, but I suspect a very accurate \none.\n  Maybe we should put a new term in the American language called \n``McNamaranism.'' That is when you pursue a policy which you know is \nsubstantively wrong but you pursue it because of the political need or \nthe need of the ego or the need of the presentation of the Presidency \nto the people. You pursue it not because you know it is right \nsubstantively, not because you know it is going to correct a problem \nwhich you think is there, but because you know, as a member of the \npolicymaker at the highest level in Government, that if you do not \npursue it, you are going to put at risk the President's imprimatur of \nauthority, his personal leadership role or his reelection efforts.\n  McNamaranism--I think that is a term that we should start with and we \nshould identify. Clearly, McNamaranism occurred in the early sixties. I \nthink a form of McNamaranism has occurred in Haiti. We pursued a policy \nin Haiti not because we knew we were going to correct that country. We \nknew that country was going to continue to have serious economic \nproblems and serious political problems no matter what we did, because \nit has had those problems a long time and we do not have the \nwherewithal to change that culture unless we are willing to essentially \ntake that country over and dominate it for years, something we tried to \ndo from 1919 to 1935 and failed to do during that period. So we know it \nwill take longer than that length of time, which is when we last \noccupied that country.\n  But we went into Haiti because this administration had a political \nneed to go into Haiti, to be quite blunt. There were certain forces \nwithin the constituency which support this Presidency who demanded \nunequivocally that we go into Haiti, and they were effective in making \ntheir case. So it was a political decision to go into Haiti, even \nthough substantively we knew we were not going to correct the \nsituation, and we are now seeing the result of that.\n  McNamaranism struck us in Haiti. Let us hope that McNamaranism does \nnot strike us in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, November 21, the Presidents \nof Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia initialed a peace plan to end the \nfighting in Bosnia. The peace plan, if implemented and enforced by the \nparties would result in Bosnia being governed by two entities, the \nMoslem-Croat Federation, which would have jurisdiction over 51 percent \nof the territory, and the Serb Republic, which would have jurisdiction \nover 49 percent of the territory. Sarajevo will remain a united \ncapital, which would fall within the territory of the Moslem-Croat \nFederation, along with its Serbian-held suburbs.\n  On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council voted to lift economic \nsanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and also to lift the arms \nembargo against Bosnia and the other Yugoslavia Republics. The lifting \nof sanctions will only take place after the peace agreement is signed \nin Paris and Bosnian Serb military forces are redeployed behind a zone \nof separation.\n  The Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia followed up the \ninitialing of the peace plan in Dayton by forwarding identical letters \nto President Clinton vowing the support of their governments to the \nimplementation and enforcement of the peace agreement and guaranteeing \nthe security of NATO peacekeeping troops.\n  However, not less than a week after Balkan leaders initialed this \npeace agreement, the Bosnian Serbs, led by Radovan Karadzic have \ndemanded the renegotiation of the provisions regarding the future of \nSarajevo. While in Sarajevo, Serbs residents are protesting the peace \nagreement that would place their neighborhoods under the control of the \nMoslem-Croat Federation. Along the Dalmation Coast, Croats are \nprotesting the turnover of land in exchange for land along a Posavina \ncorridor that would provide better security. Moslem-led Bosnian army \nsoldiers entered a United Nations base in the Bihac enclave, manned by \nBangladeshi peacekeepers and took equipment, including vehicles. There \nwere also reports that Croat forces were burning and looting homes in \nnorthwestern Bosnia that is scheduled to be turned over to the Serb \nRepublic.\n  Mr. President, on November 8, the House and Senate leadership met \nwith President Clinton to discuss the situation in Bosnia and the \nstatus of the negotiations in Dayton. At that time, I advised the \nPresident that I felt he had not convinced the American public, nor the \nCongress, that it was in the national interests of the United States to \ndeploy United States military forces to implement or enforce the Bosnia \npeace agreement. I also advised the President that convincing the \nAmerican public and Congress rested on his shoulders--the President \nneeds to come before the American public and make his case.\n\n  The President has not yet convinced the American public, nor the \nCongress, that the United States has an interest in securing, or \nensuring, the implementation or enforcement of a peace agreement in \nBosnia. He has not convinced the American public or Congress that \nEuropean nations in the region where the fighting has taken place, and \nwho would be directly affected if the fighting were to cross the \nborders of Yugoslavia, need the support of United States military \nforces.\n  As a world leader, the United States should exercise its leadership \nby asking the European Community why it does not view it to be their \nresponsibility to secure, or ensure a lasting peace in Bosnia; if \nnecessary, why they do not employ the necessary military forces, as \nPresident Clinton has pledged to do, to implement the peace agreement.\n  I respect the constitutional prerogatives of the President, as \nCommander in Chief, to exercise his authority to deploy U.S. military \nforces. However, the Congress has a constitutional responsibility to \nbalance his check. As a Senator and the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I have a responsibility to ensure that a thorough \nand public national debate takes place.\n  I support the North Atlantic Alliance and believe that the United \nStates should remain engaged in, and show leadership in NATO. I believe \nthat the \n\n[[Page S 17518]]\nUnited States has obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty. I also \nbelieve that the American public and Congress are willing to use U.S. \nmilitary forces to defend U.S. national security interests.\n  In an effort to convince the American public and the Congress, \nPresident Clinton will address the Nation this evening to defend the \nUnited States-brokered Bosnia peace agreement and describe America's \nnational or vital security interests which warrant the need to deploy \nUnited States military forces to Bosnia. In short, he needs to convince \nthe public and Congress that it is the proper course of action for the \nUnited States to deploy troops to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that President Clinton make the case \nfor United States involvement in Bosnia to the American public and gain \ntheir support before any United States military forces are deployed to \nBosnia. The President must be clear about United States objectives in \nBosnia and the risks involved. The decision to deploy U.S. military \nforces and the length of time spent in the operation should not be \nbased on Presidential politics. The decision to send U.S. military \nforces has to be based on clear and achievable objectives and goals, \nand a developed exit strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17517-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17518-S17520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDRESS OF PRESIDENT FIDEL V. RAMOS OF THE PHILIPPINES AT THE EAST WEST \n                           CENTER IN HONOLULU\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the Record the \nstatement of the distinguished President of the Philippines, Fidel V. \nRamos, on the topic of ``Regional Cooperation and Economic Development \nin the Philippines.'' President Ramos delivered the statement last \nmonth as part of the First Hawaiian Lecture Series at the East West \nCenter in Honolulu. The presentation was part of the ongoing efforts of \nthe East West Center to provide a badly needed platform for prominent \ngovernment and business leaders to comment on relations in the Asia-\nPacific region. In this endeavor, the East West Center, Mr. President, \nhas no equals. For the past 25 years it has been the nerve center for \nbringing together opinion leaders, as is evident from President Ramos' \npresence.\n  Mr. President, I offer President Ramos' speech as a matter of great \ninterest to the Members of this body. We need to know what our best \nfriends think of our foreign policy. Clearly, the Philippines, and \nPresident Ramos especially, are good friends, good partners, and strong \nallies of the United States.\n  In his statement, President Ramos makes an observation regarding the \ndirection of U.S. foreign policy that should not be ignored. In a few \nwords, he tells us not to trust old conventions or concepts that are \nout of place in the post-cold-war environment. Instead, he says, and I \nquote:\n\n       The United States must redefine its concept of national \n     security in economic and cultural terms. Like the rest of us, \n     America's place in the future world will be determined just \n     as much by the creativity of its workpeople and the daring of \n     its entrepreneurs as by the devastating power of its weapons.\n       Since virtually all of its trade deficit comes from its \n     East Asian commerce, the United States is looking for a new \n     sense of fairness in its economic relationships with the \n     Asia-Pacific region. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. \n     security umbrella--and the rich U.S. market--have enabled \n     East Asia to prosper. Now American leaders argue that \n     Americans must see their country as sharing in this \n     prosperity--if American taxpayers are to continue supporting \n     their country's continued security engagement in the region.\n       We of the Philippines have no problem at all with this \n     proposition--particularly since we do not regard economic \n     competition as a winner-take-all or zero-sum contest. In the \n     economic competition, everybody wins--and even the relative \n     ``loser'' ends up richer than when he started.\n\n  I have selected this passage from the text of the speech because it \ncharacterizes what I perceive to be the attitude of our Asian-Pacific \npartners toward expanded trade.\n  I agree with President Ramos: There is a new post-cold-war \ncompetition. We, the United States, cannot afford to distance ourselves \nfrom regional and global participation any more than we had assumed the \nheavy burden of regional and global security during the cold war. \nEconomic competition, like trade, tightens relationships, fosters \ncultural understanding, and generally produces all winners, even though \nthere may be short-term losses.\n  President Ramos knows what he's talking about. The trade ties between \nour countries are strong, with the Philippines ranking as our 26th \nlargest export market. In addition, the U.S. stock of foreign \ninvestment in that country stands at nearly $2 billion. Although this \ninvestment has been in manufacturing and banking in the past, the \nrestoration of such former United States military installations as \nSubic Bay to the Philippines has opened still newer, mutual trade \nopportunities. Today, U.S. cargo shippers are developing major staging \nand warehousing facilities there, contributing to our increased trade \nposition in the region.\n  The Philippines is emerging as a reliable place for Americans to do \nbusiness. In July 1991, the Government set in motion a major program \nfor the reduction, restructuring, and simplification of tariffs. Its \ngovernment procurement program does not discriminate against foreign \nbidders. The Philippines has excised from its books preferential rates \nfor export financing for domestic companies and is a signatory to the \nGATT Subsidies Code. After some disagreements with the United States on \nintellectual property protection, the Philippines is drafting new \nlegislation on trademarks, copyrights, and patents that promise to be \nworld class. The importance of the Philippines intellectual property \nchanges should not be underestimated. The country is largely dependent \non imported technology. Today, much of that comes in the form of \ncomputer disks, tapes, and other media with embedded software. This \nsoftware provides computer-based routines for manufacturing, education, \nmedical, and other applications of technology essential to national \ngrowth. Indeed, much of this software comes from my own State of Utah. \nWithout appropriate protection of their property, exporters of \ntechnology would be very reluctant to market it abroad.\n  While there are some deficiencies remaining in the country's trade \nstatutes, we should commend the Philippines for their rate of progress \nin the past 5 years alone.\n  Clearly, the pace at which the Philippines is entering the world \ntrade arena will establish it as a competitive and worthy partner of \nwhich all fair trade countries will want to take notice. For these and \nthe reasons stated earlier, I commend the balance of President Ramos' \nremarks to the Record and ask unanimous consent that the entire speech \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      America's Role in East Asia\n\n(Address of H.E. President Fidel V. Ramos, before the East-West Center, \n                           October 16, 1995)\n\n\n                    introduction and theme statement\n\n       From your vantage point here on these lovely islands, even \n     to doubt whether the United States will remain an Asia-\n     Pacific power seems no less than ridiculous.\n       But perspectives shift with longitude--and I must tell you \n     that concerns about America's staying power--specifically, \n     concerns about the strength of the U.S. commitment to \n     intervene in future regional crises--are beginning to \n     preoccupy most countries in East Asia.\n       Over this past generation, the regional stability \n     underwritten by the United States has given our countries the \n     leisure to cultivate economic growth. Now the fear is \n     widespread among them that the United States is turning \n     inward--that it will revert to the isolationism which has \n     characterized its foreign policy throughout much of its \n     history.\n       I must add that we of the Philippines believe the United \n     States will remain in the Asia-Pacific--and not out of \n     altruism, but in its own interest.\n       You more than any others realize how the tilt of U.S. \n     population away from its Atlantic Coast, the influx of Asian \n     migrants, and the attraction of East Asian trade and \n     investments have made your country a true Asia-Pacific power.\n       And so it cannot afford to leave the Asian Continent in the \n     hands of a single dominant power--any more than it could \n     tolerate Western Europe's being in the same situation.\n       America's role in East Asia is my topic here this \n     afternoon. Let me summarize the four points I wish to make \n     before I elaborate on them:\n       First--over the foreseeable future, the United States must \n     continue to be the fulcrum of East Asia's balance of power.\n       Second--economic competition between the United States and \n     East Asia is not ``winner-take-all'' but a game both sides \n     can win. \n\n[[Page S 17519]]\n     A vigorous American economy is just as good for East Asia as it is for \n     Americans themselves.\n       Third--now that political values have become just as \n     important as traditional security concerns and economic \n     interests in the relations between countries, I ask you not \n     to underestimate the power of America's democratic ideals to \n     help shape East Asian political systems.\n       Fourth--America's military hegemony in the post-cold war \n     period gives it the historic opportunity to bring political \n     morality to international relationships--to shape a moral \n     world order. And this is a chance America must grasp--before \n     it slips away.\n       Now let me take up these four points one by one.\n\n\n               fulcrum of the east asian balance of power\n\n       Over these last 50 years, the sustained United States \n     presence in East Asia--and its willingness to mediate East \n     Asia's conflicts--have ensured there would be no repetition \n     of the Korean war--and that the Vietnam war ``dominoes'' \n     would fall the other way.\n       By interposing itself between the Chinese civil war \n     protagonists across the Taiwan Straits, the United States \n     presence enabled Beijing and Taipei to cool off their \n     enmities--and in fact to cooperate in the South China growth \n     triangle with Hong Kong. The United States has also acted as \n     a buffer between Japan and China--and between them separately \n     and the Soviet Union.\n       The cold war's end has not ended the usefulness of the \n     American presence. Over the foreseeable future, the United \n     States must continue to be the main prop of the East Asian \n     balance of power--if only to preserve the bubble of stability \n     that keeps East Asia's ``economic miracle'' going.\n       In this role, the United States has no competitor. Its \n     military presence is--uniquely--acceptable to all the powers \n     with legitimate interests in the region.\n       Over the future we contemplate, Russia's energies will be \n     directed inward--to problems at home--and to relationships \n     with its commonwealth neighbors in the former Soviet Union.\n       Meanwhile, fifty years after the Pacific war, Japan has \n     neither completely reconciled with East Asia nor decided on \n     its new role in the region.\n\n\n             CHINA WILL BE EAST ASIA'S MOST SERIOUS CONCERN\n\n       China--over these next 25 years--by the World Bank's \n     estimate--will become the world's largest economy. Over this \n     next quarter-century, China will unavoidably press--\n     politically and militarily--on East Asia, even if Beijing \n     made no effort to build up its capability to project power \n     beyond its strategic borders.\n       How China exercises its political and military clout must \n     concern us all. (The opposite possibility--of China's \n     economic collapse and its reversion to ``Warlordism''--is, if \n     anything, even more alarming.)\n       The allies in Western Europe solved a roughly similar \n     problem by integrating postwar Germany into the European \n     Union. So must we endeavor to integrate China into the Asia-\n     Pacific Community--economically through the Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation [APEC] and politically through the Asean \n     Regional Forum [ARF]--if we are to have lasting regional \n     stability.\n       Only with America's help--only with America's leadership--\n     can this be carried out successfully.\n       China and the United States--the ``Elephant'' and the \n     ``Whale,'' Walter Lippmann once called them--one a land--and \n     the other a maritime-power, so that their interests were not \n     antagonistic but complementary.\n       But, today, the elephant is learning to swim: China is \n     building itself a blue-water navy. Since the collapse of the \n     Soviet Union, America's political and military dominance has \n     been unchallenged. Is China gearing up to become the only \n     counterforce to United States hegemony in the post-cold war \n     world?\n       Over these past 15 years or so, China has set aside its \n     historical grievances, its ideological mission and its \n     geopolitical ambitions in its pursuit of economic growth. \n     Will it return to these causes once its economic growth is \n     assured?\n       China's encroachment into mischief reef--part of our \n     Kalayaan (Freedom) group of islets in the Spratlys--should \n     warn us that China claims nearly two million square miles of \n     land in adjacent countries; and that it also has unresolved \n     territorial or maritime disputes with Russia, India, North \n     Korea, Tajikistan, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and \n     Indonesia--any one of which could spark off a local conflict.\n\n\n                       Containment or engagement?\n\n       How are we--its neighbors--to deal with China?\n       The debate rages between those who urge ``containment''--\n     after the way the west restrained an expansionist U.S.S.R. in \n     the early years of the cold war--and those who believe \n     China's ``engagement'' into our peaceful network of economic \n     and political institutions to be the better course.\n       We in the Philippines believe we must apply one or the \n     other response as the emerging situation demands.\n       We must discourage any Chinese aggressiveness--yes--but we \n     must also encourage every trend that ties the Chinese economy \n     more tightly to those of its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific.\n       Obviously, we cannot approach today's China with \n     preconceived notions when this huge and complex country--a \n     civilization in itself--is in the middle of such an epochal \n     transition.\n       This is why the Asean states refuse to commit themselves \n     prematurely to the proposal for ``prepositioning'' United \n     States materiel.\n       This caution is partly a lesson remembered from the \n     colonial period--when the weak were wise to stay away from \n     the quarrels of the strong. But it also results from an \n     appreciation of the chance that the dismantling of the \n     American naval and air bases removes a potential provocation \n     to Asean's giant neighbor--and invites China to live-and-let-\n     live with Southeast Asia.\n       Meanwhile, even the reduced United States deployments close \n     to the Asean region are a counterweight enough in the \n     region's security balance.\n       Some say that, if Beijing should continue encroaching on \n     the South China Sea, then this aggressiveness will accelerate \n     security cooperation among the Southeast Asian countries--and \n     between them and the United States.\n       But, for the moment, the Asean states are betting that \n     interdependence and intensified cooperation will preempt the \n     rise of long-standing political antagonisms.\n       Economic interdependence may not by itself prevent \n     conflicts. But it does raise the cost--and the threshold--for \n     using force, especially among the great powers.\n\n\n                     japan, our other main concern\n\n       About Japan, we of the Philippines have two basic concerns. \n     The first is that the alliance between Japan and the United \n     States must be preserved; and the second is that Japan must \n     find a political role in the world proportionate to its \n     economic power.\n       Like all the other Southeast Asian countries, we want \n     Japan's alliance with the United States to continue--although \n     we now accept the alliance must be redefined into something \n     closer to a genuine partnership.\n       There is an inherent anomaly--similar to the original West \n     European effort to keep apart the two Germanys--in today's \n     Japan remaining a strategic client of the United States. This \n     can only fan an unhealthy kind of nationalism in a country \n     acutely aware of both its economic strength and its cultural \n     uniqueness--increasing the danger that the trade disputes of \n     the United States and Japan would spill over into their \n     security relationship.\n       The Philippines supports--within the context of United \n     Nations reforms--Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the \n     Security Council.\n       We see this as enhancing Japan's integration into the world \n     community. And we are reasonably confident Japan's political \n     role will be exercised on the side of peace--if only because \n     the Japanese people have suffered so much of war.\n       To sum up this section--we of the Philippines believe any \n     dilution of the American commitment to East Asian stability \n     will severely undermine regional confidence--put an end to \n     the region's economic miracle--and perhaps set off an arms \n     race that could have incalculable, tragic consequences for \n     all of us.\n       Let me now turn to the economic ties between the United \n     States and East Asia.\n\n\n                economic ties between u.s. and east asia\n\n       Economic interdependence among the Asia-Pacific countries \n     has largely been market-driven: Only now are the APEC \n     governments trying to manage it. And the key to the region's \n     tremendous growth has been the shift to free-market economies \n     among its democratic and authoritarian states alike.\n       Already the United States exports more to East Asia than it \n     does to its traditional markets in Europe and Latin America. \n     And East Asia's market is becoming even more attractive.\n       By the year 2000, the World Bank estimates that half the \n     growth in the global economy will come from East Asia alone. \n     In five years' time, one billion East Asians will have \n     significant consumer spending power; and of these, 400 \n     million will have average disposable income as high as their \n     European or American counterparts, if not higher.\n       This means the economic dimension to Asia-Pacific \n     relationships will be stronger than it is already.\n       Like the rest of us, the United States must redefine its \n     concept of national security in economic and cultural terms.\n       Like the rest of us, America's place in the future world \n     will be determined just as much by the creativity of its \n     workpeople and the daring of its entrepreneurs as by the \n     devastating power of its weapons.\n       Since virtually all of its trade deficit comes from its \n     East Asian commerce, the United States is looking for a new \n     sense of fairness in its economic relationships with the \n     Asia-Pacific region.\n       Over the past 30 years, the United States security \n     umbrella--and the rich United States market--have enabled \n     East Asia to prosper. now American leaders argue that \n     Americans must see their country as sharing in this \n     prosperity--if American taxpayers are to continue supporting \n     their country's continued security engagement in the region.\n       We of the Philippines have no problem at all with this \n     proposition--particulary since we do not regard economic \n     rivalry as a winner-take all or zero-sum contest. In economic \n     competition, everybody wins--and even the relative ``loser'' \n     ends up richer than when he started.\n       Since it takes two to trade, a strong American economy is \n     as good for us in East Asia as it is for you in America.\n\n[[Page S 17520]]\n\n       In sum--we do not want an underperforming, undersaving, \n     under-investing American economy any more than you do--if \n     only because a weakened American economy will trigger off \n     strong protectionist tendencies in the United States.\n\n\n         the U.S. as an influence on east asian democratization\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen:\n       Over the past half-century, a spacious sense of its self-\n     interest has impelled the United States to help shape East \n     Asian development--in fact, to make East Asian development \n     happen.\n       And this enlightened self-interest derives from the very \n     idea that is America. Its Founding Fathers saw their country \n     as a venture greater than just another national enterprise. \n     They saw their country as bringing a message of revolutionary \n     enlightenment to all humankind.\n       That revolutionary message has not lost its relevance-\n     particularly for East Asian people who--as they become richer \n     and more secure--are demanding respect from their rulers--and \n     a say in how they are governed.\n       Authoritian regimes may seek their legitimacy by sponsoring \n     capitalist growth. But economic development cannot--forever--\n     substitute for democracy. And it is to the idea of America \n     that East Asia looks--in its groping for freedom. Look at how \n     the Chinese student-militants of 1989 dared to raise a 30-\n     foot plaster model of the Statue of Liberty on Tiananmen \n     Square.\n       During the cold war, America was sometimes accused of a \n     cynical willingness to sacrifice democracy abroad to preserve \n     democracy at home. Now, at last, America can reconcile power \n     and morality in its foreign relations.\n       Despite a decline in its relative wealth, capacity and \n     influence, the United States today is the world's only \n     superpower. And it is at the cutting edge of a revolution in \n     both military technology and doctrine which promises to \n     preserve its military preeminence in the world for at least \n     another generation.\n       Because of its hegemonic power, America ``can afford the \n     luxury of attending to principle.''\n       America can be to the world what its founders meant it to \n     be--the ultimate refuge of all those ``yearning to breathe \n     free.''\n\n\n                worthwhile causes for american idealism\n\n       And--although the ideological challenge from messianic \n     communism has collapsed--there is no lack of worthwhile \n     causes for American idealism.\n       We are as far away from a stable--and moral--international \n     order as we were at the end of World War II. Far too many \n     regions of the world are still subject to regimes of varying \n     barbarism; while other national societies are disintegrating \n     in anarchy.\n       If only America can gather its resolve, it can also lead \n     the global community to begin dealing with the tremendous \n     income disparities among nations--and alleviating the mass-\n     poverty of regions like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n       Then there is the care and protection of the global \n     environment--a task so susceptible to the free-rider axiom \n     that it needs exceptional leadership to organize effectively \n     and equitably.\n       In these vital missions of reawakening America to its \n     historical role--and of propagating in the Asia-Pacific the \n     ideals and values America stands for--this center of \n     intellect and scholarship will continue to play an ever-\n     increasing role.\n       Throughout its time on Earth, humankind has been striving \n     for the ideal society. Unless we of the Asia-Pacific and \n     America embark on a win-win Direction, that ideal may forever \n     remain beyond our grasp.\n       But, if America remains true to its original sense of \n     revolutionary enlightenment, perhaps it can lead the world to \n     approximate that ideal: To banish pain and fear and hunger--\n     to bring a measure of peace and prosperity to every region--\n     to enable every nation to discover the extraordinary \n     possibilities of ordinary people.\n       Thank you and good day!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17518-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, I have \nintroduced legislation to reform the way property owners are treated by \nthe Government. My legislation would encourage, support, and promote \nthe private ownership of property by clarifying existing laws and \ncreating a more uniform and efficient process by which these rights are \nprotected. In short, it seeks to protect the rights of citizens as \nenvisioned by the Framers of the Constitution.\n  Recently, however, critics have misinterpreted some of the bill's \nprovisions. For example, some have stated that this bill would cost the \ntaxpayers billions of dollars to implement or that it would force the \nGovernment to pay polluters to clean up their act. These fears are not \nwarranted.\n  I was encouraged by an editorial in Salt Lake City's Deseret News \nheadlined ``Enough with half-truths about property rights bill.'' This \neditorial dispels the myths and misconceptions about property rights \nlegislation. I commend it to my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the editorial was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Salt Lake City Deseret News, Nov. 20, 1995]\n\n           Enough With Half-Truths About Property Rights Bill\n\n       Politicians and activists must think they are terribly \n     clever when they toss around inaccuracies and inflated half-\n     truths in order to win public sentiment.\n       Take, for instance, the attacks on Sen. Orrin Hatch's \n     omnibus Property Rights Act, which is set to break out of the \n     Judiciary Committee before Thanksgiving. In recent days, \n     critics, including President Clinton, have ranted about the \n     Utah's senator's attempts, through the bill, to force the \n     government to ``pay polluters'' to clean up their operations. \n     They have carried on about the bill's enormous costs to \n     government (some have placed the figure in the tens of \n     billions of dollars).\n       These are arguments certain to strike fear in the heart of \n     every sober-minded American concerned with the environment \n     and taxes--just in time for Halloween. Trouble is, they are \n     as hollow as jack-o'-lanterns.\n       Critics are conveniently overlooking this sentence in the \n     bill: ``The government is not required to pay compensation in \n     cases when the property is a nuisance.'' Whoops.\n       Polluters, by anyone's definition, are nuisances. If the \n     government can prove the item in question--say, a belching \n     smoke stack or a toxic waste dump--is a nuisance, it won't \n     have to pay compensation. No one will be paying polluters, \n     after all.\n       Critics also are overlooking, or perhaps ignoring, a study \n     recently released by the Congressional Budget Office showing \n     the bill would cost only up to $40 million annually, and then \n     only for the first few years. After that, costs would drop \n     because agencies would avoid actions that could lead to \n     protests by property owners. Whoops, again.\n       The bill is a reasonable attempt to clarify and solve a \n     conundrum as old as the republic. While the Fifth Amendment \n     prevents the taking of private property for public use \n     without compensation, government must retain the right to \n     pass regulations for the greater good of society.\n       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes set the current standard for \n     this balancing act in a 1922 Supreme Court ruling when he \n     said, ``. . . if regulation goes too far, it will be \n     recognized as a taking.''\n       Hatch's bill merely attempts to define ``too far,'' and it \n     would make the burden of protesting such takings less onerous \n     for the average citizen.\n       Horror stories abound of small-property owners who find \n     they can't build on their land because of wetlands or \n     endangered species regulations. Critics have tried to \n     diminish the impact of these stories, but they can't explain \n     away the witnesses who have testified of them at \n     congressional hearings. Environmental laws are indeed \n     important and necessary, but so are property rights.\n       So far, 18 states have passed similar compensation laws. \n     The House recently passed a bill that in some ways goes \n     farther than Hatch's version. It would compensate anyone \n     whose property was diminished in value by 20 percent, while \n     the Hatch version requires owners to prove a 33 percent loss.\n       No doubt, Congress eventually will pass a compromise \n     version of the two bills. When it does, the planet will not \n     spin off its axis.\n       The Hatch bill is not above reproach. For example, it would \n     prohibit agencies from entering private property without the \n     consent of the owner--a prohibition that could keep the \n     government from ever gathering facts about a nuisance.\n       Critics of the Property Rights Act should read it sometime, \n     rather than amusing themselves with strange fictions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17520-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17520-S17521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HE PUT OUR RIGHT TO LIVE OVER OUR RIGHT TO KNOW\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in early October John Scali died, the \nobituaries stated, of heart failure--which is interesting because John \nScali was a gentleman known by his friends as being ``good-hearted.'' I \nhad known John for many years in many ways and I never heard him boast, \neven once.\n  John Scali had a quiet greatness that carried him to a distinguished \ncareer as an honorable and objective journalist for ABC television, \nlater as an adviser to President Nixon, and then as successor to George \nBush as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  I first met John Scali during his and my television days; he with \nABC-TV in Washington and I with WRAL-TV in Raleigh. When I was elected \nto the Senate in 1972 John was one of the first to call. When I arrived \nin the Senate in January 1973 as a new boy on the block, I saw John \nScali more often. He stopped by many times, seldom for an interview but \nmostly as a friend.\n  There were a few lines in a few obituaries about John that deserved \nmore attention than they got concerning John Scali's remarkable \ninvolvement \n\n[[Page S 17521]]\nin pulling back the Soviet Union and the United States from what may \nhave been the brink of war in 1962.\n  Mr. President, John Scali kept this episode a secret, and at this \npoint, I shall bring to the Senate's attention a column by my longtime \nfriend, Max Freedman, himself an erudite gentleman whose very credible \nthoughts appear regularly in the Jewish Journal published in New York \nCity. At this point, Mr. President, let Max take over.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the Max Freedman column of \nNovember 24 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Jewish Herald, Nov. 24, 1995]\n\n            He Put Our Right To Live Over Our Right To Know\n\n                           (By C.H. Freedman)\n\n       The greatest tribute to John A Scali in his recent obituary \n     was that most readers had not been that familiar with him.\n       Such relative non-celebrity status was what made the former \n     ABC correspondent one of the noblest Americans ever.\n       Scali could have been a ``superstar'' journalist had he so \n     chosen. Next to him, such names as Cronkite, Donaldson, \n     Woodward and Bernstein would now be comparative bush leaguers \n     had he embraced the same ``journalistic ethic'' many of them \n     do.\n       Scali had what was arguably the greatest scoop of all time \n     during the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962--and forwent \n     it for the sake of America and civilization.\n       I recall the time all too vividly. With city-obliterating \n     Soviet missiles pointed at us and ours at them, and our next \n     day's very existence predicated on national egos and on two \n     posturing leaders' flashpoints, most of us were shaking in \n     our pre-L.L. Bean boots.\n       In the midst of this national trauma, the Washington-based \n     Scali unexpectedly received a call from one Aleksandr Fomin, \n     counselor of the Soviet Embassy. Fomin, whom Scali knew to be \n     the head of Soviet intelligence in this country, invited him \n     to lunch.\n       ``I'd already had lunch,'' recalled Scali, ``but his voice \n     was so urgent and insistent that I decided to go \n     immediately.''\n       At the Occidental Restaurant, almost in the shadow of the \n     White House, Fomin made an astonishing proposal.\n       ``After the waiter had taken our order,'' Scali recounted, \n     Fomin ``came right to the point and said, `War seems about to \n     break out; something must be done.' ''\n       Scali recalled answering, ``Well, you should have thought \n     of that before you introduced the missiles'' in Cuba.\n       ``There might be a way out'' of the impending conflict, \n     said Fomin. Suppose that ``we would promise to remove our \n     missiles under United Nations inspection and promise never to \n     introduce such offensive missiles into Cuba again? Would \n     President Kennedy be willing to promise publicly not to \n     invade Cuba?''\n       Scali judiciously replied that he didn't know, but was \n     ``willing to try and find out.''\n       To Scali's eternal credit, he forsook his journalism \n     ``ethic''--which, to many, demands such story be propagated \n     forthwith--and instead assumed the role of patriot. In the \n     days that followed, he became an unnoticed, unheralded \n     courier shuttling between the White House and the Soviets \n     until the crisis was peacefully resolved.\n       Not until 1964, when the lines in the sand were long since \n     washed away, did Scali go public with the story.\n       He received no great tributes then--or at any time since--\n     for the noble career sacrifice he had made two years earlier.\n       Imagine, especially if you're a devotee of what-if fiction, \n     what the scenario might have been if, say, Fomin had gotten a \n     steady busy signal on Scali's line and in his urgency called \n     one of the dozens of other such correspondents in Washington.\n       Not necessarily someone like Lyle Denniston of the \n     Baltimore Sun--who once told an interviewer that if he'd been \n     old enough for World War II he would have reported the atom-\n     bomb secret or the time and place of the upcoming D-Day \n     invasion; indeed, he boasted, he would have even stolen such \n     war-forfeiting information. ``They would have made good \n     stories,'' he explained.\n       No, Fomin needn't have reached a Lyle Denniston to risk \n     turning us into radioactive cinders; a much more moderate \n     practitioner of the craft would have done just fine--say, one \n     of the thousands of Denniston's colleagues who would never \n     publicly proclaim what he did, but who condone, if not \n     heartily approve of, his stance.\n       Such reporter would have solemnly agreed to Fomin's \n     request, finished lunch, smiled reassuringly as he or she \n     waved poh-kah (friendly, informal Russian ``goodbye'') to \n     Fomin, then established a world's record dash--not to the \n     White House, but to his or her newsroom.\n       There, a pious morality play would be staged by reporter \n     and editors: national security versus that pompously invoked \n     ``public's right to know!''\n       And don't you dare even think that we idealistic \n     journalists, in making such solemn decision, would consider \n     such crass things as instant personal fame, skyrocketing \n     circulation and the like.\n       But, blessedly, Fomin did not get that busy signal. And \n     thus did not turn to someone who would have broken the story \n     that, given the lost ``face-saving'' element, could well have \n     led to this city and others becoming Hiroshima II.\n       It's sad enough to note here that John Scali was never \n     given a fraction of the tribute he would have received had he \n     sold out his soul and America by breaking that story. But \n     besides being denied his moral due, he was treated shabbily \n     in a more direct way.\n       Based on Scali's expertise in international matters, in \n     1971 President Nixon appointed him special consultant for \n     foreign affairs and communications; two years later, Nixon \n     named him to replace George Bush as our representative to the \n     United Nations.\n       But when Gerald Ford assumed the presidency, he \n     unceremoniously dumped this man who had performed so \n     admirably at the post.\n       To be charitable toward Ford, such action demonstrated that \n     playing football without a helmet does indeed diminish one's \n     reasoning ability.\n       To be less charitable, it provided further insight into the \n     character of a president who owed his career and prominence \n     to conservatives--and showed his gratitude by choosing as his \n     vice president, the original ``Rockefeller-liberal \n     Republican,'' Nelson.\n       Had Scali, 33 years ago, embraced the ``ethic'' of many \n     journalists, there's an excellent chance Ford wouldn't even \n     have been around to take over the Oval Office in 1974; \n     indeed, there might not have even been an Oval Office. Or \n     much of a citizenry left to care about one.\n       That concept is probably beyond the capacity of Gerald \n     Ford. But maybe some less-dense influential Americans might \n     show belated appreciation to a newsman, John A. Scali, to \n     whom this scared-silly-in-'62 American, for one, feels \n     eternally grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17520-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

HUGH L. \n                                 CAREY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, of the many commemorative ceremonies \nheld on Veterans Day, November 11, one event had particular \nsignificance for the Honorable Hugh L. Carey, the former Governor of \nthe State of New York, and for his family and many friends.\n  More than 50 years ago, Hugh Carey, then a young officer with the \n``Timberwolves'' of the 104th Infantry Division, United States Army, \nled a patrol near the Elbe River in Germany. The patrol encountered an \nencampment of German soldiers who, unaware that Germany had surrendered \nseveral days earlier, were holding a large number of French prisoners. \nA fight broke out, and the Germans were overtaken by the American \npatrol. This capture by the American soldiers led to the discovery of \nsome 35,000 French prisoners, who were then freed by the Allies.\n  For his extraordinary valor in this mission, Hugh Carey was awarded \nthe Croix de Guerre with Silver Star, one of France's most esteemed \nmilitary decorations. Yet, owing to the unpredictabilities of war, he \nwas unable to attend the presentation ceremony for the Croix de Guerre.\n  Time passed, and Hugh L. Carey continued his service to his country. \nHe was ultimately discharged from active duty with the rank of colonel, \nand went on to serve as a Member of the House of Representatives and as \nGovernor of New York, raising 14 children with his late wife Helen \nalong the way.\n  Last Saturday, in a special ceremony at Dacor Bacon House here in \nWashington, Governor Carey finally got that medal. He was presented the \nCroix de Guerre with Silver Star by Brig. Gen. Gerard de Bastier on \nbehalf of the Republic of France. The decoration was given in \nrecognition of Governor Carey's ``outstanding services during the \noperations of the liberation of France.''\n  Earlier that day, Governor Carey joined President Clinton at the \ndedication of the site for the World War II Memorial at The Rainbow \nPool on The Mall. As vice chairman of the American Battle Monuments \nCommission, Governor Carey pursued the establishment of this memorial \nwith his usual vigor and unbounded enthusiasm. His commitment to the \nproject has been such that at one point he even telephoned this Senator \nabout it from his \n\n[[Page S 17522]]\nbed at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, where he was recuperating from \nback surgery. He later remarked to the New York Times that his back \ncondition was due to carrying an infantryman's rifle during World War \nII and the weight of the state budget on his back for two terms as \nGovernor.\n  So it was fitting indeed that on the same day that Governor Carey's \nefforts to honor veterans of the Second World War reached fruition, a \ngrateful ally took the occasion to honor him.\n  Mr. President, I salute my gallant friend Gov. Hugh Carey on this \ngreat and richly deserved honor, and I ask unanimous consent that the \ntribute by Brig. Gen. Gerard de Bastier and other material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Presentation of the Croix de Guerre With Silver Star To Governor \n                             Hugh L. Carey\n\n       On this Veterans Day, November 11, 1995, Governor Hugh L. \n     Carey receives one of France's most esteemed military medals. \n     Brigadier General Gerard de Bastier, Defense and Air Attache \n     to the French Embassy, presents Governor Carey with the medal \n     he earned more than fifty years ago for his valor in World \n     War II. Governor Carey is cited for this distinguished \n     military decoration for his efforts in leading a patrol to \n     free French citizens, imprisoned near the Elbe River by \n     German SS Guards, who were unaware that Germany had \n     officially surrendered days before, in May of 1945. Governor \n     Carey's patrol came upon the German soldiers and their \n     prisoners unexpectedly, and a fight broke out. After Governor \n     Carey's patrol overtook the group, they discovered many other \n     prisoners who had been held by Germany since the beginning of \n     the war. Encampments totaling thirty-five thousand French \n     prisoners, both military and civilians, were eventually found \n     by the Allies.\n       In 1939, Governor Carey enlisted in the New York National \n     Guard as a Private in the 101st Cavalry, Squadron C. As a \n     Major in the 104th Infantry Division, known as the \n     ``Timberwolves,'' he served as the S-3 in the Regimental \n     command of the 415th Infantry Regiment. The 104th Infantry \n     Division was the first American Division to land directly on \n     the European continent in Normandy without first going to \n     England. The 415th Infantry Regiment's debarkation at Utah \n     Beach began on September 7, 1944, while the other units of \n     the Division debarked at the Cherbourg harbor. Some of the \n     first duties of the Division included supplementing the Red \n     Ball Express to expedite the supplies to the front and to \n     guard the supply lines from Cherbourg to Paris.\n       Governor Carey served with the Timberwolf Division in its \n     hard fought, ten-month campaign across Northern France and \n     Holland, leading some of the first American troops across the \n     Rhine, and effected the liberation of the Nordhausen \n     concentration camp. A recipient of the Combat Infantryman's \n     Award and the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters, as well as \n     the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star, he left active duty \n     with the rank of Colonel.\n       After his distinguished service in World War II, Governor \n     Carey further served his country as a Member of the U.S. \n     House of Representatives and as Governor of the State of New \n     York.\n       Earlier today, President Clinton dedicated the site for the \n     World War II Memorial to be built on the Mall in Washington, \n     D.C. Governor Carey is a Commissioner of the American Battle \n     Monuments Commission, and he has been an ardent supporter of \n     the memorial, recently approved by Congress. Governor Carey \n     has represented the United States at events commemorating the \n     50th anniversary of the end of World War II. His family, \n     friends, and colleagues salute Governor Hugh L. Carey for the \n     honor he receives today from the Republic of France and for \n     his exceptional contributions to the United States of \n     America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                Remarks of Brig. Gen. Gerard de Bastier\n\n       Governor Carey, Governors, Commissioners, ladies and \n     gentleman:\n       Today is the date of a very important anniversary in the \n     memories of our nations, which gives a special meaning to \n     this ceremony taking place right after the dedication of the \n     World War II memorial site.\n       It is a great honor and privilege to be with you today to \n     honor Governor Carey in recognition of his outstanding \n     service during World War II.\n       I would like to start by saying a few words about Governor \n     Carey's career.\n       You were born in Brooklyn, maybe just a few years before \n     me! And were graduated from St. Johns' University Law School \n     with the degree of juris doctor.\n       In 1939, you enlisted as a private in the 101st Cavalry of \n     the New York National Guard. You were later sent to Europe \n     with the 104th Infantry Division known as the Timber Wolves. \n     This division was the first American division to land on the \n     European Continent without first going through England.\n       After your exceptional campaign in France, you had an \n     outstanding career in civilian and political areas, and you \n     served on various boards.\n       Finally, in 1993, President Clinton appointed you to the \n     American Battle Monuments Commission, and I should also \n     mentioned that you represented the United States at various \n     ceremonies commemorating the end of World War II.\n       The ties between our two countries have always been strong \n     despite our differences, and we have been together, along the \n     road since your revolutionary war. Last month, we celebrated \n     together the battle of Yorktown with the names of General \n     Rochambeau and Admiral De Grasse engraved in our memories.\n       I was born in 1945, and did not witness the war, but my \n     childhood was filled with stories from my parents recounting \n     the time when the U.S. military headquarters were set up near \n     their house in Marseilles, after the U.S. landing on the \n     Riviera (the ``Cote d'Azur'').\n       Governor Carey, you were in Europe in 1944, fighting for \n     the freedom of our nations.\n       The Timberwolf division fought during a ten-month campaign \n     across Northern France and Holland, leading some of the first \n     American troops across the Rhine, and liberated the \n     Nordhausen concentration camp.\n       You earned this esteemed military decoration for leading a \n     patrol to free French citizens imprisoned near the Elbe River \n     by German SS guards, who were unaware that Germany had \n     officially surrendered days before, in May of 1945. Your \n     patrol came upon the German soldiers and their prisoners \n     unexpectedly, and a fight broke out.\n       After your patrol overtook the group, you discovered many \n     other prisoners who had been held by Germany since the \n     beginning of the war. Encampments totaling thirty-five \n     thousand French prisoners, both military and civilians were \n     eventually found by the allies.\n       For these actions, you received the combat infantryman's \n     award and the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster.\n       For some unknown reasons, you never received officially the \n     citation awarding you of the Croix de Guerre with Silver \n     Star.\n       This ceremony is a testimony to the long friendship between \n     our two countries, and it is a great honor for me to present \n     now this award to you.\n       Today, Colonel Hugh Carey, on behalf of the French defense \n     minister, I am presenting to you the medal of the Croix de \n     Guerre with Silver Star, in recognition of your outstanding \n     services during the operations of the liberation of France. \n     (Paris, le 1er Avril 1946).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     The Croix de Guerre 1939-1945\n\n       The War Cross 1939-1945 (Croix de Guerre 1939-1945) was \n     instituted on September 26, 1939 as a decoration for the \n     Second World War. The decoration was conferrable on officers, \n     noncommissioned officers and men of the Armed Forces, \n     citizens of France and foreigners, who had been mentioned in \n     dispatches for acts of exceptional bravery, and in special \n     cases, also on military units, towns and civilians.\n       The Cross is a Maltese Cross in bronze with crossed swords \n     between the arms of the cross. The obverse medallion bears \n     the symbolic female head of the Republic with the legend \n     ``Republique Francaise'' (The French Republic), and the \n     reverse medallion bears the date ``1939'' or sometimes \n     ``1939-1945''. The Cross is worn on a red chest riband with \n     four green stripes, which according to the nature of the \n     dispatch, is provided with a palm in bronze or a star in \n     bronze or silver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17521-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17522-S17524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONCERNING LONG-TERM DEFICIT IMPLICATIONS OF REPUBLICAN TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just prior to the Thanksgiving recess, \nthe Republican conferees for the budget reconciliation bill agreed to a \n7-year deficit reduction plan that included a tax cut purporting to \ncost $245 billion. The Democratic conferees were excluded from all \ndeliberations of the conference.\n  I have previously expressed my concern about tax cuts of this \nmagnitude in the face of annual deficits and the accumulated national \ndebt. The conference agreement falls far short of paying for these \ncuts--the tax cuts will cause the cumulative deficit to increase over \nthe next 7 years by $200 billion more than it would without them. We \nwill be forced to borrow to pay for them. When one considers the fact \nthat elsewhere in the Republican budget agreement taxes are being \nraised on families making $30,000 or less, we see that there is very \ncurious social policy being advanced as well.\n  Today, however, I would like to focus on another troubling aspect of \nthese tax cuts. The true cost of the cuts explodes once you get beyond \nthe initial 7 years that are counted for estimation purposes. The cost \nof several of the tax cuts doubles or triples when you include the 8th, \n9th and 10th years, as compared to the first 7. This is no accident. \nThe tax cut provisions are deliberately crafted so that their true \ncosts do not begin to show up until after the initial 7 years. That \nway, they do not show up in the 7-year plan to balance the budget. \n\n[[Page S 17523]]\n\n  The magnitude of the out year costs can be found in figures provided \nto me by the Joint Committee on Taxation, dated November 16, 1995. When \nthe majority released their conference agreement on the deficit \nreduction bill, they provided revenue tables that covered only the \nfirst 7 years. I asked the Joint Tax Committee staff to provide figures \nshowing the revenue effect of the tax cuts for an additional 3 years \nbeyond what had previously been disclosed. That is, for the first 10 \nyears after enactment.\n  What is shown on these 10-year revenue estimates is astonishing.\n  The analysis provided by the Joint Tax Committee shows that the total \ncost of the tax cuts starts out at $245 billion over the first 7 years, \nbut then in the short span of the next 3 years another $171 billion is \nadded. The average annual revenue loss is about $35 billion over the \nfirst 7 years, but rises to an average of $57 billion per year for the \n3 years after 2002.\n  Three provisions, in particular, stand out. First, the cost of the \ncapital gains cuts for individuals more than doubles over 10 years, as \ncompared to the cost for the first 7 years--from $28.8 billion to $70 \nbillion. Second, the expansion of individual retirement accounts \n[IRA's] in the bill costs $11.8 billion over 7 years, but nearly \ntriples to $32.5 billion when you include the 3 years after 2002. \nThird, the cost of reductions in the estate tax more than doubles from \n$12.3 billion over 7 years to $25.5 billion over 10 years. Other \nprovisions that show rapid out year growth include the reduction in the \nmarriage penalty on couples filing joint returns and the expansion of \nthe self-employed health insurance deduction.\n  In part, the explosion in the long-term revenue costs of these tax \ncuts results from the attempt to hide their true impact, by drafting \nthem so that they do not take full effect until after the 7-year budget \nwindow is closed. Possibly the most egregious example is the provision \nthat permits indexing of capital assets. Under this provision, \ntaxpayers can exclude from their taxable income capital gains on \nqualifying assets resulting from inflation after calendar year 2000. To \nqualify, an asset generally must be purchased after 2000 and be held \nfor over 3 years. Thus, the revenue cost of indexing does not show up \nuntil 2004 and thereafter, that is, conveniently outside the 7-year \nbudget window.\n  The indexing provision, however, would permit taxpayers to treat \nassets purchased prior to 2000 as newly purchased assets eligible for \nindexing if they elect to pay taxes on the appreciation in the assets \nat the time of the election. This results in a speedup of tax revenues, \nallowing the Republicans to score about $10 billion of accelerated tax \nrevenues inside the last 2 years of the budget window.\n  The 10-year revenue numbers evince an effort by the right to starve \nthe beast--that is, to cut off funding for the Federal Government. The \nextreme growth in revenue loss outside the budget window is ominous \nbecause the spending reductions in the bill are far from certain to \noccur. A recent Washington Post editorial entitled ``Time Bomb in the \nBudget'' states:\n\n       . . . the deeper the ultimate tax cuts in the plan, the \n     deeper the spending cuts must also be to keep up. And some of \n     these spending cuts are too deep to sustain. The focus in the \n     fight thus far has almost all been on what would happen in \n     the first 7 years of this plan. That's fine, but it makes no \n     sense to solve a problem in that period only to begin to \n     create it all over again immediately thereafter.\n       Mr. Moynihan's 10-year chart is a useful warning. The \n     government shouldn't be mortgaging its future by cutting \n     taxes that in the long run it will need to fulfill its basic \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of this \neditorial be printed in the Record, along with another article on this \ntopic from the Washington Post, dated November 23, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 22, 1995]\n\n                        Time Bomb in the Budget\n\n       The tax cuts and some of the spending cuts in the \n     Republicans' seven-year package would ultimately be much \n     larger than the official estimates suggest. That's because as \n     they were written their full effect would not be felt until \n     after or near the end of the seven-year period for which the \n     estimates were made.\n       These delayed-action mechanisms should be an issue in the \n     talks about the begin between the president and Congress. You \n     cannot achieve a better balance between the resources and \n     responsibilities of the government with these slow-developing \n     tax cuts whose long-term effect would be to create a new \n     imbalance. It was known all along that some of the tax cuts \n     in the plan were backloaded. In the House-Senate conference \n     they became much more so. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan asked \n     the staff of the Joint Tax Committee for long-term estimates \n     of how the bill would affect revenue, not just for seven \n     years but for 10. In the 10th year the diminution of revenue \n     caused by these tax cuts would be 75 percent greater than in \n     the seventh year; that's how much of the full cost the tax-\n     writing committees postponed.\n       Most of the postponement would come in capital gains. The \n     conferees agreed not just to cut the capital gains tax but to \n     begin adjusting gains for inflation, so that when an asset \n     was sold the government would tax only the increase in value \n     in excess of the inflation rate. The inflation adjustments \n     wouldn't begin until the year 2001, however. That and other \n     steps conceal their cost. The tax cut to end the so-called \n     marriage penalty on two-earner couples filing joint returns \n     was also largely delayed until the period 2003 to 2005, and \n     there are other examples.\n       A lot of the spending cuts in the plan have been backloaded \n     all along as well. Medicaid may be the best example. The cut \n     in projected spending for the full seven years--all seven \n     combined--would be 17 percent; that is the figure most often \n     cited. But it is misleading, because the cuts in the early \n     years would be small and grow progressively larger. By the \n     seventh year the cut on an annual basis would amount to 28 \n     percent.\n       Nor does even that do justice to what might happen to the \n     program, it turns out. That's because the conferees also \n     eased the rules governing how much states would have to spend \n     to qualify for their federal funds. If hard-pressed states \n     were to spend the least they could and still quality for \n     their full federal grants, the federal and state governments \n     together by the seventh year would be spending 35 percent \n     less than under current law.\n       That would be a devastating cut--but the deeper the \n     ultimate tax cuts in the plan, the deeper the spending cuts \n     must also be to keep up. And some of these spending cuts are \n     too deep to sustain. The focus in the fight thus far has \n     almost all been on what would happen in the first seven years \n     of this plan. That's fine, but it makes no sense to solve a \n     problem in that period only to begin to create it all over \n     again immediately thereafter.\n       Mr. Moynihan's 10-year chart is a useful warning.

But the average \n     annual revenue loss would jump to $57 billion in the three \n     subsequent years, according to the agency.\n       The plan provides $245 billion in tax breaks over the next \n     seven years and would cost a total of $416 billion in lost \n     revenue over 10 years, the committee said.\n       Clinton administration officials and some private budget \n     analysts have seized upon the estimates--which were provided \n     by the Joint Committee on Taxation at the request of the \n     Senate Finance Committee's ranking Democrat, Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan (N.Y.)--as evidence that the GOP tax proposals were \n     crafted to hide their true cost.\n       To maintain a balanced budget after 2002, deeper cuts in \n     projected federal spending would be required beyond those \n     outlined in other parts of the reconciliation bill.\n       A budget plan with a tax cut that would ``explode in the \n     last three years of a 10-year period has got to be viewed as \n     an unwise policy decision,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. \n     Rubin said at a breakfast meeting with reporters yesterday. \n     He denounced the Republican tax proposals as ``enormously \n     outsized.''\n       President Clinton is expected to veto the legislation.\n       The GOP plan is riddled with ``gimmicks--the sole purpose \n     of which is to mask the trues cost of tax breaks in the \n     seven-year period,'' said the liberal Center for Budget and \n     Policy Priorities in an analysis released Tuesday.\n       In unveiling their reconciliation package last week, \n     congressional Republicans stressed that the single largest \n     item in their package of tax cuts is a proposal to grant \n     parents a $500 tax credit for each child.\n       With the addition of several other proposals--including a \n     reduction in the ``marriage penalty'' on couples filing joint \n     returns, a credit for parents who adopt, and a deduction for \n     long-term health care--the ``pro-family'' provisions in the \n     tax package accounted for 73 percent of the total cuts, the \n     Republicans said.\n\n[[Page S 17524]]\n\n       But critics claim the Joint Committee on Taxation's \n     projections show the pro-family component is a much smaller \n     part of the GOP tax cut over the longer term.\n       And opponents of the GOP plan claim much of the extra \n     revenue loss would come from two items that primarily benefit \n     upper-income families: a proposed cut in the tax rate for \n     capital gains, or income from the sale of stocks, property \n     and other assets; and new incentives for savers using \n     individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\n       To understand why the cost of the GOP tax cut would rise in \n     the years following 2002, consider the structure of the \n     proposed capital gains tax cut. The reconciliation plan \n     includes an ``indexing'' provision that would allow investors \n     to subtract from their taxable income capital gains resulting \n     directly from inflation beginning in 2001.\n       But in its first year, the indexing provision includes what \n     analysts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities decry \n     as a ``gimmick.'' It would allow taxpayers to consider assets \n     they already hold as ``new'' assets eligible for indexing the \n     following year if they pay taxes on their capital gains \n     earned until that point.\n       The change would yield a one-time-only revenue increase of \n     about $10 billion in fiscal 2002, the year the budget is \n     supposed to reach balance. But that revenue only represents \n     taxes the Treasury would have claimed the following year. \n     Over the long term, indexing is a big revenue loser, the \n     liberal analysts said.\n       The Joint Committee's figures suggest revenue loss from all \n     the capital gains tax cuts advocated by Republicans could cut \n     Treasury revenue more than $100 billion in the seven years \n     after 2005, the liberal analysts said.\n       Similarly, revenue loss from GOP tax provisions aimed at \n     widening participation in tax-favored IRAs would average \n     about $1.7 billion between 1996 and 2002, under the GOP \n     reconciliation bill. But in the three years thereafter, \n     revenue loss would snowball, averaging $6.9 billion each \n     year, the committee estimates.\n       One reason the IRA provisions might lose revenue at a \n     faster rate after the seven-year budget period is that the \n     GOP bill establishes ``back-loaded'' IRAs. People who open \n     the new accounts would be taxed on initial contributions, but \n     not on accumulated interest or withdrawals for retirement, \n     new home purchases, education expenses and other uses. In \n     traditional IRAs, the initial contribution is tax-deductible, \n     but withdrawals are taxed.\n       Analysts expect the withdrawal rate for the new IRAs to \n     increase after 2002, as cash builds up in the accounts and \n     participants tap their tax-free gains for a multitude of \n     uses, including retirement. The tax-free withdrawals cost the \n     Treasury revenue it would have otherwise received if the IRAs \n     were structured the traditional way.\n       Moreover, the bill gradually allows people with higher \n     incomes to establish the accounts, with the top income level \n     not allowed in until 2007, thus masking the total cost of the \n     new IRAs in the long run.\n       The GOP plan also includes a four-year ``rollover'' \n     provision that would allow money in traditional IRAs to be \n     shifted into the new, backloaded accounts, provided the \n     holder pays taxes immediately on current gains. That funnels \n     extra income that would have been collected in the future \n     into Treasury's coffers during the next seven years, thus \n     lowering the apparent cost of the tax benefit.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise, Mr. President, to talk about Bosnia, to talk \nabout the thing that, I guess, is before all of us as American \ncitizens--decisions, some of which, unfortunately, have apparently \nalready been made, but the major decisions are still to be made.\n  I have thought a lot about this tragedy, as most of us have. \nCertainly, it has been before us almost nightly on TV, a great deal of \ndiscussion about it: some 43 months of war, over 200,000 people killed, \na real human tragedy, of course. All of us feel badly about that. I \nhave also had the opportunity to travel there recently. About a month \nago, seven of us from the Senate had a chance to go there. I must tell \nyou, I came back no more convinced that we have a role there with \nground troops than I did before I left.\n  I think the idea of inserting 20,000 ground troops is a mistake. \nThere are a number of questions that, I think, the answers to which \nlead to that conclusion. The basic one, of course, is: What is the \nnational interest? I think that question needs to be asked in each of \nthe kinds of commitments we make--major commitments, particularly of \nArmed Forces. What is our role throughout the world? There are many \nplaces in which there is unrest and tragedy, and there are a number of \nplaces in which there is civil war. Is it in our national interest to \nintercede in each of those, to send 10,000 troops, 20,000 troops? I do \nnot know the answer. But I think not. I do not think it is in our \nnational interest to be the policeman of the world in civil uprisings \nsuch as this.\n  I guess we have to ask ourselves, are we to police regional peace \nthroughout the world wherever it is threatened? Do we have an \nobligation to secure regional peace throughout the world by sending our \ntroops into these kinds of situations? What is the national interest? \nWhat kind of national interest does deserve military attention? I think \nthis is the basic issue. All of the other things we talk about are \npretty secondary to that. The President, of course, has not been able \nto lay out convincingly that interdiction and involvement of 20,000 or \n25,000 U.S. troops is indeed in our national interest.\n  Let us examine some of the administration's concerns and arguments. \nThey have been here in our Committee of Foreign Relations. We had a \nhearing with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, as \nwell as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the arguments is that killing \nis morally wrong. Of course, we all agree with that. But then should we \nsend troops wherever that occurs? Should we be involved each time \nkilling occurs? I think we would be overwhelmed by the number of times \nthat we would saddle up and go to Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and endless \nother places, if killing is in fact the issue of national interest that \npromotes the sending of 25,000 troops.\n\n  We hear that the conflict will expand. Frankly, I have to tell you \nthat I do not believe that is nearly as imperative as it was 43 months \nago. My impression, frankly, from being there--and I was only there 4 \ndays, so I am not an expert by any means --as you would imagine, these \npeople are very tired of fighting. They are looking for solutions \nthemselves, as you would imagine they would be. The notion that this is \ngoing to expand now if we do not move 25,000 troops in I do not believe \nis a basis in fact.\n  We were there going down the street of Sarajevo, and they point out, \nalmost with pride, that there is the bridge where the Grand Duke was \nshot before the start of World War I. Really, that adds very little to \ntoday's expansion of another war. But if you want to look at historic \nthings, in that country, the guerrillas, during World War II, were \nnever chased down. They never surrendered. In that country, in the \nmountains, these kinds of troops will go on forever, if they choose to. \nAnother is that if we do not intercede at this level, we will then be \nisolationists in the world and we would be withdrawing from our role of \nleadership. I cannot imagine that argument, as involved as we are \naround the world, both in troops, commerce, and trade, and we are \ninvolved in all of the organizations that have to do with security, \ntrade, and with the development of international relations. We are \nisolationists? Give me a break. That is hardly what our activities can \nbe called.\n  It seems to me that the principal reason the President is pushing as \nhard as he is, is that 2 years ago, he indicated we would send 25,000 \ntroops. Now it is 20,000. Why not 10,000? Why not 15,000? We spent 4 \ndays there. The first day was with the Unified European Command. I must \ntell you, I was very proud, as always, of the American troops, who are \ntraining to be part of this undertaking. But at that time, they were \ntalking about 25,000 American troops, talking about a total of 90,000 \nNATO troops, with another 15,000 already there--over 110,000 troops in \nthis area. The Senator from South Carolina just spoke about the \nagreement. I guess I have to say that if the agreement is one that is \nagreed to by the warring parties--genuinely agreed to--then you could \nsay, why do you need 90,000 troops to enforce it? If it is not agreed \nto, then the Secretary of Defense, and others, said we should not be \nthere. You have to fight your way in. If you have to fight to make \npeace, then that is not our mission. That has been made clear that we \nwill not be there. So there has to be an agreement that has genuine \naccord. We will see. I hope there is. I think the United States and the \nState Department have done a great job in bringing together these \npeople to some kind of a peace agreement.\n  Why is it so important that we have to define the national interest? \nYou hear a lot about being concerned, as we \n\n[[Page S 17525]]\nshould be, with putting troops in harm's way. Frankly, often troops are \nin harm's way. That is what troops are for. The issue is not harm's \nway; the issue is why they are there. If the troops are there with a \nbona fide national interest, then we try to avoid harm's way. But that \nis not the criteria. The cost. When you talk about $1 billion, $2 \nbillion, I think we spent that much in Haiti. Can you imagine that this \nwill cost less than Haiti? I do not believe so. Is it in the national \ninterest to spend $3 billion, $4 billion? That is a question.\n  Maybe more important than anything was the lack of specific goals. In \nthe hearing that I mentioned with the Joint Chiefs, the general said we \nwill get the job done. I believe that. I believe our Armed Forces will \nget the job done. I ask, how will you know? What is the job that is to \nbe done? Frankly, I do not think anyone knows precisely.\n\n  Pull out in 1 year? I have a hunch that is a little bit political, \nthat the notion is that we know you cannot leave troops there very \nlong.\n  What if you are not through in a year? How do you know you are \nthrough? What is it that signifies having the job done? We were very \nconcerned when we talked to the command. What do you do in this zone? \nDo you have check points with half a dozen soldiers--I do not know--\nthat are subject to raids by small bands? Do you put them in large \ngroups and patrol? The notion was, if you are fired on, you get to fire \nback. That is right, the way it ought to be. It was also, if there is \nan attack, we should withdraw because we are not there to fight but to \nkeep peace. If there is no peace we would not be there. Sort of a \nconundrum.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me that it is an almost unsolvable \nsituation. I think we can be involved. I think people want us to be \ninvolved. I think we indeed have been involved. The question of 20,000 \ntroops is quite a different matter. I have to say, in the time I was in \nWyoming, I really did not find anyone who supported that idea.\n  So we have a situation of 43 months of war in the former Yugoslavia, \nmore than 250,000 people killed, an ethnic war, a continuation of \nsomething that has gone on a very long time. The question is, do we \nplace ourselves in the middle of this, between the Serbs?\n  One of the things that has happened, I believe, partly as a result of \nthis body's taking action on lifting the arms embargo, is that we did \ntend to equalize the forces. Croatians and Moslems got together in the \nfederation which sort of leveled the playing field of the Serbs, and \nthen NATO's airstrikes completed that job. You noticed a great change \nin what was happening.\n  So we are faced with an ancient ethnic and religious conflict. \nFrankly, it is hard to know who is on what side.\n  Another obstacle is to overcome how you handle the United States and \nRussia being there at the same time. Russians will not be under the \ncontrol of the NATO but still want to be in a segment. The winter is \ncertainly a worry. I know we can handle it, but nevertheless it is \ntough.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there has been demonstrated--and \nquite frankly I do not believe there will be demonstrated--an \nindication that placement of these troops in the former Yugoslavia is \nin the international interests. I think that ought to be the criterion. \nThat ought to be the measurement. In the next few weeks we will need to \nmake that measurement.\n  All of us need to be involved whether we are in the Senate, whether \nwe are citizens, whether we vote. This is a U.S. decision, and it will \nhave to be made by all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17524-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17525-S17526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEBATE ABOUT BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we go into this very busy week, coming \non the heels of the Thanksgiving break, I do not know of a time that we \nhave had so many issues at the forefront that are so important to this \ncountry--not only the debate on the budget, how do we balance it, how \ndo we stay on track to balance the budget in 2002 and how important \nthat is to our children and grandchildren, the business of reforming \nwelfare to make it work for people rather than lock them into certain \ncircumstances, and now the situation as it is developing and unfolding \nin Bosnia.\n  There are a lot of folks, including some who are running for public \noffice, by the way, who do not even know where Bosnia is. But the \ndebate, I am sure, this week will boil down to be a three-pronged \ndebate: Is it in our national interest to deploy troops as peacekeepers \nor peacemakers, and there is a difference; will there be a clear and \nconcise mission with hardly any opening for mission creep, and that is \nkind of tough to define, and it is kind of tough to stop--we learned \nthat in Somalia; and is there at some time certain a withdrawal plan or \nsome avoidance to deal with maybe an endless mission.\n  One has to read the history of that part of the world to really \nunderstand it. I have been there, spent quite a lot of time on the \nDalmation coast in Croatia, and I will tell you that the passion and \nthe love for their land runs as deep as their hatred of their \ntrespassers.\n  In Bosnia, is it a holy war? One would like to think not. But I think \nit is part of the equation. An ethnic war? Of course it is because of \nthe ethnic cleansing that has been carried out. The carnage that has \nbeen thrust upon this country is almost unspeakable and unheard of.\n  Is it a civil war? Yes, it is a civil war. Is it a war that goes \nacross borders? It is that, too. But it has been waged for generations. \nAnd just since our history or our recollection or our generation, \n250,000 people have perished at the hands of those who would be in the \nbusiness of ethnic cleansing. The atrocities are unspeakable, and they \nare there.\n  So we have to look at that situation as we try to define our \nresponsibility in that equation. I give high marks to this President, \nmy President--we only have one at a time--in bringing the warring \nparties together at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, and the \namount of resolve that was placed on this to come out of there with \nsome kind of an agreement that would be good for everybody.\n  We have seen cease-fires, and we have seen agreements that were drawn \nup and concluded within Serbia and Croatia and in Bosnia, but they did \nnot last very long. I am wondering how long this will last. Does \neveryone who is a party to that accord or that agreement that was \nsigned at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio really, really agree \non peace? Are their leaders really 100 percent dedicated to it? Is \neveryone ready to stop the fighting?\n  It would seem to me that after a while you would just get tired of \nkilling one another. That has not been the case in this particular \ncorner of the world. I would also ask, after the accord was signed in \nOhio, what has been the part for the rest of the international \ncommunity? Have they stepped forward? And how much pressure have they \nput on the parties, the three main parties in that part of the world to \nwork out some sort of a peace? How heavy has the international pressure \nbeen? Has it been as intense as it has from this country? Because I \nhappen to believe in the American way. I have always said our greatest \ntrait as a people is most times our undoing because we are a caring \npeople. No catastrophe happens around the world that we do not react in \na very positive way to help people. We care. And also when we see the \natrocities on our television screens every night during the nightly \nnews, it moves our conscience. And we are a nation with a conscience. \nNo person can stand to one side and not feel for those people who have \nbeen victims of unspeakable atrocities.\n\n  But those folks who have pledged troops into NATO as a peacekeeping \nforce, how many of those people have really stepped up and said this is \nwrong, and how much pressure have they put on their folks that this \nmust stop? If the Bosnian Moslems and the Serbians and the Croatians do \nnot think this peace agreement is in their best interests, then we \nwould question, \n\n[[Page S 17526]]\nis it in our best interests? Would our troops be placed in harm's way? \nWould they be placed there as peacemakers or peacekeepers? And I would \nsay as this debate drones on, peacemakers become a lot more dangerous. \nIt is hard to keep the peace where there is no peace.\n  I am also sympathetic with the President on wanting to do the right \nthing. I am also sympathetic in that he has the right if he thinks it \nis right to deploy troops in a peacekeeping mission. But it would be a \nlot easier if he would come to this Congress and consult with this \nCongress before he did so and have the support of the American people. \nIt is terrible to order young men and women into harm's way without the \ncomplete support of their nation. I will not do that.\n  There seems to be another situation here, too--the provision of this \naccord to lift the arms embargo and to arm and train the Bosnians. That \ndoes not seem like a peacekeeping mission to me. And I will have to \nknow more about the wording on that and our goal or the ultimate end.\n  It seems hard to say that if we flood the country with arms and in \nthe next breath we say, ``No more war,'' that seems sort of an oxymoron \nto me.\n  In conclusion, it is, like I said, like no other part of the world \nwhere you will find people that have a love so deep and a passion so \ndeep for their land but also a hate so deep for their trespassers. And \nthat is the situation we have to deal with. So despite my expressed \ndoubts on the merits of this decision to deploy--we will listen to the \ndebate--but I have no intention of withdrawing my support for our young \nmen and women who will be placed in harm's way in this mission of \npeace.\n  I can remember when President Bush came to this body and asked for \npermission to deploy in the Middle East. We did have a national \ninterest there. How much do we have in this circumstance? We will weigh \nthat decision. And it will probably be, if the President chooses to do \nso, and I think he will, that he will come to this Congress asking for \nour support. It will be a very, very tough decision. It could be one of \nthose votes that one never likes to cast either up or down. But the \ndebate must be held, and we must talk about it openly because there are \nyoung men and women's lives at stake, and the interest of the most \npowerful and free Nation in the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, seeing no one wishing to speak, I would \nlike to address very briefly the matter that I have spoken of on a \nnumber of occasions. That is the opening up of the arctic oil reserve \nknown as ANWR. And I would like to submit some particular documentation \nthat has come into my office in the last few days, but I will be \nspecific in my reference.\n\n  As the President and my colleagues are aware, the idea of opening up \nthe Arctic oil reserve, or ANWR, is not a new idea. It was left in 1980 \nto the Congress to make a determination as to the appropriateness of \nopening up an area in the coastal plain, approximately 1.5 million \nacres out of the 19 million acres which make up ANWR. Approximately 8.5 \nmillion acres of that has already been set aside in a permanent \nwilderness by the 1980 legislation. Another 9.5 million acres has been \nset aside in refuge, leaving approximately 1.5 million acres in the so-\ncalled 1002 area for the disposition of Congress.\n  At this time, we are faced with a dilemma as to whether or not, \nindeed, this is in the national interest. It is a similar argument to \nthat which prevailed in the seventies when there was question as to \nwhether or not the Prudhoe Bay area would be open for exploration and \ndevelopment.\n  That was over 20 years ago, Mr. President. Prudhoe Bay has been \nproducing approximately 25 percent of the total domestic crude oil \nproduced in the United States over the last 18 years. Today, Prudhoe \nBay has declined. The production from that field has dropped from \napproximately 2 million barrels a day to 1.5 million barrels a day. But \nthe arguments over whether or not we should open up the Arctic oil \nreserves of ANWR and the arguments that prevailed 20 years ago are \nbasically the same: Can we do it safely? What will be the effect on the \ncaribou? What will be the effect on the moose and the other animals \nthat frequent the area, the bird life and so forth?\n  We have seen over the last 18 years of operating the Prudhoe Bay \nfield an extraordinary set of events relative to the wildlife. We have \nseen the caribou herds grow from 3,000 to 4,000 animals to the current \nlevel of approximately 24,000 animals. It has been recognized in the \noil fields, as in other areas where the caribou frequent that there are \napproximately three detractors and a number of animals that can sustain \nthemselves, and those are individually related to the number of wolves \nin an individual area or other predators such as bear, the winter--the \nheavy snows take a toll on the caribou--and, of course, overgrazing is \nalso a difficulty. In any event, we have seen the growth of these \nherds, which suggest, indeed, we have the capability to safely manage \nwith a reasonable amount of development in an area given time.\n  My point is, again, we are reflecting the same arguments that were \nbefore us in the seventies, applicable today, but we have the proof, we \nhave the scientific evidence and we have the redundancy, if you will, \nof recognizing that this population has increased and, with proper \nmanagement, there can be little effect on the animal population \nassociated with development in the high Arctic.\n  Further, there has always been a question as to the safety relative \nto the advanced technology. We have proven that we can limit the \nfootprint dramatically. We have seen an extensive field in Prudhoe Bay \nreduced as new fields have been found, as stepouts of Prudhoe Bay, \napproximately 7 years ago, brought in a field known as Endicott which \nonly took in 56 acres of surface land, yet it was the 10th largest \nproducing field in North America. Today, it is the 7th largest \nproducing field.\n  There was another question as to what effect this activity would have \non the residents, the Eskimo people themselves. I quote from a \nstatement, a news release from the North Slope Bureau and the Arctic \nSlope Regional Corporation:\n\n       The Eskimo people are working their way out of Federal \n     dependency. Because of their success, they state they are \n     being opposed at every turn by the Assistant Secretary for \n     Indian Affairs--\n\n  And they named Ada Deer in that regard and suggest she opposes \nsuccessful native American corporations and organizations. She, in \ntheir opinion, wants them to be dependent on the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. But they indicate that they are well aware of what dependency \nbrings: a state that kills self-initiative, that breeds a welfare \nsociety. They further conclude that they want to follow the American \nway, the old way of independent self-help and individual \nresponsibility, family values and sense of community.\n  In other words, Mr. President, they want to have the same \nopportunities that other Americans enjoy: jobs for their children, tax \nbases for their communities, running water that other Americans enjoy.\n  So as a consequence, as we debate the merits of whether ANWR should \nstay in the reconciliation package, as has been deemed by action taken \nby both the House and the Senate, we are faced with this question of \nnational security interests as well.\n  Currently, we are importing about 51 percent of our total crude oil. \nBack in \n\n[[Page S 17527]]\n1973, we were importing 34 percent. Obviously, we are sending our jobs \nand dollars overseas and the justification of that, in my mind, is very \nquestionable. If the oil is there, and volumes would have to be, it is \nestimated it would create 257,000 jobs associated with the life of the \nfield. This would be the largest single jobs producer that we can \nidentify in North America today.\n  So, as a consequence, if we add up the attitude of the Eskimo people \nwho see this as an opportunity for stimulating their own economic \nlivelihood, the national energy security interests of our Nation, the \ntremendous number of jobs, the realization that we have been able to \ndevelop safely oil and gas in the Arctic, as evidenced at Prudhoe Bay, \nthere is no good reason why this administration should not support \nopening up ANWR to drilling.\n  It is anticipated that the lease sale would bring in approximately \n$2.6 billion. That would be split 50 percent to the Federal Government \nand 50 percent to the State of Alaska. As a consequence of that, it \nwould give our engineers, our scientists, our technical people a great \nchallenge to address new technology to make the footprint even smaller.\n  It has been estimated that if the oil is there, the development \nscenario can be accomplished in an area of less than 3,000 acres. The \nfirst estimate of this given a couple years ago was approximately \n12,500 acres. Sometimes it is difficult to generate a comparison, but \nif one looks at the Dulles International Airport complex, that is about \n12,500 acres, and a comparison would be if the State of Virginia was a \nwilderness. That is, I think, the picture that we can best use as an \nanalogy to try to describe the vast distances associated with the \nArctic and the realization that the footprint would be very, very \ninsignificant.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I refer to an editorial in Nation's Business \nin November 1995. It is entitled ``How Energy Policy and the Budget \nIntertwine.'' It reads:\n\n       Consider a situation in which the central government holds \n     direct ownership of properties containing most of the \n     resources critical to economic growth. It also controls \n     access to vast additional areas holding still more of those \n     resources.\n       This central government has adopted policies that in effect \n     block the country's citizens from using such materials even \n     as their availability from other sources declines.\n       The nation fitting this description is the United States. \n     The federal government owns one-third of the lands that hold \n     most of the remaining reserves of oil, natural gas, timber, \n     low-sulfur coal, gold, silver, other minerals, and timber. In \n     addition, our government controls the outer continental shelf \n     (OCS), the undersea area extending from three to 100 miles \n     off the East, Gulf, and West coasts.\n       Federal lands, notably the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     (ANWR), and areas under federal jurisdiction, notably the \n     OCS, contain vast reserves of oil and natural gas. But \n     national policy has been to keep those resources locked up, \n     and the nation's dependence on imports continues to grow as \n     domestic production declines.\n       The United States now relies on imports for more than half \n     of the crude oil it consumes, and much of that comes from \n     countries with long records of political instability. Within \n     20 years, imports will represent 60 percent of domestic \n     consumption. Given such dependence, even a slight drop in the \n     supply from overseas could inflict severe economic harm.\n       The consequences of excessive reliance on imports were \n     starkly demonstrated in the 1970s, when foreign manipulation \n     of supplies and prices caused economic disruptions that \n     continued into the next decade.\n       There are, however, grounds for optimism that the nation \n     will not be held hostage to political events in the oil-\n     exporting nations. Congress is considering legislation to \n     permit exploration for oil and natural gas in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge and development of sites deemed \n     productive. With a membership far more attuned to economic \n     realities than its predecessors, this Congress might be the \n     one that adopts the rational energy policies the country has \n     long needed.\n       Environmentalists are predictably sounding alarms that ANWR \n     development would destroy vast areas of pristine natural \n     beauty. The facts show otherwise. The refuge consists of 19 \n     million acres, and the development ``footprint''--the \n     visible results of development--would affect 15,000 acres, \n     one-twelfth of 1 percent.\n       Oil exploration and production activity would be limited to \n     the coastal plain area, which is by no means a pristine \n     sanctuary but contains, among other things, abandoned \n     military bases. Even then, the footprint would affect only 1 \n     percent of the designated coastal area.\n       Advances in oil-production technology, such as horizontal \n     drilling, would further minimize the environmental impact. \n     Horizontal drilling, with pipes stemming underground from a \n     single pad, sharply reduces the number of traditional oil \n     rigs needed to produce from a wide area.\n       Given the economic necessity of developing the nation's oil \n     reserves and the negligible environmental consequences, the \n     proposal to open a relatively tiny portion of the ANWR should \n     command broad support in Congress--broad enough to override \n     the veto that has been threatened by President Clinton \n     because of pressure from environmentalists.\n       There is an additional benefit from opening that small \n     portion of the ANWR: The federal government would realize \n     $1.3 billion in oil royalties over seven years, money that \n     would help achieve the goal of a balanced federal budget.\n       The revenue potential of resource development on other \n     government-owned and/or government-controlled lands in one \n     that should be taken into consideration as Congress seeks \n     ways to achieve its goal of a balanced budget by 2002. Such \n     land use not only could help meet crucial resource needs but \n     also could help achieve a fiscal policy that would provide a \n     tremendous boost to the economy generally.\n       Although the federal government holds the legal title to \n     one-third of U.S. lands the key to offshore resources, the \n     officials who make up that government have failed in the past \n     to recognize that they were actually trustees and that \n     ultimate ownership and control was held by the American \n     people.\n       Those people want wise use of their properties. Such use \n     includes preservation where warranted and economic \n     utilization where that is warranted.\n       A Congress under new management appears to be aware of that \n     distinction. The president should also grasp it.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the last item I want to submit for the \nRecord is a letter dated November 10, 1995, to the President of the \nUnited States from Mr. George Duff, president of the Greater Seattle \nChamber of Commerce. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Greater Seattle\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                November 10, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce \n     continues its support to open the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge's (ANWR) Coastal Plain to environmentally responsible \n     oil and gas exploration, development and production. The \n     Advanced technologies of the oil companies have proven that \n     opening ANWR would be environmentally safe and wouldn't \n     endanger wildlife habitat. In 1987 after extensive \n     examination of this issue the Chamber adopted a formal \n     position supporting the opening of ANWR.\n       The Chamber believes that national security and economic \n     stability depend on sufficient ongoing quantities of domestic \n     oil production. Increased domestic oil production minimizes \n     the possibility of economic disruption due to dependence on \n     foreign oil and decreases the nation's trade deficit.\n       The Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce urges you to \n     approve the federal budget bill containing a provision to \n     open ANWR's Coastal Plain to oil and gas exploration and \n     development.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      George Duff,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, on last Thursday, Senator Dorgan, my friend \nfrom North Dakota, introduced a bill to assess the impact of the NAFTA \nto require further negotiation of certain provisions of the NAFTA and \nto provide for the withdrawal from the NAFTA unless certain conditions \nare met.\n  That bill is S. 1417. I am pleased to cosponsor the bill introduced \nlast Thursday by my friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. This bill \ncalls for an evaluation of the effects of the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement, known as NAFTA, on the U.S. economy and work force. It is \nvery \n\n[[Page S 17528]]\ntimely, given the precipitous calls to expand NAFTA further. I share \nSenator Dorgan's suspicions, supported by the initial data, that U.S. \nparticipation in NAFTA may not have benefited the United States and, in \nfact, may have harmed the economy of the United States.\n  I did not vote for NAFTA. I do not regret having voted against it.\n  The U.S. trade deficit with our NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico, \nreached $16.7 billion in just the first 6 months of 1995. In 1993, \nbefore NAFTA, the United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico. \nGiven the rule of thumb that each net export of $1 billion in goods \ncreates 16,500 jobs, a trade deficit of $16.7 billion therefore \ntranslates roughly into 275,500 U.S. jobs lost as a result of NAFTA.\n  To be sure, the Mexican peso crisis earlier this year is partly to \nblame for the sudden shifts in trade with Mexico. With the devaluation \nof the peso, Mexican exports to the United States are cheaper than \never, while Mexican citizens can no longer afford to purchase U.S.-made \nproducts.\n  The Treasury Secretary's report to Congress for August 1995 indicates \nthat consumer good imports in Mexico fell 29 percent in the first \nquarter of 1995 and 49 percent in the second quarter of 1995, compared \nto 1994. Unemployment and underemployment in Mexico grew from 4.5 \nmillion in the first half of 1994 to 7 million in the first half of \n1995; only employment rates in the low-wage, export-oriented \nmaquiladora sector increased--only in that one sector. Additionally, \nthe number of workers in Mexico who earned less than the Mexican \nminimum wage rose to almost 11 percent of the work force in May \n1995. Decreasing already low wages only encourages further job flight \nfrom the United States to Mexico.\n\n  Passage of NAFTA was supposed to be in recognition of Mexico's strong \neconomic performance over the last decade. But the economic crisis this \nyear suggests that Mexico was not ready to participate in a \n``predictable commercial framework for business planning and \ninvestment,'' as NAFTA purported. The Mexican crisis has also pointed \nout some flaws in the NAFTA that Senator Dorgan's bill attempts to \ncorrect. NAFTA must be renegotiated in order to correct for large trade \ndeficits; it must be corrected to adjust for currency distortions; and \nit must be adjusted to prevent unfair displacement of agricultural \nproducts. These changes will help to make this flawed agreement less \ndisadvantageous to the United States.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, Senator Dorgan's bill requires a number \nof certifications from the President and members of his Cabinet \nregarding a number of issues. These certifications provide a review of \nNAFTA and its effects on the U.S. economy and its effect on U.S. \nworkers. They include issues like job losses and gains, U.S. purchasing \npower, trade flows, environmental and safety standards, the drug trade, \nand democratic reforms in Mexico. These are reasonable standards by \nwhich to measure the costs and benefits of continued U.S. participation \nin NAFTA. If NAFTA is not providing all the benefits that its sponsors \npromised, we should know that and we should act accordingly, even to \nthe extent of withdrawing from an agreement that does not meet our \nneeds. We certainly should not consider expanding this agreement until \nwe have concluded that it provides more good than harm.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Mr. Dorgan, on his \nforesight in introducing this legislation. I am glad to be a cosponsor \nof it. I hope that it will receive the careful consideration of the \nSenate and that the Senate will act accordingly in view of the needs \nfor action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, was leaders' time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17527-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17528-S17529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MONEY TRAIN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, thousands of concerned citizens all across \nAmerica are now joining the chorus of voices speaking out against an \nentertainment industry that too often glorifies mindless violence, and \npeddles its harmful wares relentlessly to our children. These citizens \nunderstand, as I do, that images of senseless violence--repeated over \nand over again and showing murder in ever more graphic detail--debase \nour culture and affect people's attitudes and conduct, especially the \nattitudes and conduct of our impressionable young.\n  Regrettably, a shocking incident reported in today's New York Daily \nNews, New York Post, and New York Times seems to confirm the accuracy \nof this observation.\n  This past Sunday, two men squirted a bottle of flammable liquid into \na token booth at a subway station in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant \nneighborhood. They then lit a match, igniting an inferno that blew the \ntoken booth apart and sprayed broken glass and splintered wood \nthroughout the subway station. Trapped inside the token booth at the \ntime of the explosion was its operator, 50-year-old Harry Kaufman, who \nmiraculously survived with his life but who nonetheless suffered \nsecond- and third-degree burns over nearly 80 percent of his body. Mr. \nKaufman normally works only weeknights, but made the fateful decision \nto work the overtime shift on Sunday because he was trying to save \nmoney to send his son to college.\n\n  This incident--committed by two men whose depravity is beyond \ndescription--is remarkably similar to incidents depicted in a new movie \ncalled ``The Money Train,'' produced by Columbia Pictures. Although I \nhave not personally seen ``The Money Train''--and after Sunday's subway \nattack I have no intention of patronizing it--the movie apparently \ncontains two scenes that occurred nearly identical to the one that \noccurred in Brooklyn on Sunday. In the movie, a pyromaniac named \n``Torch'' squirts flammable liquid through the slot in the token booth \nand then ignites the booth. Unlike Mr. Kaufman, the fictional token-\nbooth operator escapes unscathed from the ensuing explosion.\n  Are ``The Money Train'' scenes and the real-life tragedy in Brooklyn \njust a coincidence? Perhaps. But, apparently, this is not the view of \nNew York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, who says, ``There \nseems to be some connection between the movie and the explosions.'' Or \nas Alan Kiepper, the head of New York's Transit Authority, points out: \n``We know from experience that when you get movie and television \ndepictions of criminal activity, it is often copycatted.''\n  Copycat or no copycat, the individuals who committed this unspeakable \nact must be held accountable for their crimes. We are all responsible \nfor own actions. To say that a movie caused this senseless act in \nBrooklyn gives it a logic and dignity it does not deserve and cannot \nhave. There can be no excuses for criminal behavior, whatever the \nmotivation may or may not be.\n\n  But, at the same time, those who work in Hollywood's corporate suites \nmust also be willing to accept their share of the blame. For those in \nthe entertainment industry, who too often engage in pornography or \nviolence as a way to sell movie tickets, it is time for some serious \nsoul-searching. Is this how they want to make their livelihoods? Is \nthis their contribution to society?\n  Those who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore \ndeep into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving \nthemselves and ignoring reality. They are ignoring what happened this \npast June when a group of teenagers killed a Massachusetts man claiming \nthey were natural born killers. And, yes, they are ignoring the \nsenseless act that occurred this past Sunday morning in Brooklyn.\n  In fact, news reports indicate that transit authority officials had \nreviewed ``The Money Train'' script before the movie was filmed and had \nobjected to the token-booth arson scenes. The film's producers decided \nto create the scenes anyway--on Los Angeles soundstages. We may never \nknow the true impact of this decision.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to convey my thoughts \nand \n\n[[Page S 17529]]\nprayers to Mr. Kaufman and his family. We wish him a speedy recovery. \nAnd we wish the New York City Police Department every success in their \nefforts to track down the vicious thugs who have committed this \ncowardly act.\n  The American people have a right to voice their outrage, and they can \ndo so not through calls for government censorship, but by derailing \n``The Money Train'' at the box office.\n  Just so you get a better picture of what happened, this is the Daily \nNews, the front page of the Daily News. It is just entitled \n``Torched.'' So, when you put a flammable liquid into that little token \nbooth and light a match to it, with no real way to escape, this is what \nhappens. The front page says, ``Attack mimics the hit movie `Money \nTrain,' Token clerk firebombed in booth, Family and (transit authority) \nassail film thriller.''\n  Then in the New York Post pretty much the same. ``Torched! Gun-toting \nfirebombers steal scene from movie to blow up token booth.'' I know, if \nthere is any--maybe the paper is wrong. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe most \nAmericans are wrong. But if someone out there is watching a movie and \nis taken by it and excited by it and says, ``I would like to try it,'' \nand then goes out to try it in real life, this is the result--burns \nover 80 percent of his body. Keep in mind he was working the overtime \nshift so he could earn a little extra money to send his son to college.\n  The same coverage is in part B of the New York Times, same kind of \ncoverage, same broad coverage. But on the inside page here it says, \n``TA Worker Hurt In Booth Inferno.'' ``Two are sought in `movie' \nstunt.'' ``Train film's on fast track.''\n  It is all about what happens when people are mad and depraved or \nwhatever. This is what happens. So I would just say to my colleagues, \noutrage is a powerful weapon. It is covered by the first amendment. The \nmovie industry will tell you and the TV industry and all the others, \n``Oh, this is the first amendment, right of free speech.''\n  We have also a right under the first amendment called ``outrage.'' \nAnd if the American people express their outrage, in my view, good \nthings will happen. We do not need to pass legislation. We do not need \ncensorship. We just need to alert the American people and to ask some \nof those--in this case Columbia Pictures--to accept some corporate \nresponsibility, to be a good corporate citizen.\n  I noted that Time Warner--we recently talked about that--has decided \nto sell off and has sold off Interscope, which is producing some of the \nCD's that you could not repeat anywhere, privately or in public or \nanywhere else. They were available to young people 10, 11, 12 years of \nage or younger, walking into any of these stores and buying the CD's.\n  Those are the things that, in my view, I think make you wonder, where \ndo you draw the line on profit? When does profit become greed? When \ndoes it stop, if it is harmful to society, particularly young people in \nAmerica?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17528-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17529-S17530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just quickly on another matter, I will just \nsay that tonight the President of the United States is going to deliver \na very important message to the American people. He will attempt to \npersuade the American people that the United States, as a member of \nNATO, has a responsibility to commit 20,000 Americans to keep the peace \nor to enforce the peace--I think there is some confusion of exactly \nwhat it might be at this point--in that part of the world.\n  The President talked to me, called me yesterday from Camp David. We \nhad a good discussion. I said, ``Mr. President, you need to persuade \nthe American people if you are to persuade Congress.'' I must say that \nit is difficult, particularly when this administration virtually sat on \nits hands the past 30 months while many of us talked about lifting the \narms embargo. I still believe had we done that--and we had the debate \non the Senate floor a number of times. We had strong bipartisan votes, \nDemocrats joining Republicans, Republicans joining Democrats. The \nPresident indicated his opposition to that legislation. He said he \nwould veto it.\n  Now, it is always easy to second-guess. I am not trying to second-\nguess the President of the United States. But it seems to me, and many \nwho are experts, that had we lifted the arms embargo 6 months, a year \nago, we would not be talking about sending American forces to that part \nof the world, to Bosnia, to Tuzla, wherever the Americans will be \nstationed.\n  Now, in my view the President has the authority and the power under \nthe Constitution to do what he feels should be done regardless of what \nCongress does. But we also have a responsibility to our constituents \nand, I think, to the President of the United States to give him our \nbest advice. So, I would guess that after the President makes his \nremarks and after the American people respond and after we finally have \na signing of the peace agreement on December 15, is my understanding, \nthat then the Congress will take some action. I am not certain what \naction that would be, because I think we need to consult with one \nanother.\n  I remember when President Bush asked a previous Congress to authorize \nthe use of offensive force in the gulf crisis, not a single Member of \nthe Democratic leadership in either the House or the Senate would \nsupport the President of the United States. But, fortunately, in the \nSenate there were 11 Democrats who stood with President Bush, and by a \nnarrow margin, after the President rolled the dice, we prevailed.\n  One thing I recall from that debate and the positive response after \nthe vote was that the American people, once the Congress had given \ntheir--I do not say their stamp of approval, but at least authorized or \nbacked up the President of the United States--as I recall, public \napproval for the operation rose rather significantly.\n  So, I will just say to the President, I wish you well tonight. I \nthink you have a difficult job. I think the rest of us should keep an \nopen mind--not an empty mind, an open mind--an open mind, assuming we \nhad the same responsibility, keeping in mind that those in the armed \nservices are now volunteers. They are volunteers. And I assume when \nthey volunteer they know that the good and the bad can happen. But they \nare still young and still Americans and they still have a right, \nperfectly understandably, as do their families, to know what risks will \nbe taken, how long they may be there, what the costs may be, is there a \nvital national security interest and American national security \ninterest, do we have an exit strategy, how long will they stay, how \nmany, and many other questions on which I think we should focus.\n\n  I will just say, it seems to me if I pick out one thing where I think \nthe President can make a case, it is all these people came to America \nand they went to Dayton, OH, and they stayed there for a couple of \nweeks or longer, and they finally hammered out a fragile peace \nagreement and initialed it--it has not been signed yet--and initialed \nit, all under the auspices of American leadership--the President, the \nSecretary, the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Holbrook, and others--\nand all this was premised on the fact that there would be 20,000 \nAmericans there.\n  So it seems to me the President may have at least laid some \nfoundation, and there may be some obligation--some obligation--\nobviously that we follow through on that agreement. But the agreement \nhas not been signed finally. We have not heard from the American \npeople. We have not heard from Congress. We have heard from the House \nwhere they, by a pretty good margin, indicate they want to cut off all \nfunds. That bill has not yet been taken up in the Senate and it may not \nbe taken up this week.\n  I only hope that all of our colleagues will understand this is a very \nimportant decision all of us must make, and it must not be made just \nfor today, but for next year and the next year and the next year. It is \na question of Presidential authority, Presidential power, \nconstitutional responsibility, and the responsibility of the Congress \nof the United States.\n  So I look forward to listening carefully to the President tonight and \nwish him success.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to recognize the validity of rights-of-way granted \nunder section 2477 of the Revised Statutes, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the revised statutes 2477 rights-of-way settlement act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ncosponsored both by myself, Senator Hatch, Senator Stevens and Senator \nBennett. The purpose of this legislation is to allow State law to \ncontinue to determine revised statute covering 2477 right-of-ways, as \nit is known in the West.\n  Mr. President, for almost 130 years State law has applied to the \nvalidation of R.S. 2477 right-of-ways. Simply stated, that is the \n``right-of-way for the construction of highways over public lands, not \nreserved for public uses, is hereby granted.''\n  Originally, the grant was section 8 of the Mining Act of 1866. The \nprovision then became section 2477 of the revised statute, R.S. 2477, \nuntil its repeal by the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976, \nknown as FLPMA.\n  Section 706 of FLPMA repealed R.S. 2477. However, section 701 \nstates--and I quote--``Nothing in this act terminates any valid right-\nof-way existing on the date of approval of the act.'' Similarly, \nSection 509 of FLPMA states that nothing in title V on right-of-ways--\nand I quote--``shall have the effect of terminating any right-of-way or \nrights-of-use heretofore issued, granted, or permitted.''\n  Under the authority of R.S. 2477, highways were established to \nachieve access through the public domain. It was a primary authority \nunder which many existing State and country highways were constructed \nand operated over Federal lands in the Western United States.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Alaska many of these access routes were \nnothing more than perhaps a dogsled trail or footpath, but nevertheless \nprovided essential routes from village to village for Alaska's Native \npeople and other residents of the State. At that time it was a \nterritory. \n\n[[Page S 17531]]\n\n  The original grant was viewed as an open-ended offer that only \nrequired acceptance to fully vest. Once a right-of-way is fully vested, \nsignificant property rights would be attached to it.\n  Historically, the Department of the Interior looked to the State \nhighway laws as the standard for acceptance of the grant. The Federal \nGovernment did little to keep track of the number or location of these \nrights-of-ways for more than a century.\n  However, the Department of the Interior proposed regulations in \nAugust 1994 to make it extremely difficult to establish right-of-way \nclaims across Federal lands established under this law. The Department \nof the Interior claims the reason they are doing the regulations is to \nmake a logical process to get R.S. 2477 rights-of-ways recognized.\n  Mr. President, the regulations would actually do the following: They \nwould override State law with restrictive new definitions of \n``highway'' and ``construction.'' They would put a cloud in the title \nof R.S. 2477 roads, treating them as invalid until proven valid. They \nwould prevent any further expansion of scope of an R.S. 2477 right-of-\nway. And it would prevent making the right-of-way any wider. It set a \nsunset of administrative and court action on validity of R.S. 2477 by \nextinguishing claims not filed within 2 years, and 30 days after final \nruling.\n  Further, construction and maintenance would not be permitted without \napproval of DOI with 3 days' notice, preventing the fixing of washed-\nout roads until the Department of Interior gave approval. The draft \nDepartment of the Interior regulations are nothing more than an attempt \nto prevent legal access across our public lands. It would impose an \nalmost impossible task on State and local governments to make all \nclaims for rights-of-ways on Federal lands, and then have to validate \neach and every one of those claims.\n  Nowhere would this be more burdensome than in my State, Alaska, twice \nthe size of Texas, and less roads than the State of Vermont.\n  This is clearly an effort to make sure Alaska and other Western \nStates, Utah and others, would not have access across Federal lands for \nvalid rights-of-way egress and access.\n  It is really an effort to take away the rights of the States to \nvalidate and use their rights-of-ways.\n  This legislation which I have introduced today will define those who \ncan file a claim, will put a time line on the filing of these claims. \nIt will ensure there are validated claims according to State law at the \ntime of the assertion of those claims. Further, it would put the burden \nof proof on the Secretary of the Interior if he wants to challenge \ntheir validity.\n  Additionally, legislation introduced herein will not, first, create \nany new rights-of-ways. If they were nonvalid in 1976, they will not be \nvalid today.\n  Further, we will not supersede existing environmental protections. We \nwill not trample on private lands or Native lands.\n  And, finally, Mr. President, the Federal Government has better things \nto do, in my opinion, than put unnecessary burdens on the Western \nStates. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I would also add, Mr. President, that the State of Alaska has only \nbeen a State for 36 years. We are still very much involved in making \nclaims based on the use across public lands for access. And so it is \nvery much a real part of developing our State today. And I would urge \nmy colleagues to recognize it. In most of the other States this process \nwas done 100 years ago.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthis legislation being introduced today by my good friend from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, regarding rights-of-way granted under revised \nstatute [R.S.] 2477. This issue is of extreme and critical importance \nto my State, and this legislation is necessary to resolve, once and for \nall, the current situation that has clouded these rights since 1976.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Murkowski for his leadership to bring \nthe matter of claims made pursuant to R.S. 2477 to a close. I have \nworked closely with him to draft this proposal that meets the needs of \nall claimants in the various States, especially Alaska and Utah, where \nthe overwhelming majority of R.S. 2477 claims are located.\n  Mr. President, since 1976, when R.S. 2477 was repealed with passage \nof the Federal Land Policy and Management Act [FLPMA], State and local \ngovernments have had to wage constant battle with the Federal \nGovernment as to what constitutes a valid R.S. 2477 claim as well as \nwhat the scope of that claim is once it is determined valid under this \nstatute.\n  In Utah, this battle has been raging for quite some time. And, this \nfirestorm is quickly spreading throughout the West. The controversial \nand highly publicized Burr Trail case in Garfield County, Utah, which \nhas been litigated during the past decade, has brought this issue to \nthe forefront. Nearly every county in UT, as well as many others in the \nWest, has identified numerous R.S. 2477 rights-of-way claims. These \nlocal governments are justifiably concerned that the validation process \nof each claim may require enduring the same financial and legal burdens \nas the Burr Trail case, especially considering that more than 10,000 \nclaims have been identified in Utah alone.\n  There has to be a better solution than the current system, which is \nwhat my colleagues from Alaska, Senators Murkowski and Stevens, and my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, and I have been fighting for \nduring the past few years.\n  At issue here is what constitutes a right-of-way as authorized by \nCongress in 1866. R.S. 2477 rights-of-way are thoroughfares, cart \npaths, one lane dirt roads, small log bridges over streams or ravines, \nand other roads that time and necessity have created in our western \nStates. These rights-of-way, which traverse Federal lands--and we are \nobviously not using the term highway in the modern sense--have been an \nintegral part of the rural American landscape for over 100 years.\n  These rights-of-ways constitute an important part of the \ninfrastructure of the Western States. I would ask my colleagues to \nthink of this issue this way: suppose your front yard belonged to \nsomeone else--the Federal Government, for example--and the gravel \ndriveway through the front yard was the only way to get to your house \nfrom the street. If you do not have complete authorization to maintain, \nimprove, and keep open this driveway, then access to your home and \npossessions is eliminated. You would have to haul your groceries to \nyour front door from the street. A simple illustration, perhaps, but \none that shows the importance of these R.S. 2477 rights-of-way to the \npeople in the West. These rights-of-ways were accepted before 1976 and, \nlike your driveway, have been used continuously for decades as an \nintegral part of the West's transportation systems. The Senate should \ntake appropriate action to protect the well-being of western and Utah \ncommunities.\n  Our legislation proposes to resolve the current controversies \nsurrounding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way in several ways. It would provide a \nmethod of relief that many of us in the West have been pursuing for \nseveral years, namely that the designation of rights-of-way claims made \npursuant to this authority should be determined under State law. The \nvalidity of these rights-of-way should be determined at the local \nlevel, and not by Congress, the U.S. Department of Interior, or the \nU.S. Department of Transportation.\n  At the same time, the process for submitting claims under R.S. 2477 \nshould be as simple as possible consistent with legal requirements. A \nsystem for determining the validity of such claims should be designed \nto promptly resolve outstanding R.S. 2477 claims. Our bill creates such \na process and places the burden of proof of each claim squarely on the \nshoulders of the Federal Government. Without this process, I envision a \nFederal system under which resolutions of such claims will become \ntremendously bogged down with no substantial resolution to this issue.\n  My colleagues may ask that if these rights-of-way have existed for \n100 years, why is this legislation necessary?\n  Last August, the Clinton administration and Secretary Babbitt \nproposed regulations to settle this issue. These regulations would \nrequire a complete abandonment by State and local governments of R.S. \n2477 rights-of-way claims and a total rejection of any evidence that \ndocuments the existence \n\n[[Page S 17532]]\nand historic use of these rights-of-ways from 1866 up to 1976. They \nwould allow the Secretary to determine whether or not a right-of-way \nexisted prior to 1976 which, in my opinion is nothing more than asking \nState and local governments to abrogate their responsibilities as the \nowners of these rights-of-ways. We in the West are unwilling to do \nthat. The Secretary's regulations are evidence that the task of \nachieving a solution that protects the intent and scope of the original \nstatute while preserving the infrastructure of rural communities must \ninvolve Congress. As far as I am concerned, we are beyond a regulatory \nfix on this subject, particularly in light of the regulatory proposal \nput forward by the Clinton administration.\n  Fortunately, Congress has included language in next year's Interior \nappropriations bill that prohibits the implementation of these \nmisguided regulations.\n  Basically, our legislation will ensure that: First, the intent and \nscope behind the original statute are consistent with the intent and \nscope underlying congressional passage of FLPMA; second, the \ncongressional intent regarding the interpretation of R.S. 2477 in \naccordance with State law is preserved; third, the large body of \nsettled, well-established, and well-documented Federal and State case \nlaw and agency regulatory determinations is adhered to, and fourth, the \ntrust and respect for State and local governments, which hold these \nrights and are entitled to exercise their powers within the sphere of \ntheir authority without Federal intervention are restored.\n  Mr. President, this matter is critical to communities and citizens in \nthe rural West. In many cases, these roads are the only routes to farms \nand ranches; they provide necessary access for schoolbuses, emergency \nvehicles, and mail delivery. The Interior Department regulations would \nsignificantly confound transportation in the Western States, \njeopardizing the livelihoods of many citizens and possibly their health \nand safety as well.\n  Some claim that R.S. 2477 rights-of-way are nothing more than dirt \ntracks in the wilderness with no meaningful history, whose only value \nto rural counties arises from the hope of stopping the creation of \nwilderness areas. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one is \nsuggesting that we turn these rights-of-way into six-lane lighted \nhighways with filling stations, billboards, and fast food restaurants.\n  Although, I am confident in saying today that I expect those opposed \nto this legislation to initiate a campaign of misinformation, dishonest \nfacts, and outright untruths about the impact of our bill. They will \npaint a picture of our bill as authorizing the construction of paved \nroads through wilderness areas, native American trust lands, and \nnational parks. They will employ these scare tactics, like they have on \nother public land measures now before Congress, to mislead the public \nand the media into believing an array of bulldozers, graders, and other \nroad building vehicles are ready to begin an assault on the Nation's \nmost pristine areas. Again, nothing could be further from the truth. If \nthe right-of-way exists, then the scope and the attributes of that \nright must be protected from the local entity with jurisdiction. We are \nnot--I repeat, not--authorizing the construction of roads over public \nlands where no right-of-way exists. Our bill provides the Secretary of \nInterior considerable latitude to express his position on each and \nevery claim that is submitted and why these claims may or may not be \nvalid.\n  I do not like to be so forthcoming in this way, but after witnessing \nthe misinformation campaign being waged against our Utah wilderness \nbill, I want to prepare my colleagues for what is coming. I would ask \nthat they carefully confer with those of us who have thousands of these \nclaims in our States so as to fully recognize the importance of this \nmatter to our citizens.\n  There is no pressing environmental reason to change the R.S. 2477 \nrules other than to make Federal land more pristine than it has been \nsince the pioneers settled in the West. I urge the Senate to support \nadoption of this legislation during this Congress.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin introducing this important legislation and I congratulate Chairman \nMurkowski for his tremendous leadership, as well as Congressman Jim \nHansen, who has led the debate in the House of Representatives. While \nthe issue of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way may not be of concern to many of \nour colleagues east of the Rocky Mountains, it is certainly an issue of \nimportance to States in the West. The bill which we are introducing \ntoday will take great strides in putting an end to a controversy which \nhas nearly paralyzed many rural counties in the State of Utah.\n  As my colleagues have eloquently described the history of this issue, \nI will not go into great detail. However, I would like to make a few \nvery important points.\n  The R.S. 2477 statute is the authority under which many of the \nexisting State and county highways in my State were constructed and \noperated. For example, in Garfield County, UT, portions of Highway 12, \none of the most scenic and most heavily traveled routes in southern \nUtah, have no other written authorization besides the R.S. 2477 \nauthorization. Another example is the Hole-in-the-Rock road, \nhistorically one of the most significant routes in Utah history.\n  This legislation seeks to address the problems that developed by the \nfailure of R.S. 2477 to define what a highway was. By modern \ndefinition, highways are generally considered to be paved two or four \nlane roads, suitable for all types of traffic. However, southern Utah \nis crisscrossed with literally thousands of improved and unimproved \nroads which, regardless of the condition of the roads, are the \nlifelines to many native American communities, rural communities, \npublic recreation areas, mining, oil and gas, and grazing claims.\n  Currently, the only way a State or county can confirm the legality of \na right-of-way is to file a lawsuit in a Federal court. This has placed \nan onerous financial burden on county governments which sincerely want \nto resolve the issue. Indeed, many of the smaller counties in Utah \ncannot afford to file claims even though R.S. 2477 rights-of-way is \ncritical to their current and future economic survival. Mr. President, \nUtah has asserted more claims for R.S. 2477 than any other State. \nNearly 5,000 claims have been asserted at one time or another. You can \nimagine the tremendous financial burden that result both for the county \nand the Federal Government.\n  This legislation preserves the important role of State law in \ndetermining what is and is not a valid right-of-way. R.S. 2477 was \noriginally an offer made by Congress to State and local governments to \ncreate highways across the vast stretches of western desert and to help \nsettle the West. The original act recognized State law and relied on \nState law to provide many of the details of its implementation. In \nyears past, the Department of the Interior has generally acquiesced to \nState law. Since the passage of FLPMA, and even up until the recent \nadministration took office, the Department of the Interior's policy has \ngenerally looked to State law to determine what constitutes a public \nhighway.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It restores the role of the State \nin determining what is and is not a valid right-of-way. It forces both \nthe claimant and the Federal Government to come to the table. It \nnarrows the time frame in which claims might be filed to 5 years. It \ngrants the Secretary 2 years to object in writing to the claim and to \nprovide a factual and legal basis for each objection. The proposed \nregulations would put the burden of proof on the claimant. It places \nresponsibility on the holders of the claims to define, file, and defend \nthem in court.\n  This legislation will prevent roads from deteriorating which have \nbeen locked up. Most important, the legislation will preserve the \nability of citizens to access public lands and, in many cases, private \nlands to mine, hunt, fish, camp, hike, view wildlife, and enjoy our \nfabulous natural beauty.\n  The bill is not without its critics. The administration has already \nclaimed that the bill will make it too easy to file new claims, and too \nburdensome for the Government to reject ones that do not meet the \nstatutory criteria. Mr. President, I believe that we can take steps \nthat will permit us to work through a large portion of the outstanding \nclaims and I intend to work closely with my colleagues to do \n\n[[Page S 17533]]\nso. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and I look \nforward to assisting the chairman in any way possible to move this bill \nquickly through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1426. A bill to eliminate the requirement for unanimous verdicts \nin Federal court; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       federal court legislation\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho to amend the Federal \nrules of criminal and civil procedure to allow convictions on a 10 to 2 \njury vote.\n  It is my belief that this change to the Federal rules will bring \nabout increased efficiency in our Nation's court system while \nmaintaining the integrity of the pursuit of justice.\n  This legislation is consistent with the Supreme Court ruling \nconcerning unanimity in jury verdicts, specifically in Apodaca v. \nOregon, 406 U.S. 404. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the \nsixth amendment guarantee of a jury trial does not require that the \njury's vote be unanimous. The Supreme Court affirmed an Oregon Court of \nAppeals decision which upheld a guilty verdict under an Oregon law that \nallowed a 10 to 2 conviction in criminal prosecutions.\n  Mr. President, clearly there is not a constitutional mandate for the \ncurrent requirement under the Federal rules of criminal and civil \nprocedure of a jury verdict by a unanimous vote. The origins of the \nunanimity rule are not easy to trace, although it may date back to the \nlatter half of the 14th century. One theory proffered is that \ndefendants had few other rules to ensure a fair trial and a unanimous \njury vote for conviction compensated for other inadequacies at trial. \nOf course, today the entire trial process is heavily tilted toward the \naccused with many, many safeguards in place to ensure that the \ndefendant receives a fair trial.\n  Although majority verdicts were permitted during 17th century America \nin South Carolina, North Carolina, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, \nunanimous verdicts became an accepted part of common-law juries by the \n18th century.\n  Mr. President, I found it interesting that the proposed language for \nthe sixth amendment, as introduced by James Madison in the House of \nRepresentatives, provided for trial by jury as well as requisite of \nunanimity for conviction. While this particular proposal was passed by \nthe House with little change, it met a significant challenge in the \nSenate and was returned to the House in a different form. Later, a \nconference committee was appointed and reported the language adopted by \nthe Congress and the States which reflects the current sixth amendment.\n  The earlier House proposal requiring a unanimous jury verdict for \nconviction was considered and not made a part of the sixth amendment. \nFor purposes of discussion of this legislation, I will quote the \npertinent part of the sixth amendment: ``In all criminal prosecutions, \nthe accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an \nimpartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have \nbeen committed.''\n  The sixth amendment includes some features of common-law juries. \nHowever, the Supreme Court has admonished reliance on the easy \nassumption that if a given feature existed in a jury at common law in \n1789, then it was necessarily preserved in the Constitution. So here we \nsee the Supreme Court has noted specifically that all features of the \ncommon-law jury are not mandated by the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, there may be a number of inferences to be drawn from \nthe deletion of the unanimity for conviction requirement in the \nproposed sixth amendment. One point we cannot escape is the fact that a \nunanimity requirement was considered by our Founding Fathers and \ndetermined that it should not be constitutionally mandated.\n  In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. at 156, the Supreme Court stated \nthat the purpose of the right to a trial by jury is to prevent \noppression by the Government by providing a ``safeguard against the \ncorrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the biased or eccentric \njudge.'' Carrying this view further in the subsequent case of Williams \nv. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Supreme Court stated, ``The \nessential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition between \nthe accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of \nlaymen'' Williams, supra, at 100.\n  Juries are representative of the community and their solemn duty is \nto hear the evidence, deliberate, and decide the case after careful \nreview of the facts and the law. Of course, this should be done free of \nintimidation from outside and within the jury. The Supreme Court has \nnoted that a jury can responsibly perform its function whether they are \nrequired to act unanimously or allowed to decide the case on a vote of \n10 to 2.\n  There are cases where a requirement of unanimity produced a hung jury \nwhere had there been a nonunanimous allowance the jury would have voted \nto convict or acquit. Yet, in both instances, the defendant is accorded \nhis constitutional right of a judgment by his peers. It is my firm \nbelief that this legislation will not undermine the pillars of justice \nor result in the conviction of innocent persons.\n\n  The American people, I believe, will strongly support change in the \nFederal rules of criminal and civil procedure to allow a jury \nconviction by a vote of 10 to 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to deplore Iran's \nabominable human rights practices, and to remind my colleagues that \nIran's continued abuse of the fundamental rights of its own citizens is \none of the reasons why I have offered legislation intended to increase \neconomic pressure on this outlaw regime in Tehran.\n  Human rights organizations all over the world have been deploring the \nIslamic Republic of Iran's human rights abuses against women, religious \nand ethnic minorities for years.\n  This is a country that sentences women to death for adultery, and \nthen carries out the death penalty by bundling them into a postal sac \nand throwing them from the roof of a 10-story building.\n  This is a country that still carries out public stonings, and even \nhas a strict legal code to govern the size stones citizens are to use \nto stone their fellow citizens. Stones too large are not to be used, \nbecause death will be inflicted too quickly. Stones too small are to be \navoided, because death doesn't come at all. The stones have to be just \nthe right size to allow the victim to suffer for a very long time, and \nto ensure that they will die of their wounds.\n  This is a country that continues to use paramilitary security forces \nto harass and intimidate people in the street, and that closes \nnewspapers because of a political cartoon comparing the Supreme Leader \nto a comic strip figure.\n  This is a country where to be a candidate in an election you must \nfirst be deemed to be a supporter of the sitting Government. And this \nis a country, Mr. President, that continues to be cited, year after \nyear, by the Special Representative of the U.N. Subcommission on Human \nRights for its systematic use of torture, arbitrary arrests, and \nsummary executions.\n  These practices were described in an article appearing in a Paris-\nbased newsletter nearly 5 years ago, which I ask to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks, along with more recent material \nsupplied to my office by the Foundation for Democracy in Iran, a human \nrights advocacy group.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call your attention to a few of the \nlesser known human rights abuses of the clerical regime in Tehran: its \nrepression of religious and ethnic minorities.\n  As cited by the 1995 report of Middle East Watch, and the February \n1994 report of U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights for Iran, \nthe Iranian security forces conduct arbitrary arrests of Kurdish, \nBalouch, Turkomen, and other ethnic minorities, and to subject these \nminorities to cruel and degrading punishments in Iranian jails, \nincluding torture and summary execution.\n  Similarly, as the State Department's February 1995 Report on Human \nRights points out, the clerical regime discriminates against citizens \nof other religious persuasions than the dominant Shiite Moslem faith. \nBaha'is, Jews, and Sunni Muslims have been arrested over the past year \nfor no other reason than their faith, and some of these individuals \nhave been executed.\n  In fact, the Islamic Republic has engaged in a deliberate policy to \nsuppress the rights of its Sunni minority, and in particular members of \nthe Balouchi tribes in eastern Iran. On February 1, 1994, riots broke \nout in Zahedan, Mashed, and Khaf after 500 municipal workers demolished \na Sunni mosque in the Zahedan district. On January 10, 1993, Iranian \nRevolutionary Guards troops attacked Balouchi residents in the village \nof Robat, when the homes of an estimated 50 families were set on fire \nin an attempt to secure a single individual, Haji Pirdad. The U.N. \nSpecial Representative for Human Rights reported on February 2, 1994 \nthat 20 Balouchis were executed in December 1992 and February 1993 in \nZahedan prison, while Amnesty International reported that 42 Balouchis \nincluding minors were executed between November 1991 and March 1992.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that this behavior by the Islamic Republic \njust goes to show that we are dealing with an outlaw regime that cares \nlittle about its own people. If it cares so little about its own \npeople, how will it act toward others?\n  Iran is isolated and universally viewed as a pariah state. Its \nactions are abhorrent to the civilized world. As long as this warped, \nterroristic regime continues to punish the Iranian people with its \nmisrule, this condition will continue. The tyrants in Tehran must \nunderstand their aggression and abuse of the good people of Iran will \nnot last, and one day they will be brought to task for their actions.\n  While the tyrants continue to rule in Tehran, sanctions are a clear \nway to keep up the pressure on Iran and to deny them the ability to \ncarry out their aggression on the outside world as well as against \ntheir own people. We do not take these issues lightly. It is a pity \nthat the regime cannot act like a civilized country and not be so \nabusive. If only Iran would not conduct these brutal actions, we would \nnot have to place sanctions on it.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From Mednews, No. 4.4, Dec. 3, 1990]\n\n                      Human Rights Abuses in Iran\n\n       The ``moderate'' regime in Tehran so dear to Washington \n     policymakers has failed the test again--the test of human \n     rights. Three recent reports on human rights abuses in Iran \n     show beyond a doubt that extreme caution is still needed in \n     dealings with the current regime in Iran.\n       The reports were prepared independently by Amnesty \n     International, the United Nations, a Paris-based Iranian \n     exile group, the Foundation for the Independence of Iran. All \n     three conclude unequivocally that human rights abuses have \n     increased markedly since the end of the Gulf war, despite \n     Iranian government claims to the contrary.\n       In his second report in thirteen months, which was released \n     in late November, the UN's Reynaldo Galindo Pohl confirms \n     that at least 113 Iranians have been executed since March 21, \n     the start of the Iranian New Year.\n       In fact, Pohl's figures fall far short of the mark--once \n     again. Accounts published in the official Iranian media alone \n     show more than 600 deaths by execution since March 21. Last \n     year, that figure reached 2,500. When he questioned the \n     Iranian authorities about the executions during his first \n     visit to Tehran during the fall of 1989, Mr. Pohl was told \n     that the victims were ``ordinary criminals,'' not political \n     prisoners, and that all had been ``treated in confirmity with \n     the Ta'zirat and the standards of Islamic law.'' Allegations \n     of torture and summary execution were groundless, Pohl \n     explained, since Iran did not maintain that its laws adhered \n     to the universal declaration of human rights.\n       Amnesty International recently quoted Iran's ``Islamic'' \n     law on lapidation and concluded: ``In Iran, stoning someone \n     to death isn't against the law. Using the wrong stone is.'' \n     [See illustration.] Yet another Amnesty report on Human \n     Rights abuses in Iran is scheduled for release on December 5.\n       The Foundation for the Independence of Iran has chosen to \n     stick to accounts published in the Iranian press, and \n     recently presented a detailed report to the French government \n     on human rights abuses in Iran.\n       Here are just a few of the more startling examples the \n     Foundation discovered:\n       July 26: Keyhan announces that forty women have recently \n     been stoned to death. ``Whippings, sectioning of fingers and \n     hands are common punishments'' in Iranian prisons.\n       August 17: The Iranian Press Agency (Irna), quoted by \n     Nimrooz, acknowledges that 14,000 persons have been arrested \n     during the past two months, mostly for drug trafficking. On \n     the personal orders of President Rafsanjani and Intelligence \n     Minister Fallayian, they were deported to work camps on the \n     Island of Endourabi.\n       August 24: Nimrooz reported that a woman accused by her \n     husband of infidelity was sentenced to an unusual death in \n     Tehran. She was sewn into a burlap bag and thrown off the \n     roof of the Ministry of Justice.\n       August 30: Keyhan reports that 45-year old Ebaolollah Kiani \n     was condemned to death by stoning in the central square of \n     the town of Nahavandi, for having had intercourse with a \n     woman.\n\n[[Page S 17535]]\n\n       August 31: Nimrooz reports that anti-government slogans \n     chanted during a football match in Tehran led to mass \n     arrests. Two thousand persons received prison terms ranging \n     from 5 years to life, while many others were executed, \n     [Opposition sources believe as many as 400 were sentenced to \n     death].\n       September 7: Nimrooz reports that a fight between two men \n     in the town of Rey ended in blows and the death of one of the \n     men, Hassan Ahmadi. As punishment, the mollahs of the town \n     ordered that his assailant, Nader Zandi, be taken to the town \n     square and beaten to death by the crowd, under the principle \n     ``an eye for an eye . . .''\n       September 13: Keyhan lists the names of 51 persons who were \n     hanged in a single day in the cities of Mashad and Khach, on \n     charges of drug-trafficking and illegal possession of \n     weapons.\n       October 4: Keyhan lists the names of 65 persons executed by \n     hanging in the towns of Mashad, Zahedan, Malayer, Busheir, \n     Ardebil, and Sabzevar. In Kermanshah two petty criminals had \n     fingers chopped off as punishment for theft.\n       Meeting with members of the French government's Human \n     Rights Commission on November 22, the Foundation's President, \n     Colonel Hassan Aghilipour, noted that the new European \n     Charter just signed by 34 heads of State in Paris ``devoted \n     45 lines to human rights,'' while in Iran executions and \n     deportations were occurring daily. ``There are 150,000 \n     Iranians now condemned to Islamic gulags in the southeast of \n     Iran and on the Persian Gulf islands,'' Aghilipour said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 20, 1995.\n     Subject: Execution and arrest of Kurds in Iran.\n\n                    Foundation for Democracy in Iran\n\n       The Foundation for Democracy in Iran is concerned over \n     recent reports from Iranian Kurdistan regarding the execution \n     of 10 Kurds and the arrest of at least 26 others.\n       According to the opposition Democratic Party of Iranian \n     Kurdistan (DPIK). 10 Kurdish political prisoners accused by \n     the regime of being DPIK supporters were executed or died \n     under torture in late September.\n       Six of the prisoners, Kurdish villagers from northwestern \n     Iran, were executed by firing squad after a year of detention \n     in Orumiyeh prison, the group said. Three others died under \n     torture. The tenth, a Kurdish villager identified as Rashid \n     Abubakri, was hanged on Sept. 21, also in Orumiyeh prison. \n     All were detained and executed on the grounds they were \n     supporters of a banned political opposition group.\n       In early October, the Iranian press reported that 345 \n     persons had been arrested in Orumiyeh district at the same \n     time as the alleged DPIK sympathizers were executed. On \n     October 7, 1995, the DPIK released the names of 26 Kurdish \n     civilians it claims have been arrested over the past two \n     months in the Orumiyeh and Salmas regions in northwestern \n     Iran, on charges of cooperating with a banned political \n     opposition group. Those arrested were identified as follows:\n       1. Asgar Darbazi, son of Omar, native of the village of \n     Barazi.\n       2. Aziz Hayavani, son of Shino, native of the village of \n     Barazi.\n       3. Pros Azizi, son of Hussein, native of the village of \n     Barazi.\n       4. Dino Ibrahimi, son of Saleh, native of the village of \n     Barazi.\n       5. Salahaddin Faghapur, son of Saleh, native of the village \n     of Barazi.\n       6. Ghamar Mirazai, son of Timur, native of the village of \n     Dostan.\n       7. Saleh Amini, son of Khaled, native of the village of \n     Gozek.\n       8. Yunes Amini, his son, born in the same village.\n       9. Naji Mohammadi, son of Mohammad, native of the village \n     of Gozek.\n       10. Omar Mohammadi, son of Timur, native of the village of \n     Gozek.\n       11. Doctor Shirvan, son of Mostafa, native of the village \n     of Haraklan.\n       12. Sadigh Alizadeh, son of Abubakr, native of the village \n     of Haraklan.\n       13. Afshar Laal, son of Abdul Rahman, native of the village \n     of Kalarash-Sofla.\n       14. Shafigh Hakkari, son of Reza, native of the village of \n     Kalarash-Sofla.\n       15. Bakra Hakkari, son of Sultan, native of the village of \n     Kalarash-Sofla.\n       16. Taghsim Mirzai, son of Mirza, native of the village of \n     Tarikan.\n       17. Nuraddeen Taheri, son of Jahanghir, native of the \n     village of Tarikan.\n       18. Farhad Zareh, son of Sayda, native of the village of \n     Sharvani.\n       19. Tajaddeen Faghazadeh, son of Sadigh, native of the \n     village of Sharvani.\n       20. Nasser Zarch, son of Mullah Sultan, native of the \n     village of Sharvani.\n       21. Majid Husseini, son of Mullah Sayed, native of the \n     village of Sharvani.\n       22.

Ahmad Sultani, son of Smeh, native of the village of \n     Islamabad.\n       The Foundation condemns the execution of individuals for \n     their political beliefs, and calls on the UN Rapporteur for \n     Human Rights to investigate these reports. The Foundation \n     further condemns the recent round-ups of Kurdish civilians by \n     the Iranian authorities as a clear attempt to intimidate \n     citizens from the legitimate non-violent expression of their \n     political beliefs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 22, 1995.\n     Subject: New Security Violates Human Rights.\n\n                    Foundation for Democracy in Iran\n\n       The Foundation for Democracy in Iran is concerned that a \n     sweeping new security law voted by the Iranian Parliament \n     (Majlis) on October 17 adds a new threat to the human rights \n     of ordinary Iranian citizens. The new law criminalizes a wide \n     variety of non-violent political activity, and creates broad \n     categories of ``seditious'' behavior that are punishable by \n     law. It also creates a sweeping new ``national security'' \n     provision, which can be used against political opponents both \n     inside and outside Iran. This new law goes far beyond \n     existing statutes in the Islamic Republic and suggests that \n     recent riots in South Tehran and labor strikes in major \n     factories may have destabilized the regime much more than \n     previously thought.\n       The law imposes a penalty of two to ten years in prison for \n     anyone, regardless of ideology, who forms or leads a group of \n     more than two members, in Iran or abroad, with the aim of \n     threatening the country's security, Tehran radio reported. \n     For defendants who are found by an Islamic court to be \n     ``mohareb''--infidels--the penalty is death.\n       Under this provision, the Islamic Republic could claim \n     legal justification in kidnapping political opponents living \n     outside of Iran. A first instance of this appears to have \n     occurred on September 27, when Ali Tavassoli, a former \n     central committee of the Fedayeen (Majority) Organization, \n     was reportedly kidnapped by Iranian government agents in \n     Baku. Mr. Tavassoli had traveled to Azerbaijan from Britain \n     for a business meeting. According to the Fedayeen he had \n     retired from their active leadership in 1989.\n       Other provisions of the new law raise the intimidation \n     level against ordinary Iranians for any contact with \n     foreigners or fellow citizens suspect of contact with \n     foreigners.\n       The new law:\n       imposes a maximum ten year jail sentence on anyone \n     convicted of passing ``confidential'' information on Iran's \n     domestic or foreign policies to unauthorized persons;\n       imposes a maximum ten year jail sentence on ``attempts to \n     demoralize the armed forces and the police,'' including \n     appeals to soldiers to desert.\n       a maximum five year jail sentence for foreign nationals \n     caught spying in Iran on behalf of a foreign state;\n       This sweeping new security law is a clear violation of the \n     fundamental human rights of Iranian citizens. The Foundation \n     vigorously condemns these efforts by the Iranian regime, and \n     calls on Iran's Majlis to rescind the law before it goes into \n     effect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17534-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17535-S17536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE DEATH OF HENRY J. KNOTT, SR.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with great sadness, I rise today \nto pay tribute to an extraordinary man. Henry J. Knott, Sr., died \nyesterday at the age of 89. For many decades, we knew him in Baltimore \nand throughout Maryland as a talented businessman and a philanthropist \nwhose generosity knew no bounds.\n  I first want to express my deepest condolences to his wife of 67 \nyears, Marion Burk Knott, his 12 children, his 51 grandchildren, and \nhis 55 great-grandchildren.\n  People in positions of power and responsibility should serve as role \nmodels for our young people and give something back to their \ncommunities. I have great admiration for people who have a sense of \ncivic responsibility, for people who try to make their community a \nbetter place to live.\n  Mr. Knott epitomized these qualities. Throughout his career, he \nsought to help those less fortunate than himself get a better education \nand lead better lives. He donated millions of dollars to Catholic \neducational institutions like his alma mater, Loyola College; Mount St. \nMary's College, Emmitsburg; the College of Notre Dame in Maryland; and \nthe University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\n  His legendary generosity extended well beyond education. He provided \nenormous help to health and cultural institutions as well. He donated \nessential funds to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Johns Hopkins \nOncology Center, and several Baltimore hospitals to help them establish \nan income fund to provide medical care for the poor.\n  His many business activities earned him a reputation as a highly \ndisciplined and hard-working person. But his civic and charitable \nactivities showed us that he was also an extremely modest person who \nhad very deep feelings for the Catholic Church, his community, and the \npeople around him.\n  In a 1987 Baltimore Magazine article, he was asked about his \nprodigious philanthropy. He replied that making money was ``like \ncatching fish. You get up early. You fill the boat up with fish. \n\n[[Page S 17536]]\n And then you give them all away before they start to rot.''

Mr. President, I find it necessary today to set \nthe record straight on the issue of domestic sugar policy. My remarks \nare in reference to comments made on November 17, 1995, by my good \nfriend from Nevada, Senator Reid, and on November 18, 1995, by my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg.\n\n\n                 Everyone Benefits From Family Farmers\n\n  First, let me tell you about the significant importance of sugar to \nmy State of Idaho; 1,800 family farms raise sugar beets on an annual \nbasis. These farms combine to grow over 200,000 acres and produce over \n5 million tons of sugar beets. Sugar beets are the third largest crop \nin Idaho after potatoes and wheat.\n  Sugar-beets are also important to the communities where these family \nfarmers live. Farmers generate sales at local businesses for their \nvehicles, fuel, farm implements, irrigation materials, fertilizer, and \nother inputs.\n  These sugar-beet farmers are also efficient. Of the 31 countries \naround the world that produce beet sugar, the U.S. beet-sugar industry \nis the second lowest cost producer. While these farmers are efficient, \nthey need the stability of U.S. sugar policy to compete against unfair \nsubsidies and trade practices used by foreign countries.\n  Sugar beets provide direct employment opportunities in Idaho \ncommunities. There are three processing facilities in Idaho--plus one \nin nearby Nyssa, OR--owned by the Amalgamated Sugar Co., that combine \nto pay in excess of $45 million in salary and wages to their employees. \nThere are 1,200 people employed year round and at the seasonal peak \ntotal employment approaches 4,000 people.\n  The Amalgamated Sugar Co., also pays $50 million annually to the \ntruck and rail transporters of raw beet sugar and the finished \nproducts.\n\n\n                          Erroneous GAO Report\n\n  My colleagues cited an erroneous figure of $1.4 billion in annual \nconsumer costs. This figure is based on an April 1993 General \nAccounting Office report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently \nadmonished the GAO report for its flawed estimates, omitted data and \nambiguous results.\n  In an October 24, 1995, letter, Under Secretary Gene Moos wrote that\n\n       Some data were used incorrectly and important data and \n     sugar market issues were not considered . . . Based on this \n     world price estimate and an average U.S. sweetener price over \n     1992-1994, a more normal price period, it can be shown using \n     GAO's methodology, that there are no costs to domestic users \n     and consumers.\n\n  Mr. Moos continues:\n\n       The estimated effects of the U.S. sugar program are highly \n     sensitive to expected world prices if global sugar trade is \n     liberalized. GAO's analysis, in my judgement, does not \n     adequately consider the complexities and dynamics of the U.S. \n     and global sugar markets.\n\n  The erroneous GAO results have been misinterpreted by my colleagues. \nFirst, the mistaken $1.4 billion cost is not a payment to beet or cane \nproducers. Sugar is not like the wheat or corn program; sugar farmers \ndo not receive a Government payment. Rather, sugar growers pay a \nmarketing assessment on their sugar that goes directly toward deficit \nreduction. Over the course of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, the \nsugar assessment will provide $287 million in deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I ask that the text \nof the letter from Mr. Moos of USDA to Representative Patsy Mink \nregarding the erroneous GAO report be printed in its entirety.\n\n\n                      World and U.S. Sugar Prices\n\n  To fully understand the selling price of sugar here and abroad, my \ncolleagues need additional insight and information.\n  It is important to realize that the world sugar market is very \nvolatile due to the small quantities traded and large number of \ncountries with protectionist policies. According to USDA, all 110 \ncountries producing sugar subsidize their sugar production, \nconsumption, and/or trade in some way.\n  The world price of sugar has ranged from more than 60 cents per pound \nin 1974 and more than 40 cents per pound in 1980 to less than 3 cents \nper pound in 1985.\n  This world price does not correspond with the world cost of \nproduction. In fact, a 1994 Landell Mills study showed that the world \nprice average of 8.4 cents per pound between 1982-92 and the average \ncost of production was estimated at 17.5 cents per pound during the \nsame period.\n  This obvious presence of a world dump market does not and would not \nallow foreign needs to meet domestic demands at the suggested lower \nprice. U.S. consumers use about 9 million tons of sugar each year, \nwhich is equal to more than a third of the total sugar traded on the \nworld market each year.\n\n\n                           Program Extension\n\n  The gentleman from New Hampshire also took issue with the fact that \nthe sugar program was extended for 7 years. Mr. President, for the \nrecord I would like to note that all agricultural commodities were \nextended for 7 years. Yes, every single commodity in the ag title of \nthe Balanced Budget Act. This includes not only sugar, but wheat, \ncotton, rice, peanuts, corn, and barley.\n  I would point out that the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was designed \nto achieve a fiscal balance by 2002 and thus most, if not all, of the \nbill's provisions were approved in 7-year time-frames.\n\n\n                       Record of Committee Review\n\n  For the record, I would also like to review the process of hearings \nand committee markups that the sugar section of the bill underwent \nprior to final inclusion. To suggest that the sugar program slipped \ninto the bill is an insult to the members of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Last December, the Agriculture Committee chairman, Senator Lugar, \nasked 53 questions about domestic agriculture and rural policy that \nbegan an extremely comprehensive schedule of committee hearings. Eight \nfull committee hearings were held between March and June to form the \nfoundation of the 1995 agricultural legislation. Four subcommittee \nhearings were also held in May and June. In addition, I personally \nchaired a field hearing in Pocatello, ID, on August 15 to thoroughly \nreview farm policy, including \n\n[[Page S 17537]]\nsugar. In addition, the full committee participated in 2 days of \nlengthy debate in late September prior to final approval of the bill.\n\n\n                  Sugar Program Passes the Reform Test\n\n  In closing let me briefly review the significant reform submitted as \na result of the thorough committee process and recently approved by the \nCongress in section 1107 of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  The sugar program of the future is definitely not the sugar program \nof the past. Consistent with the other ag policy changes, the sugar \nprogram contributed to deficit reduction and was rewritten to more \nclosely respond to market signals.\n  Sugar program reform included the removal of marketing allotments, a \nshift to recourse loans, an increased assessment, and a penalty that \neffectively lowers the loan rate by a penny.\n  In past years, sugar production was controlled by a system of \nmarketing allotments. This bill removes those production controls. The \nGovernment will no longer tell farmers where and in what quantity they \ncan raise sugar. This major reform signifies the end of sugar-supply \nmanagement.\n  A recourse loan provision will now apply to the sugar program. Other \ncommodities, and previously sugar, utilized a nonrecourse loan program. \nThis meant the Government had no means of recovering a defaulted loan \nexcept collection of the commodity used as collateral. The new sugar \nprogram will not allow that risk to the Federal Government. This is \nsignificant to farmers, because it eliminates any guarantee of previous \nminimum payments.\n  The most significant reform provision is a new penalty on any sugar \nthat is forfeited to the Government. This 1-cent penalty effectively \nlowers the loan rate by a penny. That occurs because the loan holders \nwill lower the sales price of their sugar to avoid paying the newly \ninstated penalty.\n  There are significant real life effects of a 1-cent decrease in the \nsugar loan rate. The average Idaho farmer raises 128 acres of sugar \nbeets according to the latest data. The USDA says they will average 25 \ntons of sugar beets per acre this year and, given the national average \nextraction rate, this means they will produce 6,924 pounds of refined \nsugar on each acre they harvest in Idaho.\n  In Idaho, like most of the rest of the areas where sugar beets are \ngrown, the farmer has a contract with the company that processes the \nsugar beets and it provides that the farmer will get 60 percent of the \nvalue of the sugar he produces.\n  Thus, the farmer's share of 1-cent reduction is 60 percent, Six-\ntenths of a cent a pound times 6,924 pounds per acre equals $41.55; \n$41.55 loss per acre times the average Idaho farmer's 128 acres equals \n$5,318.40.\n  Let me repeat, a 1-cent reduction in the value of sugar per pound \nwill cost the average Idaho farmer $5,318.40.\n  That $5,318.40 is very often the difference between profit and loss \nfor many farmers even during prosperous, let alone difficult, economic \ntimes in rural America.\n  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the loss to producers would \nbe passed on as savings to consumers.\n  A 1-cent reduction might seem minimal to those not familiar with the \nprogram, but it is not.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask that my colleagues consider my words \ncarefully and come to appreciate the reforms that have been made to the \ndomestic sugar program. I also want to commend the other members of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee that combined to craft sugar policy that \nthis Congress can be proud to point to as an example of market driven \nreform. Most importantly, I offer my gratitude to the farmers and \nranchers from across this country that continue to produce a bountiful, \nsafe, and reasonably priced food supply.\n  The text of the letter follows:\n\n                                    Department of Agriculture,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Patsy T. Mink,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congresswoman Mink: Thank you for your letter of July \n     26, 1995, concerning the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     report that stated that the U.S. sugar program costs domestic \n     users and consumers an average of $1.4 billion annually and \n     GAO's July 1995 analysis that the sugar program cost the \n     Government an additional $90 million in 1994 for its food \n     purchase and food assistance programs.\n       In my opinion, GAO's April 1993 report was flawed in its \n     estimates. Some data were used incorrectly and important data \n     and sugar market issues were not considered. Based on GAO's \n     methodology, but by selecting prices in different time \n     periods, the results are more ambiguous. Depending on the \n     timeframe, one may contend that the domestic sugar program \n     either costs or benefits U.S. users and consumers.\n       GAO's estimate of $1.4 billion annually was based on an \n     assumption of a long-run equilibrium world price of 15.0 \n     cents per pound of raw sugar if all countries liberalized \n     sugar trade. GAO added a transportation cost of 1.5 cents per \n     pound of raw sugar to derive a landed U.S. price (elsewhere \n     in the report GAO stated that the transportation cost \n     adjustment should be 2.0 cents per pound.) To derive a world \n     price of refined sugar of 20.5 cents per pound, GAO added a \n     refining spread of 4.0 cents per pound.\n       GAO compared its constructed U.S. sweetener price with its \n     derived world price. However, GAO constructed the U.S. price \n     for the 1989-1991 period during which 1989 and 1990 were \n     unusually high price years for U.S. refined sugar. This \n     exaggerated the difference between the so-called world \n     derived price and the U.S. sweetener price. By selecting a \n     period of world price spikes, such as 1973-1975, GAO's \n     analysis would show an annual savings to domestic users and \n     consumers of $350 to $400 million.\n       Clearly, the expected world price of raw sugar with global \n     liberalization is critical to any analyses of the effects of \n     the U.S. sugar program. In 1993, the Australian Bureau of \n     Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimated that \n     sugar trade liberalization in the United States, European \n     Union, and Japan alone would result in an average world price \n     of 17.6 cents per pound of raw sugar--2.6 cents per pound \n     higher than GAO's derived world price.\n       Based on the ABARE analysis and using a transportation cost \n     of 1.75 cents per pound, which more accurately reflects \n     global transportation costs to the United States, plus a \n     refining spread of 4.27 cents per pound (Landell Mills \n     Commodities Studies, Incorporated), a world price of refined \n     sugar is estimated at 23.6 cents per pound. Based on this \n     world price estimate and an average U.S. sweetener price over \n     1992-1994, a more normal price period, it can be shown using \n     GAO's methodology, that there are no costs to domestic users \n     and consumers.\n       The estimated effects of the U.S. sugar program are highly \n     sensitive to expected world prices if global sugar trade is \n     liberalized. GAO's analysis, in my judgment, does not \n     adequately consider the complexities and dynamics of the U.S. \n     and global sugar markets.\n       With respect to the effects of the U.S. sugar program on \n     Government costs of its food purchase and assistance \n     programs, an independent analysis by the Economic Research \n     Service (ERS) estimates the cost at $84 million based on the \n     difference between U.S. and world refined sugar prices in \n     1994. However, just as for the GAO analysis, different \n     effects could be estimated by using other time periods when \n     the price gap between U.S. and world prices was smaller. \n     Moreover, with global liberalization, the price gap would \n     narrow because of the dynamics of adjustment which were not \n     considered in the ERS analysis.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Eugene Moos,\n\n                                      Under Secretary for Farm and\n     Foreign Agricultural Services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17536-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17537-S17538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ISRAEL COHEN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat man and a great friend. Late last Wednesday, Israel Cohen, the \nchairman of Giant Food, passed away at 83.\n  Izzy Cohen was more than simply a successful businessman. He was a \nleader. He understood the complicated relationship between labor and \nmanagement as well as, if not better than, anyone I can remember. He \nknew that the success of his business was directly related to the \nhealth and well-being of his employees. He was a man who always had \ntime to visit with his employees, no matter how busy he may have been. \nHe worked as hard for them as they did for him.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post ran a story about Izzy on Friday, \nNovember 24. The story tells of employees waiting around after putting \nin a full shift to meet and shake hands with him. It tells how he \ncreated a family atmosphere with his employees, refusing to be called \nMr. Cohen, but insisting on Izzy. It stresses his most fundamental \nphilosophy: to recognize the value and importance of every single \nworker at his stores, from the President of the company to the high-\nschooler who bags groceries on Saturday afternoons.\n  It tells of his dedication to providing the best service possible--\neven if that meant he had to jump in behind a cash \n\n[[Page S 17538]]\nregister and bag a customer's groceries himself. This is a lesson from \nwhich every American should learn.\n  But Izzy Cohen was more than just a businessman. He was a good \nfriend. He never hesitated to share his feelings and insights with me, \nto help me get a better perspective on whatever issue was foremost on \nmy mind.\n  There is a lesson for all of us in Izzy Cohen's life: The most \nsuccessful businesses are the ones in which workers and management act \nas a team. He proved that when management takes care of its workers, \nthe workers will take care of management.\n  Mr. President, the two groups are inextricably linked. Each relies on \nthe other to succeed. And when the workers feel that they are getting a \nfair shake, that the boss is looking out for them, they will do \neverything they can to ensure the vitality of the business.\n  It is my hope and belief that those who take over for Izzy Cohen will \ncontinue his work. I would also like to see workers and managers all \nacross America learn from Izzy's example so that both groups, working \ntogether, achieve the success he and his employees have realized over \nthe past 60 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17537-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE AFTERMATH OF THE ASSASSINATION OF YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly \non the aftermath of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak \nRabin.\n  Following this tragedy, there was a great hue and cry as to who was \nresponsible for the assassination.

Mr. President, I followed with great interest the comments \nmade on the floor today, and on previous days, regarding the \nPresident's speech this evening on the situation in Bosnia and our \npotential participation in that effort.\n  I have said all along that I thought the odds were stacked against a \npeace agreement that we could work on and that had sufficient detail to \nenhance the likelihood of doing some good in that troubled area of the \nworld.\n  We do, however, have an agreement that has been hammered out in \nDayton. We should look at several things with regard to the agreement \nand what happens after the agreement. I said all along--and I say again \ntoday--the agreement must be specific in its detail. You cannot draw a \nline that is not exact. We cannot go over there and put our people in \nharm's way and find out later that something was not agreed to or that \na line was not agreed to, or was not marked out closely enough. We must \nknow precisely what we are protecting and who we are keeping apart. \nThat kind of detail appears to have been worked out in Dayton.\n  Today we got a copy of the Proximity Peace Talks. In this, they \nspecify that we will use 1,000 to 50,000 scale maps and charts. This \nwill define the lines down to within 50 meters. Local commanders \nenforcing the truce within those areas will get together with the local \npeople to define it even down below that 155 or 160 feet that would be \nthe 50 meters. That is a pretty good definition of road intersections \nand road routes, and all are listed here; they are well defined. We \nwant to see this carried out. It appears that we are well along the way \ntoward defining the agreement in its initial phases.\n  The final agreement that will be signed in Paris--not just \ninitialed--will even go into more detail, as I understand it. So the \nfirst requirement of a peace over there, and for our participation in \nit, or even considering American participation in it, is to see that we \ndo have that agreement signed with as much detail as possible.\n  Now, a second requirement is a tough one. That is, a cease-fire has \nto have taken place and be in effect. That sounds great. Some may think \nthat the military commander puts out word and the cease-fire occurs and \nthat is it. That is not the way it works in that Balkan area. We were \nbriefed on our trip there several weeks ago. One of the big problems \nover there is that 20 to 50 percent of the people in combat over there \nare not the regular troops that receive commands down the military \nchain of command. They are what are called the ``irregulars,'' those \nwho have a village they have been used to defending. They may have a \nrifle, and one man may be mowing hay one day and he decides it is his \nturn to protect whatever they are protecting. He then relieves another \nfellow and maybe takes the same rifle. That other man then goes back \nand cuts hay for a while. They take turns.\n  Those irregulars that have interests in particular local areas have \nbeen the primary reason why the more than 30 cease-fire agreements have \nfailed in the last couple of years. Over 30 agreements have failed \nbecause the irregulars are not really taking their orders from anyone. \nOnce they start firing, other firing starts, and the whole thing breaks \ndown again.\n  So these two things must be in place before we can even consider \nsending Americans in there. One, the agreement must be worked out \ndefining \n\n[[Page S 17539]]\nvery, very specifically the borders of what belongs in one jurisdiction \nand what belongs in another. The second is that the cease-fire has to \nhave actually occurred, and that includes the irregulars.\n  The Proximity Peace Talk agreement document says: ``The parties also \ncommit themselves to disarm and disband all armed civilian groups, \nexcept for authorized police forces, within 30 days after the Transfer \nof Authority.''\n  The definition of the lines is in another section. It says the lines \nwill be ``accurate to within approximately 50 meters. During the period \nin which the IFOR is deployed, the IFOR commander shall have the right \nto determine, after consultation with the parties, the exact \ndelineation of such lines and zones, provided that with respect to \nSarajevo the IFOR commander shall have the right to adjust the Zone of \nSeparation as necessary.''\n  They were able to hammer this out and get all parties to initial this \nagreement, and we hope to have the signing in Paris before too long.\n  Why is it necessary that we go in at all? If they are willing to go \nto this length and say we agree we are all tired of war and that is the \nreason they have come as far as they have--we are tired of war and do \nnot want to fight anymore. We are tired of the killing, tired of seeing \npeople killed, and over 250,000 people have been killed. We are tired \nof seeing 2 million refugees floating from one place to another. They \nwant peace.\n  You may ask if they want peace that badly, why can they not just stop \nfighting? Well, they have a long history, going back several hundred \nyears, of not trusting each other and not fully trusting the people in \nEurope either. But they trust the United States. To our credit, they \ntrust us, and so we can be a party for good in that part of the world, \nif we want to be. And if the agreement is signed and if a cease-fire \nhas taken place, then we can keep these irregulars, which I defined a \nmoment ago, from breaking the peace within the 2- to 4-kilometer-wide \narea between the previously warring parties.\n  They want peace. If we can help implement it, it seems to me that we \ncan do a great service by doing that.\n  Secretary Perry described yesterday, once again, the fact that we \nwould not fight our way in. I heard comments on the floor today about \nwhether we are to create peace or not. We are not there to create \npeace. We are not there to take one side or the other or carry \nanybody's battle for them. We are there to maintain a peace that will \nhave been established before we move in, with the agreement signed by \nall parties and with a cease-fire actually having occurred--or we do \nnot go in.\n  We can help them achieve this peace because the parties trust us as \nlong as we are involved. We did not fight our way in. We establish our \nseparation zones, and we move into those separation zones.\n  Local violations of the agreement will be met with a preponderance, \nan overpreponderance of force, as we were briefed by our military \ncommanders in Europe while on our trip just weeks ago.\n  This is not the U.N. rules of engagement. This is not debating and \nasking for permission to retaliate if fired upon. As it was described \nto us, if anyone fires on the forces in there, the implementation \nforces, they will be met with return fire of overwhelming support.\n  Now, say someone changes their mind about this, which has been in the \npaper the last couple of days. Say any of the participants that \ninitialed the agreement change their mind and say they now believe it \nis a bum deal, and ``we will not go on with what we initialed in \nDayton.'' In that case, our participation is not going to occur.\n  It is that simple. We are not there to go in and fight somebody's war \nfor them. We are there only to help implement a peace that they have \nsaid they, themselves, want and that they have initialed in Dayton, and \nwe would only go in after the final signing in Paris.\n  Any general attempt at breaking the agreement would mean that we \nwould not stay. We are not there to fight anybody's battle or establish \npeace throughout the Balkans by military action. We are there only to \nhelp separate the combatants for this 1-year period while they can see \nthe benefits of peace more than the war that has gone on there for far \ntoo long.\n  Let me put our involvement in a little bit different light. I believe \na little risk now--and there is a little risk--may enhance our long-\nterm leadership toward freedom and peace around the world, and in the \nlong run, perhaps, even save lives.\n  I think those who question American participation could well ask, why \ndid we keep our troops in Korea at the end of the Korean war? Because \nwe have been able to maintain peace in that area. How about the Middle \nEast? We are very much involved in the Mideast. I know we have a good \npercentage of our population of Jewish heritage, and they are \nparticularly interested in that part of the world, but I think our \ninterest goes well beyond that and we have tried to get a Mideast peace \nbecause we care.\n  We are a nation that wants to see peace. We do not like to see one \nnation fighting another. We are interested in the Mideast and the peace \nprocess there. We have pursued it for years and years and years. We \naccept that as part of the American way of doing good around the world, \nof putting into real terms our Christian-Judeo heritage of which we are \nso proud.\n  Mr. President, Americans want to alleviate suffering. We never want \nto see people being killed or hurt or one nation pitted against \nanother. Granted, we cannot take on all the world's problems, nor \nshould we try. Any time we move outside the confines of our own \ncountry, whatever the purpose is, we do take some risk.\n  There would be some risk in this situation, of course. I do not want \nto minimize this, but we take a little risk when we get up in the \nmorning and get out of bed, I guess every time we take an airplane out \nof a hangar and fly it. Yet, we are willing to take that risk for the \ngood that may come from it.\n  Have we taken any risks in the past? I imagine if we had a vote here \nin the Senate today as to whether we would want to keep the Peace Corps \nin operation, we would find that the Peace Corps would be rather \npopular. There would probably be no votes against ending the Peace \nCorps because it has done a lot of good around the world. But how many \nlives have been lost in the Peace Corps by people overseas killed in \naccidents or shot or catching some disease? They were put at risk \nbecause they went overseas. Do you know how many there are? We have \nlost 224 people that have died overseas in the Peace Corps. Yet we do \nnot say, pull the Peace Corps out because we have lost people overseas. \nWe would not do that.\n  Another issue that has repeatedly been raised is the fact that our \nleadership in NATO is very important. It is. As important as that is, I \npersonally do not think we would go into Bosnia-Herzegovina just \nbecause our NATO allies say we should go in. ``So, America, you lead \nour way into that area.''\n  If they were going in some other area we thought was not right, I \ndoubt we would want to rush in and be their leader just to show we are \npart of NATO. Too many American people, I think, do not have \nappreciation of NATO, though. Too many people in our country see NATO \nas a remnant of the cold war and not of the good things that NATO has \ndone. It has been the most successful peacekeeping operation in the \nhistory of this world.\n  At the present time, it is adapting under their own impetus with the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, cooperating with \nthe European Union, with the Partnership for Peace, which is in its \nfledgling status right now, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, \nwhich came into being in 1991. NATO has taken part in all of these \nthings and is a tremendous benefit for peace in the world.\n  We could even say that we have had economic benefits. Europe is an \neconomic entity and is now one of three major economic centers in the \nworld: Europe, Japan, and our own country.\n  The main point here is the tragedy and suffering in Bosnia. All \nparties are war weary. There is now a framework for peace with a \ndetailed agreement. If a cease-fire can come into place, we can move in \nand help stop what has been a tinderbox over the years and that helped \ntrigger World War I. We do not want to see that ever happen again.\n  Old enmities die hard. It is very complicated. There are ethnic, \nreligious, patriotic feelings in that area where \n\n[[Page S 17540]]\nthey do not trust each other. They trust us to come in and try and help \nimplement peace in that area.\n  This is one of the first times in history I think we have ever seen a \nsuperpower--and we are the world's superpower--that had no ulterior \nmotive, that had no territorial designs, and would help to spread the \nbenefits of democracy and freedom around the world. This is a place \nwhere, with perhaps little risk, we may enhance the long-term benefits \ntoward freedom and peace that will literally save lives.\n  I do not think we can withdraw from the world. We cannot withdraw to \nour own shores and take an isolationist stance. We can work for peace \nin that part of the world. I am thankful that we have not withdrawn \nfrom the rest of the world. We can be involved for good.\n\n  To those who say we are off on another do-gooder mission around the \nworld, I think we should take pride that we have a heritage of trying \nto do good, of trying to alleviate suffering, of trying to stop \nconflicts such as this one. We are a powerful nation that cares--truly \ncares about other people and what happens around the world. We care \nwhen 250,000 people have been killed. We care on a personal basis. We \nhave empathy for the people there who have lost children, husbands, \nfathers, mothers, wives. Two million refugees. So we care.\n  If we are to have leadership for the future, this is an opportunity \nfor us to do what we have done historically, to care for other people. \nObviously, we cannot take on everything in the world. But, here we can \nhelp to maintain the peace.\n  We stayed active around the world after World War I. We stayed active \nafter World War II and helped form the United Nations. We stayed active \nin Europe in partnership in NATO. Because of that alignment of the \nUnited States along with other nations, we have a world, now, which \nlooks much more peaceful into the future than it did just a few years \nago.\n  I would say thank God we have a nation like the United States, a \nsuperpower, that truly does care about the suffering and about the \ntragedy of what is going on in a place like the Balkans. Thank God we \nhave a nation like the United States, that wants the benefits of peace \nand cooperation for everyone. And thank God, if the conditions are \nright, if the agreement holds, and if the fighting has stopped, we are \nwilling to take the risk that will have to be taken if we are to do \nmuch good in that part of the world.\n  I look forward to President Clinton's speech this evening and his \nassessment of the situation. I believe that we want true, long-term \npeace in the world. I think we are a force for peace and freedom and \ntaking the small amount of risk to enforce the peace will be worth it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/27/senate-section/article/S17538-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
