Today there will be a period for morning business until 12 \no'clock noon, with Senators to speak for up to 5 minutes each, with the \nfollowing exceptions: Senator Grassley for 60 minutes--and I see he is \nhere and prepared to proceed--Senator Feinstein for 30 minutes, and \nSenator Daschle 30 minutes.\n  At 12 noon today, following morning business, the Senate will proceed \nto executive session to consider the nomination of Madeleine Albright \nto be Secretary of State. Under the order that has been agreed to, \nthere will be 2 hours and 10 minutes for debate on the nomination, with \nthe vote to occur at the conclusion or yielding back of the debate \ntime.\n  So I presume that will be around 10 minutes after 2 or so. It is my \nhope that some of that debate time will be yielded back so the Senate \nmay vote on the nomination early enough to accommodate our colleagues \nwho wish to attend the wake of former Senator Paul Tsongas.\n  Following the vote on the Albright nomination, I expect an additional \nperiod of morning business to allow Senators to introduce legislation \nthey have been working on or perhaps to make comments on bills that \nwere introduced yesterday.\n  Finally, I will announce that, if available later this week, the \nSenate may consider the nomination of our former colleague, Senator \nBill Cohen, to be Secretary of Defense. We are not sure exactly how \nthat will proceed. The committee is scheduled to have a hearing today. \nWe are looking at the possibility of whether or not it could be taken \nup either later today or, if not today, then late tomorrow after our \ndelegation returns from Massachusetts.\n  I had indicated to the President our desire to cooperate with him in \ngetting his foreign policy and defense Cabinet nominees in place as \nsoon as possible. So I would really like to see us get that done this \nweek. I know there will be support for that on both sides of the aisle.\n  Therefore, additional rollcall votes may occur today or this week and \nMembers will be notified accordingly. I think at this point there does \nnot appear to be a necessity for us to have votes on Friday, although I \nam not making that commitment yet. Just be prepared to have more votes \npossibly today and tomorrow, on Thursday.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S579-5", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

I just have heard so much, Mr. President, about a desire \nto return to less partisanship and more comity at both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue. I hope that might happen for the sake of this \ncountry.\n  I go back to an experience my father used to tell me about when I was \na child. It was in 1936. I was not yet alive. But my father was born, \nraised in Vermont. At that time it was probably the most Republican \nState in the Union, one of only two States, for example, that voted for \nAlf Landon in the Franklin Roosevelt landslide.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt came to Vermont in 1936, actually August \n1, 1936. He went in an open car down State Street in Montpelier. The \nNational Life Insurance Building had its headquarters at that time \nthere. My family had their home almost across the street where they had \nthe Leahy Press. My father, who was probably the only Democrat in \nMontpelier at the time, was standing in front of the National Life \nBuilding.\n  You must understand, National Life was sort of an adjunct to the \nRepublican Party. They would determine, along with a couple other \ncompanies, who would be Governor this year to the next year and the \nnext year at a time when we were solely a one-party State. I must say, \nas a Democrat I will have to admit they came up with some pretty good \nGovernors too, but very, very much a Republican hierarchy place.\n  As the car went by, the President of the National Life took off his \nhat, stood at attention holding it over his heart. My father, standing \nnext to him, said, ``I never thought I'd see the day that you would \ntake off your hat to Franklin Roosevelt.''\n  He turned to my father and said, ``Howard, I didn't take off my hat \nto Franklin Roosevelt. I took off my hat for the President of the \nUnited States of America.'' My father told me that story so many times \ngrowing up, and I had met the man who did that and I knew the facts of \nit. I recounted the story to a number of people, people writing books \nor speaking on this, as an example of a different era. Now, this man \nwould never have voted for Franklin Roosevelt. He would have supported \nwhoever ran against him, but he respected the office of the Presidency, \nas he respected the office of the Congress.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that all of us who serve in the Congress, in \nboth parties, would stop trying to figure out how best to tear down \nthese institutions. We are the most powerful democracy history has ever \nknown. We are the only superpower in the world today. That brings with \nit certain responsibilities--to stay both a democracy and so powerful a \ncountry. We did it because of the genius of our three-part Government--\nthe executive branch, legislative branch, and the judicial branch.\n  In recent years, with both Democrat and Republican Presidents, it has \nbecome a sport in this Nation to find every conceivable way to tear \nthem down no matter what they do. I would ask myself and the public, is \nit conceivable that any person, man or woman, Democrat or Republican, \ncould ever, anywhere in this Nation of 260 million people, reach the \nlevel of virtue and be the paragon that we seem to insist our President \nshould be? If so, then that person is not a representative of 260 \nmillion Americans. But we try every which way to diminish the power of \nthe Presidency, the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. In the \nSenate and in the House we do it to ourselves, so that, again, the \nrespect of the Nation is diminished. Now we see more and more attempts \nto do it to the judiciary.\n  Mr. President, let us stop and think. If we destroy, either by our \nactions or others', the respect that these institutions of Government \nmust have, how long do we remain a democracy and how long before the \nchecks and balances that have been so carefully built up, and built up \nbased on the trust of the American people, how long before that trust \nis destroyed, the checks and balances fail, and suddenly you have an \nopening for a person on horseback to come in and take over the reins of \npower of the last great nuclear superpower, with the largest economy in \nthe world, the most powerful nation on Earth, a nation that can justify \nits power and its position in this world only if it remains a \ndemocracy, only if it represents its own people, only if the reins of \npower maintain the respect of the people.\n  So I go back to that August day in Montpelier, VT, when that man was \nholding his hat over his heart as President Roosevelt went by, and as \nmy father, a loyal long-time Democrat, may God rest his soul, took his \nhat off and held it over his heart when President Eisenhower honored \nthe State of Vermont and drove through, and as I did, as a young \nprosecutor, for President Johnson and President Nixon and President \nBush and President Clinton, stand at attention, thinking how honored \nour State was that they came and brought with them the symbols of the \noffice of the Presidency.\n  Let us try. It is difficult in the time of the 30-second sound bites \nand special interest groups on the right and left. It is difficult when \npartisan feelings run high. But let us step back and say: Respect this \ncountry; respect the institutions; respect the integrity and the \nindependence of our judiciary; respect the good will and patriotism of \nthe men and women who have the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate \nand the House of Representatives; respect the fact that we, as a \nNation, elect our President, a President who constitutionally can serve \nonly 4 years at a time and no more than 8; respect the fact that we \nhave those checks and balances. Maybe we ought to work at making \nGovernment work and earn the respect of our people and not try in so \nmany ways to tear Government apart.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Iowa for his courtesy, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nif he\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nwould have any objection if I continue on another matter, with the \nunderstanding that, of course, I will yield the floor when one of his \nspeakers comes on the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No objection, assuming that if some of my cosponsors \ncome to the floor, he will yield to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S580-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MADELEINE ALBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are few jobs on Earth more demanding, \nor where the stakes are greater, than the Secretary of State of the \nUnited States. The daily business of most heads of state around the \nworld pales in comparison.\n  The President has made an outstanding nomination. Madeleine Albright \nbrings to this job a lifetime of experience. She has proven her \ntoughness and her fairness many times over. She has been an unwavering \nchampion of the fundamental ideals our Nation stands for.\n  She has been a strong voice for international human rights and the \ndignity of all people. She is going to be looked at by millions of \npeople all over the world--in democracies and countries that are not \ndemocratic--as our voice in foreign affairs.\n  My wife Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Madeleine \nAlbright for over 20 years. We have traveled with her and we have \nworked with her. I also had the privilege to be appointed as a \ncongressional delegate to the United Nations, when I joined with her in \nintroducing resolutions on landmines. I have always found her to be a \nperson of the highest integrity, the greatest ability, wide-ranging \nknowledge, and one real tough ambassador when she has to be, to protect \nthe interests of the United States.\n  On an issue dear to my heart, the abolition of antipersonnel \nlandmines, we could not ask for a more forceful or passionate advocate \nfor an international ban. Her trip to Angola last year and her poignant \ndescriptions of what she saw there gave a great boost to the effort to \nban landmines not only in this country, but worldwide.\n  The recent United Nations vote, with 156 nations in favor and none \nopposed, for a U.S. resolution calling for urgent negotiations on a \ntreaty to ban antipersonnel mines, was made possible in no small part \nbecause of Madeleine Albright's active role.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter she \nwrote to the editor of the Christian Science Monitor about her Angola \ntrip.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 11, 1996]\n\n                      Albright View of Land Mines\n\n       The author of ``A Sower of Land Mines Pleads to End Them,'' \n     Oct. 2, eloquently describes the horrific impact of land \n     mines around the world. Ending the devastation of what I have \n     called ``weapons of mass destruction in slow motion'' is a \n     high priority. As President Clinton told the United Nations \n     General Assembly just a few days ago, ``our children deserve \n     to walk this earth in safety.''\n       This is why the United States is at the forefront of \n     efforts to end the use of land mines and their stockpiling, \n     production, and transfer. In the last few months, dozens of \n     countries have joined a moratorium on these activities and in \n     a few weeks, at the direction of President Clinton, I will \n     introduce a resolution in the UN that will commit the world \n     community to negotiating and concluding an international \n     agreement designed to end the scourge of these dreadful \n     weapons forever.\n       At the same time, as the author discusses, tens of millions \n     of land mines are already in the ground and they go on \n     killing and maiming long after the conflict has ended. Along \n     with other countries, we have contributed more than $90 \n     million to demining efforts, and we are working hard to \n     develop new technology to lower the costs of clearance and to \n     reduce the danger to those heroes involved in this perilous \n     work.\n       Finally, we are helping prevent greater suffering by \n     alerting and educating on the hazards those millions of \n     civilians, particularly children, whose lives are not only \n     under threat everyday but whose ability to rebuild their \n     communities is circumscribed by the hidden danger under \n     roads, beneath playgrounds, or in unsown fields.\n       Whether in Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia, or in many other \n     places, I have seen first hand the heartbreaking devastation \n     of land mines and the continuing tragedy that they inflict. \n     At the UN and around the world, as well as at the just-\n     concluded Ottawa Conference, we will continue doing all we \n     can to end this horror and make our earth safe once again.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright and I will have \nmany conversations on a wide range of foreign policy issues. I know \nSecretaries have traditionally steered clear of budgetary issues. As \nthe budget for foreign assistance has fallen sharply in recent years, I \nhope she will become more directly involved in reversing this dangerous \ntrend. Secretary Christopher called the decline in funding for foreign \nassistance ``the biggest crisis we are facing in foreign policy \ntoday.'' Not Bosnia. Not the Middle East. Not the fate of democracy in \nRussia. Not North Korea. Not renewed violence in Northern Ireland. Not \nthe simmering conflict between India and Pakistan--both nuclear powers. \nNot the danger of plutonium ending up in the hands of terrorists. Not \nwar and hunger in Africa.\n\n  No, all of those things. Because we cannot deal with these problems \nunless we are willing to pay the price. Leadership costs money. \nAmbassador Albright knows that.\n  I believe she will make the foreign policy budget a high priority and \nkeep it at the top of the agenda. There have already been a number of \nSenators, both Republicans and Democrats, who have said strongly and \nforcefully--respected voices in this Chamber--that they will work to \nensure that the administration has the funding necessary to effectively \ncarry out its foreign policy. We need her active and sustained support \nin this.\n  She is going to have her plate full. I urge her to give special \nattention to the needs of our own hemisphere, and I know that she will. \nWe have seen real progress toward democracy and free markets in Latin \nAmerica, but the future is far from certain.\n  We have a compelling interest in stopping the flow of drugs and \nrefugees, in strengthening civilian governments and seeing human rights \nrespected in places where they are not, and in broadening our trade \nrelations. I know of nobody who would give a better voice to that.\n  So I think Madeleine Albright was a superb choice. She will make us \nall proud, as she already has as our representative to the United \nNations. And I think the fact that we are hearing such strong voices on \nboth sides of the aisle commending this choice bodes well for her as \nSecretary of State, and for all Americans. She will be confirmed \noverwhelmingly.\n  It truly is the American dream when the daughter of a Czechoslovakian \nescaping communism becomes America's Ambassador to the United Nations, \nand the Secretary of State of this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my dear friend from Iowa for his \ncustomary courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized in morning \nbusiness for approximately 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia controls the time until 11:30.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal \nGang Violence Act of 1997 which was introduced yesterday by Senator \nHatch on behalf of himself and this Senator from California. I also \nbelieve my sentiments and cosponsorship are joined by Senators Harkin, \nReid, and D'Amato.\n  Mr. President, this legislation makes the Federal Government a much \nmore active partner in the war on criminal activity that, I am \nregretful to say, has become violent and deadly and is perpetrated by \norganized street gangs. This bill was introduced with some differences \nin the last Congress, but the need for the legislation has only \nincreased, and today I hope to lay out the case for the need for the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\n  Gang violence has become a problem in the United States of America of \nepic proportions, and I think few people really understand the degree \nto which street gangs are crossing State lines and perpetrating \nviolence.\n  Today, the Department of Justice reports that in the United States \nthere are some 25,000 different street gangs. There are more than \n652,000 members of these gangs. And they are not loosely organized. \nThey are not the street kids glamorized in West Side Story.\n  Today's gangs are very different. They are organized. They are \nsophisticated. They are traveling crime syndicates much like the Mafia. \nThey regularly cross State lines to recruit new members. They traffic \nin drugs and weapons, they smuggle illegal aliens, they steal, and they \nmurder. In just one city, Los Angeles, consider this: Nearly 7,300 of \nits citizens were murdered in the last 16 years from gang warfare--\n7,300 citizens. This is more people than have been killed in all of the \nfighting in Northern Ireland.\n  Gangs were responsible for 43 percent of all homicides in Los Angeles \nin 1994. They were responsible for 41 percent of homicides in Omaha, \nNE, in 1995; more than half of all violent crimes in Buffalo, NY, in \n1994. In Phoenix, gang-related homicides jumped 800 percent between \n1990 and 1994. In Wichita, KS, drive-by shootings jumped from 8 in 1991 \nto 267 in 1993. That is a 3,000 percent increase in just 2 years. And \nthis is a smaller city--300,000 people. A Justice Department survey \nfound that gang problems are worsening in 48 percent of the responding \ncommunities.\n  These are just a few examples of the alarming rise in gang terror. \nThe problem is we have become numb to it. Let me give you an example. \nIn Los Angeles, on a Monday last February, with Mayor Dick Riordan, I \nannounced this legislation at a news conference. The Los Angeles city \ncouncilwoman who is in charge of the public safety committee, Laura \nChick, reported that just that weekend six people had been murdered by \ngangs on the streets of Los Angeles, and you know what? Not one was \nreported in the press. We have become so numb because this kind of \nviolence has become so commonplace all across the United States.\n  Last September, a member of the Crips from Los Angeles was arrested \nin Dayton, OH, with two other men for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. \nPolice seized approximately $1 million in cash in the raid.\n  A 1995 study of gang members by the National Gang Crime Research \nCenter found that three-quarters of all gangs exist in more than one \ngeographic area. One-half of gang members belong to gangs that did not \narise locally but arose with contact from a gang outside the area. One-\nhalf of gang members had contact with the same gang in another city. \nAnd this is the clincher: 61 percent of gang members indicated their \ngang was an official branch of a larger national gang.\n  Sergeant Jerry Flowers of the gang crime unit in Oklahoma City \ncaptured the migration instinct of these gangs when he said, ``The gang \nleaders realized that the same ounce of crack cocaine they sold for \n$300 in Los Angeles was worth nearly $2,000 in Oklahoma City.''\n  Let me now tell you about the size and scope of some of America's \nmost prominent street gangs. The Los Angeles Times recently conducted \none of the most intensive investigative reports of major gang activity \never conducted by a newspaper in the United States.\n  Let me begin with the 18th Street Gang and the picture the L.A. Times \npainted. The 18th Street Gang has as many as 20,000 members in southern \nCalifornia alone--20 times the size of the notorious Bloods and Crips.\n  The 18th Street Gang is so influential in narcotics trafficking that \nthe gang now deals directly with Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. \nThe 18th Street Gang actually rents street corners to nongang dope \npeddlers, forcing them to pay so-called taxes of up to $1,000 a day.\n  The gang is growing and spreading. They have become the largest and \nfastest growing gang in Oregon, where they gunned down a 15-year-old \nmember who wanted out of the gang. Utah officials say the 18th Street \nGang has arrived there with a vengeance.\n  Even internationally, the 18th Street Gang is fighting for turf. In \nEl Salvador, 18th Street is warring with rival gangs. Honduran \nauthorities have sought advice from Los Angeles law enforcement on the \ngang. 18th Street has a cell in Tijuana, where they often flee to \nescape arrest and prosecution. On the average, someone in Los Angeles \nCounty is assaulted or robbed by the 18th Street Gang every single day \nof every month of every year.\n  While currently the deadliest and most prolific on the streets in \nsouthern California today, the 18th Street Gang is not the only gang. \nLet us talk for a moment about Bloods and Crips.\n  The Bloods and Crips that originated in Los Angeles in the late \n1960's are the Nation's two largest street gangs. They are also \ncontinuing to expand, and you see this expansion as they move across \nthe United States. Local police and the FBI have traced factions of \nthese gangs to more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest. Some of \nthose cities are on this map. They have more than 60,000 members \nnationally. According to the FBI, narcotics trafficking is their \nprincipal source of income.\n  Let me give another one, the Chicago-born Gangster Disciples. The \nGangster Disciples, according to the authorities, is a Chicago-based, \n30,000-member, multimillion-dollar gang operation spanning 35 States. \nThey traffic in narcotics and weapons and are said to operate much like \na Fortune 500 company, with two boards of directors, one in prison and \none outside, a layer of governors and regents, a tax collector, and \nsome 6,000 salespersons. Their income is estimated by Chicago \nauthorities to be $300,000 daily.\n  Let me talk for a minute about Russian gangs. Russian organized crime \nactivity in the United States has been expanding for the past 20 years, \nbut its most significant growth has occurred during the past 5 years. \nMr. President, 29 States now report activities by Russian crime groups. \nFBI Director Louis Freeh stated that more than 200 of Russia's 6,000 \ncrime gangs operate with American counterparts in the United States, so \nthey flow from Russia to the United States and back.\n  Russian gangs tend to be more loosely organized than other gangs, but \nthey have formed networks that operate and shift alliances to meet \nparticular needs. The California attorney general indicates that the \nmost common activities by Russian organized crime gangs are fraud \nschemes involving fuel taxes, insurance, and credit card fraud. But \nthey also engage in more common organized crime activities: extortion, \nloan sharking, drug trafficking, auto theft and prostitution.\n  Asian gangs: The Department of Justice indicates that among ethnic \ngangs, Jamaican and Asian gangs are considered by law enforcement \nofficials to pose the largest threat. Asian gangs have been identified \nas major threats in more than 17 cities. In Los Angeles alone, there \nare more than 100 Asian gangs with 10,000 members. Illegal activities \ninclude alien smuggling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, home-invasion \nrobberies, high-technology heists, and firearms trafficking.\n  Vietnamese gangs, in particular, have become a serious threat in many \nof our cities. They tend to be very violent. They are more \nsophisticated organizationally, and they specialize in stealing \nmultimillion-dollar quantities of computer chips. At least 400 Silicon \nValley companies in my State that deal in computer chips have been hit \nin the last year and a half. That is almost one a day. And they are \nlosing tens of millions of dollars. Computer firms lose as much as $1 \nmillion a week in thefts, according to the Justice Department.\n  The legislation Senator Hatch and I have introduced does this: It \ndoubles the sentence for any member of an organized criminal gang who \ncommits a Federal crime. It expands the scope of gang-related criminal \nacts to include activities such as carjacking and drive-by shootings, \nand significantly increases penalties for those crimes. It checks the \ngrowth of gangs by making the recruitment of minors into criminal gangs \na Federal offense with stiff penalties.\n  Specifically, this legislation doubles the actual sentence for any \nmember of an organized criminal street gang who commits a Federal \ncrime. Current Federal law increases the penalties for organizers, \nleaders, managers and supervisors of criminal activity, including gang \nleaders. However, members of\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nknown criminal street gangs currently are not subjected to higher \npenalties when a Federal crime is committed. Many prosecutors and law \nenforcement officials indicate that gang members, in addition to the \nleaders and supervisors of gangs, should see their penalties increased \nto provide a stronger deterrent for children to stay away from street \ngangs.\n  This legislation amends the sentencing guidelines so that individual \ngang members convicted of felonies would have their sentencing level \napproximately doubled. For example, currently, if a first-time offender \nwho is a member of a gang is convicted of trafficking in 30 stolen \nguns, he or she would receive a minimum sentence of 4\\3/4\\ to 6 years \nin jail. Under this legislation, that sentence would be increased to 9 \nto 11\\1/4\\ years.\n  This legislation makes it a Federal offense to engage in a pattern of \ncriminal gang activity, subject to severe and certain penalties. Under \nthis legislation, if a person commits two or more predicate gang \ncrimes, which include carjacking, drive-by shooting, drug dealing and \nobstruction of justice, in furtherance of a criminal street gang's \nactivities within a 5-year period, that gangster is engaging in a \npattern of criminal gang activity and he can be prosecuted federally. \nThis is the Federal-local partnership we envision, to get at gang \nactivity that crosses State lines. And this individual, if convicted, \nwill be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison, up to life \nimprisonment for a first conviction of this offense; will be sentenced \nto at least 20 years imprisonment up to life imprisonment for a second \nor later conviction of this offense; and would be subject to asset \nseizures and forfeitures.\n  This legislation expands the definition of criminal street gangs in \nFederal law to better reflect modern-day gang activity. So it broadens \nthe definition of criminal street gangs in title 18 of the criminal \ncode to include State crimes such as drive-by shootings, rape, torture, \ncarjacking, kidnapping, and assault with a deadly weapon.\n  It doubles the penalties for interstate gang-related crimes, and it \nexpands the Travel Act to respond more effectively to the growing \nproblem of highly sophisticated, mobile and organized street gangs. As \nmost of us know, the Travel Act was written in 1961 and it had Mafia-\nstyle activity in mind. While the Travel Act as it is now written \nallows prosecutors to target some gang activities such as drug \ntrafficking, the list is not complete. Law enforcement leaders and \nprosecutors, including U.S. attorneys, have recommended to us that the \nact be modernized to better reflect current crimes by gang members.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, under this legislation, the list of \nunlawful activities in the Travel Act will be expanded to include the \nfollowing crimes: drive-by shooting; robbery; burglary; assault with a \ndeadly weapon; intimidation of witnesses, victims, jurors or \ninformants; assault resulting in bodily injury; possession and/or \ntrafficking of stolen property; alien smuggling; and firearms \ntrafficking.\n  In addition, the maximum penalties would be doubled, from 5 to 10 \nyears, for those who commit nonviolent violations of these provisions. \nA conspiracy provision is also added to the statute.\n  We double the base offense levels under the sentencing guidelines for \ntraveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang. \nThis is to get at those gangs that come from other countries and States \nand operate back and forth. So traveling in interstate or foreign \ncommerce in aid of a street gang would increase from 6 to 12 in \nsentencing levels, which increases the base sentencing range from a low \nof 0 to 6 months and a high of 12 to 18 months, to a new low of 10 to \n16 months and a new high of 30 to 37 months. Committing violent crimes \nin aid of a street gang or racketeering activity would increase from 12 \nto 24, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 10 to 16 \nmonths and a high of 30 to 37 months, to a new low of 51 to 63 months \nand a new high of 100 to 125 months.\n  One of the most insidious tactics of today's gangs is the way they \ntarget children to do their dirty work, and they indoctrinate them into \na life of crime. Let me give you an example.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, the 18th Street Gang, which I \ndescribed earlier, ``resembles a kind of children's army,'' with \nrecruiters who scout middle schools for 11- to 13-year-old children to \njoin the gang. The gang's real leaders are middle-age veteranos, long-\ntime gang members who direct this criminal activity from the \nbackground.\n  Chicago's Gangster Disciples recruit not just at high schools, but \neven at elementary schools. One of the gang's members told a Federal \ncourt about his preference for children 17 and under as armed guards, \n``because they can go to jail and get out quicker.''\n  This pattern is not unusual. A report by the National Gang Crime \nResearch Center found, ``The term `youth gang' is itself somewhat of a \nmisnomer when it comes to the major gangs in America today * * * the \nreal leaders at the top of these major gangs are in fact older adults, \nmany in their forties and even older * * * 84.8 percent''--85 percent--\n``of the gang members in our sample indicated that their gang does in \nfact have such older adult leaders.''\n  Current Federal law contains no penalty for recruiting minors to \nparticipate in gang activity, and this is a critical part of our \nlegislation. This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of \npersons to participate in gang activity subject to a 1-year minimum and \na 10-year maximum penalty, or a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is \nrecruited or solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to 4 years.\n  In addition, the person convicted of this crime would have to pay the \ncosts of housing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the \njuvenile reaches the age of 18.\n  This act also makes violation of this section a predicate offense \nunder the racketeering statutes, known as RICO statutes.\n  It is now a crime to knowingly transfer a firearm to be used to \ncommit a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime. This legislation \nadds a mandatory minimum penalty of 3 years if the gun to be used in \ncrime is transferred to a minor.\n  This legislation increases penalties for transferring handguns to \nminors. The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of the \n1994 crime bill, does not contain sufficient penalties against \njuveniles who possess handguns for criminal purposes. In fact, one \nprovision of this act requires only probation for first-time juvenile \noffenders who possess a handgun.\n  Such a weak penalty has meant that prosecutors don't bother to target \nand prosecute gang members. I have been told this by U.S. attorneys and \nby district attorneys, and we aim to correct that problem with this \nlanguage. In addition, current law sets different penalties for \njuveniles and adults who transfer a weapon to a minor. The Federal Gang \nViolence Act toughens the penalties against juveniles and adults who \ntransfer a firearm to a minor--and subjects juveniles and adults to the \nsame penalties for violating this law.\n\n  This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by:\n  First, setting a one-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult or \njuvenile--who provides a minor with a handgun.\n  Second, holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give \nanother minor a firearm by applying the same 5-year maximum sentence \nnow given to adults.\n  Third, setting a 1-year minimum sentence and applying the same 10-\nyear maximum sentence to adults and juveniles who give a firearm to a \nminor and should have known the gun would be used in a crime of \nviolence. Currently, the 10-year maximum sentence only applies to \nadults.\n  Juveniles under 13 years old, however, would not be subject to these \nmandatory minimum sentences.\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has three or \nmore prior convictions for certain crimes--is a ``career criminal''--\nand he possesses, ships, transports or receives a gun or ammunition--is \narmed--he will be subject to a mandatory minimum 15 year penalty and \nfine of up to $25,000.\n  Serious drug offenses are already in the list of crimes which count \ntoward the three-conviction minimum; this bill would allow juvenile \nconvictions for serious drug offenses to also count toward that three-\nconviction minimum.\n  This would not apply to nickel-and-dime possession offenses, but to \ndrug\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\ndealing which is punishable by 10 or more years in prison.\n  Many police officers around the country are confronting heavily-armed \ngang members who are wearing bullet-proof vests.\n  This legislation increases Federal sentences if a person wears body \narmor in the commission of a Federal offense, by directing the \nSentencing Commission to provide for a sentencing enhancement under the \nGuidelines of at least two levels.\n  Presently, a 30-day time limit exists for bringing juveniles to \ntrial. With crimes being committed by juveniles becoming increasingly \nviolent and complex, prosecutors need additional time to adequately \ndevelop cases. This legislation increases the time limit to 45 days.\n  This bill adds firearms trafficking violations to the list of crimes \nthat can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO. Currently, firearms \nviolations are not RICO predicate acts. Prosecutors and law enforcement \nofficials indicate an increasing use of firearms by criminal street \ngangs to commit home robberies, business invasions, and attacks on \nrival gangs.\n  Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate commerce--and \nbecause firearms are such an integral part of the gang's activity--law \nenforcement officials have suggested that firearms violations become \npredicate acts under RICO.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes $100 million over the next 5 \nyears for hiring additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute violent \nyouth gangs.\n  I don't mean to go into detail, but I really want this body to \nunderstand that in this Senator's opinion, and I think Senator Hatch's \nand our cosponsors', this Nation's No. 1 criminal threat comes from \norganized street gangs now moving vociferously across State lines and \nacross international lines. If we don't move now, I think we surrender \nthe independence of this Nation to a kind of underground world of \nstreet gangs connected in Russia, connected in Asia, connected in \nJapan, connected in Latin America. and Central America.\n  What we aim to do is up the penalties and create some new penalties \nwhich can really be effective in dealing with crime. The addition of \nthe RICO statutes, the use of asset seizures and forfeitures, treating \nstreet gangs today the way mafia organized crime was treated 10 to 15 \nyears ago can make a big dent and deter gangs. Most important to me is \nthat it becomes a Federal offense for anyone to go out there and \nrecruit a member of a gang that moves their stolen goods, illegal \nimmigrants, drugs, guns, murder, extortion, witness intimidation across \nState lines.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to make one last comment on another \nsubject before I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S581-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            END THE BOMBINGS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this morning, on my way to work, on \nConnecticut Avenue, I ran into the fact that another bomb had been \nplaced at a Planned Parenthood center. This is just January, and the \nnumber of these bombings and attempted bombings are already over six.\n  I rise today really to deplore these acts, and I rise today to say to \nthe right-to-life movement: Please, make clear that terrorism is not \npart of your agenda. If you fail to do so and fail to do so now, I \nbelieve we are in for a terrible siege this year, if the month of \nJanuary is any indication.\n  I am also hopeful that the Attorney General will join in the \ninvestigation and the subsequent prosecution as our legislation of the \nlast session provides.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for not more than 5 minutes and that my remarks be \nincluded with the group of speakers, including the Senator from Iowa, \n[Mr. Grassley], on alternative minimum tax relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gorton pertaining to the introduction of S. 181 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dornan, is controlling the time until 12 noon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think the President said, ``Mr. \nDornan.'' Mr. Dornan is no longer serving in the House. I am Senator \nDorgan from North Dakota.

Mr. President, prior to coming to this body I was an \nattorney, practiced law, I have great respect for the law. I tried \ndozens and dozens of cases before juries. I did not always agree with \nthe result of the verdicts that the jury came to, but I always \nrespected what they did, their obligation to do what they felt was \nright. The U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts--I do not always agree \nwith their decisions, but I respect the United States being a body that \nfollows the law. We respect the law. We follow the law.\n\n  Mr. President, on the 24th anniversary of the Roe versus Wade \ndecision, I feel it is appropriate that I come and offer a few words \ntoday about what is taking place in our country. My record --as you \nknow, is that I am personally opposed to abortion. But, Mr. President, \nI am also opposed to what is going on in this country today where \ncertain people feel that they are above the law, that the law is \nsomething that they can interpret on their own.\n  There is no justification for what is taking place in America today \nwhere violence is almost a way of life in some areas. Today on the news \nit had appeared that a bomb went off near an abortion clinic here in \nWashington, DC. It is not clear whether the bomb was meant to destroy \nthe clinic, but all over the country there are abortion clinics that \nare being bombed. I think that is abhorrent and wrong.\n  Mr. President, if someone respects life, you cannot choose which life \nyou respect. You cannot only respect the lives of those who agree with \nyou politically or those who agree with certain decisions surrendered \nby the Supreme Court.\n  I am adamantly opposed to the use of violence to show one's \ndispleasure with the law. I was the first Member of this body to come \nto the floor and denounce the killing of Dr. David Gunn in Florida. I \nam compelled to come to the floor again today, given the most recent \nbombings of abortion clinics.\n  It is incumbent upon the leaders of this country to condemn these \nshameful acts. It is incumbent upon the religious leaders that they \ncondemn these shameful tactics. Yet we need more than people saying, \nwell, I disagree with violence. We need people speaking out against \nthis violence. We need people denouncing these acts. Through their \nsilence, I believe there is an acquiescence to this violence.\n  The people who perpetrate these bombings are wrong. They are a fringe \nelement. They are extremists who advocate violence as an alternative to \nmeaningful debate and discussion. They believe, I assume, Mr. \nPresident, that they are above the law.\n  Let us continue to have passionate and vigorous debate on this \nsubject and all other subjects, but do not take the law into our own \nhands. I repeat, those who respect life cannot choose which lives they \nrespect. You cannot only respect the lives of those who agree with us.\n  Religion teaches us tolerance. This does not mean tolerance for only \nthose people who agree with us. It means tolerance for all. If your \nmessage is to protect life, then you do not put other lives in jeopardy \nby your acts.\n  We have been told in Holy Scripture, Mr. President, as you have heard \nit\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\nsaid, that it is no longer appropriate that we have an eye for an eye \nand a tooth for a tooth. In fact, we have been told to turn the other \ncheek when we are struck. We have been told to love your enemies, bless \nthose who curse you, do good to those who hate you.\n  I do not know how people have been lost in this debate, Mr. \nPresident, how they feel that they can come and bomb places of \nbusiness, hurting innocent people.\n  So I say, we must stop this violence. And the very first way of \nstopping the violence is to speak out against it. We must all speak out \nagainst these horrendous acts that are taking place in our country.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from North Dakota for \nallowing me to speak out of order.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nand ask unanimous consent that following my presentation the Senator \nfrom Florida, Senator Graham, be yielded 10 minutes from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 181 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S584-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S585-S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just finished testifying before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on the issue of a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. When I appeared before the committee, there was \na debt clock the chairman put up in the back of him. He hung it up in \nthe room. It showed the debt increasing every second as we were there \ntestifying. It was a fairly effective prop, I thought, because we ought \nto be concerned about the debt. And we are on the right subject when we \nare talking about eliminating the deficit and trying to reduce the \nFederal debt.\n  But I pointed out to the chairman of the committee that if we pass \nhis proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget, if we pass \nit right now, and then pass the proposed budget that will balance the \nbudget in the year 2002, it doesn't stop the debt clock. The debt clock \ndoesn't become a stopwatch on debt, because they are defining a \nbalanced budget as a budget that takes all the money in the Social \nSecurity system that is coming in and uses it as other revenue to \nbalance the Federal budget. The result is, in the year 2002, when they \nclaim the budget will be in balance and they will comply with the \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget, the debt in America \nwill increase by $130 billion.\n  I went to a small school, a high school class of nine. We didn't take \nthe most sophisticated arithmetic in the world, but I guarantee you \nnobody in the country teaches that if you claim you balance the budget, \nit is OK for your debt to continue to increase. Let me say it again. \nThey will enshrine in the U.S. Constitution a practice that takes \ndedicated trust funds that can be used only for Social Security to be \nused now as other revenue, and then claim they have balanced the \nbudget, even as the Federal debt will continue to increase by $130 \nbillion a year after they say the budget is balanced.\n  It is not budgeting that is correct, it is budgeting that--if you \nwere in the private sector saying, by the way, in my business, I am \ngoing to take the workers' pension funds and use them to cover my \noperating loss in the business, it would get you sent off to 2 years of \nhard tennis in a minimum security prison. That is illegal. In Congress, \nthey can simply change the definition so it allows them to say they \nhave balanced the budget, even when they have not balanced the budget \nand are still borrowing $130 billion a year more. That is not a good \nrecipe for my children or yours. And it is not an honest way to balance \nthe budget.\n  We will introduce tomorrow, a group of us, a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget that says, yes, we support it. Let us do it the \nright way, the honest way. If we are going to balance the budget, let \nus do it the old-fashioned way. In fact, putting the provision in the \nConstitution won't balance the budget. It will be men and women who \nvote for a combination of taxing and spending changes that ultimately \nwill balance the budget.\n  We have made progress, and I am proud to say that I am part of the \nteam that has allowed us to make that progress year after year, \nreductions in appropriations in program after program, year after year, \nbiting the bullet to do the tough things, make the hard choices, to \nbring the budget deficit down 4 years in a row, down by 60 percent. I \nam pleased to be a part of the group in this body that says that is the \nright course, it's the responsible thing, a thing we ought to do for \nour children's future.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me make a final point. We are going to \nintroduce that tomorrow with eight or nine of us as original \ncosponsors. I hope that will be considered whenever there is \nconsideration of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That \nis an important first topic for this Congress--again, how to get our \nfiscal house in order. But there is much more to be done.\n  The convening of a new Congress is not just about trumpeting by \nelephants or parading by donkeys; it is about people representing men \nand women of good will across the country who send us here to do the \npublic's business and to try to do the things that improve the future \nof this country.\n\n  We care about education because that is America's future. What do we \ndo to improve education in this country? That is a topic that we need \nto address. We can address that in a bipartisan way, in my judgment.\n  What about health care? What about 10 million kids who don't have \nhealth care? What about a 2-year-old that is crying with an ache in his \nstomach, but his parents don't have money in their wallets and can't \ntake him to a doctor they believe in? We should address health care. \nThat is the right subject.\n  What about the environment? Nobody in America would have predicted \nthat in the past 20 years we have doubled our use of energy, but we now \nhave cleaner air and cleaner water. Why did we end up with cleaner air \nand water when we doubled our use of energy? Because this Congress said \nto those who pollute this country, ``You can't do that anymore.'' We \nare not done with that job. There is more to do. But that is the right \ntopic as well, to improve the future of this country.\n  Crime. Yes, crime. They say statistics show that crime has \ndiminished. We have a lot to do on crime. I am somebody who believes we \nought to say to people in this country: If you commit a violent act, \nyou stay in jail until the end of your time, and no time off for good \nbehavior. You go to prison and stay there. We have a lot to do on \ncrime. We can do that, I hope, in a bipartisan way.\n  Trade. I hope in the next few days my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia and I will introduce, once again, a piece of legislation \nwe introduced toward the end of the last session, which says, what \nabout the other deficit, the deficit that is increasing at an alarming \nrate, the merchandise trade deficit, which was the largest in the \nhistory of this country last year, breaking records 3 years in a row. \nWhat about the other deficit? How does this country get its trade in \nbalance? Because the trade deficit, after all, must be repaid in the \nfuture with a lower standard of living in this country. That is why it \nis dangerous for our future. That represents an export of American \njobs. Jobs that used to be here are there. Jobs that used to be ours \nare theirs. We must confront this trade deficit. It is dangerous for \nthis country to proceed without dealing with the other deficit, the \nmerchandise trade deficit, which, after all, in my judgment, is the \ndeficit that will inexorably weaken this country.\n  No country will long remain a world economic power unless it retains \na strong manufacturing base. The merchandise trade deficit represents \nthe erosion of America's manufacturing base, the loss of American jobs, \njobs that pay well, jobs that have good benefits. That is why it is so \ncritically important to the future of our economy. I will be \nintroducing again some days ahead, with Senator Byrd, the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, a piece of legislation that establishes an \nemergency commission to make recommendations in how to address this\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nvexing, dangerous merchandise trade deficit.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Florida is waiting for the \nfloor. I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at conclusion \nof the remarks by the distinguished Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], \nI be recognized for not to exceed 5 minutes in morning business for the \npurpose of introducing a bill and making some comments thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning, I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak on behalf of an important set of provisions in the Democratic \nprogram of putting families first--in this case, the provision that \ngives families some additional security for their pension and \nretirement. There is no generation in American history which needs to \nplan more carefully for their retirement years than that which is \ncurrently in America's work force. Two fundamental things have \noccurred.\n  First, people are living longer. One of the great successes of our \ngeneration has been its capacity to extend life and extend the quality \nof life. Today a person who retires can look forward to almost 18 years \nof quality of life after they leave the workplace.\n\n  A second thing that has occurred is tremendous mobility within the \nwork force. Our grandparents had an expectation when they completed \ntheir formal education of finding a place of employment and in many \ninstances staying in that one employment for the rest of their work \ncareers. Today people are much more mobile and change their jobs at \nfrequent intervals.\n  The chart behind me indicates what has happened just in the last \ndecade in terms of job mobility. To focus on one group of Americans, \nAmerican males between the ages of 35 and 44, in 1987 the average \nAmerican male in that middle-age active employment group had been with \ntheir current employer for 7.6 years. Less than 10 years later, the \naverage has dropped to 6 years. The same is true of virtually every \nother category of males and females from the beginning worker to the \nworker who is on the edge of retirement.\n  Workers can no longer expect to spend a career with a single \nemployer. The work force patterns of the last hundred years have \nevolved as industries, technologies, and the American economy has \nevolved. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, if you are an \naverage employee between the ages of 18 and 29 you have held 7.6 jobs \nin that brief work career. On the occasion of a 30th birthday, 40 \npercent of Americans have been in their current jobs less than 2 years, \nmaking it easier for working Americans to successfully save for their \nretirement in this context of extended age after retirement, and the \nmobility of the work force is a matter of tremendous national \nimportance. It is obviously important to the individual and their \nfamilies to be well prepared for those retirement years, but also it \nhas important implications to the communities in which they will live \nand to the Nation as a whole.\n  A retiree who is financially well prepared will not risk being a \nfinancial burden to their children, or to State, local, or Federal \nGovernment social service providers. They will be able to strengthen \nthe economy in their local communities with home purchases and a \nvariety of leisure and recreation activities. They will be able to use \ntheir free time for volunteer efforts to help the next generation with \nthings like the President spoke of in his inaugural address, helping \nyoung people to learn to read, building homes for Habitat for Humanity, \nall the ways in which that discretionary time has served the community \nand the Nation.\n  Financial security retirement is valuable to the retiree. It is \nvaluable to the Nation.\n  Our Nation's businesses offer a variety of benefits to their workers \nto give them a secure retirement to help them start saving for their \npostemployment life. These range from the traditional defined benefit \nprograms to profit-sharing to 401(k) retirement accounts. I am going to \nfocus on that third area in which employers have assisted their \nemployees in preparing for retirement; that is, through incentives and \nencouragement to persons to voluntarily save for their own retirement, \nand how can we make that a more expansive and a more stable source of \nretirement income.\n  Generally, the 401(k) retirement benefits become available to \nemployees after they have worked 5 to 7 years with a particular \ncompany. If an employee leaves before that time, some or all of the \nbenefits which they derived can be lost. I applaud the Democratic \nleadership and specifically Senator Daschle for a legislative response \nthat will greatly assist hard-working Americans in continuing their \nability to prepare for their retirement even as they undergo these \ndramatic changes in their employment career.\n  This legislation provides for more rapid vesting for the employer \ncontribution to a 401(k) plan as retirement savings. 401(k) plans have \ngrown tremendously over the past two decades. In 1984, there were \n17,300 qualified plans. Today there are over 140,000 such plans. \nCurrently, 22 million American workers contribute part of their salary \nto a 401(k) plan to help prepare for retirement. In the aggregate, \n401(k) plans now hold $675 billion in assets for American workers.\n  Employees are contributing large sums to their 401(k) in part because \nmany employers match the employee contribution. But under current law, \nif an employee terminates his or her employment with a company prior to \n5 years of service, then the employee may not get any of the employer's \ncontribution to the plan. In today's mobile work force, many employees \nswitch jobs in less than 5 years. We should recognize this reality of \nthe mobility of the work force. We should recognize that it is a \nstrength of the American economy. We should mitigate the current \npractice of penalizing mobility at less than 5 years by vesting an \nemployer match after 3 years. That is one of the proposals for reform \nin the 401(k) program. But faster vesting alone is not enough. We need \nto explore other proposals that will make it easier on employers to \ntransfer pension funds with an employee when the worker changes jobs.\n  As an example, under current law, if a new employer accepts pension \nfunds that came from a new employee's previous company, a worker who \nhas worked at company A, they have accumulated savings in their 401(k) \nplan and they want to carry those funds to their new employer B, the \nnew employer has to make certain that pension funds are part of a plan \nthat meets all the Federal requirements. Failing to do so, they can be \nsubject to Internal Revenue Service penalties. Many businesses, \nparticularly small businesses, would like to let employees bring \npension funds with them, but the regulatory hassle makes it not \nworthwhile. We need to assure employers that if they allow an employee \nto roll over his or her old pension plan to carry it with them to their \nnew point of employment, that the new employer will not risk IRS \npenalties.\n\n  Mr. President, 5 million American workers participate in retirement \nsavings plans and change jobs every year. Some will be completely \nvested and have a smooth transition. Some will put themselves, their \nfamily and their retirement security at risk by losing a portion of the \ncompany's matching contributions.\n  Mr. President, the next chart indicates the percentage distribution \nof worker by years of tenure in their current job. For instance, for \nAmerican workers in the 35 to 44 age group, 14.7 percent have been in \ntheir current employment for less than 1 year, 29 percent for less than \n4 years, which means that 29 percent of Americans within that age group \nwould not be in a status in which an employer contribution to their \nretirement would be mandatory vesting. This issue of making it more \nsecure for employers to be able to provide a continuation of retirement \nbenefits to their new employee, to give the new employee a greater \nassurance that their contribution and the employer contribution upon \nwhich they counted will be there when they reach retirement, are \ncritical issues to the large\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\npopulation of Americans who will increasingly be looking to their own \nefforts in order to provide for their retirement years.\n  Mr. President, this planning for retirement will make a difference in \nthe lives of millions of Americans today and in the future and in the \ncommunities in which they live. If we take steps today to secure the \npension and retirement benefits of Americans, we will be making a \ncontribution to the well-being of those families, communities, and the \nNation.\n  I commend the leadership for having brought this important issue to \nsuch a level of priority in this 105th Congress and urge all of my \ncolleagues to give it the appropriate consideration and support for the \nsecurity of American families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 182 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, as has always been my practice on return \nhome from official travels overseas, I have sought recognition today to \nrecord for the information of our colleagues and my constituents in \nPennsylvania the results of my recess trip, from November 16 to \nNovember 24, to the North Atlantic Assembly and to the Middle East.\n  As you know, the Senate delegation in November 1996 to the North \nAtlantic Assembly included 13 Senators during all or part of a full \nschedule of meetings in Paris and London, arranged and ably chaired by \nSenator Roth. Let me take a moment to note here the important news of \nSenator Roth's election as the President of the North Atlantic \nAssembly.\n  Our delegation's mission began with a working flight to Paris early \nin the morning on Saturday, November 16. As the presiding officer knows \nhow rare it is for eight Senators to share 7\\1/2\\ hours together--\nespecially in the absence of a telephone--I know you can appreciate the \nvalue of this group of colleagues being able to exchange views and form \nplans relevant to the 105th Congress.\n  In Paris and, later in the week, in London, our Senate North American \nAssembly Delegation focused its work on the vital--but vexing--\nquestions of the purposes, the structures and the problems of \ntransatlantic relations in the post cold war era.\n  NATO has been perhaps the most successful international collective \nsecurity arrangement in the world's history, ultimately achieving its \nonce thought unattainable goal of containing and outlasting the empire \nof the former Soviet Union through a vigilant deterrence rather than \nactual conflict. It was this successful because it is more than a \nmutual defense pact. It is the coming together, across the Atlantic, of \nthe power of the ideas of freedom and democracy. But NATO's very \nsuccess in achieving its original aim is the basis of the present \nquandary of the alliance. In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion, we must ask for many reasons--including our responsibility to \nwisely spend the American taxpayers' dollars--what is NATO for now, \nwhat countries should be a part of the alliance and what roles and \nburdens should be played and borne by the different members of the \nNorth Atlantic community.\n  Our Senate delegation took up these questions--and many subordinate \nones as well, including the allied operation in Bosnia and trade and \neconomic relations across the Atlantic--with our European parliamentary \ncolleagues, senior officials of the executives of France, Britain, and \nother allied nations, international business leaders and, of course, \nour American Ambassadors and their staffs.\n  Apart from the formal itinerary of the entire delegation, I made a \npoint to visit with Alan J. Blinken, the America Ambassador in \nBrussels, headquarters of the European Economic Community, to discuss \nthe transatlantic trade situation and other matters, and to engage in \nsubstantive conversations with our Ambassador to France, Pamela \nHarriman, concerning a variety of security and international economic \nissues.\n  At mid-week, specifically, from Tuesday, November 19 through \nThursday, November 21, I split off from my North American Assembly \ncolleagues for an individual visit to the Middle East.\n  As the presiding officer is well aware, I have reported to the Senate \nand my constituents many times on my visits to the Middle East, visits \nI began making in 1964, some 16 years prior to my election to the \nSenate. As a Senator, I have traveled extensively in this vital, but \ndeeply troubled, part of the world in order to better fulfill my \nresponsibilities as a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of \nAppropriations--where I have been a member since coming to the Senate--\nand my roles as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nTerrorism and as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, as \nwell as my general duties as a Senator to be informed on a part of the \nworld frequently requiring action by this body.\n  This past August, the first visit to the Middle East I had made since \nthe Israeli elections of May 1996, my trip became something more than a \nfact-finding assessment of the always changing situation in that part \nof the world when Prime Minister Netanyahu asked me to carry a message \nto Syrian President Assad concerning the Prime Minister's views on the \nreopening of peace talks between Israel and Syria and, in an even more \ntime-sensitive vein, on Israeli thinking regarding Syrian troop \nmovements occurring at that time in Lebanon and in areas of Syria near \nthe Israeli controlled Golan Heights.\n  As I stated on the floor upon my return at that time, I carried Prime \nMinister Netanyahu's messages to President Assad in Damascus and, \nfollowing a substantive 3-hour exchange with the Syrian leader--with \nwhom I have been meeting regularly since 1988--I returned to Israel to \nbrief Prime Minister Netanyahu on President Assad's responses to the \nmessages.\n  In preparation for my joining the North Atlantic Assembly Delegation \nvisit to Europe--because I would be half-way there, so to speak--I met \nhere in Washington with the Syrian Ambassador to the United States, \nWalid Al-Moualem, to get an update from his perspective on the \nsituation between Syria and Israel. Ambassador Al-Moualem told me that \nhis government viewed my August round of talks between Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Assad as having been helpful in deescalating \nthe dangerous tensions, especially related to troop movements, between \nIsrael and Syria and the Ambassador encouraged me to return to the \nregion for another round of meetings aimed at helping the parties find \na basis to reopen their peace negotiations.\n  Now, I do not know if the Ambassador is correct in his \ncharacterization of my August meetings as helpful in reducing military \ntensions, but I told him that I obviously would make myself available \nto be helpful--without seeking either to displace the President or his \nrepresentatives in this matter and without seeking to advance any \npersonal agenda on the substance of an Israeli-Syrian peace--if both \nsides had an interest in my so doing.\n  When consultations with Israeli officials, including a telephone \nconversation I had directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu, indicated a \nsimilar encouragement for me to make another visit to Israel and Syria \nas had been expressed by the Syrian Ambassador, I decided to make such \na trip during a portion of the North Atlantic Assembly Delegation \nprogram in Europe.\n  Naturally, and any press accounts at the time to the contrary \nnotwithstanding, I and my staff both informed the State Department \nabout my planned trip and received extensive briefings by relevant \nadministration officials as to the Israeli/Syrian situation and \nadministration policy on the matter.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this sort of active involvement in \nforeign policy issues is, while--as I have already said--not meant to \nsupplant the President, the Secretary of State or their \nrepresentatives, a time-honored role for Members of the U.S. Senate, \ngoing\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nback to such distinguished Senators as Arthur Vandenburg and William \nFulbright. In any case, one could not responsibly pass up even a slight \nchance of being helpful in promoting peace between Israel and Syria \nwhen the alternative to peace could threaten dire consequences for us \nall.\n  I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, November \n20 at his office in the Israeli Knesset Building. United States \nAmbassador to Israel Martin Indyk was present. The Prime Minister told \nme that tensions with Syria have been reduced since the August/\nSeptember time period and that he wants to continue to de-escalate the \nsaber-rattling. He asked me to convey this, and specifically that \nIsrael has no aggressive intent against Syria, when I went on to see \nPresident Assad that afternoon. He noted as an exception to the \nreduction of military dangers attacks on Israeli forces in southern \nLebanon by Hezbollah and asked me to convey his request to President \nAssad that Syria seek to stop the Hezbollah attacks.\n  On the broader issue of reopening peace talks with Syria, Prime \nMinister Netanyahu told me to tell President Assad that he wishes to do \nso as soon as possible and that he is ready, willing, and able to be \npersonally involved in such talks. He said that although there are \nclearly tough issues to be addressed in negotiating with Syria, he has \na real sense that talks could be productive. Prime Minister Netanyahu \nreiterated that any talks with Syria will be based on the framework for \nArab/Israel peace established by U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 and by \nthe terms of reference of the 1991 Middle East peace conference \norganized by President Bush in Madrid. The Prime Minister's willingness \nto state the basis of talks with Syria in this way is significant \nbecause it indicates an acceptance that such talks would be based on \nthe formula standardly called ``land for peace.''\n  The Prime Minister held his ground, however, on what has been the \nSyrian demand that new talks begin where the old talks left off, that \nis that Prime Minister Netanyahu's government be bound as a condition \nfor reopening talks by what the Syrians consider a commitment by the \nprior Israel governments of Prime Ministers Rabin and Peres to full \nwithdrawal by Israel from the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 line. \nHe stated that he would not and could not agree to talks with such a \nprecondition.\n  I flew on to Damascus that day and held a wide ranging, cordial but \nfrank 3-hour meeting with President Assad, lasting from 1:20 p.m. to \n4:20 p.m. Syrian Foreign Minister Sharra and United States Ambassador \nto Syria, Christopher Ross, were also present.\n  I raised with President Assad the mounting evidence of Iranian and \nperhaps Syrian involvement in or connection to the dastardly act of \nterrorist murder against United States soldiers at Khobar Towers in \nDharhan, in Saudi Arabia, on June 15, 1996. I reminded President Assad \nthat the United States had responded militarily against Libya in 1986 \nwhen we received proof of Libyan responsibility for a bombing at a \nnightclub in Germany which killed two American servicemen.\n  Our exchange on this subject was pointed but it was incumbent on me \nto take this opportunity of a face-to-face session at this time to \nreiterate that the United States cannot be targeted by terrorists with \nimpunity.\n  On the central purpose of the meeting, I regret to say I can report \nlittle progress, frankly less than I had hoped based on the \nencouragement I had received to make this visit and on public \nstatements by the Syrian Foreign Minister about the possibility of \nrenewing talks with Israel.\n  President Assad did generally seem to share Prime Minister \nNetanyahu's desire to continue to ease and avoid military tensions \nwhich could lead to unintended hostilities. Although he denied having \nthe ability to control Hezbollah activities in Lebanon, President Assad \nreceived this portion of Prime Minister Netanyahu's message positively \nand reiterated his own return message to the same effect. President \nAssad's position was unmovable, however, regarding the terms for the \nreopening of talks with Israel.\n  The Syrian leader asserts with complete conviction that he will not \nrestart talks without a prior reaffirmation by Israel of the pledge he \nsays he received from the prior Israeli governments, and ratified in \nhis view by the United States as participants in the talks, for full \nIsraeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In his view the next round \nof talks are only properly about the details of security arrangements \nalong the new border and the process of normalization between the \ncountries, not on the territorial question itself. This is not a \n``precondition'' for future talks, he argues, because Syria already \nobtained this commitment from Israel and the United States in the prior \ntalks and that commitment binds Israel despite its change of \ngovernment.\n  I attempted to argue to President Assad that in any negotiation such \nas that between Syria and Israel, nothing is final until everything is \nfinal, and that in the absence of any signed document binding Israel as \na state, the new Israeli government was not obligated by the \nnegotiating position of a former administration. I also argued that \nPrime Minister Netanyahu's public comments accepting the land for peace \nframework for talks with Syria should be a sufficient basis to get back \nto the table and see what happens in that very different dynamic. I \ntried many formulations of these ideas but he would have none of it.\n  I returned to Israel that evening and met again with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, to brief him on my talks with President Assad, on the \nfollowing morning, Thursday, November 21, 1996.\n  While there is certainly a very sharp divide between the Israeli and \nSyrian leaders on the basis for a reopening of peace talks, I continue \nto believe that such a return to the negotiating table is not only \nessential, but possible if the American involvement in this process is \ntaken to a new level. I came away from this round of meetings convinced \nthat the logjam might be broken, but only with direct action by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  The United States has been more than an observer or facilitator of \nthe Israeli/Syrian peace process so far. We have been an indispensable \nparty, viewed by both sides as the guarantor of the integrity of both \nthe negotiating process and of any final outcome which might be \nachieved. If the different accounts of where the last round of talks \nleft off and what that means for future talks are to be resolved, it \nwill happen only with the most active American role at the highest \nlevel.\n  Since my return, I have discussed with the President's National \nSecurity advisor--and CIA Director designee--Anthony Lake, and his \nSpecial Mid-East Envoy, Dennis Ross, and I intend to discuss with the \nPresident directly, my suggestion that President Clinton invite \nPresident Assad--who has never been to this country--and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu to a meeting in the Oval Office--not to conclude a final \npeace treaty at this time but simply to find a formula for the \nreopening of talks between their countries.\n  While nothing is ever certain in such a difficult situation, I \nbelieve it would be productive for the President to raise the stakes of \nthe peace process between Israel and Syria--as an Oval Office \ninvitation would surely do--because the stakes of a continued state of \nwar between these two countries remain so high.\n  Mr. President, we must all continue to do all we can to find the path \nto a just and secure peace in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S587-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S588-S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING DAN KEMMIS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \na truly outstanding Montanan, and to make note of the recent honor \nextended to him by President Clinton.\n  Many in Montana know Dan Kemmis through his years of devoted public \nservice, first in the Montana Legislature, where he rose to the \nposition of Speaker of the House, and later as Mayor of the City of \nMissoula. In every aspect of public life, Dan has served as an example \nof the standards to which we all aspire. A true gentleman and a model \nleader he is a public servant who believes that the true greatness of \ndemocracy lives in the shared experience of the citizenry.\n  As mayor, even while working diligently on the problems of the day, \nDan continued to think ahead, authoring ``Community and the Politics of \nPlace'' in 1990, the acclaimed book serving as a\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nwritten testament to his work to foster a sense of community in \nMissoula. Then in 1995 a second work, ``The Good City and the Good \nLife,'' was published, again to an outstanding reception.\n  Many were surprised last spring when Dan stepped down as mayor to \naccept a new challenge as head of the Center for the Rocky Mountain \nWest at The University of Montana. To those of us who know him, \nhowever, the move is simply the progression of Dan's unique talents as \na leader. It is now his time to share the knowledge of the past years \nwith rest of America, and a time to learn anew.\n  This past month President Clinton recognized the contributions of Dan \nKemmis, not only to Missoula, but to communities throughout America, by \nawarding him the National Endowment for the Humanities' Charles Frankle \nPrize. I cannot think of an individual more deserving of the honor. \nThoughtful and compassionate, a true visionary and thinker, Dan is one \nof Montana's treasures and an American leader.\n  In his prose as in his life, Dan has worked to shape the politics of \nthe future, building consensus, and bringing people together, absent \nthe rhetoric of the past that simply seeks to divide. As President \nClinton so eloquently noted, he, ``* * * is a welcome and convincing \nvoice against cynicism and social divisiveness.'' For this alone, we \nall owe him a debt of gratitude.\n  I am honored to call Dan Kemmis a friend, and I join with all \nMontanans in expressing our thanks for his many years of service and \ncongratulations upon receiving this most prestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S588-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BREAST CANCER PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Breast \nCancer Patient Protection Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this legislation. This bill is about ensuring that women receive \nequitable treatment in our Nation's health care system. It puts the \ncare of grandmothers, mothers, and daughters with breast cancer before \nthe financial interests of insurance companies.\n  One of every eight women in America will develop breast cancer. These \nwomen will undergo breast cancer treatments such as mastectomies or \nlymph node removal. Insurance companies know they can cut costs and \nincrease profits if they give skimpy care to these women. Some \ninsurance plans send women home just hours after breast cancer surgery \nwith patients groggy from anesthesia, in pain and with drainage tubes \nstill in place. Other plans require outpatient mastectomies.\n  The American College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association \nsay that most patients are not ready to be sent home a few hours after \nsurgery. It is just not good medicine. I believe these doctors, who \nwant to do the right thing and give the right care, should not be \ndiscouraged or penalized for not following the insurance company's \nguidelines.\n  This legislation ensures that women with breast cancer receive the \nmedical attention they need and deserve. The bill ensures that health \nplans which provide medical and surgical benefits for the treatment of \nbreast cancer provide a minimum length of stay of 48 hours for patients \nundergoing mastectomies and 24 hours for those undergoing lymph node \nremovals. Under this bill, patients and their physicians--not insurance \ncompanies--can determine if a shorter period of hospital stay is \nappropriate.\n  So, I salute the authors of this bill, but I also salute the women, \nthe doctors, and the medical facilities that organized to challenge \nthese unfair practices. I want to see managed care, not mandated care. \nAnd I don't want to see doctors managed. There is a fundamental \ndistinction.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Paul Tsongas, \nwho lost his battle against cancer on Saturday. We have all lost a \ngreat friend; the Nation has lost an extraordinary American who defined \nthe concept of public service and whose courage and conviction set an \nexample for each and every one of us.\n  Paul was the son of Greek immigrants in Lowell, MA. He worked in his \nfather's drycleaning business, and served in the Peace Corps, as a \nLowell city councilor, as a Middlesex county commissioner, as a U.S. \nCongressman, and as a U.S. Senator in the seat that I am now honored to \noccupy.\n  Paul was able to achieve so much in his life because no matter where \nhe went, no matter what office he held, he never left the people of \nLowell. He instinctively understood not only their problems but also \nhow government could help provide some of the solutions which were \nnecessary to resolve them.\n  In 1992, when George Bush looked unbeatable, Paul Tsongas ran for the \nDemocratic Presidential nomination because he knew his ideas for our \nfuture were better.\n  We must not forget the timeless principles for which Paul Tsongas \nfought throughout his career in elective office: balancing the Federal \nbudget and establishing sound fiscal principles for the Federal \nGovernment, investing in our country and our children, and building our \neconomy so future generations can attain the dreams which seem to elude \nus today.\n  Although Paul did not win the nomination, he became the catalyst who \nturned the national spotlight on our fiscal policies and changed the \npolitical dialog in the United States forever.\n  After the campaign, Paul Tsongas joined with Warren Rudman and Pete \nPeterson to found the Concord Coalition to promote fiscal \nresponsibility. This organization again and again has drawn national \nattention to our Nation's fiscal agenda.\n  Since the 1992 Presidential campaign, we have cut the Federal budget \ndeficit by more than half. The question in Washington is no longer \n``Can we balance the budget?'', but ``How soon can we do so?'' Much of \nthe progress we have made can be attributed to Paul Tsongas and his \neconomic call to arms.\n  The rebuilt, reinvigorated city of Lowell, MA is another long-lasting \nmemorial to Paul. He as much or more than any other person shepherded \nthe revitalization program through the Congress, and by seeing and \nbreathing life into a local pride and spirit that were still alive, he \ntransformed a rundown mill town into an international destination with \nan amazing story to tell and show visitors from near and far.\n  Paul Tsongas' accomplishments only explain part of what made him so \nextraordinary. There is no way to explain the impact on others of his \ndecency, integrity, and courage. But that impact was real and \npronounced.\n  In 1983, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The next year \nhe retired from the Senate in order to spend more time with his wife \nNiki, and his three daughters, Ashley, Katina, and Molly. He \nsuccessfully battled cancer for over a decade with a sense of grace and \na strength of character that are remarkable.\n  It is terribly hard to acknowledge the death of such a person. Paul \nwill be greatly and genuinely missed because he was greatly and \ngenuinely loved. That is a compliment to which all of us can aspire \nwhen we leave this Earth. But Paul's life took him a step beyond even \nthat status among his family and friends and all who know or observed \nhim in his public service.\n  We can say truthfully and appreciatively that we are better people \nbecause of the example Paul Tsongas set during his life. In that way, \nhe not only improved the lives of many in very direct ways, he will \ncontinue to live on as an inspiration to us.\n  We will miss him, but we are comforted by what he has given to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S589-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S589-S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SCHOOLS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1, the Safe and \nAffordable Schools Act. I am pleased Senator Coverdell has introduced \nthis important legislation which will provide our children with an \naffordable, quality education. By making this bill the first bill of \nthe 105th Congress, it demonstrates to the American people the \nimportance this Senate has placed on the education of our children.\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\n  I would like to comment on a very important provision contained in \nthis bill which will make higher education more affordable. For the \npast several years, I have worked to allow the earnings invested in \nState-sponsored tuition savings accounts to grow tax-free when used for \nhigher education expenses. This bill also will cover room and board \ncost. These changes will help families offset the rising cost of \neducation by rewarding those who save.\n  For the past several years, I have worked to eliminate the tax on \neducation savings. In 1994, I first introduced S. 1787, to make a \nfamily's investment earnings tax-free when invested in a State tuition \nsavings plan. Again, in the 104th Congress, I introduced a similar \nbill, S. 386. Both bills were endorsed by the National Association of \nState Treasurers and their College Savings Plan Network, which \nrepresents the individual State programs.\n  On July 9, 1996, Congress passed many of the reforms proposed in S. \n386, as part of the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 1996. This \nlegislation was signed into law by the President on August 20, 1996.\n  While we made important gains last year, we need to finish what we \nstarted and fully exempt investment income from taxation. This \nlegislation does that. It also expands the definition of qualified \neducation expense to include room and board. Such costs make up nearly \n50 percent of annual college expenses.\n  The facts are clear; education costs are outpacing wage growth and \nhave created a barrier for students wanting to attend college. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office, tuition costs at a 4-year \npublic university rose 234 percent between 1980-94. During this same \nperiod, median household income rose only 84 percent. It is no wonder \nfewer families can afford to send their children to college without \nfinancial assistance.\n  As tuition costs continue to increase, so does the need for \nassistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form \nof financial assistance.\n  Today, it is increasingly common for students to study now, and pay \nlater. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear additional \nloan costs in order to receive an education. In 1994, Federal education \nloan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, \nstudents have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of \n28 percent.\n  So, not only are more students taking out more loans, they are taking \nout bigger loans as well. This year, nearly half of college graduates \nhit the pavement with their diplomas in one hand and a stack of loan \nrepayment books in the other.\n  I believe we need to reverse this trend by boosting savings and \nhelping families meet the education needs of their children before they \nenter college. If we continue to ignore this problem, more and more \nchildren will be forced to burden themselves with an increasing debt \nload when they go in search of their first job. This can be avoided \nwith passage of S. 1.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to build on the accomplishments of last \nyear, I look forward to working with Senator Coverdell, the sponsor of \nthis legislation, and the Senate Labor and Finance Committees to help \nfamilies meet the rising cost of higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S589-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report Executive Calendar No. \n1.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Madeleine Korbel \nAlbright, of the District of Columbia, to be Secretary of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, am I correct there is a 2-hour time \nagreement on the nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will fulfill its constitutional duty \non the nomination of Madeleine Albright to serve as Secretary of State \nof the United States. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations met for \nmore than 6 hours on January 8, to consider this nomination. During \nthat hearing, the committee heard from then Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher, who presented Ambassador Albright, and I think that is the \nfirst time in history that an outgoing Secretary has presented to a \ncommittee the nominee to succeed him. In any case, Secretary \nChristopher presented her, and the nominee, Mrs. Albright, was \nquestioned extensively by all members of the committee on a broad range \nof national security issues.\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed to keep the record \nopen until the close of business on January 10, so Senators could \nsubmit written questions to the nominee. And twelve Senators did submit \nmore than 200 such questions, all of which were answered in writing by \nAmbassador Albright.\n  The committee still has an outstanding document request concerning \nSomalia, and we fully expect that the administration will cooperate and \ncomply with that request, as the administration has promised to do.\n  In any case, this past Monday, January 20, after members had spent \nseveral days examining the written responses to questions, the \ncommittee met in a business meeting to consider the nomination. By a \nvote of 18 to nothing, unanimously, the Committee on Foreign Relations \nfavorably reported the Albright nomination.\n  There are Senators who support this nomination but who, nonetheless, \nhave honest disagreements with Ambassador Albright on major foreign \npolicy issues. As I mentioned in the hearing myself, while I do not \ndoubt that Ambassador Albright is sincere, on some issues I believe her \nto be sincerely wrong. Some of those differences were discussed during \nthe hearing, others in private. And we will continue to discuss them \nafter she is confirmed, which I am certain she will be.\n  Notwithstanding our differences, Mrs. Albright is a lady who \nunderstands Congress. She understands the important role that Congress \nmust play in developing U.S. foreign policy. However, my support for \nthe nominee should in no way be misconstrued as an endorsement of the \nadministration's conduct of foreign policy. It would be insincere of me \nif I pretended otherwise. Many Americans, among them myself, hope that \nin the area of foreign policy, the next 4 years will not produce a \nsequel to the travail of the first 4 years.\n  After 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the White House, \nthe United States had once again become the undisputed leader of the \nfree world. Our friends followed us, and our enemies, the enemies of \nfreedom, thanks to Presidents Reagan and Bush, feared and respected the \nUnited States, because we were strong. The emphasis was on our \nconstitutional requirement as a tripartite Government, to make sure \nthat this Nation would lead the world as a strong, strong democracy.\n  Many of those important gains have been neutralized by a foreign \npolicy too often vacillating and insecure; a foreign policy that has \nresponded to world events, rather than shaping world events. And it is \nquite revealing when this administration, as it often does, boasts that \nthe invasion of Haiti was a great foreign policy accomplishment.\n  Mr. President, sending American soldiers into harm's way on a tiny \nCaribbean island with no vital interest at stake to replace one group \nof thugs with another group of thugs does not seem to me to be much of \nan accomplishment. In any event, the Haiti excursion, at last count, \nhas cost the American taxpayers more than $2 billion.\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\n  From there the list goes on and on: from Bosnia, where the United \nStates subcontracted to the terrorist regime in Iran our \nresponsibilities to help the Bosnians defend against genocide; to \nChina, where vacillation led Beijing to believe it could get away with \nbullying Taiwan; to Somalia, where an uncertain United States policy \nresulted in the tragic and unnecessary deaths of 18 American Rangers; \nto Iraq, where our CIA Director himself admitted that Saddam Hussein is \nnow politically stronger than ever before.\n  Time and time again, during the past 4 years, a message of weakened \nresolve was sent around the world, and with tragic results.\n  History teaches us one unmistakably clear lesson, I think, Mr. \nPresident, that being that the security of the American people is \nalways less certain when our adversaries doubt our resolve, and our \nadversaries very much doubt our resolve at this moment.\n  If confirmed, Ambassador Albright must move swiftly and decisively to \nreverse that trend, and we have discussed it. As I said earlier, she is \na strong lady, she is a courageous lady. She has proved that, and she \nis going to have to continue to push for strength of the United States. \nShe must bring strength and courage and coherence and direction and \nfresh ideas to America's foreign policy.\n  Let's face it, one of her most critical responsibilities, if \nconfirmed--and she will be--will be that the responsibility of advising \nthe President when and where and under what conditions to commit \nAmerican forces to combat or to dangerous missions abroad. Senator \nChuck Hagel, a distinguished veteran of the Vietnam war and one of the \nnewest members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, properly \npressed nominee Albright on this very point during the hearing, as did \nanother distinguished Senator, John Ashcroft. I applaud these two \nSenators for their perseverance on this issue, because their concerns \nare shared by many Senators and millions of the American people.\n  We must make certain that never again will American troops be sent \ninto harm's way unless and until there is a clearly defined and precise \nmission and exit strategy and a clear American national security \ninterest at stake. The debacle in Somalia vividly demonstrated that \nassertive multilateralism is no way to promote any conceivable American \nnational security interest.\n  Mr. President, Ambassador Albright, based on her testimony, and I \nthink on her career, appears to understand that concern. We have \ndiscussed it, and I am sure other Senators have discussed it with her \nas well. She acknowledged to the committee that with respect to the use \nof U.S. troops overseas, she has, and I quote her, ``learned many \nlessons.'' And I thank the Lord for that.\n  She further said she is ``deeply regretful of the lives lost in \nSomalia.'' Moreover, she assured the committee that she would ``never \nadvise using American forces where other means are available, where \nthere is not the support of Congress and the people, where there is not \na possibility of or where there is no exit strategy, and where there is \nnot the likelihood or the reality of winning.'' End of quote, \nAmbassador Albright.\n  Actions speak louder than words, of course, and we will be watching \nher closely. She knows that. She expects that. We will watch her to \nensure that this administration has, in fact, learned from the \ndisasters of the past 4 years.\n  Another key responsibility of the next Secretary of State will be to \nreform and restructure the antiquated foreign policy bureaucracy. The \n104th Congress passed major legislation to streamline our foreign \npolicy apparatus and eliminate three unnecessary, bloated, and outdated \nFederal bureaucracies, one of which was described by its proponents in \nthe 1960's as a ``temporary'' Federal agency. It is like Ronald Reagan \nsaid: Nothing is so near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency. \nBut these agencies were promised to be in the 1950's and 1960's \ntemporary, and they are still around spending money, in so many, many \ncases, unwisely.\n\n  Our plan last year, and the plan that will be submitted this year, \nwill save the American people more than a billion dollars. Instead of \nendorsing that legislation last year and the year before, which was \nvigorously supported and endorsed by five former Secretaries of State, \nthe administration opposed it every step of the way. In fact, the \nadministration, while trashing our proposal, never came forward with a \nproposal of its own, despite promises to do so by the administration.\n  Vice President Gore, who served in the Senate and whom all of us \nlike, issued a statement on January 27, 1995, promising the American \npeople a plan to streamline the U.S. foreign policy bureaucracy and \nsave, in his words--these are not my words, these are Al Gore's words--\nto save $5 billion over 5 years.\n  But 2 years have passed and the distinguished Vice President has yet \nto put forward any such proposal. I am hopeful that Madeleine Albright \nwill prod our friend and former colleague, Al Gore, and get to work \nwith us on this problem, because it is a jointly realized problem.\n  We must work together, and I hope I have indicated already, and some \nof the rest of us, that we want to work together. I pledge to do that. \nThe support for our plan has not diminished, it has grown, among the \nAmerican people.\n  If Madeleine Albright is confirmed, I intend to schedule an early \nmeeting with her and other key Senators for the purpose of working \ntogether and reaching agreement on a bipartisan plan to restructure our \nforeign policy institutions to meet the new challenges we will face in \nour next century.\n  The point is this: Republican or Democrat--it doesn't matter--none of \nus should be willing to stand by and allow America to enter a new \nmillennium with antiquated foreign policy institutions built, let's \nface it, to fight the cold war. And mark my words, if I have anything \nto do with it, we will not do so.\n  Mrs. Albright assured the committee that she will keep an open mind \nas she discusses this matter, and others. I intend to hold her to that \ncommitment to work with us, to consult with us and cooperate with us so \nthat we can work together for the goals that she and we have discussed \nand mutually agreed to.\n  Mrs. Albright must also work with Congress to achieve serious and \nlasting reform at the United Nations. The selection of a new Secretary \nGeneral is an important first step, but it is only one step.\n  I think the American people are tired of all the rhetoric from the \ninternational community and the State Department blaming the United \nStates for the United Nations' so-called fiscal crisis. One quarter of \nevery dollar that the United Nations receives for its budget comes from \nthe taxpayers of the United States. Over all, American taxpayers \ncontribute upwards of $3.5 billion to the United Nations. By contrast, \nmore than half of the United Nations members pay just one-hundredth of \n1 percent of the United Nations regular budget. Senators must keep that \nin mind as we begin discussions on U.N. reform. Many countries have no \nincentive to reform because they gain more from the United Nations than \nthey put into it.\n\n  So let me summarize in conclusion, Mr. President. Mrs. Albright knows \nthat I intend to work with her. I think she understands that the entire \nForeign Relations Committee intends to work with her. I intend to also \nwork with the new Secretary-General, Mr. Annan, and with Senator Rod \nGrams, who is our congressional delegate to the United Nations, who has \ndeveloped an important expertise on this issue. We will work with all \nof these and other Members of Congress to bring true reform to the \nUnited Nations, which is long overdue and badly needed.\n  I believe that on balance Mrs. Albright is well qualified for the \npost of Secretary of State. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot \nof things on our agenda, and I look forward to working with her in \nmoving our agenda forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from California \nis recognized to speak on the nomination under the time controlled by \nthe minority.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\ncomments and also for the speed with which he processed this \nnomination. I think it is very important and significant that he has \ndone that, and it certainly speaks for the best interests of \nbipartisanship.\n  Mr. President, as the only woman on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nI consider this to be a historic appointment indeed. I rise to say that \nI am proud to indicate my very enthusiastic support for Madeleine \nAlbright to be confirmed before this body as Secretary of State.\n  I want to commend President Clinton because he was certainly faced \nwith an array of very qualified candidates. But I think he chose one of \nthe very, very best. Anyone who heard her thoughtful responses to some \n6 hours of questioning during her confirmation hearing would have been \nimpressed by her knowledge, her eloquence and her skill. I fully expect \nAmbassador Albright to be a truly superb Secretary of State.\n  I look forward to working with her as various foreign policy issues \ncome before the Senate of the United States. It is difficult to imagine \na background and a body of experience better suited to the person we \ncall on to be our Nation's chief diplomat and the President's chief \nforeign policy advisor. Madeleine Albright knows firsthand the \n``streets'' of foreign policy, how actions by governments affect the \nlives of individuals. Her enormous intellect, her personal experience, \nher plain speaking, I think, will be huge assets.\n  As the United States approaches the 21st century, I believe it is \ncrucial that our foreign policy be conducted in a bipartisan manner. \nThe practice of reinventing the wheel of foreign policy every 4 years \nor at least with every change of administration has been difficult on \nour allies and weakens American credibility as the strongest nation on \nEarth.\n  Madeleine Albright holds a unique opportunity to cement a bipartisan \nforeign policy. If she can accomplish this, her legacy to this Nation \nand the world will be significant. One of the most complex issues that \nshe will face, and the largest single area that I believe needs focused \nattention, is the entire Pacific rim. With 60 percent of the people of \nthe world now living on the shores of the Pacific and American trade \nwith the Pacific rim nations three times that of the Atlantic, the \nadministration's No. 1 priority in foreign policy should be to maintain \na strong and positive presence in Asia.\n\n  As part of this effort, the United States must build our most \nimportant, but still largely undeveloped, bilateral relationship--that \nwith the People's Republic of China--into one of partnership and \ncooperation in our many areas of mutual interest.\n  Ambassador Albright's qualifications to be Secretary of State are \nunimpeachable. For the past 4 years she has served with distinction as \nthe U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a member of \nthe President's Cabinet, and a member of the staff of the National \nSecurity Council.\n  She has also headed one of Washington's foremost think tanks, served \nas professor of international affairs at Georgetown University's School \nof Foreign Service, and holds a doctorate from Columbia University. \nAnd, I might add, she served as a staff member for one of the true \ngiants of the U.S. Senate, Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to serve \nas Secretary of State.\n  Beyond her professional accomplishments, her life--having fled \nCzechoslovakia at the dawn of the Second World War--provides a lesson \nin the values that we as Americans hold most dear and for the role in \nthe world that America, at its best, can play.\n  As the first woman to serve as Secretary of State, Madeleine \nAlbright's nomination will open up new doors for all women, not just in \nthis country, but around the globe, in places unaccustomed to seeing \nwomen in high office. Whenever a woman crosses a threshold into an area \nthat has been predominantly held by men, and performs effectively, the \ndoors open for women everywhere.\n  I take particular pride in casting my vote for Ambassador Madeleine \nAlbright. It is a tremendous step forward in our country for a woman to \nbe named the Nation's top diplomat. As consequential as that is, in \nMadeleine Albright's case it is really a secondary consideration, \nbecause she is so eminently qualified for the job.\n  Although I am sure it is unnecessary to do so, I take pride in urging \nall of my colleagues to support this outstanding nomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and, Mr. President, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nMadeleine Albright for Secretary of State. Ms. Albright brings a \nlifetime of credentials to the job. She has superb experience as a \npractitioner of the craft of diplomacy, and a wide knowledge of outside \nopinion on the range of options and potential solutions that confront \nus in given international situations. More than that, and most \nappropriate for the rather free-wheeling, often confusing international \nenvironment that we currently face, she is an initiator and an exponent \nof an energetic and forward-looking American leadership in world \naffairs.\n  Ms. Albright acquitted herself admirably as our most recent \nAmbassador to the United Nations. She is, I believe, sensitive to the \nrole of Congress in formulating foreign policies, certainly partly \nbecause she has served as a foreign policy staffer in the Senate to the \nlate Senator Ed Muskie of Maine. She has served in various posts in \nprevious administrations, and stayed active on the faculty of \nGeorgetown University while the other party controlled the White House \nand foreign policy making apparatus.\n  At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright, as a matter of practice \nand of principle, put American interests first, as she should have, but \nalso introduced overdue cost analysis as a requirement in the \ndevelopment of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the \ncommitment of United Nations contingents abroad. She made the American \nweight felt in the Security Council, not the least in her successful \neffort to bring a new Secretary General to power in New York.\n  There were, in the early years of the first administration of \nPresident Clinton, some growing pains in sorting out the role of the \nUnited States in the disorder that we confronted in the aftermath of \nthe cold war, particularly as it related to the proper approach for \nboth the United Nations and the United States in peacekeeping and so-\ncalled peace enforcing operations. We all learned some lessons from the \nexperience of our involvement in Somalia, and the administration \nlearned some lessons, as well. Ambassador Albright moved forcefully to \nresolve those lessons and established a laudable and workable mechanism \nfor frequent consultation between her staff in New York, the State \nDepartment here in Washington, and the interested Senators and \ncommittees here in the Congress. I think that she believes, as I do, \nthat early and substantive consultations between the administration and \nthe Congress are essential for the successful conduct of American \nforeign affairs, and I fully expect the early development of an \neffective working relationship in that regard after she is confirmed by \nthe Senate.\n  I congratulate Ms. Albright for her selection as the first female \nnominee to be an American Secretary of State, and I look forward to \nworking with her during her tenure at the helm of the Department of \nState and its far-flung operations around the globe.\n  I shall cast my vote for Madeleine Albright this afternoon, and I \nshall do it with enthusiasm and with faith in her ability to perform \nthe job and to perform it well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 45 minutes, 10 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me begin, while both my senior colleagues are on \nthe floor here, by complimenting Senator\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nByrd on his ringing endorsement of Madeleine Albright. Senator Helms \nand I have been around here a long while, 24 years. But that is a short \ntime compared to the senior Senator from West Virginia. We all know \nthat when he stands to take the floor and give his endorsement to a \ncandidate who requires confirmation, probably more than any other \nSenator on this floor, the Chamber listens.\n  Madeleine Albright is a fine candidate, but she is also a lucky \ncandidate today to have such strong support from the Senator from West \nVirginia, and, as well, she is fortunate to have the Senator from North \nCarolina as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I publicly \nthank him for how gracious he has been and for how he has expedited \nthis nomination. We all know he is a man of very strong convictions, \nand we all know that when Senator Helms concludes that there is \nsomething moving in the Senate too swiftly, or it is something he does \nnot support, he is, along with the Senator from West Virginia, maybe \nthe most effective person on the Republican side of the aisle in \nslowing things down.\n  There was a lot of discussion in the press and a lot of discussion in \nthe Cloakrooms about whether or not Senator Helms was going to \ncooperate. I am here to tell you that he has not only cooperated, he \nhas expedited it, and he has been, as always, the consummate gentleman \nin the way in which he has dealt with his colleagues, the new ranking \nmember in particular, but the committee in general and the Senate as a \nwhole. I personally thank him for doing what I never doubted he would \ndo once he concluded he was going to get this on the floor early. I \nwant the record to note that we are moving on one of the two most \nimportant Cabinet posts, and we are doing it before anything else has \nhappened in this body. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, to state the obvious, I strongly support Madeleine \nAlbright's nomination to become the 65th Secretary of State of the \nUnited States of America. Obviously, along with others who have spoken, \nI commend the President for nominating her.\n  There was a friend of ours who doesn't always like having a quote \nattributed to him, but I must attribute every quote. I never want to \nmake that mistake again. I will not use his name, but I will \nacknowledge that this is not emanating from me. We had a colleague who \nserved with the Senator from North Carolina and me for some years--and \nI will tell him the name after I finish--who used to say, ``It is great \nin politics when conscience and convenience cross paths.''\n  I would suggest that Madeleine Albright's nomination to be Secretary \nof State meets that test like none other since I have been here. This \nis truly a historic occasion. I know we do not and should not think in \nterms of quotas and affirmative action. But the fact of the matter is \nthis is one of two remaining bastions where the mindset, I think, of a \nforeign policy establishment, the mindset of the public, the mindset of \neveryone, is that it is sort of the province of men. And that \nstereotypical notion is, in large part because of the cooperation of \nthe Senator from North Carolina, about to end today. That does not mean \nthat makes anyone a good Secretary of State or makes her the most \nqualified person. But that is where the conscience part comes in. It \njust so happens that the woman we are about to confirm--God willing and \nthe creeks not rising--is also eminently qualified to be Secretary of \nState.\n  I have been here too long to use phrases like ``this is the most \nqualified person.'' There are 50 people maybe in America who are \nqualified to do this job, and there are probably 10 as qualified, but \nnone more qualified than Madeleine Albright.\n  One of the things I think that has endeared her and recommended her \nto Senator Helms and to me, both of us having served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee for so long, is that we have encountered Madeleine \nAlbright in our official capacities and our personal political lives on \na number of other occasions, and we have found her, as professor, as \nforeign policy adviser, and as a politically active academic, to be \nextremely incisive, blunt, to the point, and honest with us in her \nassessments. You have no idea--maybe you do, Mr. President, but the \nlonger you are here it will become even more apparent. I find that the \nhardest speak to understand is foreign policy speak. And I sometimes \nused to kid, after years of being the chairman or the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I would say to the witness, ``You sound like \nyou are from the State Department.'' That means that you get a \nnonanswer; never a wrong answer, but a nonanswer. Madeleine Albright is \nvery straightforward. And it is a welcome thing. We had that in other \nSecretaries of State, Democrat and Republican. But it is always nice to \nknow.\n  In her 4 years as our Representative to the United Nations, \nAmbassador Albright has ably demonstrated her qualifications to carry \nAmerican foreign policy into the 21st century. Her personal history, \nher academic research and writing, her diplomatic experience, and her \npolitical acumen make her uniquely qualified to lead this country in \nworking with our friends and allies--and our adversaries, and there are \nsome--to further our national interests and the ideals of freedom and \ndemocracy that we espouse as a nation.\n  As we all know by now, Ambassador Albright was not born an American. \nShe and her family chose to come to these shores out of a deep \nappreciation of what America stands for. She was born in \nCzechoslovakia, which between the two world wars was the only country \nin Central Europe to share our commitment to freedom and democracy.\n  She was twice forced to flee her native land, first in the wake of \nthe Nazi occupation, then 10 years later after a Communist coup. She \nhas seen first-hand the two worst forms of tyranny of this century, and \nshe vividly understands the importance of standing firm against \naggressors who seek to subvert freedom.\n  The young Madeleine Korbel earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley \nCollege in political science in 1959, worked briefly as a journalist, \nthen married and raised three bright, accomplished, and lovely \ndaughters, two of whom I have had the occasion to get to speak with and \nget to know a little bit better.\n\n  At the same time she was raising her family, she attended graduate \nschool at Columbia University. In 1968, she earned her master's degree \nand the certificate of the Russian Institute at Columbia. She went on \nto receive her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1976.\n  With her doctorate in hand, she came to Washington to work for one of \nthe finest men ever to serve in this Senate--the late Senator from \nMaine, Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to become Secretary of State. \nAs his chief legislative assistant, she gained an appreciation for the \nrole of the Senate in helping the President and the Secretary of State \ncraft American foreign policy, experience on which she will draw as we \nwork with her in the years ahead.\n  Ambassador Albright left Senator Muskie's staff in 1978 to work for \nher former professor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, on the staff of President \nCarter's National Security Council. She then worked at two of the most \nprestigious think-tanks in Washington--the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars--before becoming a professor at Georgetown University in 1982.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe official biography of Madeleine Albright.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Madeleine Korbel Albright\n\n       Madeleine Korbel Albright was appointed by President \n     Clinton on January 27, 1993, as the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations. President Clinton \n     elevated this position and made the Ambassador a member of \n     his Cabinet and a member of the National Security Council.\n       Prior to her appointment, Ambassador Albright was the \n     President of the Center for National Policy. The Center is a \n     non-profit research organization, formed in 1981 by \n     representatives from government, industry, labor and \n     education. Its mandate is to promote the study and discussion \n     of domestic and international issues.\n       As a Research Professor of International Affairs and \n     Director of the Women in Foreign Service Program at \n     Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, she taught \n     undergraduate and graduate courses in international affairs, \n     U.S. foreign policy, Russian\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\n     foreign policy, and Central and Eastern European politics, \n     and was responsible for developing and implementing programs \n     designed to enhance women's professional opportunities in \n     international affairs.\n       In 1981-82 Ambassador Albright was awarded a fellowship at \n     the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the \n     Smithsonian following an international competition in which \n     she wrote about the role of the press in political changes in \n     Poland in 1980-82.\n       She also served as a Senior Fellow in Soviet and Eastern \n     European Affairs at the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies, conducting research in developments \n     and trends in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n       From 1978-1981 Ambassador Albright was a Staff Member on \n     the National security Council, as well as a White House staff \n     member, where she was responsible for foreign policy \n     legislation.\n       From 1976-1978, she served as Chief Legislative Assistant \n     to Senator Edmund S. Muskie.\n       Other professional experience includes Board Member of the \n     National Endowment for Democracy, Board Member of the \n     International Media Fund, Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to \n     Presidential Candidate Michael S. Dukakis, Foreign Policy \n     Advisor to the Mondale-Ferraro campaign, Vice-Chair of the \n     National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, \n     Member of the Board of Directors of the Atlantic Council of \n     the United States, Member of the Board of Trustees of \n     Wellesley College, Member of the Board of Trustees of the \n     Black Student Fund, Member of the U.S. National Commission \n     for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \n     Organization, Member of the Board of Trustees of \n     the Washington Urban League, Member of the Board of \n     Directors of the Center for National Policy, Member of the \n     Chapter of the Washington National Cathedral, Member of \n     the Board of Trustees of Williams College, Member of the \n     Board of Trustees of the Democratic Forum, Member of the \n     Executive Committee of D.C. Citizens for Better Public \n     Education, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Beauvoir \n     School, Public Relations Staff of the Encyclopedia \n     Britannica, and Reporter on the Rolla Daily News, Rolla, \n     Missouri.\n       Awarded a B.A. from Wellesley College with honors in \n     Political Science, she studied at the School of Advanced \n     International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, received a \n     Certificate from the Russian Institute at Columbia \n     University, and her Masters and Doctorate from Columbia \n     University's Department of Public Law and Government.\n       Ambassador Albright is fluent in French and Czech, with \n     good speaking and reading abilities in Russian and Polish.\n       Selected writings include ``Poland, the Role of the Press \n     in Political Change'' (New York: Praeger with the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies, Georgetown University, \n     Washington, D.C. 1983); ``The Role of the Press in Political \n     Change: Czechoslovakia 1968'' (Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia \n     University 1976); and ``The Soviet Diplomatic Service: \n     Profile of an Elite'' (Master's Thesis, Columbia University \n     1968).\n       Ambassador Albright has three daughters.\n       For future correspondence, the Ambassador may be reached at \n     either her Washington, D.C. or New York, offices: Suite 6333, \n     Department of State, 2201 C Street N.W., Washington, D.C. \n     20520-6319, or U.S. Mission to the United Nations, 799 United \n     Nations Plaza, New York, New York 10017.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the 1980's as the Communist countries of \nCentral and Eastern Europe were casting off the Soviet yoke, then-\nProfessor Albright conducted research into the attitudes of the people \nof these countries, and she wrote about the need to assist them in \ntheir transition from communism to freedom.\n  That is where Senator Helms and I and others on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee got to see her again because she came and testified about \nthat research and the polling data that she conducted.\n  Her academic and personal understanding of these issues will allow \nher to formulate policies to encourage the continued spread of \npolitical and economic freedom throughout the world as she attempts to \nimplement this administration's foreign policy.\n  At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright successfully advanced and \ndefended American interests and enlisted the support of others for our \npolicies. Her straight talk and tireless commitment won her the \nadmiration of Democrats and Republicans alike. She recognizes that \nwhile it is sometimes in America's interest to act alone, always acting \nalone is ineffective and an unnecessary use of our resources.\n  Two weeks ago, Ambassador Albright came before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and outlined a comprehensive framework for American \nforeign policy into the next century, one in which none of us, I think, \nis likely to accept wholesale. But that is the way the process is \nsupposed to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her insightful statement \nto our committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Secretary of State-Designate Madeleine K. Albright Before \n        the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--January 8, 1997\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a great \n     honor and pleasure to be here with you this morning. I want \n     to begin by thanking the President for his trust in \n     nominating me to this high and very challenging position.\n       I am very grateful to Secretary Christopher both for his \n     kind words of introduction and for the opportunity he has \n     given me these past four years to observe how a steady and \n     determined diplomat conducts business.\n       And I appreciate very much the Committee's courtesy in \n     scheduling this hearing so promptly.\n       Mr. Chairman, we have reached a point more than halfway \n     between the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the start \n     of a new century. Our nation is respected and at peace. Our \n     alliances are vigorous. Our economy is strong. And from the \n     distant corners of Asia, to the emerging democracies of \n     Central Europe and Africa, to the community of democracies \n     that exists within our own hemisphere--and to the one \n     impermanent exception to that community, Castro's Cuba--\n     American institutions and ideals are a model for those who \n     have, or who aspire to, freedom.\n       All this is no accident, and its continuation is by no \n     means inevitable. Democratic progress must be sustained as it \n     was built--by American leadership. And our leadership must be \n     sustained if our interests are to be protected around the \n     world.\n       Do not doubt, those interests are not geopolitical \n     abstractions, they are real.\n       It matters to our children whether they grow up in a world \n     where the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction have \n     been minimized or allowed to run out of control.\n       It matters to the millions of Americans who work, farm or \n     invest whether the global economy continues to create good \n     new jobs and open new markets, or whether--through \n     miscalculation or protectionism--it begins to spiral \n     downward.\n       It matters to our families whether illegal drugs continue \n     to pour into our neighborhoods from overseas.\n       It matters to Americans who travel abroad or go about their \n     daily business at home whether the scourge of international \n     terrorism is reduced.\n       It matters to our workers and businesspeople whether they \n     will be unfairly forced to compete against companies that \n     violate fair labor standards, despoil the environment or gain \n     contracts not through competition but corruption.\n       And it matters to us all whether through inattention or \n     indifference, we allow small wars to grow into large ones \n     that put our safety and freedom at risk.\n       To defeat the dangers and seize the opportunities, we must \n     be more than audience, more even than actors, we must be the \n     authors of the history of our age.\n       A half century ago, after the devastation caused by \n     Depression, holocaust and war, it was not enough to say that \n     what we were against had failed. Leaders such as Truman, \n     Marshall and Vandenberg were determined to build a lasting \n     peace. And together with our allies, they forged a set of \n     institutions that would defend freedom, rebuild economies, \n     uphold law and preserve peace.\n       Today, it is not enough for us to say that Communism has \n     failed. We must continue building a new framework--adapted to \n     the demands of a new century--that will protect our citizens \n     and our friends; reinforce our values; and secure our future.\n       In so doing, we must direct our energies, not as our \n     predecessors did, against a single virulent ideology. We face \n     a variety of threats, some as old as ethnic conflict; some as \n     new as letter bombs; some as long-term as global warming; \n     some as dangerous as nuclear weapons falling into the wrong \n     hands.\n       To cope with such a variety of threats, we will need a full \n     range of foreign policy tools.\n       That is why our armed forces must remain the best-led, \n     best-trained, best-equipped and most respected in the world. \n     And as President Clinton has pledged, and our military \n     leaders ensure, they will.\n       It is also why we need first-class diplomacy. Force, and \n     the credible possibility of its use, are essential to defend \n     our vital interests and to keep America safe. But force alone \n     can be a blunt instrument, and there are many problems it \n     cannot solve.\n       To be effective, force and diplomacy must complement and \n     reinforce each other. For there will be many occasions, in \n     many places, where we will rely on diplomacy to protect our \n     interests, and we will expect our diplomats to defend those \n     interests with skill, knowledge and spine.\n       If confirmed, one of my most important tasks will be to \n     work with Congress to ensure that we have the superb \n     diplomatic representation that our people deserve and our \n     interests demand. We cannot have that on the cheap. We must \n     invest the resources needed to maintain American leadership. \n     Consider the stakes. We are talking here about one percent of \n     our federal budget, but that one percent may well determine \n     fifty\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\n     percent of the history that is written about our era.\n       Unfortunately, as Senator Lugar recently pointed out, \n     currently, ``our international operations are underfunded and \n     understaffed.'' He noted, as well, that not only our \n     interests, but our efforts to balance the budget would be \n     damaged if American disengagement were to result in ``nuclear \n     terrorism, a trade war, an energy crisis, a major regional \n     conflict . . . or some other preventable disaster.\n       Mr. Chairman, we are the world's richest, strongest, most \n     respected nation. We are also the largest debtor to the \n     United Nations and the international financial institutions. \n     We provide a smaller percentage of our wealth to support \n     democracy and growth in the developing world than any other \n     industrialized nation.\n       And over the past four years, the Department of State has \n     cut more than 2000 employees, downgraded positions, closed \n     more than 30 embassies or consulates, and deferred badly-\n     needed modernization of infrastructure and communications. We \n     have also suffered a 30% reduction in our foreign assistance \n     programs since 1991.\n       It is said that we have moved from an era where the big \n     devour the small to an era where the fast devour the slow. If \n     that is the case, your State Department, with its obsolete \n     technology, $300 million in deferred maintenance and a \n     shrinking base of skilled personnel, is in trouble.\n       If confirmed, I will strive to fulfill my obligation to \n     manage our foreign policy effectively and efficiently. I will \n     work with this Committee and the Congress to ensure that the \n     American public gets full value for each tax dollar spent. \n     But I will also want to ensure that our foreign policy \n     successfully promotes and protects the interests of the \n     American people.\n       In addition, I will want to work with you to spur continued \n     reform and to pay our bills at the United Nations, an \n     organization that Americans helped create, that reflects \n     ideals that we share and that serves goals of stability, law \n     and international cooperation that are in our interests.\n       The debate over adequate funding for foreign policy is not \n     new in America. It has been joined repeatedly from the time \n     the Continental Congress sent Ben Franklin to Paris, to the \n     proposals for Lend Lease and the Marshall Plan that bracketed \n     World War II, to the start of the SEED and Nunn-Lugar \n     programs a few years ago. In each case, history has looked \n     more kindly on those who argued for our engagement than on \n     those who said we just could not afford to lead.\n       Mr. Chairman, any framework for American leadership must \n     include measures to control the threats posed by weapons of \n     mass destruction and terror; to seize the opportunities that \n     exist for setting dangerous regional conflicts; to maintain \n     America as the hub of an expanding global economy; and to \n     defend cherished principles of democracy and law.\n       At the center of that framework, however, are our key \n     alliances and relationships. These are the bonds that hold \n     together not only our foreign policy, but the entire \n     international system. When we are able to act cooperatively \n     with the other leading nations, we create a dynamic web of \n     principle, power and purpose that elevates standards and \n     propels progress around the globe. This is our opportunity, \n     for in the post Cold War era, big power diplomacy is not a \n     zero-sum game.\n\n\n                     the trans-atlantic partnership\n\n       A foremost example is the trans-Atlantic partnership.\n       It is a central lesson of this century that America must \n     remain a European power. We have an interest in European \n     security, because we wish to avoid the instability that drew \n     five million Americans across the Atlantic to fight in two \n     world wars. We have an interest in European democracy, \n     because it was the triumph of freedom there that ended the \n     Cold War. We have an interest in European prosperity, because \n     our own prosperity depends on having partners that are open \n     to our exports, investment and ideas.\n       Today, thanks to the efforts of President Clinton and \n     Secretary Christopher, American leadership in Europe is on \n     solid ground.\n       European institutions are evolving in directions that are \n     making the continent more free, unified and peaceful than at \n     any time in history.\n       Our key bilateral relationships, albeit spirited at times, \n     are as strong and resilient as they have ever been.\n       The terrible carnage in Bosnia has ended.\n       The Partnership for Peace has broadened cooperation on \n     security matters.\n       And there is continued progress on political and market \n     reforms within Central Europe and the New Independent States.\n       If confirmed, I will be returning to this Committee often \n     to ask your support for our vision of an integrated, stable \n     and democratic Europe.\n       In July, at the NATO summit in Madrid, the alliance will \n     discuss European security, including NATO adaptation to new \n     missions and structures, a framework for enhanced \n     consultation and cooperation with Russia, and enlargement.\n       The purpose of enlargement is to do for Europe's east what \n     NATO did 50 years ago for Europe's west: to integrate new \n     democracies, defeat old hatreds, provide confidence in \n     economic recovery and deter conflict.\n       Those who say NATO enlargement should wait until a military \n     threat appears miss the main point. NATO is a not a wild west \n     posse that we mobilize only when grave danger is near. It is \n     a permanent alliance, a linchpin of stability, designed to \n     prevent serious threats from ever arising.\n       To those who worry about enlargement dividing Europe, I say \n     that NATO cannot and should not preserve the old Iron Curtain \n     as its eastern frontier. That was an artificial division, \n     imposed upon proud nations, some of which are now ready to \n     contribute to the continent's security. What NATO must and \n     will do is keep open the door to membership to every European \n     nation that can shoulder alliance responsibilities and \n     contribute to its goals, while building a strong and enduring \n     partnership with all of Europe's democracies.\n       Building a more cooperative and integrated Europe will be \n     one of many issues that President Clinton will be discussing \n     with President Yeltsin during his visit here to the United \n     States in March. A democratic Russia can and must be a strong \n     partner in achieving this shared goal.\n       We know that Russia remains in the midst of a wrenching \n     transition, but gains made during the past five years are \n     increasingly irreversible. Despite the threats posed by \n     corruption and crime, open markets and democratic \n     institutions have taken hold. And last summer marked the \n     first fully democratic election of national leaders in \n     Russia's long history.\n       President Yeltsin's challenge in his second term will be to \n     restore the momentum behind internal reforms and accelerate \n     Russia's integration with the west. We have a profound \n     interest in encouraging that great country to remain on a \n     democratic course, to respect fully the sovereignty of its \n     neighbors and to join with us in addressing a full range of \n     regional and global issues.\n       Our deepening friendship with a democratic Ukraine is also \n     fundamental to Europe's integration. Ukraine was the first of \n     the New Independent States to transfer power from one \n     democratically-elected government to another. And, under \n     President Kuchma, it has launched ambitious economic reforms \n     that have subdued inflation and prevented economic collapse.\n       In our relations both with Russia and Ukraine, the \n     binational commissions established with Vice-President Gore \n     as the lead U.S. representative will serve as a valuable aid \n     for setting the agenda, and facilitating cooperation across a \n     broad range of endeavors.\n       Finally, the future of European stability and democracy \n     depends, as well, on continued implementation of the Dayton \n     Accords.\n       Although IFOR completed its military tasks brilliantly in \n     Bosnia, more time is needed for economic reconstruction and \n     political healing. SFOR's goal is to provide the time for \n     peace to become self-sustaining.\n       Although the full promise of Dayton is not yet fulfilled, \n     much has changed during the past 13 months. The fighting has \n     stopped, peaceful elections have been held, and the framework \n     for national democratic institutions has taken shape.\n       Much of this is due to American leadership. Our plan now, \n     in cooperation with our many partners, is to consolidate and \n     build on those gains. Our strategy is to continue diminishing \n     the need for an international military presence by \n     establishing a stable military balance, improving judicial \n     and legal institutions, helping more people return safely to \n     their homes and seeing that more of those indicted as war \n     criminals are arrested and prosecuted.\n       Given the ongoing challenges, it is encouraging to note the \n     history-making dimension of the process set in motion by the \n     Dayton Accords.\n       Today, in Bosnia, virtually every nation in Europe is \n     working together to bring stability to a region where \n     conflict earlier this century tore the continent apart.\n       This reflects a sharp departure from the spheres of \n     influence or balance of power diplomacy of the past, and an \n     explicit rejection of politics based on ethnic \n     identification. And it validates the premise of the \n     Partnership for Peace by demonstrating the growth of a common \n     understanding within Europe of how a common sense of security \n     may be achieved.\n       The experience of IFOR and now SFOR in Bosnia heightens the \n     potential for security cooperation among the full range of \n     NATO and non-NATO European states. In Bosnia, soldiers from \n     NATO, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Romania and many other nations \n     trust, defend and depend on each other. Our challenge is to \n     extend that spirit to other joint endeavors and to keep it \n     thriving long after SFOR concludes its work.\n       European stability depends in large measure on continued \n     American engagement and leadership. And as history attests, \n     European stability is also vital to our national interests. \n     As a result, we will remain engaged, we will continue to \n     lead, we will strengthen our alliances and we will continue \n     to build with our democratic partners a Europe in which every \n     nation is free and every free nation is our partner.\n\n\n            promoting mutual security and prosperity in asia\n\n       Mr. Chairman, America must remain a European power. We \n     must, and will, remain a Pacific power, as well.\n       Asia is a continent undergoing breathtaking economic \n     expansion and measured, but steady, movement in the direction \n     of democracy. Its commercial vigor reinforces our own and \n     contributes to the vital interest we have in its security. \n     This is, after all, an area in which America has fought three \n     wars\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n     during the past six decades, and in which 100,000 American \n     Troops are based.\n       President Clinton has elevated this dynamic region on our \n     agenda, and I plan to devote much of my attention to its \n     promise and perils.\n       Our priorities here are to maintain the strength of our \n     core alliances while successfully managing our multi-faceted \n     relationship with China.\n       Because of our commitment to regional security, we have \n     maintained our forward-deployed military presence in the \n     Western Pacific. We are encouraging regional efforts to \n     settle territorial and other disputes without violence. We \n     are working hard to open markets for American goods and \n     services, both bilaterally and through APEC, which the \n     President lifted to the summit level. We are broadening our \n     diplomatic and security ties in Southeast Asia, home to the \n     world's fastest growing economies. And we will continue to \n     promote respect for internationally-recognized human rights \n     and the spread of freedom.\n       Our closest and most wide-ranging bilateral relationship in \n     the region is with Japan, with whom we have strongly \n     reaffirmed our alliance.\n       We consult Japan regularly on a broad range of foreign \n     policy questions from security in Asia to development in \n     Africa. We appreciate its generous financial support for \n     peace efforts from Bosnia to the Middle East. And we are \n     working with Japan and another valued ally, the Republic of \n     Korea, to implement the Framework agreement freezing North \n     Korean development of nuclear arms. In recent weeks, we and \n     Seoul have worked together successfully to reduce tensions, \n     reinforce the nuclear freeze and improve prospects for \n     dialogue on the Peninsula.\n       I look forward, if confirmed, to visiting both Japan and \n     the Republic of Korea at an early date.\n       I am also looking forward to the visit here soon of the \n     Chinese Foreign Minister.\n       A strong bilateral relationship between the United States \n     and China is needed to expand areas of cooperation, reduce \n     the potential for misunderstanding and encourage China's full \n     emergence as a responsible member of the international \n     community.\n       To make progress, our two countries must act towards each \n     other on the basis of mutual frankness. We have important \n     differences, especially on trade, arms transfers and human \n     rights, including Tibet. We have concerns about Chinese \n     policy towards the reversion of Hong Kong. While adhering to \n     our one China policy, we will maintain robust unofficial ties \n     with Taiwan. But we also have many interests in common, and \n     have worked together on issues including the Korean \n     peninsula, crime, the global environment and nuclear testing.\n       U.S. policy towards China has long been an issue of \n     controversy in Congress and among the American people. There \n     are disagreements about the proper balancing of the various \n     elements of that policy. There should be no doubt, however, \n     about the importance of this relationship, and about the need \n     to pursue a strategy aimed at Chinese integration, not \n     isolation.\n\n\n         preventive defense through the control of deadly arms\n\n       The Cold War may be over, but the threat to our security \n     posed by nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction has \n     only been reduced, not ended. Arms control and \n     nonproliferation remain a vital element in our foreign policy \n     framework.\n       With our leadership, much has been accomplished. Russian \n     warheads no longer target our homes. Nuclear weapons have \n     been removed from Belarus and Kazakhstan and in Ukraine, the \n     last missile silos are being planted over with sunflowers. \n     Iraq's nuclear capability has been dismantled, and North \n     Korea's frozen. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has been \n     extended, indefinitely and without conditions. A \n     comprehensive ban on nuclear tests has been approved and a \n     chemical weapons ban will soon be in effect.\n       Mr. Chairman, these efforts to reduce the spread and number \n     of weapons of mass destruction contribute to what Defense \n     Secretary Perry has called ``preventive defense''. They are \n     designed to keep Americans safe. We pursue them not as favors \n     to others, but in support of our own national interests. But \n     arms control and nonproliferation are works in progress, and \n     we will need your help and that of this Committee and the \n     Senate to continue that progress.\n       First, we will be asking your consent to the ratification \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC, before it enters \n     into force in late April.\n       As this Committee well knows, the CWC was begun under \n     President Reagan and negotiated under President Bush. It is \n     supported by many in both parties, by the business community \n     and by our military. The CWC is no panacea, but it will make \n     it more difficult for rogue states and others hostile to our \n     interests to develop or obtain chemical weapons. I hope, Mr. \n     Chairman, that we will be able to work together to get this \n     Treaty approved in time for the United States to be an \n     original party.\n       We will also be seeking your early approval of the CFE \n     Flank agreement, which is essential to sustain the CFR \n     Treaty, which in turn contributes mightily to European \n     security.\n       Overseas, we will be working with Russia to secure prompt \n     ratification by the Duma of the START II Treaty, and then to \n     pursue further reductions and limits on strategic nuclear \n     arms.\n       We will also continue efforts to fulfill the President's \n     call for negotiations leading to a worldwide ban on the use, \n     stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel \n     landmines. The humanitarian problems created by the misuse of \n     anti-personnel landmines can only be dealt with on a global \n     basis. In September, the President told the UN General \n     Assembly that ``our children deserve to walk the Earth in \n     safety.'' This will be a major arms control objective of the \n     next four years.\n       Arms control and nonproliferation are closely linked to our \n     policies toward rogue states. We have a major interest in \n     preventing weapons of mass destruction from being obtained by \n     regimes with a proven disrespect for the rule of law. \n     Accordingly, we will continue working to improve the security \n     and prevent the diversion of fissile materials. We will \n     continue to oppose strongly the sale or transfer of advanced \n     weapons or technologies to Iran. And we will insist on \n     maintaining tough UN sanctions against Iraq unless and until \n     that regime complies with relevant Security Council \n     resolutions.\n\n\n                 vigorous diplomacy in support of peace\n\n       Mr. Chairman, the appropriate American role in helping to \n     end conflicts and respond to crises overseas has been debated \n     widely, not only in our time, but throughout American \n     history.\n       Because we have unique capabilities and unmatched power, it \n     is natural that others turn to us in time of emergency. We \n     have an unlimited number of opportunities to act around the \n     world. But we do not have unlimited resources, nor do we have \n     unlimited responsibilities. If we are to protect our own \n     interests and maintain our credibility, we have to weigh our \n     commitments carefully, and be selective and disciplined in \n     what we agree to do.\n       Recognizing this, we have a strong incentive to strengthen \n     other mechanisms for responding to emergencies and conflicts, \n     including the United Nations and regional organizations. We \n     should work closely with the entire network of public and \n     nongovernmental organizations that has evolved to predict, \n     prevent, contain and minimize the human and other costs of \n     natural and human-caused disaster. And we should insist that \n     other capable nations do their fair share financially, \n     technically and--if necessary--militarily.\n       The primary obligation of the United States is to its own \n     citizens. We are not a charity or a fire department. We will \n     defend firmly our own vital interests.\n       But we recognize that our interests and those of our allies \n     may also be affected by regional or civil wars, power vacuums \n     that create targets of opportunity for criminals and \n     terrorists, dire humanitarian emergencies and threats to \n     democracy. Then, as President Clinton said recently, ``The \n     United States cannot and should not try to solve every \n     problem, but where our interests are clear, our values are at \n     stake, (and) where we can make a difference, we must act and \n     we must lead.''\n       During the past four years, under President Clinton and \n     Secretary Christopher, the United States has been steadfast \n     in supporting the peacemakers over the bombthrowers in \n     historically troubled areas of the globe. Our goal has been \n     to build an environment in which threats to our security and \n     that of our allies are diminished, and the likelihood of \n     American forces being sent into combat is reduced.\n       We recognize that, in most of these situations, neither the \n     United States nor any other outside force can impose a \n     solution. But we can make it easier for those inclined \n     towards peace to take the risks required to achieve it.\n       As this statement is being prepared, sustained U.S. \n     diplomacy in the Middle East has helped to build a renewed \n     dialogue between Israel and its Palestinian partners, \n     producing significant progress on Israeli redeployment in \n     Hebron.\n       While an agreement is not yet in hand, the intensive \n     negotiations which have been conducted over the past three \n     months--including direct discussions between Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat--have restored a sense of \n     momentum and greater confidence between the sides. This \n     process began during the Washington summit called by \n     President Clinton last October and has been sustained and \n     advanced through our active diplomatic engagement.\n       Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat have \n     reaffirmed to President Clinton their determination to \n     continue their joint efforts for peace. The United States \n     will stand by them as they do.\n       Today, there remain two competing visions in the Middle \n     East. One is focused on the grievances and tragedies of the \n     past; the other on the possibilities of the future. An \n     agreement on Hebron would serve as a catalyst, strengthening \n     the supporters of peace. Under the President's leadership, we \n     intend to press vigorously on all tracks to realize a secure, \n     comprehensive and lasting peace between Israel and her Arab \n     neighbors.\n       Throughout, we will be guided by America's unshakeable \n     commitment to Israel's security, and by our opposition to \n     those who would disrupt this process through terrorism and \n     violence.\n       Secretary Christopher leaves office after four years of \n     historic progress in facilitating peace in the Middle East. \n     While his presence will be missed, I will maintain fully the \n     State Department's commitment to an active U.S. role in this \n     long-troubled and strategic part of the globe.\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\n       Across the Mediterranean in Cyprus, another longstanding \n     disagreement remains unresolved. In 1996, the parties moved \n     no closer to a final decision on the status of the island. \n     Moreover, disturbing incidents of violence marred the climate \n     for negotiations, while underlining their urgency. The \n     dispute here and related differences between our two NATO \n     allies, Turkey and Greece, affect European stability and our \n     vital interests. Accordingly, we are prepared in this new \n     year to play a heightened role in promoting a resolution in \n     Cyprus, but for any initiative to bear fruit, the parties \n     must agree to steps that will reduce tensions and make direct \n     negotiations possible.\n       In Northern Ireland, we are encouraged that multi-party \n     talks began but we are disappointed by the lack of progress \n     made, and strongly condemn the IRA's return to violence. We \n     will continue to work with the Irish and British governments \n     and the parties to help promote substantive progress in the \n     talks. And we note that former Senator George Mitchell, who \n     is chairing the multi-party talks, has been crucial to the \n     forward steps that have been taken.\n       As we enter the 50th anniversary year of independence for \n     both India and Pakistan, we will again consider the prospects \n     for reducing the tensions that have long existed between \n     these two friends of the United States.\n       We have a wealth of equities in this region, and a \n     particular concern about the regional arms race and nuclear \n     nonproliferation. India and Pakistan should both know that we \n     will do what we can to strengthen their relations with us and \n     encourage better relations between them, and that we expect \n     both to avoid actions calculated to provoke the other.\n       Another dispute tangled by history and geography concerns \n     Armenia, Azerbaijan and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The \n     good news here is that the ceasefire has now held for more \n     than two years. The bad news is that progress under the \n     OSCE's Minsk process has been agonizingly slow. We have very \n     substantial economic, political and humanitarian interests in \n     this region, and are prepared to play a more visible role in \n     helping to arrange a settlement. One step that Congress could \n     take to increase our influence would be to lift restrictions \n     on nonmilitary assistance to Azerbaijan, while maintaining \n     support for our generous aid program in Armenia.\n       Finally, in Central Africa, we are striving with regional \n     leaders and our allies to prevent a still-volatile situation \n     from erupting into even greater tragedy. We are encouraging \n     the repatriation of the remaining Rwandan refugees and \n     assisting in their re-integration into Rwandan society. \n     Through the efforts of Special Envoy Howard Wolpe, we are \n     promoting a dialogue between the opposing parties in Burundi. \n     And we support and end to conflict in Zaire based on \n     recognition of Zaire's territorial integrity and full respect \n     for human rights.\n       Mr. Chairman, I visited Central Africa last year. In \n     Rwanda, in the beautiful region where they filmed ``Gorillas \n     in the Mist'', there is an old stone church. By its side, \n     American and other volunteers work with little brushes to \n     clean and reassemble the skeletons of people slaughtered \n     there in 1994. Among the hundreds of skeletons there, I \n     happened to notice one in particular that was only two feet \n     long, about the size of my little grandson.\n       It is said that foreign policy should not be influenced by \n     emotion. That is true. But let us remember that murdered \n     children are not emotions; they are human beings whose \n     potential contributions are forever lost. America has an \n     interest, as do all civilized people, to act where possible \n     to prevent and oppose genocide.\n       One practical step we can take is to increase the capacity \n     of African countries to engage successfully in peacekeeping \n     efforts within their region. That is the purpose of the \n     African Crisis Response Force proposed by the Administration \n     last fall. This proposal has generated considerable interest \n     both within and outside the region. With Congressional \n     support, it will be a priority in the coming year.\n\n\n                    leadership for a global economy\n\n       The Clinton Administration has had extraordinary success \n     these past four years in creating jobs for Americans at home \n     by opening markets abroad. The more than 200 trade agreements \n     negotiated have helped our exports grow by 34% since 1993 and \n     created 1.6 million new jobs. By passing NAFTA, concluding \n     the GATT Uruguay Round and forging the Miami summit \n     commitment to achieve free and open trade in our hemisphere \n     by 2005 and the APEC commitment to do the same in the Asia-\n     Pacific by 2020, the President has positioned the United \n     States to become an even more dynamic hub of the global \n     economy in the 21st century.\n       As Secretary of State, I would do all I can to see that \n     this momentum continues. Already, I have talked with Treasury \n     Secretary Rubin, Commerce Secretary-designate Bill Daley and \n     Trade Representative-designate Charlene Barshefsky. We \n     intend, if confirmed, to function as a team--America's team. \n     And we intend to be a very tough team.\n       Competition for the world's markets is fierce. Often, our \n     firms go head-to-head with foreign competitors who are \n     receiving active support from their own governments. A \n     principal responsibility of the Department of State is to see \n     that the interests of American companies and workers receive \n     fair treatment, and that inequitable barriers to competition \n     are overcome. Accordingly, the doors to the Department of \n     State and our embassies around the world are open--and will \n     remain open--to U.S. businesspeople seeking to share their \n     ideas and to ask our help.\n       In the years ahead, we must continue shaping a global \n     economic system that works for America. Because our people \n     are so productive and inventive, we will thrive in any true \n     competition. However, maintaining the equity of the system \n     requires constant effort. Experience tells us that there will \n     always be some who will seek to take advantage by denying \n     access to our products, pirating our copyrighted goods or \n     under-pricing us through sweatshop labor.\n       That is why our diplomacy will continue to emphasize high \n     standards on working conditions, the environment and labor \n     and business practices. And it is why we will work for a \n     trading system that establishes and enforces fair rules.\n       Although we will continue to work closely with our G-7 \n     partners, the benefits of economic integration and expanded \n     trade are not--and should not be--limited to the most \n     developed nations. Especially now, when our bilateral foreign \n     assistance program is in decline, public and private sector \n     economic initiatives are everywhere an important part of our \n     foreign policy. We can also leverage resources for results by \n     working with and supporting the international financial \n     institutions.\n       In Latin America, a region of democracies, we will be \n     building on the 1994 Summit of the Americas to strengthen \n     judicial and other political institutions and to promote \n     higher standards of living through free trade and economic \n     integration. I am pleased that, in this effort, we will have \n     the assistance of the newly-designated special envoy for the \n     Americas, Mack Mclarty.\n       Although much poverty remains, substantial gains have been \n     made in many parts of the hemisphere through economic \n     reforms, increased commerce, lower inflation and higher \n     foreign investment. We believe that further progress can be \n     achieved that will benefit us, as well as our hemispheric \n     partners, through agreement on a Free Trade Area for the \n     Americas by the year 2005. We also place a high priority on \n     the early addition of Chile to the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement on equitable terms, and on the extension to Central \n     America and the Caribbean of Arrangements equivalent to \n     NAFTA.\n       Even closer to home, we are encouraging continued economic \n     and political reform in Mexico, with whom we share a 2000 \n     mile border and a host of common concerns, including crime, \n     narcotics, immigration and the environment.\n       In Africa, the overall economic outlook is improving, but \n     daunting problems of debt, strife, environmental stress and \n     inadequate investment remain.\n       It is in our interest to help the region's leaders overcome \n     these problems and to build an Africa that is more \n     prosperous, democratic and stable.\n       We know, however, that the primary impetus for development \n     here, as elsewhere, must come from the private sector.\n       It is encouraging, therefore, that many African governments \n     are facilitating growth through policies that allow private \n     enterprise to take hold, while investing public resources \n     wisely in education, health and measures that expand \n     opportunities for women.\n       If confirmed, I will place great emphasis on working with \n     Africa's democratic leaders to broaden and deepen these \n     trends. More specifically, we will work towards the \n     integration of Africa into the world's economy, participate \n     in efforts to ease debt burdens, and help deserving \n     countries, where we can, through targeted programs of \n     bilateral aid.\n\n\n            promoting freedom and extending the rule of law\n\n       Mr. Chairman, the representative of a foreign power said \n     once that his country had no permanent allies, only permanent \n     interests.\n       It might be said of America that we have no permanent \n     enemies, only permanent principles.\n       Those principles are founded in respect for law, human \n     dignity and freedom not just for some, but for all people.\n       If I am confirmed, I can assure you that the United States \n     will not hesitate to address frankly the violation of \n     internationally-recognized human rights, whether those \n     violations occur in Cuba or Afghanistan; Burma, Belgrade or \n     Beijing.\n       We will work with others to defeat the forces of \n     international crime and to put those who traffic in drugs \n     permanently out of business.\n       We will pursue a hard line against international terror, \n     insisting on the principle that sponsoring, sheltering or \n     subsidizing terrorists cannot be rationalized; it is wrong; \n     and those guilty should not be appeased, but isolated and \n     punished.\n       We will maintain our strong backing for the international \n     war crimes tribunal for Rwanda and the Balkans, because we \n     believe that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing should be \n     held accountable, and those who consider rape just another \n     tactic of war should answer for their crimes.\n       And we will continue to promote and advocate democracy \n     because we know that democracy is a parent to peace, and that \n     the American constitution remains the most\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\n     revolutionary and inspiring source of change in the world.\n\n\n                      the environmental mainstream\n\n       One final note, Mr. Chairman. Before closing I wanted to \n     make it clear that I intend, if confirmed, to build upon \n     Secretary Christopher's wise decision to incorporate \n     environmental goals into the mainstream of our foreign \n     policy.\n       Over the past several years, I have traveled to almost \n     every region of the world. I have seen the congestion caused \n     by over-development, and the deforestation that results when \n     expanding populations compete for shrinking natural \n     resources. I have smelled the air of smoke-clogged cities \n     where the environmental techniques made possible by modern \n     technology have not yet been applied.\n       The threats we face from environmental damage are not as \n     spectacular as those of a terrorist's bomb or a hostile \n     missile. But they directly affect the health, safety and \n     quality of life of families everywhere. We can choose to be \n     passive in responding to those threats, and leave the hard \n     work to our children, or we can be active and forward-looking \n     now. I choose the latter course, and will not be shy in \n     seeking congressional and public support.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Members of the Committee, I am deeply honored to appear \n     here today. I have laid out some, but by no means all, of \n     what I see as the principal challenges and opportunities we \n     will face over the next four years. Clearly, we have a lot to \n     do.\n       I could say to you that it had always been my ambition to \n     be Secretary of State of the United States. But that is not \n     true. Frankly, I did not think it was possible.\n       I arrived in America when I was 11 years old. My family \n     came here to escape Communism and to find freedom and we did. \n     My ambition at that time was only to speak English well, \n     please my parents, study hard, and grow up to be an American.\n       The newspaper in Denver, where we lived, had a motto that \n     read, `` `Tis a privilege to live in Colorado.''\n       My father used to repeat that motto on a regular basis, but \n     he would often add a reminder: ``Kids,'' he would say, \n     ``never forget that it is also a privilege to live in the \n     United States.''\n       Long after I left home, my mother would call on the Fourth \n     of July to ask my children, her grandchildren: ``Tell me, are \n     you singing any patriotic songs?''\n       Senators, you on your side of the table and I on my side, \n     have a unique opportunity to be partners in creating a new \n     and enduring framework for American Leadership. One of my \n     predecessors, Dean Acheson, wrote about being present at the \n     creation of a new era. You and I have the challenge and the \n     responsibility to help co-author the newest chapter in our \n     history.\n       In so doing, let us remember that there is not a page of \n     American history of which we are proud that was written by a \n     chronic complainer or prophet of despair.\n       We are doers.\n       By rejecting the temptations of isolation, and by standing \n     with those around the world who share our values, we will \n     advance our own interests; honor our best traditions; and \n     help to answer a prayer that has been offered over many years \n     in a multitude of tongues, in accordance with diverse \n     customs, in response to a common yearning.\n       That prayer is the prayer for peace, freedom, food on the \n     table and what President Clinton once so eloquently referred \n     to as ``the quiet miracle of a normal life.''\n       If with your consent, I am confirmed as Secretary of State, \n     I will ask you to join me in doing all we can, as \n     representatives of the indispensable nation, and with the \n     help of God, to answer that prayer.\n       Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Ambassador Albright possesses a rare talent for \narticulating the reasons why events in seemingly far away places matter \na great deal to ordinary Americans.\n  I was with another member of this administration, Sandy Berger, today \nand we were talking about it. I said that I had to leave to go and deal \nwith Madeleine Albright's nomination on the floor. And I said, ``They \nseem to like her.'' I don't think this is inappropriate to suggest. \nThere is no State secret. He said, ``We were at a meeting, and she used \nthe line that I think is great, and it captures what is going on. She \nsaid, `It is amazing that the 1 percent of the resources of this \nGovernment may very well' ''--that is approximately what we spend on \nthe whole foreign policy establishment of this Government--`` `\\1\\ \npercent of the resources of this Government will probably determine 50 \npercent of the future of this Nation over the next 6 to 8 years.' ''\n  The reason I bother to mention that as an aside is that one of the \nthings she grasped very well, as all great Secretaries of State have, \nis in the context in which she is operating, and the context in which \nthe foreign policy it will be her responsibility to promote will be \nhers.\n  Ambassador Albright has made a convincing argument for the United \nStates to remain engaged throughout the world and for this Congress to \ngive the State Department the resources it needs to, as she said, \n``promote and protect the interests of the American people.''\n  I look forward to working with Ambassador Albright to secure an \nadequate level of funding for her to direct American diplomacy, in \norder that our Foreign Service officers, our U.S. Information Service \nofficers, and our Agency for International Development workers can be \nactive throughout the world. We need a diplomatic corps that can react \nquickly and decisively to crises before they escalate and then threaten \npeace and stability. We cannot afford to keep the State Department so \nunderfunded that diplomats are reduced to making calls from pay phones \nbecause our missions are so poorly equipped that even the telephones \ndon't work.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to say and much that has been said. \nI do not want to be the one to slow up the process. Let me conclude by \nsuggesting that I particularly look forward to working with Ambassador \nAlbright in a number of specific areas--the ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention before it enters into force April 29, and \nto negotiate further arms control treaties, including a Start III \naccord.\n  I also look forward to developing a policy in Bosnia that allows us \nto withdraw our forces by mid-1998 without allowing a relapse into \nrenewed fighting among the various parties there.\n  I also am looking forward to encouraging democracy throughout the \nworld in places like Serbia, Belarus, Iraq, China, Burma, and Cuba, all \nof which are going to be daunting tasks we face. And to be sure, before \nNATO decides to admit new members--I hope that we will--that the \nenlargement will increase the security of all the countries in Europe, \nand, second, that the costs of enlargement are fairly allocated in a \nmanner not unduly burdensome on the American taxpayer. And third, that \na NATO charter with Russia can be concluded that allows the alliance \nthe opportunity to consult with Moscow before making final decisions, \nin order to accommodate enhanced security in Europe. And also to \nincrease our efforts at combating the scourge of international drug \ntrafficking, which threatens so many of our neighborhoods and families.\n  The one thing that every Secretary of State has given lip service to \nis dealing with that issue. The one thing that every Secretary of \nState, Democrat or Republican, has promptly forgotten is a commitment I \nhave gotten before from every Secretary that they will not forget. But \nI want the Record to note, if Madeleine Albright is listening, that I \nremind her I will not forget her commitment that the State Department \nshould be involved in that testy, little, difficult item of dealing \nwith the international drug problem. The truth of the matter is most \nfolks at the State Department and foreign policy types think it is kind \nof beneath them to deal with drug policy, and I am here to tell them, \nnow that I rank on the Democratic side, I will be a thorn in their side \nabout increasing their attention to that issue.\n  Mr. President, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working with \nAmbassador Albright over the next 4 years. I am confident that she will \ncooperate closely with the Senate to ensure that our foreign policy \ncontinues to embody American ideals and to serve the interests of the \nUnited States around the globe.\n  I strongly urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Madeleine \nAlbright as our next Secretary of State.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Chair advise me of the time situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 44 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Delaware has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. It would be my proposal then to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana and then speak myself 5 minutes to try to get the \ntime more in\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nline. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Madeleine Albright, our \nAmbassador to the United Nations, to be Secretary of State.\n  As we all know, the Ambassador is a highly intelligent woman with a \nsolid history in foreign affairs. We have just completed visits to \ncountries where we have a very high investment in military, and let me \ntell my colleagues in the Senate that we still live in a pretty tough \nworld. Our challenges are still there.\n  Not only does she bring to her position experience from academia but \nalso the administrative arm of our Government and the legislative side. \nSo I am certain that she knows how this process works. Based on that \nknowledge, I think she knows how to work with this Congress and forms a \nsolid foundation of trust and openness that is required of all of us.\n  Considering Secretary Christopher's introduction at the Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing and Ambassador Albright's testimony in \nwhich she stated, ``I can assure you that I am going to tell it like it \nis here and also when I go abroad,'' I am hopeful that her relationship \nwith the Congress will be an open one and an honest one.\n  By her frankness, however, there are issues which concern those of us \nwho live in the State of Montana. We may disagree with the Ambassador \nin some areas. Although she has promised that ``one of the major goals \nof this administration is to make sure that the American economic \nlifeline is protected,'' the Ambassador has also stated she is \nsupportive of the fast track provision to include Chile into the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. Treaties like NAFTA have not exactly \nbeen a windfall for my State of Montana. And the mere suggestion of \nexpanding it does not sit well when you have been impacted like we \nhave, being a border State.\n  As legislators and leaders, we must ensure that free and fair trade \nis part of any treaty, and if it is not, then those treaties or \nagreements should not even be considered. I hope the Ambassador will \nremember this vital element when negotiating as a U.S. representative \naround the world.\n  Also, in the past, I have had great concerns about what I have \nperceived as her overly enthusiastic willingness to use American troops \nabroad just from some of the statements she has made.\n  I see she did in her testimony give a statement that would raise our \ncomfort level a little more, and I think that statement is good enough \nfor me. I have always believed that the United States should never \nforget that sending our troops into dangerous situations should only be \ndone when our national security is in jeopardy. Ambassador Albright \nseems to understand the gravity of this concept, and I am now assured \nthat she will not take such action when policies face that kind of \nsituation.\n  Based on that, and I know we are squeezed for time and there are many \nstatements to be made about this wonderful lady, I hope that my \ncolleagues will support her to be confirmed in this nomination.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire. I yield the remainder of my \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized on the nomination in \nthe time under the control of the minority for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I rise in very strong and enthusiastic support of the \nnomination of Madeleine K. Albright to be Secretary of State.\n  In my judgment, Ambassador Albright is an outstanding choice for this \nposition. Her experience, both personal and professional, as well as \nher demonstrated leadership ability, her steadfast adherence to the \nvalues and principles that Americans hold dear, and her vast and \nindisputable knowledge of the many complex issues that will no doubt \nconfront our next Secretary of State, make it clear why President \nClinton has selected her.\n  Ambassador Albright's work with the administration over the past 4 \nyears testifies to her ability to excel at two very different aspects \nof the position for which she has been nominated. She has worked within \nthe administration to craft effective responses to the international \nchallenges we face--obviously a prime responsibility of the Secretary \nof State. She also during these last 4 years has articulated those \npolicies in a clear and persuasive manner, building support among the \nAmerican people and winning the cooperation and respect of the \ninternational community. Her capability in both the private and public \narenas of policymaking is most impressive.\n  It is abundantly clear to those familiar with her record that she \nrepresents a very tough-minded and perceptive choice on the part of the \nPresident. She has distinguished herself in many institutions and \naspects of foreign policymaking, from the executive and legislative \nbranches to the world of academia. Over the past two decades, she has \nserved as a staff member both at the National Security Council and in \nthe Senate, where she worked with our former colleague, Ed Muskie, who \nhimself then later became Secretary of State. As a scholar, she has \nearned respect in the academic community as a researcher and teacher, \nconsistently drawing high praise from her students--further testimony \nto her ability both to come up with solutions to complex issues as well \nas to explain them to the community at large.\n  As president of the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research \norganization formed by representatives from government, industry, and \nlabor, she not only gained an understanding of the nonprofit sector but \nworked to bring together these diverse groups in the interest of \ndomestic and international policy.\n  For the past 4 years she has served in the President's Cabinet as \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations, where she has addressed \nissues ranging from economic development to peacekeeping to \ncounternarcotics, and has dealt with conflicts that span the globe.\n  Under her leadership the United States gained Security Council \napproval for the United States-led, multinational effort to restore \ndemocracy in Haiti, for resolutions condemning human rights violations \nin countries including Cuba, Sudan, Burma, Nigeria, Iran, and Iraq, and \nfor the establishment of an inspector general to crack down on waste \nand fraud within the U.N. system. That she accomplished these and many \nother important goals at a time when the United States was the world's \nlargest debtor to the United Nations, thereby undercutting our \ninfluence in that institution, bears witness to her formidable \ndiplomatic skills.\n  What Ambassador Albright will bring to this position, however, \nreaches far beyond the qualifications that are listed on her impressive \nresume. Her own personal family history of escaping from persecution, \nfirst at the hands of the Nazis and subsequently at those of the \nCommunists, has given her a profound understanding of the values and \ninterests at the very heart of U.S. foreign policy. At her hearing, she \neloquently reminded us that freedom and democracy can be challenged \nfrom both the left and the right of the political spectrum. She told \nthe committee, ``It might be said of America that we have no permanent \nenemies, only permanent principles. Those principles are founded in \nrespect for law, human dignity and freedom, not just for some, but for \nall people.''\n  Referring to the United States as ``the indispensable nation,'' she \nchallenged us to become ``the authors of the history of our age'' by \nseizing the opportunity to meet the demands of a new century.\n  I think we all agree on the importance of having the President's new \nforeign policy team in place as quickly as possible, and I am pleased \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate are acting \nupon this nomination in such an expeditious manner. I understand the \nArmed Services Committee is also moving expeditiously to consider the \nnomination of our former colleague, Senator William Cohen, to be \nSecretary of Defense. We have before us a full and pressing agenda: the \nratification of the Chemical Weapons\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nConvention and budgeting adequate resources for the effective conduct \nof our foreign policy, to mention only two. Ambassador Albright's \nconfirmation hearing proved to all of us President Clinton's insight in \nselecting her for this significant and weighty assignment. He chose her \nfor her demonstrated competence, her broad range of experience, for her \nconsistently sound advice, and her exceptional ability to explain \ninternational issues to Americans while conveying U.S. policies and \nprinciples to the world.\n  I believe that Madeleine Albright is eminently qualified to become \nSecretary of State. I urge my colleagues to join with me in approving \nher nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nAmbassador Albright's nomination as Secretary of State. I am confident \nshe will serve our national security interests with distinction.\n  While she has managed a broad portfolio in her capacity as our \nAmbassador to the United Nations, there are two issues where I have had \noccasion to work closely with her and have been particularly impressed \nwith her views and commitment.\n  On Burma, Ambassador Albright has consistently delivered a tough \nmessage to the ruling junta: We expect improvements on human rights, we \nexpect a serious effort to be made to combat the scourge of narcotics \ntrafficking.\n  She has recognized that the key to progress in both areas is to \nrestore democracy to Burma.\n  To the supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi and her legitimately elected \nGovernment of Burma, robbed of their victory in 1991, Albright has been \nthe sole voice of support and hope in this administration.\n  Following the International Conference on Women in Beijing, she \ntraveled to Rangoon and met with Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  This may not seem to be exceptional, but Ambassador Albright is the \nonly senior official in the administration to meet with Aung San Suu \nKyi and has been alone yet unfailing in her outspoken support for the \nadvancement of Burma's freedom from the thugs who currently rule.\n  A few weeks ago, after several hundred students and citizens were \narrested for calling for political change, Ambassador Albright spoke \nout forcefully and in clear terms at the United Nations that this \noppression must come to an end.\n  Last year, during consideration of the foreign operations bill, we \nincluded language which established criteria for imposing economic \nsanctions against SLORC.\n  Specifically, we required sanctions be applied if there was large \nscale repression against the opposition or if any action was taken to \nharm or rearrest Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Since the bill passed, the administration continues to be in a \nholding pattern claiming our policy is under review, a review which has \nbeen going on for several years.\n  In the meantime, more than 500 people have been arrested when Aung \nSan Suu Kyi ventured from her compound several weeks ago, her car was \nstoned and smashed by thugs as SLORC police looked on. Since then she \nhas been under undeclared house arrest.\n  Given her past support I am hopeful Ambassador Albright will finally \ntake the necessary steps to position this administration squarely in \nsupport of democracy and its most eloquent, dignified advocate Aung San \nSuu Kyi.\n  Let me comment briefly on one other area where I believe Ambassador \nAlbright has already made a difference.\n  During the administration's recent consideration of the level of \nsupport for the foreign affairs account she has been unflinching and \nunapologetic about the need to provide adequate resources to administer \nAmerican foreign policy and assistance programs.\n  I share her view that we have reached a crisis point--we cannot \nafford to compromise our financial support for our embassies and \nprograms abroad based on a misguided notion that further reductions \nwill actually make a difference in balancing the budget.\n  The 150 account is already less than 1 percent of Federal spending--\nfurther cuts will not make any meaningful contribution to controlling \nour budget deficit and, in fact may actually make it worse.\n  Cutting back on America's presence overseas has a direct impact on \nAmerican commercial interests--without export promotion programs to \nlaunch and support them in critical but risky new markets, American \nbusiness men will lose long term access and share--and as we all know, \nexports are the key to both American income and 11 million jobs.\n  It's not just our economy that is affected, our presence abroad has a \ndirect affect on protecting our interests in combating terrorism and \nnarcotics trafficking, direct threats to our communities and families.\n  American leadership has paid a premium in peace and prosperity but it \ncomes at a price. Madeleine Albright has courageously and clearly \ndefended the importance of making that down payment.\n  I am confident that she will bring the same frank, smart, and tough \napproach to her new responsibilities that we have seen her exercise in \nher current position.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Albright's statement at the \nUnited Nations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement by Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright, United States \n Representative to the United Nations, in the General Assembly, on the \n           Human Rights Situation in Burma, December 12, 1996\n\n       The United States strongly supports this resolution on the \n     human rights situation in Burma, and I congratulate my \n     colleagues from Sweden for the skill and commitment with \n     which they authored and gained agreement to it.\n       This resolution reflects the consensus view of the members \n     of the United Nations, a view premised on the ideals of the \n     UN Charter and the principles enshrined in the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights. It reflects the hard-earned \n     wisdom of the international community that every government \n     of every society should be held to certain minimum standards \n     of respect for the rights and freedoms of its own people.\n       Regrettably, the current government of Burma is not meeting \n     these minimum standards. It has subjected democratic forces \n     to a kind of rolling repression in which small steps forward \n     alternate with crackdowns and episodes of intimidation and \n     violence.\n       The Burmese authorities, known as the SLORC, have refused \n     to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the leader of the \n     National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, or with \n     other democratic leaders and representatives of the major \n     ethnic groups. They have continued to deny to their citizens \n     the fundamental political freedoms of expression and \n     assembly. And they have engaged in torture, forced labor, \n     forced relocations and summary executions.\n       It is increasingly clear that the failure of Burmese \n     authorities to respect civil and human rights is causing \n     unrest within the country.\n       Recent student demonstrations, although non-political in \n     nature, have been harshly repressed. The Government has \n     periodically curtailed the right of Aung San Suu Kyi to \n     address her supporters in public and even to leave her home. \n     Last November, her motorcade was attacked by a mob that could \n     only have acted with official authority and blessing. As we \n     speak, the restrictions on her movements and activities are \n     the most severe since her release from ``house arrest'' in \n     July, 1995.\n       Although the SLORC professes a desire to move Burma in the \n     direction of democracy, it has not done so. The \n     Constitutional Convention it established to create the \n     illusion of a national political dialogue is a sham--fully \n     controlled and orchestrated by the government. As a result, \n     the Convention has been a source not of reconciliation, but \n     of further division.\n       Finally, the Government of Burma has refused to cooperate \n     with the UN Special Rapporteur and with the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary-General.\n       The Burmese authorities would like the world to believe \n     that its harsh policies are necessary in light of Burma's \n     turbulent history and the multi-ethnic nature of Burmese \n     society. But as the Resolution approved today shows, the \n     world does not accept that excuse. The right of people to \n     participate freely in a democratic political process is an \n     ally--not an enemy--to national unity and social peace.\n       Experience tells us that the kind of stability that may be \n     achieved through repression is sterile, superficial and \n     temporary. It is a stability maintained by fear, in which the \n     human resources of a society are held back and beaten down.\n       Lasting stability, economic prosperity and a rich cultural \n     life come when people are free to make use of their full \n     talents and abilities. A society blossoms when those who \n     govern respect those who are governed, and when the people \n     have confidence in those they have chosen to make and enforce \n     their laws.\n       For Burma, the path to that kind of future is outlined in \n     this resolution.\n       In it, we call upon the government to cease abusing human \n     rights, to empty their cells\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\n     of those detained for political reasons, to permit UN \n     representatives to visit; and to begin a genuine dialogue \n     with democratic and ethnic leaders.\n       The more time elapses before these steps are taken, the \n     more the pressure will build, the more divided Burma will \n     become, and the more difficult it will be for Burma to \n     achieve a peaceful transition to democratic rule.\n       The international community would like to see Burma develop \n     into a stable, prosperous and democratic society. We would \n     like to remove Burma from the list of nations about which we \n     annually express concern.\n       But as long as repression remains the government's chosen \n     means of conducting business with its own people, we will \n     continue to meet our own responsibility to speak up; and to \n     assert the validity in Burma of the universal and cherished \n     principles by which all nations have agreed to live, and \n     without which, no nation can fulfill its potential.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to speak, along with my colleagues, on the good counsel, good \ndecision the President has made in choosing Madeleine Albright. I think \nit also is appropriate at this time to acknowledge the extraordinary \neffort and the extraordinary commitment of service that was made by \nSecretary Christopher during his term as Secretary of State. He was a \npatient and tireless pursuer of peace around the world. I may not have \nagreed with all his policies, but certainly in a number of areas his \nsuccesses are considerable and I point specifically to the Mideast.\n  Equally important, he was an individual totally committed to raising \nup the standard of living and of support for members of his team, his \nForeign Service team and their families, something I am also committed \nto, that, as chairman of the appropriations committee which has \njurisdiction over the State Department, I feel very strongly we must \ncontinue to pursue. So I congratulate him on his efforts.\n  Ambassador Albright is someone I have had a chance to work with, \nrelative to her time at the United Nations. I know she will bring to \nthe office of Secretary of State a great deal of integrity and a great \ndeal of energy. Of course she has a unique personal background that I \nthink will be a tremendous asset to the President, as he and she \ndevelop international policy.\n  But, as we address the issue of Madeleine Albright's nomination I \nthink we need to go beyond the person. I intend to vote for her and \nvote with enthusiasm for her, but I do believe very strongly that we \nneed to raise the issue of policy, as to how this administration is \npursuing the decisions of foreign policy in a number of arenas because \nthere are some problems and I have significant reservations, as I know \nmany of my colleagues do. I know there has been some discussion on the \nissue of Bosnia, and the question as to how the administration acted \nand is going to continue to act there, the fact that basically neither \nthe Congress nor the American people were told fully of the policies \nthere, and in fact were really misled as to the decisions that were \nmade there, as to the removal of American troops. But rather than \nfocusing on that issue, that I know some of my colleagues were talking \nabout, I want to focus on two other issues I think are critical and \nabout which this administration's policies need to be reviewed with \nconsiderable intensity.\n  The first issue is how we deal with the United Nations. It is my \nunderstanding the administration will be sending up a supplemental \nrequest or some other form of request for an appropriation to fully \nfund the arrearages that are due to the United Nations. I happen to be \na supporter of the United Nations, its goals and purposes. But I also \nam realistic enough to know that body has not functioned very \neffectively and that body has spent a lot of money ineffectively and \nhas had a significant track record of patronage, of misuse of funds, \nand in some instances of actual abusive use of funds.\n  The question becomes how should we pay these arrearages? Should we \njust do it in a carte blanche manner or just do it in an orderly manner \nthat allows the United States to assert financial interests of the \nintegrity within the institution, of its management of day-to-day \noperation, and of its delivery of services? To date we have not had a \ngreat deal of success in that area. There has been a lot of talk about \nit. The United Nations has claimed that it is now funding a no-growth \nbudget, something which is very suspect even though the State \nDepartment has certified it. It is very suspect because there are $154 \nmillion worth of reductions in spending which they claim they are going \nto make, but which have not been identified. Yet we see the State \nDepartment accepting them at face value, which is something I think \nthis Congress should have a great deal of problems doing for any \nAmerican agency.\n  In addition, we hear the United Nations is aggressively pursuing \nreform within itself. But that reform does not seem to be broad. It \nalso does not seem to be willing to be subject to significant review. \nAn inspector general has been appointed, but that inspector general's \nportfolio has been significantly limited.\n  We, as a Congress, have also been significantly circumscribed in our \nability to determine how the dollars are being spent.\n  Why is it important that we look at this? Well, because 25 cents of \nevery dollar that the United Nations spends comes from the American \ntaxpayer, and we have to go back to our constituents and say those \ndollars are being spent effectively.\n  I personally have no problem funding the United Nations at a level \nthat is reasonable, but I do have a great deal of problem funding some \ngroup of individuals simply sitting at a desk who got those jobs out of \npatronage or because they happened to know somebody or related to \nsomebody and are not pursuing and accomplishing a great deal, either to \nthe benefit of the United Nations or the world. Yet, there appears to \nbe a significant amount of that going on.\n  I had one U.N. spokesperson say to me, ``But we have 290 countries \nlooking over our shoulders making sure every cent is spent \nappropriately.'' The fact is, just a few nations are actually paying \nfor the spending. Most of the nations that participate in the United \nNations either contribute very little or, in some cases, nothing to \ngeneral coffers, and they are not looking over their shoulders to \ndetermine how the money is being spent effectively. In many instances, \nthey are looking over the shoulders to see how much money they can get \nspent on them.\n  So, really, it is the United States role in the exercise of reviewing \nthe United Nations that we be much more aggressive in financial review \nand management of that institution.\n  This is something I do not think this administration has pursued \naggressively enough. Ambassador Albright, to her credit, tried to \npursue it aggressively, but I think that once we take off the lever of \nthe arrearages issue and simply sign a blank check for arrearages, we \nlose our capacity to effectively pursue United Nations reform in its \nown house, and that is something that I will be very resistant to \ndoing.\n  I believe Congress should put a strong fence around any funds for the \nUnited Nations, and before those moneys can be spent for arrearages, \nthere must be a hard account--a hard account--of how the reforms have \noccurred and whether or not they are going to be effective.\n  Second, this administration's actions in the area of terrorism, which \nis a core issue of foreign policy--in fact, there is no greater threat \nto this country today than the act of a terrorist, either orchestrated \nby a foreign power or orchestrated by an international group of \nindividuals directed at our country--there is no greater threat to our \ncountry today.\n  We came out of the cold war where the threat was two nations \nconfronting each other with nuclear armament into a world where we have \ninnumerable factions around the world who, for whatever reasons--\nwhether they are religious, whether they are personal, whether they are \njust economic--have decided to make the United States the target of \ntheir concerns and, in many instances, these are fanatics.\n  We, as a nation, must be much more aggressive in addressing the issue \nof terrorism. To do this, we have to have a coordinated effort that \nstarts with the President and involves the core agencies at the Federal \nlevel, including the State Department, the CIA, the Defense Department \nand the Justice Department, and especially the FBI in the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I have been concerned and have spoken on this floor a number of \ninstances\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\nabout the fact that although we have leadership in those Departments \nwho have raised the issue of terrorism to a high standard within their \nDepartments, and although those leaders talk to each other--Secretary \nChristopher was aggressive in talking to other agency heads, the \nDefense Department, CIA, and Justice--we do not yet have in place a \nsystematic process for pushing down through the agencies the \ncooperation which is necessary in order to have a coordinated effort. \nIn fact, we still have in the field significant resistance from the \nState Department to FBI agents being placed overseas for the basic \npurpose of law enforcement, and we have a real lack of communication, \nin many instances, between the FBI, CIA, and the field people who do \nthe work for the State Department.\n  Until we put in place a systematic process of developing information \nand getting it back to a central group in this country who can use that \ninformation effectively, we will be continuing to blind ourselves as a \nnation as to the threat of terrorism and our ability to respond to it.\n  This has to come from the top. It has to come from the President. The \nPresident has to have the leadership of the agencies sit with him on a \nregular basis and develop a plan which is then communicated down \nthrough the various levels of the different Departments. But it has not \noccurred yet. To be honest, I do not think there is a sense of urgency \nexpressed yet within this administration to do that. So, once again, I \nhave a strong concern and hope that they will take this issue on.\n  So those are two public policy issues which I think this \nadministration has yet to adequately address, and I hope the \nnew Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright, will pursue them. They are \nput on the table by myself as a matter of a caveat item of concern \nthat, as chairman of the committee which has jurisdiction over the \nState Department and the Justice Department, I intend to continue to \npush and to which I hope this administration will respond.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the nomination \nof Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. I thank the majority \nleader for moving so rapidly to schedule both this debate as well as \nthe vote.\n  I believe the overwhelming vote--probably unanimous--in favor of \nMadeleine Albright is going to properly reflect the confidence and \nesteem in which she is held by the U.S. Senate.\n  I think the President should be greatly commended for this \nnomination. Obviously, he has chosen not only someone who is eminently \nqualified to be Secretary of State, but he has made a wonderful \nstatement to the world about the possibilities in the United States of \nAmerica. It is something we often talk about, but Madeleine Albright \nwill be a living example, an Ambassador, even as Secretary of State, of \nthe opportunities in this country for an immigrant as well as for \nwomen. I think all of us should be very proud of that.\n  She brings a remarkable amount of knowledge and practical experience \nto this job. She is an academic with recognized expertise in the \npolitics and policies of Russia, Central and Eastern Europe.\n  During her tenure as our representative at the United Nations, she \nhas shown herself to be a remarkably forceful and effective diplomat. \nOf particular importance to us here, she understands the Hill, she \nunderstands the Congress, she understands the constitutional \nprerogatives thereof, and she has worked as well with the executive \nbranch as she has with the legislative branch of our Government.\n  During her 4 years at the United Nations, she established an \nimpressive record of accomplishments on behalf of our country. Thanks \nto her determination, the United States was able to hold the line on \nU.N. sanctions against Libya and Iraq and to gain the Security \nCouncil's approval for the United States-led multinational effort to \nrestore democracy in Haiti, an effort, I might comment, met with \nsignificant resistance in this country, that represented both a gutsy, \ncourageous decision and one which has made an enormous difference, \nultimately, for the people of Haiti and, I think, also, one might say, \nto our country because of what we accomplished and also because of the \npractical things that we avoided with respect to the forced immigration \nand difficulties we were facing with refugees coming to Florida.\n  In addition to that, her very strong personal advocacy led to the \nestablishment of the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda and the former \nYugoslavia and for the fulfillment, really, of Eleanor Roosevelt's \nproposal for the establishment of a new position, the High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights.\n  In the very difficult area of U.N. reform and management, which is an \narea Senator Gregg referred to, and other Senators have expressed a \ngreat deal of concern about, particularly those of us on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Ambassador Albright's determined and personal \nefforts have led to the establishment of an inspector general, the \nadoption for the first time in history of a no-growth budget. As \nsuspect as Senator Gregg says some of the promises may be, it is in \nplace and I believe we are in a position to help leverage that now for \nthe first time, and also, most important, the election of a new \nSecretary General who understands the paramount need for continued \nreform.\n  Those of us who know Ambassador Albright were not at all surprised by \nher deft handling of the nomination process itself, the way in which \nshe impressed both the public and the Senators who were part of that \nconfirmation process earlier this month.\n  As the former chairman and now ranking member of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, I was particularly pleased that Ambassador \nAlbright shares my concern about two important issues. They are not the \nonly things we share, but two that I want to just spend a moment on.\n  One is the need to ensure that the State Department has adequate \nresources to conduct our diplomacy in this increasingly complex world. \nI think it is vital for us in the Congress not to balance the budget of \nthe United States on the great international interests we have, to \nnickel and dime many of those vital interests as we go forward in this \nfar more complex world.\n  Many of my colleagues spend a lot of time extolling the virtues of \nthe end of the cold war, and well we should. But the end of the cold \nwar does not mean the end of the need for personal diplomacy or for \nvigilance or for American presence. I would respectfully submit that it \nmeans the need for more, not less. And the new kind of conflicts that \nwe see, conflicts that emerge out of nationalism, out of \nfundamentalism, the problems of terrorism and working on treaties and \nvarious agreements, and legal agreements to exchange law enforcement \nand information, all of these things really demand more personal \ndiplomacy than ever before.\n  Indeed, the extraordinary confrontations we face internationally on \nissues of resource allocation, refugees, human rights require the \nUnited States of America, the preeminent leader on these issues in the \nworld, to be able to make our presence felt.\n  Mr. President, that means people talking to people. It does not mean \nclosing every mission or closing every outpost in the world. It frankly \nmeans a greater presence, not a lesser presence. I believe that that \nwill return to us in so many hundreds of thousands of ways, some of \nthem immeasurable, but most of them measurable, that it is well worth \nthe investment of this country.\n  The second area, I believe, is the importance of developing a \nmultilateral strategy to combat the increasing threats positioned by \ninternational crime. Without such a strategy, we will find ourselves \nincreasingly threatened in the face of a growing global criminal \nnetwork that tears at the fabric of our society and jeopardizes our \nrelationships with other nations.\n  In the coming months we have to address a host of important issues in \nthe Senate: arms control and foreign policy issues, including the \nChemical Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Safety Convention, the future \nof the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.N. funding\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\nand reform, and the question of resources for international affairs, \nagencies and programs. So I look forward to working with the new \nSecretary of State on those issues.\n  Mr. President, many of us have had the honor of working with \nAmbassador Albright for the last 4 years. We know she has a remarkable \ngrasp of the issues that we face and a determination to confront the \nchallenges. We should remember that she brings a very important \nadditional quality to this job--it is a special quality, and I think \nparticularly important in this time--and that is the ability to connect \nwith the American people and to help define to the American people the \ncomplexities of our interests in foreign policy and to do so in a way \nthat all Americans can understand and appreciate.\n  When we visited in my office prior to her confirmation hearing, \nAmbassador Albright said to me that her first objective was to make the \nAmerican people understand what we are trying to accomplish, how we are \ntrying to accomplish it, and their stake in what we are trying to \naccomplish in their name. Like any smart politician, she understands \nthat no foreign policy can be successful ultimately without the support \nof the American people. I am confident that she will engender that \nsupport in her new role as Secretary of State.\n  So today we have an opportunity to help make history in the U.S. \nSenate by confirming a remarkably talented person who happens to also \nbe a woman as the next Secretary of State. I am pleased to cast my vote \nalong with others for Madeleine Albright. I know she will undertake her \nnew job with great thoughtfulness and creativity and with a zest that \nwill make us proud.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of time for our side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for this opportunity to speak.\n  I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in the \ndiscussion of the confirmation of the President's choice for Secretary \nof State, Madeleine Albright.\n  Generally, Mr. President, I respect the Executive's prerogative to \nchoose Cabinet officers whom the President believes will faithfully and \ndiligently execute the Administration's policies. However, in our \nfederal system, the Senate plays an important role in the confirmation \nprocess through the constitutionally granted power to ``advise and \nconsent.'' It is this duty--the duty to advise and to grant consent--\nwhich brings me before you today, for I have grave concerns regarding \nthe conduct of U.S. foreign policy under the Clinton administration.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I had the privilege \nand the responsibility to question Ambassador Albright concerning her \nstrategic vision for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. Ambassador \nAlbright is a capable and forceful advocate of the Clinton \nadministration's agenda. I am confident that she will serve the \nPresident with honor and distinction. Unfortunately, I am equally \nconfident that Ambassador Albright will continue to promote the same \nmisguided Clinton foreign policy that we have had for the past 4 years.\n  We need our foreign relations to be conducted at the highest level of \nintegration and coordination, and the highest level of representation \nof the sovereign interests of this country and the American people. We \nmust ensure that our influence is used to advance the national interest \nand to ensure respect for American leadership abroad. National prestige \nis reinforced and enhanced when we operate with a coherent, concise, \nand understandable foreign policy. As the world's only remaining \nsuperpower--we must enhance our capacity to deliver military, economic, \nand moral leadership with clarity.\n  To date, the Clinton administration has reacted to foreign policy \ndevelopments, but has failed to a develop a foreign policy. The \nadministration has lurched from managing one crisis to another, but \nnever articulated the national interest in accordance with a core \nphilosophy. Instead of consistently safeguarding and promoting our \nvalues abroad, the Clinton administration has acted on an ad hoc basis \naccording to the exigencies of the moment, confusing our allies and \nemboldening rogue nations. China was emboldened to conduct missile \ntests off the coast of Taiwan; North Korea was emboldened to further \nthe development of their nuclear weapons capabilities; Saddam Hussein \nwas emboldened to strengthen his position in northern Iraq.\n  Mr. President, in her confirmation hearing Madeleine Albright said, \nquoting the President of the United States, ``Where our interests are \nclear, our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we \nmust act and we must lead.'' This formula for deploying American forces \nis one which is so broad and so vague that it sends signals which might \nconfuse other players in the international arena.\n  ``Where our interests are clear''--I suppose we could have an \ninterest anywhere--and ``where our values are at stake''--I am sure the \nvalues we hold dear are at stake in every situation around the world--\nand ``where we can make a difference.'' Well, the truth of the matter \nis, no one would think that we would send our troops where we could not \nmake a difference.\n  I remain concerned that if we deploy troops in too many instances \njust because there are interests and there are values at stake and we \ncan make a difference, there may come a time when our troops will be so \noccupied that they will not be available to protect strategic national \ninterests where we must make a difference.\n  It is important that we ask the Secretary of State-designate and this \nadministration for a well-defined set of guidelines for how we deploy \nthe strength of the United States around the world. The absence of such \na policy, I think, could be disastrous in terms of our own interests \nand could be confusing and send the wrong signals to the international \ncommunity. In that respect I send to the desk for inclusion in the \nRecord an editorial from the Philadelphia Inquirer of January 13, 1997, \nregarding this matter and the hearing and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statecraft--After Madeleine Albright Skates to Confirmation, It'll Be \n                 Performance, Not Rhetoric, That Counts\n\n       During her confirmation hearings for secretary of state \n     last week, Madeleine Albright was asked when America should \n     intervene abroad.\n       She quoted a high-sounding but vague statement by President \n     Clinton: ``Where our interests are clear, our values are at \n     stake, and where we can make a difference, we must act and we \n     must lead.''\n       Sen. John Ascroft, a Missouri Republican, asked with \n     understandable perplexity, ``How do we set those priorities? \n     Are there ever times where we don't act where we could make a \n     difference because we need to reserve our capacity to act \n     where we must make a difference?''\n       Mrs. Albright, who served in Clinton's first term as \n     ambassador to the United Nations, replied that such choices \n     are policymakers' most difficult task. But that is precisely \n     the mountain she must move if the Clinton foreign policy is \n     to gain coherence. As Americans struggle to find the line \n     between isolationism and global gendarme, Mrs. Albright still \n     hasn't clarified where she stands.\n       Her confirmation hearing was a lovefest, in part because \n     she charmed conservatives by bashing Cuba and former United \n     Nations chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in part because she will \n     be the first woman to hold such high office. But she didn't \n     resolve the contradictions in her political and diplomatic \n     track record of interventionism.\n       As a child of refugees from Hitler and Soviet communism, \n     Mrs. Albright says her thinking was molded by Munich rather \n     than Vietnam (that is, she sees U.S. intervention as good, \n     not evil). But it has often seemed her litmus test for U.S. \n     intervention was more a hope of doing good, than a pursuit of \n     vital U.S. interests.\n       On taking her U.N. post, Mrs. Albright called for \n     ``assertive multilateralism,'' meaning America should lead, \n     but work through international organizations like the United \n     Nations. But she dropped that idea after the U.N. and \n     American peacekeeping debacle in Somalia (for which she bears \n     much responsibility).\n       Now Mrs. Albright talks about a pragmatic ``doability \n     doctrine.'' She said America isn't the world's policeman. But \n     she never answered Sen. Ashcroft's question.\n       The lack of clues to an Albright doctrine wouldn't be so \n     worrisome had she demonstrated a firmer grip of strategy over \n     the past four years. Instead, she became known more as the \n     queen of the TV sound bite, coining punchy foreign policy \n     phrases to\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n     compensate for the taciturn Warren Christopher. Pundits \n     praise her ``passionate'' approach, but in her new job it \n     will be strategy and performance that count, not rhetoric. \n     Perhaps she can avoid her boss' history of confusing the two.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, during her confirmation hearing \nAmbassador Albright stated that ``we are not the world's policeman, \nnor, . . . are we running a charity or a fire department.'' However, \nshe failed to recognize that the combination of her so-called \n``assertive multilateralism'' and a ``do-ability doctrine''--whereby \nthe United States acts ``in the places where our addition of action \nwill, in fact, be the critical difference''--places the United States, \nas a practical matter in the position of being the world's policeman, \nof running a charity or a fire department.\n  For the past 4 years, the pursuit of the United States' national \ninterests has been obscured by an overriding reliance on multilateral \naction. The administration's embrace of `assertive multilateralism' has \nresulted in both the abdication of our responsibilities and the \nmisguided projection of our power. For example, instead of applying the \nReagan Doctrine to Bosnia by equipping and training the Bosnian forces \nin spite of our allies' objections, the Clinton administration \nsubcontracted our role of arming the Bosnians to a terrorist regime in \nIran, allowing fundamentalists to gain a foothold in the heart of \nEurope and thus unnecessarily endangering the lives of U.S. troops. In \ncontrast, the administration's attempt at nation building in Somalia \nsacrificed the lives of 19 brave Rangers without regard to whether such \naction advanced our vital national interests. When this administration \nacts according to the exigencies of the moment instead of according to \nan underlying philosophy, the country lurches from paralysis to mission \ncreep without regard to the national interest.\n  Recently, there has been discussion of the possibility of reworking \nour entire military force structure--which is presently based on the \ncapacity to fight two simultaneous major regional conflicts--in order \nto enable us to commit U.S. troops to an ever-growing number of \nmultilateral peacekeeping missions. I am concerned that we may \nsacrifice our vital national security interests in order to be able to \nparticipate in peripheral endeavors. We should not be shortsighted. We \nshould not lose sight of what we must do in order to accomplish what we \ncan do. Our military should be used to protect our national security \ninterests, not provide peacekeeping in areas without strategic \nsignificance.\n  We need to continue to very closely monitor the foreign policy of the \nClinton administration in terms of the national security interests of \nthe United States. We must be vigilant about the deployment of U.S. \ntroops around the world, including deployments that might include an \nattempt to place U.S. troops under the command of individuals who are \nnot U.S. citizens and who do not have the kind of values to which we \nare committed.\n  Mr. President, in this era of hegemonic stability, with the \nproliferation of fissile materials and missile delivery systems to \nrogue nations we must be constantly vigilant to security threats. We \nmust ensure that adherence to Russia's narrow and one-sided \ninterpretation of the ABM Treaty does not jeopardize the safety of the \nAmerican people. Russia should not have veto power over developing a \ndefensive system to protect the American people from missile attack. \nAmbassador Albright supports the administration's goal to develop a \ntheater missile defense system that will protect our allies and our \ntroops abroad--but not to develop a system to protect our own territory \nand citizens at home in the near term. I find this position to be \nuntenable.\n  Mr. President, we must not only protect the physical security of the \nUnited States and the American people. We must also safeguard our \nsovereignty--our State and local laws and customs from international \nreview. I am troubled by Ambassador Albright's assertion that ``there \nis no such thing anymore as just a purely domestic issue or a purely \nforeign issue.'' She says there are only ``intermestic'' issues, \nmeaning international and domestic issues combined. I think there are \nsome issues of sovereignty that need to be reserved directly and \nappropriately, not only to the purview of our country, but to its \ncitizens--to individuals and to families. I am concerned about her \nsupport of international treaties which could infringe upon the \nparental and religious rights Americans now enjoy.\n\n  I am concerned that we closely monitor the extent to which the United \nStates from time to time by treaty cedes the sovereignty of the \nAmerican people to international organizations. Madeleine Albright, the \nSecretary of State-designate, for instance, signed the United Nations \nConvention on the Rights of the Child. Britain, which has ratified the \ntreaty, is now being called on the carpet because they allow moderate \ncorporal punishment of children by parents. I simply do not think we \nneed to look to the United Nations or international organizations to \ntell us whether moderate spanking of children is allowed in the United \nStates. Inasmuch as she was an individual who signed the treaty on \nbehalf of the United States, I think it behooves us, given her \ncommitment to the so-called ``intermestic'' nature of all issues, that \nwe ask her to be especially careful about the sovereignty of the United \nStates and the prerogatives of individuals in specific States. \nAmbassador Albright stated that ``the promotion and protection of \ninternational human rights may require that domestic state and local \npolicies in certain areas be open to international scrutiny. We have no \nreason to fear it.'' I would suggest that any threat to our \nsovereignty, any threat to our State and local laws, any threat to the \nsanctity of the family, is a reason to be vigilant.\n  In order to safeguard the national interest, we must reorganize our \nforeign policy apparatus. This Nation is still saddled with an unwieldy \ncold war foreign policy bureaucracy in which many of the functions of \nAID, ACDA, and USIA could be better handled by the State Department. I \nwas hoping that Ambassador Albright would come forward in support of \nthis effort, as did Secretary of State Christopher--however fleetingly. \nThe American people not only want our Government to reflect their \nwishes abroad, but they want it to do so coherently, concisely, and \nclearly. If we have a single voice in foreign policy representing the \nadministration, be it Republican or Democrat, that single voice is most \nlikely to get the job done, rather than the cacophony of voices from \ncompeting fiefdoms which undercut the authority of the Secretary of \nState.\n  For example, currently there is a ``good-cop, bad-cop'' approach to \nforeign policy, whereby the entities who hand out U.S. foreign aid \nmaintain good relations with client nations, while the Department of \nState essentially holds the line in protecting U.S. interests. We \nshould not be handing out foreign aid to a country at a time when that \nvery country is clearly acting against our interests. When we \ndistribute foreign aid, it should be with an understanding that the \nUnited States agency or department asking for coordination and \ncooperation from a country in one arena is the same agency or \ndepartment that will be delivering assistance to that country.\n  We must prioritize our expenditures. There are those in this country, \nlike Ambassador Albright, who think that there cannot be any cuts at \nall in the foreign relations area. The Clinton administration has \nactually asked for over $1 billion more in funding over last year's \nlevel. Lobbyists for more foreign aid kept trawling the Halls of \nCongress last year with their buttons saying ``Just 1 percent.'' I just \nwant to point out that the ``Just 1 percent'' is actually about $18 \nbillion. Ambassador Albright is convinced that we have made ``the most \nout of that (foreign aid) money.'' I am not so sanguine. We have poured \nhundreds of millions of dollars into countries over the years with \nlittle effect, because we have not tied that aid to internal changes in \nmany countries which would make that aid meaningful and eventually \nunnecessary.\n  I am not in favor of abolishing foreign assistance, but I am in favor \nof sending a signal around the globe that when American citizens are \ntightening their belts, and exercising fiscal responsibility, there \nwill be some ripple effects in terms of our aid. We need to send a \nclear signal that the shared sacrifice here at home should be matched \nby a certain degree of sacrifice around \n\n[[Page S605]]\n\nthe world. There is a direct correlation between our international \nprestige and the fiscal health of this country. If we do not have the \nability to put our financial house in order, we will not be respected \nby countries around the world. If we continue to race down the road to \nbankruptcy, our influence will not be substantial. It is my sense that \nour stock will rise on the exchange of the world's international \ncommunity, when we demonstrate our intent to address seriously our \nresponsibilities.\n\n  However, the United States is not alone in the need to downsize its \nbureaucracy and eliminate waste. The United Nations must do the same. \nTo her credit, Ambassador Albright has been an outspoken critic of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the United Nations. She was instrumental in \ninitiating an oversight process. However, I am disturbed that she \nsupports the payment of arrears by the United States. The Congress \nwithheld those funds in order to exert leverage for reform. Those funds \nshould not be released until there is tangible evidence that those \nreforms have been enacted as required by Congress.\n  I am casting my vote for Ambassador Albright with grave reservations. \nFor I want to make clear that my vote for Ambassador Albright to ascend \nto the position of Secretary of State is not an endorsement of the \nClinton administration's foreign policy. As I noted, I take my ``advise \nand consent'' responsibilities very seriously. I also take my oversight \nresponsibilities very seriously. I pray that over time, my concerns \nthat we are in store for 4 more years of an ad hoc foreign policy will \nprove to be unfounded. Ambassador Albright is an honorable, committed, \nand distinguished public official. She is eminently well qualified to \nbe our 63d Secretary of State. It is a privilege to be able to cast the \nhistoric vote for the first woman to be nominated for this office. As a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to working \nwith her in the future to protect America's interests abroad.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a housekeeping matter and ask \nunanimous consent that the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Second, Mr. President, following his remarks on the \nnomination, Senator Dodd has requested a couple of minutes in morning \nbusiness. I ask unanimous consent that that be granted and not charged \nto either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time does the minority control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 12 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I will make it briefer than that then.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator needs 10, go ahead.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Biden and also my \ncolleague from North Carolina for his understanding. I also thank him \nand Senator Lott for the expeditious manner in which this nomination \nhas been treated. Finally, I thank my colleagues on the committee as \nwell, who engaged in a long day of testimony by Madeleine Albright, \nunder an arrangement that allowed us to move this nomination out of our \ncommittee on the day of the inauguration. Now, it will allow us to vote \nhere today in the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, I believe that today's bipartisan cooperation on this \nnomination will help to forge the kind of working relationship between \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate that should make it easier to \nget the American people's business taken care of here in Washington. I \ncommend the leaders of both sides of the aisle for their efforts in \nthat regard.\n  To be honest, Mr. President, reaching consensus on this nomination \nwas not difficult at all. That's because the nominee we are considering \ntoday is so highly respected by everyone in the U.S. Congress--by \nDemocrats and Republicans, liberals, moderates, and conservatives.\n  During her nomination hearing on January 8, Ambassador Albright \ndemonstrated a profound understanding of the foreign policy issues \nconfronting the United States as we prepare to enter the 21st century. \nIn her opening statement on that day, she laid out very effectively, in \nmy view, and succinctly why all Americans should care about foreign \npolicy. I would like to quote her:\n\n       Do not doubt,--\n\n  Speaking of foreign policy interests.\n\n     Those interests are not geopolitical abstractions, they are \n     real.\n       It matters to our children whether they grow up in a world \n     where the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction have \n     been minimized or allowed to run out of control.\n       It matters to our families whether illegal drugs continue \n     to pour into our neighborhoods from overseas.\n       It matters to Americans who travel abroad or go about their \n     daily business at home whether the scourge of international \n     terrorism is reduced.\n       It matters to our workers and business people whether they \n     will be unfairly forced to compete against companies that \n     violate fair labor standards, despoil the environment or gain \n     contracts not through competition but corruption.\n       And it matters to us all whether through inattention or \n     indifference, we allow small wars to grow into large ones \n     that put our safety and freedom at risk.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that summarizes very well why what happens \noutside of our borders is important to each and every American.\n  I know that time is limited and many of my colleagues wish to speak \non this issue as well. So I will just cover some brief points here, if \nI can. I certainly would not want to allow the time to pass without \nmaking some personal observations about Madeleine Albright.\n  Obviously, Ambassador Albright's nomination is historic for a number \nof reasons, and those reasons have been outlined by the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from North Carolina, as well as others, over the \nlast several hours. She will be the first woman to hold the position of \nSecretary of State. Without a doubt, Madeleine is eminently qualified \nto discharge the duties of this office. She has the expertise, academic \nbackground, and leadership qualities that will make her an excellent \nSecretary of State. I may also point out, Mr. President, that Madeleine \nAlbright speaks, I believe, four or five languages fluently--which will \nbe a first, I think, for anyone to ever hold this position--including \nher native language of Czech, as well as Russian, Polish, French, and \nobviously English. This will provide an invaluable tool for the United \nStates, to have a Secretary of State with such a proficient ability to \ncommunicate with leaders throughout the world.\n\n  I have known Ambassador Albright for many years. Our families have \nbeen close. My brother, Tom, was a colleague of Madeleine's at \nGeorgetown University for many years, where they both taught.\n  Madeleine is also no stranger to the Congress and she keenly \nunderstands the need to return to a bipartisan consensus on American \nforeign policy. In fact, Mr. President, if I were asked what is the \nsingle-most important foreign policy issue facing this country today, I \nwould say getting the Congress and the legislative branch to work \ntogether. I think that is No. 1. Every other issue you can mention is \nobviously important, but unless we figure out a way to return to a time \nwhen there was comity in the foreign policy agenda, it is going to be \nvery difficult to deal with any foreign policy issue.\n  I happen to think Ambassador Albright is eminently qualified because \nshe knows all of this so well. We have dealt with her, we know of her \nand her competence, and we have confidence in her. That is a very \nimportant step in allowing us to work together on behalf of shared \ngoals. I've heard my chairman speak about this subject matter and I \nhave a great deal of confidence that we are going to have great success \nunder his leadership and the leadership of Ambassador Albright in that \nregard.\n  Madeleine has also worked closely with both Chambers over the past 4 \nyears as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. She \nhas been a voice of wisdom and reason at the United Nations during the \ncourse of the many debates that have occurred there--on Bosnia, on \nIraq, on Haiti, on Cuba, and on the need for institutional reform \nwithin that international body.\n  Why has Madeleine been so effective at representing U.S. interests? \nPerhaps\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\nbecause her own life story, which may not be well known to many people, \nis the epitome of what makes this country great.\n  Becoming the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was something of a \nhomecoming for Ambassador Albright. She had, after all, been at the \nUnited Nations once before. Madeleine first came to the United States \nin 1948, at the age of 11, when her father was appointed as the Czech \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  Little did her family realize at that time that their stay in the \nUnited States would be more than the usual ambassadorial rotation. Soon \nafter their arrival, the free Czechoslovakia they had left behind was \nunder the grip of totalitarian rule. It had fallen to the dictatorship \nof communism.\n  I happen to know about that so well, because during that very brief \ntime when Czechoslovakia was a free government, my father was fortunate \nto receive the Order of the White Lion, which was the highest honor \nthat Czechoslovakia could give to a non-Czech, at the end of World War \nII. We still prize it as one of my father's most memorable moments in \nhis life. So from that relationship, my family got to know Madeleine's \nfamily.\n  It is perhaps because of these unique personal experiences that \nAmbassador Albright has been such an effective U.S. spokesperson at the \nUnited Nations. Whatever the topic, Madeleine is able to speak out \npassionately--from the heart--about the importance of democracy and \nrespect for human rights across the globe.\n  Even before going to the United Nations, Ambassador Albright already \nhad a distinguished career of public service and academic achievement. \nShe is a graduate of Wellesley College and Columbia University. She was \na fellow at both the Woodrow Wilson Center and the Center for Strategic \nand International Studies. As I mentioned earlier, she was a professor \nof international relations at Georgetown University and president of \nthe Center for National Policy.\n  Her public service is equally distinguished--as a staff member to the \nlate Senator Edmund Muskie, then as a member of the National Security \nCouncil in the Carter administration and most recently Ambassador to \nthe United Nations. Mr. President, I believe the same qualities that \nmade her so effective in these positions will make her particularly \neffective as the next Secretary of State.\n  Heads of state and foreign ministries around the globe already know \nthat our next Secretary of State is highly respected in the United \nStates and internationally and that she can go toe to toe with the most \nseasoned diplomats and foreign leaders. But, they should also know that \nshe has the full confidence of both the President and the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, Madeleine Albright is uniquely qualified, at this \nmoment in history, to be America's voice abroad. I am confident that \nshe will be a superb Secretary of State and I urge all to join me in \nsupporting her nomination.\n  I thank our colleague from Delaware and our chairman for moving this \nalong. This is the way we ought to be able to do business around here. \nI commend him and thank the majority leader, as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today \nprincipally to lend my support to the nomination of the Honorable \nMadeleine Albright to be Secretary of State.\n  It is a historic and fitting occasion that this will be the first \nvote in the U.S. Senate in the 105th Congress. I have come to know \nAmbassador Albright in her work at the United Nations, and have a very \nhigh regard for her competency. And I am pleased that the President has \nmade this historic appointment because she is the first woman who will \nhave this very important position.\n  She has an extraordinary record in academia: president of the Center \nfor National Policy; a professor of international affairs at Georgetown \nUniversity; a senior fellow in Soviet and Eastern European affairs at \nthe Center for Strategic and International Studies; served on the \nNational Security Council staff; has excellent academic credentials \nfrom Wellesley; also a masters and doctorate from Columbia University; \nand, perhaps most importantly is a graduate of the Senate family, \nhaving served as chief legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie.\n  I had occasion to work with Ambassador Albright on a number of \nmatters. One of the most important was working with her on the War \nCrimes Tribunal, where the United States has played an active role in \nbringing to justice the international criminals from Bosnia and Rwanda. \nShe accompanied me in a meeting which I had several years ago with then \nSecretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and \nthere has been really good cooperation from the U.S. Government on that \nimportant matter. I have had an occasion to visit the War Crimes \nTribunal on two occasions; to visit with our staff there, and also the \njudges. She has played a very important role in promoting the War \nCrimes Tribunal.\n  It is my hope that Secretary of State Albright will pursue an \nactivist foreign policy and will lend the prestige and the power of the \nUnited States to solve complex international problems, one which I \nrefer to--and only one for the brevity of time--which involves the \nefforts to bring conciliation between the Governments of India and \nPakistan.\n  About a year and a half ago Senator Brown and I were traveling in \nIndia and met with Prime Minister Gowda, who commented about his \ninterest in having the subcontinent nuclear free. We then discussed the \nmatter with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan. The ministers of \nthose two countries have not met. Senator Brown and I wrote to the \nPresident urging that he invite them to the Oval Office.\n  I mention that only as an illustration of what I am hopeful Secretary \nof State Albright will activate on U.S. policy.\n  I think it is important for the United States to remain active \ninternationally. She has an extraordinary background having been born \nin Czechoslovakia and having come to this country at the age of 11, and \nis also known to be fluent in four languages.\n  So I am pleased to lend my support to her nomination today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Today, indeed, is a historic day. We gather on the Senate floor to be \npresented both to ourselves and the American people the nomination of \nDr. Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State--Madeleine Albright, \nthe very first woman to be nominated Secretary of State; Madeleine \nAlbright, the very first refugee to be nominated Secretary of State.\n  What a wonderful, historic opportunity we have to confirm her \nnomination and to make history as well as to help carry out President \nBill Clinton's foreign policy, to make the world a better and safer \nplace.\n  I know Dr. Albright well. We have been friends and colleagues for \nmany years, and I am so enthusiastic about her nomination because of \nher skills, her experience, her character, her values. She is a woman \nof honor, integrity and extraordinary patriotism.\n  As President Clinton was making his decision, I called him. I called \nhim to urge that he consider Dr. Albright. I said there are three \nimportant reasons why I felt Madeleine Albright is the best person to \nserve as Secretary of State in this new millennium. First, she is a \nwoman of great competence in the area of foreign policy and \ndemonstrated skills in that area as our Ambassador to the United \nNations.\n  Second, her remarkable personal history is the story of America.\n  And third, she has a great and unusual ability to communicate our \nforeign policy to the American people and to the world.\n  First, she would bring great competency and experience to the post. \nForeign policy is her life's work and her life's passion. In addition \nto her dazzling intellectual ability and scholarship, Ambassador \nAlbright has diplomatic skills and the understanding of what this new \nworld order is all about.\n  She has a proven record. As our Ambassador to the United Nations, she \nshowed brains and backbone asserting U.S. policy. We do not need to \nquestion whether she can deal with China, different cultures or with \ndictators. She has already done it. She is respected by our allies and \nby our foes. She has proven that she is firm, fair, and tenacious.\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\n  For the past 4 years, she has defended our values and interests at \nthe United Nations, and she has done more to bring fiscal \nresponsibility to the United Nations. She stood up to dictators and \nstood by our friends.\n  As Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will do something else. \nShe will bring a story of America to people from the old world order as \nwell as the new and emerging one. I discussed with President Clinton \nher personal story, that she is the daughter of the last Ambassador \nfrom a free Czechoslovakia until the end of the cold war. While her \nfather was in this country, Czechoslovakia fell to a dictatorship. He \ndefected so that he could serve Czechoslovakia by being a good American \nand by being a spokesman in this area. She comes from a history and \ntradition where patriots are willing to make sacrifices. She knows what \nit means to lose a home to dictatorship and therefore she reaches out \nto others who experience the same pain. She will understand those who \nlabor tirelessly in exile to reclaim their freedom, and will support \nthem.\n\n  And, as new immigrants, Madeleine Albright and her family used \nAmerica's great opportunity structure so they could rebuild their \nlives, based on opportunity, merit, and hard work. Where else in the \nworld could a refugee rise to become the highest ranking woman in our \nhistory?\n  She has also been involved in the social movements of our time, \nwhether the civil rights movement or the women's movement, or those \nsocial movements that help create a democracy. The world is not just \ntransformed by treaty and law, but cultural and social transformations \noften occur through democratic social movements, institutionalized in a \npositive way. And Albright will do that.\n  As a child whose family fled from Europe as the Iron Curtain was \nraised and slammed down on the people of Central Europe, she stood up. \nShe knows what this is all about. As a member of an immigrant family \nmaking a start in a new country, she will work to ensure that our \nforeign aid is used to foster opportunity around the world.\n  Mr. President, the third reason Ambassador Albright will be an \nextraordinary Secretary of State is she has an unusual talent for \ncommunication. She has already demonstrated her capacity to articulate \nthe President's policy and agenda, not only to the world, but also to \nthe American people. She will enable people to understand our American \npolicies. This is essential to mobilize support for these policies, \nboth at home and abroad. Even if our policies are not supported, they \nshould be understood and respected. No one does a better job of \nexplaining American foreign policy to the American people than \nMadeleine Albright. Most people are understandably concerned about \ntheir jobs, their children, their security. It is a lot to ask them to \nfocus on Bosnia, Haiti, Chechnya, human rights, China. And after paying \nbillions of dollars to win the cold war, many Americans wonder why we \nmust continue that burden of leadership.\n  We cannot solve every problem in the world and we should not try. But \nwe must act where we can make a difference, where American values and \ninterests are at stake. With Dr. Madeleine Albright as Secretary of \nState, we will continue to have a foreign policy that reflects our \nvalues, that serves our interests, in consultation with Congress, and \nwith mobilized American support.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying this. There is an added \nbonus to Dr. Madeleine Albright's nomination. The Senate is about to \nconfirm this highest ranking woman in American history. As the first \nwoman elected by my own party to serve in her own right, and as the \nsenior woman in the Senate, I must say this is truly a historic \noccasion. This is a moment for all of us to take pride in, in the \nopportunity and fairness of our country.\n  Mr. President, the American people will not have to worry about \nMadeleine Albright's service. When she was nominated, she said this to \nher daughters, ``When you were little girls I often used to worry where \nyou were and what you are doing. Now you will wonder where your mother \nis and what she is doing.''\n  But, you know, the American people will not have to worry. Whether it \nis in Cyprus, Singapore, China, she will be defending American values \nand interests. She will be one of the best Secretaries of State we have \never had.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I would like to extend my \nappreciation to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the \nway he conducted the hearing and the nomination process, with the \nfairness and civility and the expeditious way he does it.\n  I, and I know Dr. Albright and her entire family who support her, \nappreciate the courtesy and expeditious nature in which the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina has dealt with this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nnomination of Madeleine K. Albright to be Secretary of State. We stand \nat the end of a century of European conflict: two world wars followed \nby a cold war. In the wake of this hundred years' war it is hugely \nimportant that the President has nominated a woman, born in Europe \namidst this turmoil, to be his Secretary of State to lead us into the \nnext century.\n  The first point I would like to make, a point that deserves to be \nstressed by every Senator, is that when Ambassador Albright is \nconfirmed, she will become the 64th Secretary of State, and the first \nwoman ever to hold that office. No woman has ever held a higher office \nin the executive branch. I congratulate both the President and his \ndistinguished nominee on this milestone.\n  Ambassador Albright came to the United States at the age of 11, \nhaving experienced herself the realities of this hundred years' war. \nMost recently she comes to us from Turtle Bay, NY, where she has served \nas our Permanent Representative to the United Nations. As the only \nAmbassador-Senator, and having served in the same post at the United \nNations, I feel it incumbent upon me to inform my colleagues that for \nher to have endured 4 years of mind-numbing addresses at the United \nNations is no small feat.\n  As Ambassador, she has earned the respect of many. Not the least of \nwhich are the editors of the New Republic who wrote in a December 30, \n1996, editorial:\n\n       The good news about Albright, in sum, is that she is a \n     creature of the twentieth century. For this reason, she \n     understands how appallingly similar to this century the next \n     century is likely to be. A person whose primal scene was \n     Nazism and then Stalinism is not likely to get drunk on talk \n     of a new millennium. She is likely to know, rather, that evil \n     is never permanently retired, and certainly not by \n     technological change. Albright recognized early that the most \n     pressing order of business for Clinton's foreign policy in \n     its first term was not protectionism, it was genocide. And a \n     person whose primal scene was not Vietnam will know that \n     there is only one way to stop genocide, and this is the \n     harsh, airborne way.\n\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we find ourselves at the \nend of a century of conflict. We began the century trying to stay out \nof the affairs of Europe. That lasted only through Wilson's first term. \nNow we end the century having played a pivotal role in the events which \nshaped it. This is an occasion on which we recall the great hopes that \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had for the United Nations. We can now use the \nfruit of our century-long labors, most importantly the United Nations \nCharter, to realize the hopes of Roosevelt, Truman, Marshall, and \nAcheson.\n  Nowhere is the importance of the Charter more pronounced than in \nBosnia. I have spoken in this chamber many times on the subject of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. Had we invoked the charter early in the \nconflict and its provision for demonstrations under article 42, by \n``air, sea, or land forces, [to] restore international peace and \nsecurity,'' much of the genocide that followed could have been \nprevented. We had the tools, but waited too long to use them.\n  The Bosnian conflict is far from over. Though the Dayton agreement \nand NATO forces have achieved relative stability over the past 13 \nmonths, there are still many important issues to be resolved.\n  None is more important, or pressing, then the work of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal. Today 75 persons have been indicted \nfor war crimes. It is appalling to report that 68 of them remain at \nlarge. Not because they cannot be found, but because pressure has not\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\nbeen brought to bear on countries to deliver indicted war criminals to \nThe Hague.\n  This is an issue that cannot afford delay. I would ask the Secretary-\ndesignate to seek to address this important problem at the earliest \npossible date. She has made such a pledge during her testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and I look forward to working with her \nto achieve these goals.\n  I say this with the deepest respect for Ambassador Albright, who, \nhaving spent 4 years at the United Nations, is keenly aware of the \nimportance of these issues. I wish her well on her historic \nappointment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that most Americans realize \nthe world in which we live has changed dramatically over the last \ndecade. The world which had been divided into two hostile yet stable \ncamps since the end of World War II entered a new era when the Soviet \nUnion ceased to exist. When the Berlin Wall fell the divide between the \nEast and West did as well, and we entered a new era.\n  Today, democracy is spreading around the globe and our international \npriorities which once focused on strategic arms reduction treaties can \nnow focus on other issues such as improving relations with democratic \ncountries in South America, Asia, and Eastern Europe that have \nburgeoning market economies.\n  These tremendous changes, however, come hand in hand with new \nchallenges. Fighting international terrorism and crime is important to \nlaw abiding citizens everywhere. Fighting international drug \ntraffickers is of particular importance to the citizens of New Mexico \nsince approximately 70 percent of all illegal drugs entering the United \nStates comes across our southern border with Mexico.\n  Helping Russia emerge as a stable democracy with a growing economy \nis, also, very important. A strong, democratic Russia would be a \nstabilizing influence in Asia and could help prevent the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. In fact, the Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in New Mexico is already working with Russia to safeguard \nits nuclear weapons and ensure that nuclear materials do not fall into \nthe wrong hands.\n  Another important challenge is helping China emerge as a peaceful, \nresponsible world power. A friendly China with its strong economic \ngrowth, huge population, and vast resources would be both a valuable \npartner in trade and a valuable ally in Asia. An aggressive China, \nhowever, could become a destabilizing influence in a region that is \nvital to our national interests.\n  The United States faces a number of other important international \nchallenges. Among them are: arriving at an agreeable method to allow \nEastern European and central Asian countries to join the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization [NATO], resolving the dispute between Greece and \nTurkey over Cyprus, finding a lasting political solution to the \nproblems of the Korean Peninsula, and securing the peace in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and bringing the young men and women of the United States \narmed services home safely.\n  With all of the changes of the last decade, one might view the world \nas unstable. In fact, facing such a list of daunting tasks, one might \nconsider these challenges insurmountable. I view them as an \nopportunity.\n  With strong leadership, and clearly defined and consistent \ninternational policies, the post-cold-war era could be one of even \ngreater American prosperity. I believe Madeleine Albright, as Secretary \nof State, will provide such leadership.\n  Madeleine Albright spent 2 years working here, in the U.S. Senate, \nwhen she served as chief legislative assistant to Senator Muskie from \n1976 to 1978. Her intelligence and competence were recognized when, in \n1978, she moved to the National Security Council and the White House to \nhandle foreign policy legislation. Many foreign policy professionals \nmight consider being on the National Security Council the pinnacle of a \ncareer, but Madeleine Albright was just getting started. In 1981 she \nwas awarded a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars at the Smithsonian. She became a professor of international \naffairs, and the director of the women in foreign service program at \nthe School of Foreign Service at Georgetown. She served as president of \nthe Center for National Policy. In 1993, she was appointed U.S. \nRepresentative to the United Nations, and made a member of President \nClinton's Cabinet.\n  Madeleine Albright is living proof of the American dream. Having fled \nCzechoslovakia and both the Nazis and Communists, Madeleine Albright \ncame to the United States, studied hard, worked hard, and has now been \nnominated for the office of United States Secretary of State. Madeleine \nAlbright, once a persecuted immigrant, is now the first women in United \nStates history to be nominated to the highest office in the State \nDepartment. Not since Margaret Thatcher governed Britain has a woman \noccupied a position on such a scale of international influence. As \nSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright will negotiate with the world's \nmost powerful leaders.\n  Mr. President, Madeleine Albright has done a superb job as Ambassador \nto the United Nations. She has worked to make the United Nations more \nefficient and more responsive to U.S. interests. She prevailed in \nurging the NATO bombing in Bosnia, which she argues eventually led to \nthe Dayton Peace Accord last year. She condemned Cuba when it shot down \ntwo unarmed civilian airplanes over international air space. She has \nfought for the freedom and the rights of people around the world. For \nthese reasons and others, I believe Madeleine Albright will provide the \nstrong leadership necessary make the post-cold-war era one of \nopportunity, cooperation, and American leadership. It is my honor to \nsupport Madeleine Albright for the position of U.S. Secretary of State.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong reservations about \nthe administration's foreign policies as we debate the confirmation of \nAmbassador Madeleine Albright as Secretary of State.\n  Following President Clinton's direction, Ambassador Albright signed \nthe United Nations Rights of the Child Convention, a document which I \nbelieve is seriously flawed. As a nation, we hold our children dear. We \nhave established laws on a national level and local levels to \nadequately protect our children and the rights of our families. The \nidea that a foreign state or an international federation knows better \nthan we how to raise our children is abhorrent to our very essence.\n  We have engaged in diplomatic and physical conflict with other \nnations throughout our entire history over just such an issue. The root \nof all autocratic regimes has been that the state knows best. We \ncannot, we must not let that idea insinuate itself into how we conduct \nourselves as a nation. I am concerned that Ambassador Albright through \nher vote in the United Nations, may have done just that.\n  Her support of policies which have come dangerously close to \nrelinquishing command of our own troops to United Nations commanders \nwho may or may not share the democratic ethic of our command authority \nconcerned me in the past and concerns me today.\n  The rules under which our troops conduct themselves while assigned to \nduties with the United Nations places them under extraordinary \npressure. Our soldiers are required to make judgments as to \nappropriateness of orders received by U.N. authorities not only as to \ntheir legality but as to whether the commands are in concert with \nUnited States policy. We should never place them in such a position, \never. Currently, if the policy of the United States comes into conflict \nwith U.N. orders, it becomes incumbent upon the individual soldier to \nrecognize the conflict and make the proper choice as to whether to \nfollow the order or not. Recently though, to complicate that soldier's \nresponsibility further, U.S. policy shifts have occurred during ongoing \noperations; peacekeeping mutating to nation building, embargo \nenforcement un-enforced. Ambassador Albright must not let this happen \non her watch.\n  As Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will be responsible for \ndirecting and implementing our foreign policy. I hope that if our \nstated policy for instance, is to impose an arms embargo on a war torn \nregion that she would neither tacitly approve nor be a part of a plan \nto approve the introduction of inflammatory religious extremists and \nthe weapons they chose to introduce into the region while hiding that \nfact\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\nfrom this body, the rest of the Congress or the American people.\n  As Secretary of State she must realize that the sovereignty of the \nUnited States can never be made secondary to any country, entity or \norganization.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a special honor for all of us who \nknow and respect Madeleine Albright to vote for her confirmation as \nSecretary of State. This is an historic moment for the country, and I \nknow that she will serve with great distinction as the first woman in \nour history to hold that high office.\n  Over the years, Madeleine Albright has always been an excellent \nsource of wise advice to many of us in Congress on matters of foreign \npolicy. I have always valued her counsel and respected her leadership, \nand the President's decision to nominate her as Secretary of State is a \nwell-deserved honor.\n  In the course of her extraordinary career, she has skillfully \ncombined public service and academic pursuits, and these abilities make \nher especially well-suited for the challenges she will face as \nSecretary of State. Many of us first came to know her when she was an \nable assistant to our former colleague Senator Edmund Muskie, and later \nas a member of President Carter's National Security Council. And all of \nus were proud of her brilliant service in recent years as our \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  Academically, she has served as a senior fellow at the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, as a professor at Georgetown's \nSchool of Foreign Service, and as president of the Center for National \nPolicy.\n  Her personal history of fleeing Hitler and Communism as a child from \nher home in Czechoslovakia and her rise in this country to the position \nof Secretary of State is one of the great American success stories of \nour time and a vivid symbol that the American dream is alive and well \nin our day and generation.\n  I commend her for her nomination, and I look forward to working \nclosely with her in the years to come. I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of the 64 persons who have served as Secretary of State, including \nMadeleine Albright, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     SECRETARIES OF STATE 1789-1977\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Name                 When appointed        President\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Jan. 22, 1997         Do.\n                                    (confirmed by\n                                    Senate).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have known Madeleine Albright for many \nyears and consider her extraordinarily well qualified for the important \npost of Secretary of State. She has the knowledge, experience, \nintelligence, candor, energy, and strength of will necessary for this \ndifficult job. I will support her confirmation with enthusiasm.\n  By now most Americans have heard the compelling story of Madeleine \nAlbright's family flight from first fascism, and then communism. After \ncoming to the United States, Madeleine Albright compiled an impressive \nacademic resume, including a B.A. from Wellesley College and a masters \nand doctorate from Columbia University. Her subsequent career has been \ndevoted to international affairs and government--from Capitol Hill, to \nthe National Security Council, to the challenging post of United States \nU.N. Ambassador. She served as a professor at the Georgetown \nUniversity's School of Foreign Service and a scholar at both the \nSmithsonian's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies. Prior to her \nappointment to the U.N. post, Ambassador Albright was president of the \nCenter for National Policy, a nonprofit research institution.\n  By any measure, the job of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations is a \nmost demanding one and Ambassador Albright handled it with great skill, \nearning praise from across the political spectrum. During Ambassador \nAlbright's tenure at the United Nations, I had the pleasure of working \nwith her to promote the establishment of an inspector general within \nthe U.N. system. Ambassador Albright worked long and hard--and \neventually successfully--to build a consensus among the member states \nfor this U.S. initiative.\n  The cold war no longer provides the overarching architecture for U.S. \nforeign policy. And I doubt that any similarly comprehensive substitute \nwill evolve in the near future. U.S. foreign policy now has several \nmore or less equal priority objectives. Balancing these objectives one \nagainst the other and moving them all forward in today's complex \ninternational environment is a challenging task. I am confident that \nAmbassador Albright has not only the intellect to meet this challenge \nbut also--and equally importantly--the ability to clearly articulate \nfor the benefit of the American people the national interest involved \nin the foreign policy challenges we face and the choices we make.\n  I am pleased that someone of Madeleine Albright's character and \nability has been chosen, and has agreed, to serve this President and \nthis Nation as our primary representative to the world. I congratulate \nher on her imminent confirmation and look forward to working with her \nin the future.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today is indeed a historic milestone for \nour Nation. For the majority of this country's history, a full half of \nour citizens were left without the right to vote therefore they were \nleft without a voice, without a collective voice in the direction of \ndomestic affairs or international affairs for our country.\n  With the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920, this flawed policy \nwas corrected, however since that time progress and change in this area \nhas come, but very slowly. Today we take a great step forward for our \ncountry and the world in approving the nomination of Secretary of State \ndesignee Madeleine Albright.\n  Although there is little controversy surrounding our vote today on \nthis confirmation we should take a moment to note the historical \nsignificance of this occasion.\n  There was a time not long ago when the nomination of any woman \nregardless of how qualified or experienced to lead our Nation's foreign \npolicy would have been at the least controversial, and at the most \nunthinkable. Today, that time is over.\n  Ambassador Albright's confirmation is all but certain in just a few \nmoments\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nwith the vote of this Senate. She is a tribute to her gender, but it is \nnot to her gender that this accomplishment is due, it is through her \nexemplary career in foreign service.\n  To be here today on the floor of this historic Chamber to cast my \nfirst vote as a U.S. Senator is in itself a exhilarating experience, \nbut to be able to cast that vote for Madeleine Albright the first woman \never to serve as Secretary of State of this great Nation makes it even \nmore memorable.\n  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to share these thoughts.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the occasion of Ambassador Albright's \nimminent confirmation as Secretary of State raises some deep concerns \nregarding this administration's foreign policy.\n  While I believe there is much to be admired about Ambassador \nAlbright--she has a reputation as a frank and forthright speaker, who \nis able to articulate forcibly her views--I have deep reservations \nabout what I believe is her flawed philosophy of the role of U.S. \nforces in the conduct foreign policy.\n  As our U.N. Ambassador over the last 4 years, Mrs. Albright has \nconsistently articulated an alarming vision of post-cold-war foreign \npolicy. It is one which designates the United Nations as the world's \nguarantor of peace and in so doing seeks to subjugate United States' \ninterests to this world body.\n  In June 1993, she articulated the concept of assertive \nmultilateralism as a way of responding to internal political and \neconomic turmoil, defiant regimes, and failed societies in countries \naround the globe.\n  The United States would act primarily as a part of the United Nations \nto respond to crises throughout the world.\n  Fundamental to this premise is the belief that every conflict, every \ndisaster will eventually impact the United States and is therefore in \nour interests to intervene, militarily, to intervene.\n  The United Nations as the instrument of this collective security \ncalls the shots and the United States responds by sending troops. The \nUnited States participating with other nations would be able to right \nthe wrongs in the world. This is faulty in concept and dangerous in \nexecution.\n  Consider some of the statements she has made:\n\n       Our goal is to foster the development of a community \n     capable of easing, if not terminating, the abominable \n     injustices and conditions that still plague civilization, \n     because only in such a community can America flourish.\n       We are also facing increased ethnic and subnational \n     violence. Wherever we turn, someone is fighting or \n     threatening someone else. These disputes may be far removed \n     from our borders but in today's global environment, chaos is \n     an infectious disease.\n\n  The role of the United States is then to ``reform or isolate the \nrogue states that act to undermine the stability and prosperity of the \nlarger community and * * * to contain the chaos and ease the suffering \nin regions of greatest humanitarian concern.''\n\n  There is an obvious and immediate danger to this type of thinking. \nThe reality is there are many problems in the world which we simply \ncannot resolve. In exerting great effort to accomplish impossible goals \nwe endanger the lives of our troops, damage U.S. leadership and \nprestige, squander valuable resources, and destroy the will of the \nAmerican people to intervene when our own interests are indeed \nthreatened.\n  The first year of the Clinton administration was dominated by behind \nthe scenes effort to develop a document which would serve as the \nClinton policy initiative on multilateral action. The consistent theme \nof this Presidential Review Directive [PRD-13] was to upgrade the \nU.N.'s military capabilities and to increase--even institutionalize--\nthe U.S. involvement with U.N. peacekeeping operations.\n  Ambassador Albright's comments reveal the lines that PRD-13 would \nfollow.\n\n       We favor substantial enlargement and reorganization of the \n     peacekeeping headquarters staff and the creation of a \n     permanent foundation for rapid 24-hour communication, \n     intelligence, lift, recruitment, training, and the full \n     spectrum of in-theater logistical support.\n\n  Clinton's foreign policy team sought to expand the United Nations to \na sort of global police force and equip it to carry out effectively \nthis unrealistic job. The draft document included a rapid expansion of \nU.N. military capability as well as the idea of putting U.S. forces \nunder U.N. command. This elevated peacekeeping philosophy is \nillustrated by events in Somalia.\n  During President Clinton's first year, he turned over the Bush \nlimited food-delivery mission in Somalia to the United Nations. Over \nthe next few months, United States troops were used to hunt down Somali \nwarlord Aideed and participate in what became known as ``nation-\nbuilding'' activities in order to--in Madeleine Albright's words--\n``promote democracy in that strife-torn nation.'' Ultimately 18 U.S. \nRangers were killed by Aideed's men. The last American soldiers left \nSomalia in March 1994--100,000 troops were sent to Somalia; 30 died and \n175 were wounded and at a cost of $1.5 billion. Since our departure, \nfighting erupted and today Somalia is no more better off for our \nmisguided nation-building experience.\n  The tragedy of losing United States troops in Somalia forced the \nadministration to back away from some of the aims of PRD-13. PRD-13, \nwhen finally signed as PDD-25, had undergone a number of changes. \nMadeleine Albright now couched the document in terms of fixing U.N. \npeacekeeping not expanding it. But the underlying premise of the policy \nstill had not changed: greater emphasis on the United Nations for \nresolving conflict. In justifying use of force there was a shift in \ndefinition of national security interest.\n\n  In 1993, Ambassador Albright said:\n\n       We have a national security interest in containing and, \n     wherever possible, resolving regional conflicts * * * the \n     cost of runaway regional conflicts sooner or later comes home \n     to America. [June 1993.]\n\n  Her viewpoint--not unique to this administration--fundamentally \nshifts what previous Presidencies defined as a national security \ninterest and consequently where the President would use American force. \nThis significant alteration of U.S. interests has the profound impact \nof justifying greater and more diverse missions for our troops. Under \nthe rubric of peace operations, U.S. forces have found themselves in \nalmost every conceivable type mission: delivering food and medicine; \nbuilding bridges; training police; hunting down warlords.\n  Colin Powell's comments in his autobiography further illustrate \nMadeleine Albright's thinking. He describes a meeting at the White \nHouse when she asked him ``What's the point of having this superb \nmilitary you're always talking about if we can't use it?''\n  The practical effects of this doctrine have led to our military \ninvolvement in Haiti, Bosnia, Central Africa, and other areas only \nperipherally in our interests.\n  What I fear Ambassador Albright has yet to understand is that there \nare serious costs to using force when our vital interests are not at \nissue. None of these interventions carried out or contemplated by the \nClinton administration were in our security interests. And yet, great \nnumbers of troops have risked their lives and we have spent billions of \ndollars.\n  In Somalia, our forces left, humiliated and at great cost, with the \nturmoil on the ground basically unchanged. In Haiti, we intervened to \nrestore democracy but prospects for its survival are very much in \nquestion, despite our military contribution of $1.2 billion. After 2 \nyears of gradual escalation of United States intervention in Bosnia, \nthe President committed 20,000 of our forces to serve a year to enforce \na separation between the warring factions. U.S. troops now extended for \n18 months have the task of ensuring that civilian reconstruction \nproceeds. No one knows what will happen in Bosnia once our troops are \nremoved.\n  The military has borne great expense because of these missions. And \nin an era of declining military budgets, there  is a growing anxiety \nabout our capability to deal with future national security threats. \nLast year military testimony before the Armed Services Committee \nrevealed serious strains in our military planning and budgeting.\n\n  The President's proposed budget for defense was $10 billion lower \nthan what was appropriated the previous year. And yet testimony after \ntestimony by the CINC's and Service Chiefs indicated strong concerns \nwith levels of spending. Readiness, modernization, quality of life were \nall areas needing focus and\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\nfunding. The services altogether indicated their desire for more than \n$15 billion in increases.\n  While the administration has failed to provide adequately for our \ndefense needs, it continues to deploy our troops in more and more \nmissions around the world. In recent years our forces have been \nseriously overextended. We are asking our forces to do more but have \ndrastically cut force structure by 30 percent. General Reimer, the Army \nChief of Staff, testified that requirements on the Army have risen 300 \npercent. Today, more than 41,000 U.S. soldiers are deployed on nearly \n1,700 missions in 60 countries.\n  And while the President failed to provide adequately for the \nmilitary--to meet their current and future warfighting needs--he \nrequested a separate budget for contingency operations--a clear \nindication that the trend toward greater peacekeeping missions will \ncontinue.\n  I am deeply concerned that the growing use of our forces in areas of \nperipheral interest will have a long lasting and detrimental impact on \nour military--and ultimately on the ability of the United States to \nprotect our vital interests. The views of Ambassador Albright confirm \nher belief in using troops in this way. While the Armed Services \nCommittee can take steps to provide our forces with the funding they \nneed, there is little we can do to reign in how our troops are being \nused. these essential foreign policy decisions are made by the \nPresident, who is both Chief Executive and Commander in Chief. It is my \nfervent hope that extraordinary caution and wise deliberation will be \nexercised during the next 4 years in determining how to use American \nforces to further the foreign policy goals of this administration.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Madeleine Albright to become our Nation's 64th Secretary of State. I \nhave been privileged to know and work with Ambassador Albright for \nnearly two decades and I am confident that she will be a determined, \neffective voice for American interests as we face the foreign policy \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  This is a historic nomination. With this vote, Madeleine Albright \nwill become the Nation's first woman to hold the office of Secretary of \nState. But it's clear that this nomination was not based on gender--but \non qualifications. Madeleine Albright has been an outstanding leader \nfor America and an outspoken advocate for freedom.\n  Today Madeleine Albright steps out in front and breaks a longstanding \nbarrier. But that's no surprise because she has made a life of doing \njust that. From the time her family broke from the barriers of \ntotalitarianism in Czechoslovakia and the brutal grip of Hitler and \nStalin, Madeleine Albright has dedicated her life to spreading freedom \nand promoting international understanding.\n  She did it as a member of President Carter's National Security \nCouncil, as a noted scholar and professor at Georgetown University, as \nthe president of the Center for National Policy, and--most recently--as \nAmerica's Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\n  As in all her other work, Madeleine Albright brought energy and \nvitality to the job of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. And her \nplain spoken determination helped restore democracy in Haiti, prosecute \nwar criminals in the former Yugoslavia, and make headway in achieving a \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban. She also led the charge to achieve much \nneeded reforms in the United Nations--by advocating lower budgets, more \naccountability, and a streamlined bureaucracy.\n  Madeleine Albright has rightly observed that the United States is the \nworld's indispensable nation. But I would add that she herself has been \nan indispensable part of the foreign policy achievements of the Clinton \nadministration over the past 4 years and she will continue to be in the \nyears to come.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I look forward to working with Secretary \nAlbright on an issue that I have long championed--ending abusive and \nexploitative child labor around the world. I hope that she will use the \noffice of the Secretary of State to focus attention on this deplorable \npractice as she meets with leaders in government and commerce around \nthe world. Working together, I know that we can finally end the curse \nof child labor.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Madeleine Albright is an excellent \nchoice to become our Nation's top diplomat and I am proud to cast my \nvote in support of her nomination.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in supporting the confirmation of Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright to be our Nation's 63d Secretary of State.\n  Many have commented on the historic nature of Ambassador Albright's \nnomination to be the first woman Secretary of State, the highest \nranking of all Cabinet officers. But this would be just one more of a \nlong history of ground-breaking roles in Madeleine Albright's \ndistinguished career.\n  For instance, over the past 4 years, she has been the only woman \nserving as a U.N. Ambassador on the Security Council. In the first \nClinton administration, she was the only woman to serve in a national \nsecurity capacity on the President's Cabinet. She was also the first \nwoman to serve as the top foreign policy advisor to a Presidential \ncandidate, a role she served in 1988 to Gov. Michael Dukakis.\n  Ambassador Albright will bring a superb background to the job of \nSecretary of State. I would note that she began her rise in the foreign \npolicy field as the top foreign affairs advisor to our former \ncolleague, Senator Edmund Muskie when he was a senior member of the \nForeign Relations Committee. Then after serving on the staff of the \nNational Security Council in the Carter administration, she worked for \nover a decade as professor at Georgetown University and in various \ncenters for public policy research.\n  Since 1992, Madeleine Albright has served ably as the U.S. Ambassador \nto the United Nations and has been a formal member of the President's \nCabinet. This is a rare recognition granted to a U.N. Ambassador, and \nshe was the first U.N. Ambassador to serve in this role since \nAmbassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick in the first Reagan administration.\n  At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright became known and respected \nas a fierce defender of American interests and values. She took the \nadministration's lead role 1 year ago in denouncing Cuba's unprovoked \nmurder of two American pilots who were flying unarmed civilian aircraft \nover international waters near Cuba. She emphasized the importance of \nthis outrageous act of cowardice by Fidel Castro's totalitarian \ngovernment with characteristically direct language that helped focus \nthe attention of the world.\n  She also worked diligently--and successfully--in maintaining \ncomprehensive economic sanctions on the repressive regime of Iraqi \nPresident Saddam Hussein. Despite the call by some nations of the world \nto lift those sanctions, she has succeeded in keeping them in place \nuntil the Government of Iraq ends its threats to its neighbors, shows \ngreater respect for the human rights of its own people, and totally \ndismantles all weapons of mass production programs. These actions are \ncalled for not only in a series of Security Council resolutions enacted \nat the end of the 1991 gulf war, but also in obligations Iraq itself \naccepted in the cease fire agreement that ended that war.\n  Most recently, Ambassador Albright insisted on the replacement of \nU.N. Secretary Gen. Boutros Boutros-Ghali because of his inadequate \nattention to necessary reform of the U.N. system. She refused to bow to \npressure from other countries--on the first Security Council vote on \nthis issue the United States was opposed 14 to 1--and insisted on the \nelection of a new reform-minded Secretary General as a matter of \nprinciple. With the recent successful election of the new U.N. \nSecretary Gen. Kofi Annan, there now is an opportunity for revitalizing \nthis important international institution and restoring a bipartisan \nconsensus on the United Nations in the Congress and among the American \npeople.\n\n  As shown in just these few examples, Madeleine Albright is a strong \nadvocate for U.S. foreign policy and is more than willing to take the \ntough and principled stands. It is my hope that she will help to \nrestore American leadership and assertiveness in the international \ncommunity.\n  In addition to her strong qualifications for the job, Madeleine \nAlbright\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nalso brings a compelling personal experience and family background to \nthis job. The daughter of a Czech diplomat, her family came to the \nUnited States as refugees after World War II. In fact, in the preceding \nyears, her family had twice fled the forces of totalitarianism: first \nescaping the advancing armies of Nazi Germany, and again the Iron \nCurtain's descent on her homeland of Czechoslovakia, a country that had \npreviously had the most vibrant economy and democratic system in \ncentral Europe.\n  During her confirmation hearing, Ambassador Albright discussed how \nher parents instilled in her a deep love for the United States and the \nideals upon which our Nation was founded. Others have noted Ambassador \nAlbright's strong views on such questions as human rights, democracy, \nand individual liberty. I have no doubt that her family's experiences \nhave contributed to her evident devotion to these very American ideals.\n  If confirmed by the Senate, Ambassador Albright will become Secretary \nAlbright and will move to a larger stage for the conduct of American \nforeign policy. Under the Clinton administration, the United States has \nbeen searching for a more unified vision and greater consistency in our \nNation's foreign policy with the end of the cold war. A number of \nchallenges will immediately confront her, and I hope and expect that \nshe will be able to rise to these challenges.\n  For example, the international community is watching the rising world \npower of China, but for 4 years the Clinton administration has had \ndifficulty maintaining a consistent foreign policy in relation to this \nincreasingly important country. Tension between the important bilateral \ninterests of human rights, trade, national security, and \nnonproliferation has too often led to confusion and vacillation in our \nNation's policies. It is my hope that Madeleine Albright will rectify \nthis weakness by bringing her temperament of toughness and consistency, \ncombined with her strong grounding in long-term strategic thinking.\n  Another challenge awaits U.S. policy in the critically important \nregion of the Middle East. There is no doubt that recent negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been difficult, \nthough thankfully last week's agreement over the redeployment of \nIsraeli forces in Hebron shows that the peace process remains intact.\n  But over the next 2 years, the negotiations will become even more \nimportant and vastly more challenging. It is in this period that \nnegotiations over a final status for the Palestinian entity are \nsupposed to be reached, and the Palestinians' challenge against Israeli \nsovereignty over Jerusalem must be resolved. Ambassador Albright has \nlong been acknowledged as a very strong friend of Israel. But she also \nhas developed a very constructive working relationship with the \nPalestinian authority. In the world of international diplomacy, it is \nworth noting that two of the earliest congratulations she received for \nher nomination came from Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and \nPalestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yassir Arafat.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor and the privilege to become \npersonally acquainted with Ambassador Albright over the past 4 years \nfrom my position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the \n104th Congress, and as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee during the 103d Congress. While we have occasionally \ndisagreed on policy issues, I have always found Ambassador Albright to \nbe a forceful, effective, and persuasive advocate of administration \npolicies. She has a true skill for explaining the purpose behind \nAmerican foreign policy, and I am certain that she will use that skill \nto advance U.S. interests throughout the world.\n  I would like to again express my support for confirming Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright to be the 63d Secretary of State. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me in approving her nomination for this highest \nof all confirmable executive branch posts.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, while many of my colleagues have already \naddressed vital foreign policy issues during the consideration of \nMadeleine Albright to be the next Secretary of State, I would like to \nuse this opportunity to address some equally vital management issues. I \nhope to use the confirmation process to elevate management issues that \ntend to get swept under the carpet during high-minded policy debates. \nWhen discussing policy goals, we must be careful to determine whether \nthese goals are affordable and that the resources spent provide the \nbest value for the taxpayers' investment.\n  Congress has laid the groundwork for significant Government \nmanagement reforms with the passage of laws such as the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, which requires agencies to measure the \nresults of their efforts, the Chief Financial Officers Act, which \nrequires agencies to shore up their financial recordkeeping, and \nrecently enacted information management and procurement reforms. These \nlaws apply commonsense approaches to the business of government to \nreduce inefficiencies and get real cost savings for taxpayers. It is \nquestionable whether these new laws will be taken seriously and fully \nimplemented without extensive congressional oversight--there are \nreports that agencies do not believe Congress is serious about the \neffective implementation of these laws. I am hereby serving notice that \nthey would be seriously mistaken in that belief.\n  The State Department, which Ambassador Albright will head, has served \nthis country admirably since its founding in 1789. But I wonder if \nThomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, could have imagined \nthat the Department would grow to a staff of approximately 24,500 with \na departmental budget of about $3.9 billion, part of an even larger \n$19.2 billion international affairs budget. Maintaining the \ninfrastructure necessary to support 160 embassies and 100 consulates \nworldwide, costs this nation over $2 billion a year. The Department \nbuys over $500 million in goods and services each year and is \nresponsible for $12 billion in property. Effectively managing these \nresources would be a daunting challenge for any Fortune 500 company, \nbut the State Department must do it at the same time that it is \ncarrying out its primary functions--performing its diplomatic and \nforeign policy missions, protecting and assisting American citizens \ntraveling abroad, and providing the interagency coordination necessary \nfor conducting foreign policy in an increasingly complex and dangerous \nworld.\n  With a multitude of difficult missions to perform, management \nproblems risk being ignored due to the exigencies of the day. The new \nSecretary will no doubt be consumed by critical foreign policy issues \nand crises from Bosnia to Korea that will demand a great deal of her \npersonal attention. However, determining whether taxpayers are getting \nthe best value for their multibillion dollar international affairs \ninvestment also must be one of the Secretary's highest priorities.\n  In times of fiscal austerity, we all have to do more with less. I do \nnot advocate performing critical missions ``on the cheap,'' but we must \nstrive for the most efficient and effective use of our limited \nresources. The Government Performance and Results Act, for example, can \nbe an effective tool to make Government work better by measuring the \nsuccess or failure of Government programs and using this information to \nsupport budget decisions.\n  The effects of belt tightening are painful as is illustrated by the \n$300 million backlog in deferred maintenance, obsolete technology and \nshrinking base of skilled personnel at the Department of State. The \nCongress will no doubt be asked to provide more resources to State and \nin the international affairs budget to counteract some of these \nnegative effects. On first glance, this seemingly makes sense. However, \nthe spending for State Department operating expenses has increased in \nboth actual and constant dollars since 1985. Therefore, I question \nwhether the Department has done all it can. Has it cut to the bone and \nignored the fat in order to generate a compelling case before Congress \nfor more money? I have to say that I don't know, and we will not know \nthe true story from the Department anytime soon because the detailed \nsupporting financial information does not exist.\n  This is because the State Department does not have adequate financial \nand information systems to effectively manage and prioritize its \nprograms. In the information age, the Government is increasingly \ndependent on good information--and yet this is what we are\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\nlacking. We need adequate information upon which to base sound \ndecisions, otherwise we are making decisions in a vacuum. A good first \nstep in developing this information would be for the Department to meet \nits responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act and prepare \nan audited financial statement.\n  Good financial data relies upon the development of effective computer \nsystems. Government computers are crucial to the State Department's \nability to meets its foreign policy missions and business needs. In \nrecent years, the Department has obligated over $300 million annually \non computer systems. Yet, the State Department has had a poor history \nof managing these systems and, as a result, is struggling with aging \ncomputers that do not adequately meet the Department's needs. This has \nresulted in critical information shortfalls, as well as interruption of \noperations. Obviously, the Department needs to do a better job. \nLegislation Congress passed last year to establish a Chief Information \nOfficer at the Department of State should help in focusing attention on \nthis longstanding problem.\n  The Department has yet to change its business practices to reflect \nthe new information age. In September 1994, the State Department \nlaunched a Strategic Management Initiative to identify its highest \npriority functions and products, as well as activities which were no \nlonger necessary. However, GAO states that the State Department ``has \nbeen reluctant or unable to significantly reduce its overseas presence \nand the scope of its activities or to substantially change its business \npractices.'' I would hope in the future that the Department will not \ncontinue to conduct business as usual and then complain it does not \nhave the resources to fulfill its mission.\n  The State Department, like many other Federal agencies, is confronted \nby serious management problems that impede its ability to carry out its \nmission efficiently and effectively. GAO and inspector general reports \nhave shown that in the past, top level attention has not been given to \nthe stewardship of taxpayer resources. I am encouraged by Ambassador \nAlbright's answers to my questions during her confirmation process. She \nassured us that she will be very much a hands-on manager and recognizes \nthat the ability to conduct quality foreign policy depends upon \nattacking directly these management issues. Ambassador Albright stated \nat her confirmation hearing that she would work with Congress ``to \nensure that the American public gets full value for each tax dollar \nspent'' and that she ``is committed to making improvements in the \nDepartment's structure and operations that will produce a more \nefficient and effective use of our resources.'' I am hopeful that \nAmbassador Albright will provide the leadership necessary for the State \nDepartment to meet its management challenges of the next century. I \nlook forward to working with her to achieve those objectives in the \ncoming Congress and to effectively implement the bipartisan management \nreforms passed by Congress.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate votes to confirm the \nnomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State.\n  As many others will say today, this is a historic occasion, as the \nsecretary-designate will soon become the highest ranking woman ever to \nserve in the United States Government. As a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, it was my distinct honor to approve her nomination \nat the committee level on Monday. And I am honored to vote for her \nagain today on the floor of the Senate.\n  Back in the 1980's, I had the pleasure of meeting the distinguished \nnominee in Wausau, in my home state of Wisconsin, while I was a member \nof the Wisconsin State Senate. At the time, I was introduced to her as \nthe future Secretary of State. I have since been impressed at how she \nhas excelled--in domestic politics, as well as in foreign policy--to \nallow her to achieve this great honor, the nomination to be the \nPresident's chief foreign policy adviser.\n  In more recent days, I have observed her both in private, and at her \nconfirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee on January \n8 of this year. And I was again impressed at how articulately and \ngracefully she responded to questions that literally spanned the globe.\n  Upon confirmation, Ambassador Albright will take on a position that, \nin my view, is one of the most challenging positions in public service. \nOn the one hand, she will have a tremendous opportunity to affect world \nevents because of the leadership role that the United States plays in \nso many conflicts around the world. But on the other hand, she will \nhave awesome responsibilities.\n  Just a quick glance at the range and scope of the various bureaus at \nthe State Department remind us that the job of Secretary of State is \nfar-reaching. Not only will she be in charge of all the regional and \nadministrative bureaus, but she will also be responsible for the Bureau \nof Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the Bureau for International \nNarcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the Bureau for International \nOrganization Affairs, Bureau of Oceans and International Scientific \nAffairs and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.\n  This list underscores the fact that many of the problems that \nchallenge us today are ones that belie traditional ways of looking at \nthe world through regional, or even strictly political, lenses. \nIncreasingly, we are faced with issues that transcend national borders \nand fly in the face of old political alliances. Concerns over drug \ntrafficking, refugees, disease, and the environment have changed the \nway we define the national interest.\n  Of particular interest to me is the promotion of human rights \nworldwide. I strongly believe that the United States has a moral \nresponsibility to put human rights at the top of our foreign policy \nagenda. I also believe that--although we might disagree on the manner \nin which we should raise human rights concerns with other governments--\nAmbassador Albright agrees with my basic premise here. In my view, it \nis incumbent upon U.S. diplomats to incorporate our views about human \nrights in bilateral discussions on other issues. For example, we have \nmany interests in Indonesia, but we must never forget that its \ngovernment continues to sustain a brutal military occupation of East \nTimor. Similarly, concerns over human rights abuses in Tibet and over \nthe impending transition in Hong Kong must be pillars of our many-\npronged China policy.\n  Ambassador Albright has, in the past, exhibited superior knowledge of \nhuman rights issues and of these other transnational problems. And, I \nhope she will guide the Administration to propose creative solutions to \nsome of these problems.\n  Of particular regional concern to me is the African continent, \nwhich--too often--is left at the end of the priority lists of \npolicymakers in this country. But Africa--a continent of 48 countries \nsouth of the Sahara--supports a population of nearly 620 million \npeople. Its land mass stretches over one quarter of the Earth's \nsurface.\n  While we often focus upon areas where crises evolve, as in Liberia or \nin the Great Lakes region, we also must actively support some of the \nsuccesses in Africa, such as the stunning transition to majority rule \nin South Africa, Eritrean independence, or the fact that more than 30 \ndemocratic elections have taken place on the continent since 1989. The \nUnited States can play an important role in all these events.\n  Finally, I wish to note that in addition to Ambassador Albright's \nmany qualifications in the field of foreign policy, she also is \nespecially prepared to work with Members of Congress. She spent nearly \n2 years as the chief legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie, \nwho himself went on to be Secretary of State. She understands well the \nintent of the Constitution regarding the separate responsibilities and \nprerogatives of the legislative and executive branches of our \nGovernment. This is of particular concern to me where the deployment of \nAmerican men and women to combat is involved. I trust Ambassador \nAlbright will take the advice and consent role of the Senate seriously, \nand will consult fully with the Congress in all matters of troop \ndeployment.\n  Ambassador Albright never shied away from speaking frankly with us \nand with the American people in her previous capacity as the U.S. \npermanent representative to the United Nations. I look forward to \nfuture open and candid dialog with her on all of these\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nissues, and expect to work closely with her.\n  Mr. President, the job of Secretary of State is indeed a challenging \none. I salute President Clinton for his superb choice, for it is my \nview that this nominee is more-than-qualified to take on the challenges \nof the position under consideration.\n  I also commend the honorable Senator from North Carolina for \nexpediting the confirmation process.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I am honored to cast my vote in favor of \nthe nomination of Madeleine Korbel Albright to be Secretary of State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored today to express my strong \nsupport for Madeleine Albright's nomination to be the next U.S. \nSecretary of State. Long after I leave the United States Senate, I will \nrecall fondly the day I voted to confirm Madeleine Albright as \nSecretary of State; our 63d and first female Secretary of State.\n  Madeleine Albright is a spectacular nominee; I've worked closely with \nher since I came to the Senate, particularly on the 1995 United Nations \nConference on Women. I do speak personally of the great respect she's \nearned from many on Capitol Hill. And I know that same respect has been \nearned in Capitals around the globe throughout her distinguished \ncareer. There will be no on-the-job training for this public servant. \nIn recent times, no Secretary of State has assumed the post with the \nbreadth of experience and bipartisan support that Madeleine Albright \nwill bring to the State Department.\n  Secretary of State is an enormously important job. One of Secretary \nWarren Christopher's final public statements underscores the importance \nof the job performed by the Secretary and the American citizens who \nwork at the State Department and in postings around the world. \nSecretary Christopher, describing his tenure and accomplishments, said, \n``Russia's democracy was in crisis; its economy was near collapse. The \nnuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union was scattered among four new \ncountries with few safeguards. The war in Bosnia was at the peak of its \nbrutality and threatening to spread. North Korea was developing nuclear \nweapons. The Middle East peace process was stalemated; negotiations \nwere stymied. Repression in Haiti was pushing refugees to our shores. \nNAFTA's passage was in serious doubt.'' Certainly, Secretary \nChristopher's tenure was marked by many other difficult issues that met \nvarying degrees of success. My point is to use Secretary Christopher's \nwords to emphasize the enormity and the importance of the task ahead \nfor Madeleine Albright.\n  Madeleine Albright will confront a similar list of issues important \nto our future economic and security interests. China and Asia as a \nwhole have moved to the forefront and many have written that the \nPresident will make this important region of the world a ``legacy \nissue'' for his second term. I certainly support an activist U.S. role \nin Asia; from the Russian Far East which is increasingly linked to my \nState of Washington to South Asia where the threat of nuclear \nescalation will require careful diplomacy. Hong Kong is on the verge of \na return to Chinese sovereignty, and numerous territorial disputes \nthroughout Asia threaten to become military flashpoints. The United \nStates is and must continue to be the stabilizing force in Asia that \nfosters peace and our economic growth in the region. Numerous regional \ngroupings from APEC to the ASEAN Regional Forum will require U.S. \nleadership and vigilance. This region, with more than one-half of the \nworld's population, must be a priority of the new Secretary. And I am \nsure Madeleine Albright will represent the ideals we cherish; the \nideals we share with the world through an activist, engaged foreign \npolicy.\n  Europe and the former Soviet states must also remain a priority \nissue. NATO expansion will be difficult. And international trade issues \nwith the European Community will continue to be difficult as we seek to \ngain greater market access, end subsidized competition in manufacturing \nand agriculture, and continue to press for protection of U.S. \nintellectual property rights. Madeleine Albright, an immigrant from \nPrague, is uniquely qualified to represent U.S. interests in this \nregion of mature and growing political and economic relationships.\n  Latin America is finally emerging from the throes of the cold war. El \nSalvador and Guatemala are continuing on important paths to peace and \nreconciliation. Virtually every Latin American country is now under \nsome form of democracy; the United States must continue to foster this \ndemocratic development and reconciliation. NAFTA expansion to Chile and \nbeyond will require a respected leader to negotiate agreements \nbeneficial to the United States and to educate and understand the \nconcerns of a skeptical public. Again, I believe Madeleine Albright \nwill do a fabulous job for the American people in this region of the \nworld.\n  Problems in Africa continue to go largely unnoticed in our country. \nChildren throughout the world continue to suffer the evils of disease \nand malnutrition. Radical changes may come to Cuba and North Korea in \nthe near future. All of these issues, and many more unforseen events, \nwill require a person like Madeleine Albright.\n  Finally, following her confirmation, I want to urge the new Secretary \nto be a voice for the State Department and its family of employees, \nmany of whom are scattered around the world in service to our country. \nI find it refreshing that Ambassador Albright during her confirmation \nhearing freely talked about the difficulties of conducting foreign \nrelations, on the cheap.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I \nlook forward to working closely with Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Madeleine Albright's \nnomination to take the helm of the U.S. Department of State. I believe \nshe is well qualified and has displayed a unique steadiness and \npragmatism during her tenure as our Ambassador to the United Nations. \nFrom her difficult beginnings and throughout her life, she has proudly \nembraced this country. She has served America with dignity and \npatriotism. In her new position, I hope she will continue to sensibly \npromote our Nation's best interests.\n  All of these qualities are attested to by a very dear friend of mine, \nEdward Gnehm, our former Ambassador to Kuwait. He now serves as Deputy \nAssistant Ambassador under Madeleine Albright at the United Nations. I \nmet Skip Gnehm in 1962, when we began 4 good years together at the \nGeorge Washington University. I have always valued Skip's friendship \nand his insight--particularly in matters of foreign affairs.\n  Skip and I have recently discussed the changing role of the United \nStates in global politics. We agree that, as a nation, we live in a \nrapidly changing part of the 20th century. World politics is no longer \ndominated by the tense United States-Soviet detente that defined United \nStates foreign policy for so many years. Gone is our old familiar \nenemy, the Russian bear, growling on the horizon. But we have also lost \nthe political stability Soviet hegemony provided in the region. No one \nhere would argue for the return of a Communist-controlled Soviet \nempire, but in the wake of glasnost, we are left with a political \nminefield that demands careful attention.\n  Our foreign relations are more fragile than ever and demand \nincreasing precision. The State Department, our eyes and ears abroad, \nis our country's first line of defense. Without an effective and \nsupported foreign service, we will have little capability in combating \ntoday's imminent threats to American lives. Dangers such as \ninternational terrorism and nuclear proliferation among rogue nations \ntruly pose a greater threat to our national security than Russia ever \ndid.\n  In light of these facts, I am discouraged by the increasing trend \ntoward isolationism. We cannot turn our eyes inward and ignore the \nproblems of our neighbors. Like it or not, our world is interconnected, \ninterdependent, and international. Today, we send e-mail on the \ninternet across the globe with the push of a button. A phone call can \nbridge thousands of miles between family and friends. Businesses move \nmoney electronically across borders in the blink of an eye. A drought \nin Kansas can raise the price of bread in Moscow. It is true that \ndomestic peace and prosperity in America are important, but you can't \nsustain peace and prosperity on an island in a global sea of discord.\n  So, I am using this opportunity to speak in support of Madeleine\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nAlbright's nomination, but also to voice my concern about the lack of \ndirection and coordination in our foreign policy. We need to identify \nour goals and be very clear in our message. As the world's only \nsuperpower, we cannot stand around watching--simply reacting to random \nglobal events.\n  I believe Ambassador Albright has demonstrated her exceptional \nabilities as a diplomat and in offering thoughtful counsel to our \nPresident. I would now encourage her to utilize her proven diplomatic \nskills and her new high-profile job to bring some change in the \nPresident's Cabinet room. We need to introduce strategic planning into \nour foreign policy and she is the person to do it. With well-defined \ngoals, a properly managed administration and a little enthusiasm, our \nState Department and Foreign Service could again receive the respect \nthey deserve--both at home and abroad.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] asked me to submit his statement in support of Madeleine \nAlbright for Secretary of State. He is necessarily absent for the vote \ntoday because of responsibilities he has in leading a trade mission \nfrom his State of West Virginia to Asia. He regrets not being here to \ncast his own vote for Ms. Albright, and asks that his enthusiastic \nsupport for this outstanding individual be noted.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am submitting this statement \nto express my strongest support for the nomination of Madeleine Korbel \nAlbright to be the Secretary of State of the United States of America. \nUnfortunately, I am necessarily absent from the Senate, and am unable \nto cast my vote for Ms. Albright. Because of plans that had to be \nscheduled long ago, I am presently leading a group of more than 30 West \nVirginians on a trade mission to Japan and Taiwan that is called \nProject Harvest II.\n  This trade mission, the second I have led to Asia, is vitally \nimportant to the long-term economic vitality of my State. Since the \nfirst Project Harvest Trade mission in 1995, tens of millions of \ndollars in contracts, and many new jobs have flowed back to West \nVirginia. That first trip also served as a key step in bringing \ncompanies like Sino-Swearingen and Toyota to West Virginia--\ninternational investments that have changed the face of West Virginia's \nmanufacturing profile.\n  The globalization of the economy is the greatest force shaping \ninternational relations in the last years of the millennium, and the \nkinds of relationships that West Virginia is developing around the \nworld are a key unifying factor in this new world order. Trade missions \nlike Project Harvest can be an extension of America's international \ninterest in fostering peace, stability, and prosperity across the \nglobe.\n  I personally regret, however, that I am missing a chance to vote on \nthe nomination of Madeleine Albright. Mr. President, I don't think \nPresident Clinton could have made a wiser choice in selecting Madeleine \nAlbright for this central post in his administration. I have known \nMadeleine Albright for many years, and have rarely seen such a \ncombination of intelligence, skill, experience, principle, values, and, \nMr. President, patriotism, in all my days.\n  Madeleine Albright brings all these things to the service of her \nadopted nation. A daughter of Central European strife, she has a unique \nworld view that brings into clear focus some of the most difficult and \ncompelling challenges we face as the world's last true military and \neconomic superpower.\n  Of course the world today is a remarkably different place than the \none we faced 50 years ago, 15 years ago, and even 5 years ago. I am \nfurther struck by the fact that we are defining this time by what it is \nnot, that is the cold war--rather than by what it is--a transition time \nin the world's history where one historic power, Europe, is struggling \nto define itself; and another, China, is struggling to assert its place \nin the world. It is into this breach that Madeleine Albright has been \ntasked to define and promote America's global interests.\n  Traditionally, American foreign policy has had Europe and the \nAtlantic as its focal point. While we must continue making Europe a \npriority, we also see Asia growing in importance in economic, military, \nand other terms. This means that geographically, strategically, and \neconomically, the United States sits astride both worlds.\n  Because of my own long-time involvement in United States-Japan \nrelations and Asia issues generally, I want to voice my confidence that \nSecretary of State Albright will provide the needed leadership, \ninsight, and attention to the Pacific region in her role as the Clinton \nAdministration's chief of international diplomacy and as a key part of \nhis national security team. She understands the challenges we face \ntogether as Pacific neighbors; she appreciates the differences and \ncomplexities that are presented; and she will be a clear and forceful \nadvocate for America's peaceable interests and the goals we share with \nour allies and the people of nations worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Madeleine Albright is a superb choice \nfor Secretary of State. I ask her forgiveness that I am unable to stand \nand vote for her today, and I pledge to work with her in every way \npossible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to support the nomination of \nMadeleine K. Albright for Secretary of State. Ambassador Albright is \nextremely well-qualified for this important post and will make a \ntremendous leader of the Clinton administration's foreign policy team.\n  This nomination is truly historic. Ambassador Albright is the first \nwoman ever nominated to be Secretary of State. She will not only become \nthe most senior female appointee in this administration, but the \nhighest ranking in the history of the United States. I am so very proud \nthat today Madeleine Albright is shattering a glass ceiling that many \nthought would never be broken.\n  Ambassador Albright will also be the first refugee to hold this \nimportant post. Having fled totalitarianism herself, Ambassador \nAlbright is especially sensitive to the needs of newly emerging \ndemocracies. She is a beacon of hope to the hundreds of millions of \npeople around the world who have recently shed the shackles of \nauthoritarian government.\n  Over the last 20 years, Ambassador Albright has worked tirelessly to \npromote a safer, more stable world. After working as a foreign policy \nadvisor to the late Senator Edmund Muskie, she taught foreign policy at \nGeorgetown University's School of Foreign Service. As U.S. Ambassador \nto the United Nations, she earned a reputation for toughness, fairness, \nand the tireless advocacy of American interests.\n  Madeleine Albright is a diplomat, scholar, and a role model for the \nNation's young people--especially our young women. I am confident that \nshe will make an excellent Secretary of State and I proudly support her \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who seeks recognition? Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I ask for a minute and a half?\n  Mr. HELMS. If you want, more than that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for a \nminute and a half--5 minutes. The Senator from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend first the distinguished chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee for the manner in which he expedited \nthe hearing on this very important, most senior of our Cabinet \npositions.\n  Also, I wish to commend the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. Our committee just completed its hearing on Senator \nCohen, and we anticipate that today the Senate is likely to turn to \nthat nomination also for a vote.\n  So that under the leadership of the majority leader, with the \ncooperation of the distinguished Democratic leader and the chairmen, we \nhave, I think in record time, accomplished the very careful and \nthorough screening of two Cabinet posts and providing the President \nwith that advice which he needs.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing the distinguished Ambassador, the \nnominee for the post of Secretary of State, for many years. Ambassador\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nAlbright has come before the Senate Armed Services Committee, over the \n18 years I have been privileged to serve on that committee, on a number \nof occasions as an expert witness, which is a difficult role to carry \nout. But she has always done it in a very careful and well-informed \nmanner. Early on, she gained the respect and admiration of both sides \non our committee, as she worked her way up through a number of \nimportant posts before going to the United Nations as our Ambassador. \nAnd now I think the President is to be commended in selecting her for \nthis assignment, which I anticipate she will discharge with equal if \nnot greater wisdom and skill than her previous assignments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest we let a quorum call be charged \nequally.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just a moment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there time left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 19 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Are we going to vote, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope we will agree to vote as quickly \nas possible, but I do want to say that I welcome this nomination. \nMadeleine Albright at the United Nations as our Ambassador helped to \nmake the world realize how important it is we conserve the oceans. She \nassisted in many ways with those of us who are trying to really protect \nthe oceans. I welcome her coming to the Department of State now where I \nthink she can carry on the same fight and help us really deal with the \noverwhelming problem of assuring that the oceans of the world continue \nto produce the food that mankind needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no time is yielded, time \nwill be charged to both sides.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to complete the \ndebate on the nominee to be Secretary of State.\n  I commend the committee members for the way they have handled this \nmatter. Obviously, it was expeditious and a very pleasant experience. I \nthank the chairman for the way he has handled it. If he says the \nnominee is OK, that is very powerful in this institution. I thank the \nSenator from Delaware for his efforts also.\n  Mr. President, today is a historic day for the Senate, for the \nDepartment of State, and for the United States. Today, we will confirm \nAmerica's 63d Secretary of State. Madeline Albright will be the first \nwoman to hold our country's highest diplomatic post.\n  Most of our Members are aware of Ambassador Albright' compelling \npersonal history. As a child, she was forced to flee her native \nCzechoslovakia from the century's two great tyrannies: Nazi Germany and \nSoviet Communism. First-hand, she learned that freedom is not free, and \nthat resistance to aggression is imperative.\n  Ambassador Albright is an American by choice. She has served her \nadopted land with distinction--at the National Security Council in the \nCarter administration, in politics and in the academic world, and most \nrecently as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  When I met with Ambassador Albright last week, we had a good \ndiscussion about a range of issues. I expressed my concern over the \ngradual decline of the role of Congress in foreign policy--at least \nthat is the way Congress is sometimes treated by administrations--a \ntrend that is not in keeping with my reading of what the framers of the \nConstitution intended.\n  Ambassador Albright told me she taught a course on ``Congress and \nForeign Policy'' and that she very much understands and respects the \nrole of the Congress in our power of the purse, our sole power to \ndeclare war, and the Senate's co-equal role in treaty making.\n  As secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will face many difficult \nissues. Perhaps her greatest challenge will be articulating a vision of \nAmerica's role in the post-cold-war era--a vision that is readily \nunderstood and supported by the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Our leadership role in the world depends on the power of our ideals \nand the purpose to defend our interests. And it depends on the support \nof our citizens for a leadership role. I believe the American people \nknow America must remain engaged in the world, and that they will be \nwilling to support our engagement because it is ultimately to the \nbenefit of each and every American.\n  In just the coming months, Ambassador Albright will have a very full \nagenda--on Capitol Hill and around the world. There are continued \nconcerns about Russia's future, the threats posed by rogue regimes from \nIran and Iraq to Libya and North Korea, the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction, terrorism, international crime, and narcotics trafficking, \nthe United States relationship with Asia's emerging giant--China, \npursuit of a lasting and secure peace in the Middle East, and serious \nattention to the problems and potential of our own hemisphere.\n  Each of these will demand a very experienced and committed Secretary \nof State. The Ambassador's skills and wisdom will be challenged every \nday.\n  Secretary Albright, assuming she is going to be confirmed here \nmomentarily, will also need to spend much more time with the Congress. \nWe have pledged to do what we can to move America ahead in a \nnonpartisan or bipartisan fashion. We will try to work together on arms \ncontrol issues. We expect the administration to respect the Senate's \nrole in providing advice and consent to the significant modifications \nthey propose to the 1972 ABM Treaty.\n  The administration has tried to make a case for more money for the \nUnited Nations and for international affairs spending in general. I do \nnot believe in measuring American leadership by how many taxpayer \ndollars we send to the United Nations or to AID contractors--especially \nwhen our defense and intelligence capabilities have felt the impact of \nfar more severe budget limitations.\n  We are also awaiting the administration's request for funding their \ndecision to extend the American troop presence despite the promise of a \n1-year only deployment in Bosnia. On all budget issues, we will try to \nwork together on funding the administration's priorities and our \npriorities in a manner consistent with the move toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  I expect to work closely with Secretary Albright to prepare the \nSenate and the American people for the historic expansion of the most \nsuccessful alliance in history--NATO. We will work to support the \nhistoric progress toward peace in the Middle East, made possible \nbecause the enemies of Israel know that American support for our \ndemocratic ally is unswerving.\n  Today, with what I expect will be an overwhelming vote, the Senate \nwill confirm Madeline Albright as Secretary of State. The confirmation \nprocess moved rapidly and cooperatively, and I think it is indicative \nof what we can do in the months and years ahead.\n  I want to offer my congratulations to Secretary-to-be Albright, her \nfamily and her friends on this historic occasion. I believe President \nClinton made a sound choice, and I believe Secretary Albright will \nserve America honorably.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have been asked to yield back time on \nboth sides. I believe we are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Madeleine \nKorbel Albright, of the District of Columbia, to be Secretary of State? \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, so far, January has been quite a month for \nour highly esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia. \nOn January 8, Senator Robert C. Byrd observed the 50th anniversary of \nthe day he entered public service as a member of the West Virginia \nHouse of Delegates.\n  To commemorate this significant event, Senator Byrd returned to the \nWest Virginia State capitol on January 11 to join hundreds of grateful \nWest Virginians and other friends in the unveiling of a bronze statue.\n  This likeness of Senator Byrd, prominently placed in the capitol's \nrotunda, will serve to remind future generations of his service to his \nState and to his country.\n  Just 2 days after the Charleston, WV, ceremony, Robert Byrd achieved \nanother major distinction. On January 13, 1997, he became the fourth \nlongest serving U.S. Senator in the history of our republic, with a \nservice record of 38 years and 10 days.\n  Think of it, Mr. President. Of the 1,843 past and present senators, \nonly three have served longer than Robert C. Byrd. In another 3 years, \nSenator Byrd will exceed the 41-year service record of my immediate \npredecessor from Mississippi, John C. Stennis.\n  After that, Senator Byrd's only challengers will be the current \nrecord holder, Carl Hayden of Arizona--41 years and 10 months, and the \ncurrent second longest serving member, our highly regarded colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Strom Thurmond.\n  I shall have more to say about Senator Thurmond in May of this year, \nwhen he breaks Senator Hayden's record.\n  Each of us in this body, from the most junior to the most seasoned, \nwould do well to pay close attention to Robert C. Byrd--a man of great \nhistorical knowledge. When Robert C. Byrd speaks about the role of the \nSenate in American Government, he deserves our most careful attention.\n  On behalf of all Senators, I commend Senator Byrd for his long \nservice to our country.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S617-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 21, \nsubmitted earlier today by myself and Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 21) to direct the Senate legal \n     counsel to appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate \n     in Sen. Robert C. Byrd, et al. v. Franklin D. Raines, et al.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the resolution directs the Senate legal \ncounsel to appear as amicus curiae, as friend of the court, in the name \nof the Senate in a case pending in the United States District Court for \nthe District of Columbia, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, on April 9, 1996, President Clinton signed into law \nthe Line Item Veto Act. This act was the product of years of \nlegislative consideration and much protracted debate.\n  Beginning January 1 of this year and through the year 2004, the Line \nItem Veto Act provides the President with the authority, under a set of \ncarefully circumscribed limitations, to cancel particular items of \nappropriation, direct spending or limited tax benefit in any bill.\n  The President must report any such cancellation to Congress by \nspecial message within 5 days after his approval of the bill containing \nsuch spending or tax provisions. Congress then has the opportunity to \ndecide whether to pass a law disapproving the President's cancellation \nand mandating the spending or tax benefit.\n  As I have stated, this Act was passed after much consideration and \ndebate understanding the potential Constitutional implications. In the \nend, Congress determined to empower the President in this manner in \nrecognition of the fact that strong tools are necessary if we are to \nachieve our goal of finally getting the Federal budget in balance.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, and three other of our colleagues, the former senior Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Hatfield, the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and \nthe senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, joined by two Members \nof the House of Representatives, have filed an action in the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the \nconstitutionality of the act. They assert in their lawsuit that the act \nviolates the lawmaking provisions of article I of the Constitution by \nauthorizing the President to nullify the effect of portions of recently \nenacted laws.\n  The lawsuit at issue was commenced pursuant to a special judicial \nreview provision, section 3 of the act, authorizing the filing of an \naction by any Member of Congress to seek declaratory or injunctive \nrelief on the ground that the act violates the Constitution.\n  This judicial review provision also gives each House of Congress the \nright to intervene in the suit in defense of the act. Further, the law \nprovides for direct appeal from any decision of the district court to \nthe Supreme Court and requires both courts to expedite their handling \nof the action.\n  The Department of Justice will represent the defendants in the \nlawsuit, namely the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. As such, there appears to be no need for \nthe Senate to intervene formally in the suit as a party defendant.\n  Nonetheless, title VII of the Ethics in Government Act authorizes the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nto appear as amicus curiae, or friend of the court, in this or any such \nlegal action in which the powers and responsibilities of the Congress \nunder the Constitution are placed in issue.\n  Mr. President, appearance as amicus curiae in this lawsuit would \nenable the Senate to present to the court its reasons for enacting the \nLine Item Veto Act and the basis for its position that the law is \nconsistent with the Constitution.\n  This resolution I offer today will authorize the Senate legal counsel \nto appear in this case in the name of the Senate as amicus curiae to \nsupport the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.\n  The Senate, through the Senate legal counsel, would not take any \nposition on the other issues, such as those related to the \nconstitutional standing of the plaintiffs in the suit to bring the \naction, and the timeliness, or ripeness, of the issues before the \ncourt, that may be considered by the court in the case as such issues \nare not covered by the explicit terms of the resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution \nthat is before the Senate.\n  This resolution directs the Senate legal counsel to appear in the \nname of the Senate to defend the constitutionality of the Line Item \nVeto Act, Public Law No. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996). While both the \nLine Item Veto Act and the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 provide \nauthority for the Senate to intervene or appear as amicus curiae in \nlegal proceedings, the adoption of a resolution by the Senate is \nnecessary in order to activate participation by legal counsel. By \nadopting this resolution, we will ensure that the Senate is fully \nrepresented in the case of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, et al. versus Franklin \nD. Raines, et al., which is pending in the U.S. District Court.\n  The case that has been filed by Senator Byrd, former Senator \nHatfield, Senator Levin, Senator Moynihan, Representative Skaggs, and \nRepresentative Waxman challenges the constitutionality of the Line Item \nVeto Act on the grounds that it violates article I of the Constitution. \nI firmly believe that their assertion is false and that the Line Item \nVeto Act which was passed last year by an overwhelming vote of 69 to 31 \nis constitutional.\n  The act passed last year was very carefully drafted to ensure \nconstitutionality. While I would not presume to tell the court how they \nshould rule on this case, I am confident that the Senate legal counsel \nwill present a very compelling argument that proves that Congress does \nhave the authority to delegate this very limited and strictly defined \npower to the President.\n  Our $5 trillion debt, our voracity for spending and our lack of \npolitical courage to cut spending led Congress to pass the Line Item \nVeto Act. Finally, Members of Congress will be forced to defend their \npork barrel spending projects publicly. I am hopeful, although not \nconvinced, that the mere threat of a Presidential veto will cause \nMembers of Congress to rethink putting special interest items in \nappropriations bills like aquaculture centers to study shrimp in \nlandlocked Arizona, bicycle paths, and millions of dollars for pony \ntrekking facilities in Ireland. The time has come to force Congress and \nthe President to take responsibility for how we are spending taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  The purpose of the line-item veto is to reduce the deficit by \nallowing the President to cancel wasteful Congressional spending. Prior \nto passage of this important Government reform tool, it was easy for \nMembers to slip projects into large appropriations bills or tax bills \nand not have to be accountable for wasting taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars. When these large bills came to the President, often on a \ndeadline, his hands were tied, leaving him with a take-it-or-leave-it \ndecision on the entire bill. In essence, the old system allowed both \nMembers of Congress and the President the ability to blame each other \nand point fingers without accepting responsibility for these ridiculous \nprojects.\n\n  The court challenge launched by a few Members of Congress is simply \nan effort to continue their battle to preserve the status quo budget \nprocess--a budget process that favors seniority and the Appropriations \nCommittee, and one that allows Members to hide wasteful and parochial \nspending projects in large appropriations bills that previously the \nPresident was forced to sign or reject in total. Some of these members \nsupport the current process because they directly benefit from it. Last \nSeptember, the Portland Oregonian reported that since 1980, former \nSenator Hatfield sent $3.2 billion home to Oregon. It is simply not \nfair to allow a disproportionate share of taxpayer dollars to be \ndistributed on the basis of position or committee assignment.\n  The Line Item Veto Act ends this practice of unaccountable spending \nby allowing the President to use an enhanced rescission process that \nbuilds on the President's current authority under the Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974. It strengthens the existing rescission authority \nby placing the onus on Congress to overturn the President's rescissions \nrather than waiting for Congress to act on rescissions that the \nPresident recommends.\n  History shows the current rescission process simply does not work \nbecause it is too easy for Congress to deliberately fail to act. Since \n1974 only $23.7 billion of the $74 billion in rescissions proposed by \nPresidents have been adopted. That is just 32 percent--not a very good \nbatting record. It was, after all, our frustration with the current \nprocess and the Congress' insatiable appetite for spending that led \nCongress to cede this limited authority to the President.\n  Our opponents will attempt to persuade the courts that we have \nabdicated our constitutional powers by delegating to the President \npowers that we do not have authority to delegate. There is strong \nhistorical evidence in tax and tariff law that proves Congress can \ndelegate this kind of power to the President. The delegation of power \nis narrowly defined and limited to canceling dollar amounts of \ndiscretionary budget authority in an appropriation law, new items of \ndirect spending, or limited tax benefits for the sole purpose of \ndeficit reduction. The statute outlines strict prescriptions for how \nthe President must use this authority and gives Congress an opportunity \nto overturn the President's cancellation under expedited procedures. \nAll of these limitations on the President's use of this power ensure \nthe constitutionality of this process change.\n  Despite what the plaintiffs in this case may lead you to believe, I \nhave found nothing in the Constitution that requires the President to \nspend every dollar that Congress appropriates. Our opponents would like \nto equate preserving Congress' autonomy to spend taxpayers money with \nprotecting the delicate balance of power of our government. Actually \nthese big spenders are trying to cling to power that has been unfairly \ntipped in their favor. Since Congress usurped the President's power to \nimpound funds in 1974, it has been Congress that has upset the delicate \nbalance of power in our government system.\n\n  Congress' power has been even further expanded by the evolution of a \nbudget process that results in huge appropriations bills, omnibus tax \nand reconciliation measures as well as passage of continuing \nresolutions at the last minute just before the fiscal year ends. In \naddition, this process of passing enormous bills has substantially \nundercut the current veto power to challenge wasteful spending \nmeasures. I doubt our founding fathers could have ever envisioned \nfathomed legislation totaling hundreds of pages. In their day, an \nappropriations bill was one page--giving the President a relatively \neasy choice.\n  The line item veto finally puts the President on a level playing \nfield with the Congress by giving the President a necessary tool to \ngovern responsibly in light of the how the legislative process has \nevolved. For over 25 years it has actually been Congress that has \nquietly undermined our system of checks and balances. Passage of the \nline item veto was necessary to restore an equilibrium between the \nexecutive and legislative branch.\n  The line item veto in no way alters or violates any of the principles \nof the Constitution. It preserves wholly the right of the Congress to \ncontrol our Nation's purse strings--a trust I might add the Congress \nhas often violated. The law as crafted does nothing more than embrace \nthe Constitutional tenet to give the President functional veto power. I \nam confident that the court will look at this new authority in light\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nof the historical evidence and court precedent and find that it is \nfully constitutional.\n  I do not believe it is necessary to engage in a lengthy discussion \nabout the line item veto since the Senate has already debated this \nsubject vigorously and I believe the record speaks for itself. I would, \nhowever, like to remind the Senate that two former solicitors general--\none Democrat and one Republican--testified before Congress that the law \nis fully constitutional. The American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service reviewed the law and asserted ``nothing in delegation \ndoctrine suggests that Congress may not delegate powers . . .'' And the \nJustice Department reviewed the legislation before the President signed \nthe bill and determined it was constitutional.\n  In closing, let me say, I look forward to working with the President \nto help him identify spending and tax provisions that he should cancel. \nI hope that President Clinton has the political courage to exercise \nthis authotity diligently and will not bow to the prolific spenders in \nCongress, thus squandering this historic opportunity. The American \npeople have waited for this for over 120 years. Let us not disappoint \nthem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  Before the Chair's ruling, for the information of all Senators, this \nis a resolution that allows the Senate legal counsel to file a brief on \nbehalf of the Senate with regard to support for the line-item veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just one bit of clarification. We had \nhoped to have a full discussion of support for Senator Cohen on \nThursday. But we do have the wake and funeral of our former colleague, \nSenator Tsongas. We are trying to accommodate Senators who need to \nleave this afternoon to go up to Massachusetts for the wake and for \nother commitments that were made tonight. We needed to go ahead and get \nthis done today because Senators would not get back until late tomorrow \nafternoon. I apologize to Senators who may not have as much time as \nthey wanted. I encourage those Senators to stay after the vote to speak \non this, if they wish.\n  So for the information of all Senators, another vote is expected on \nthe confirmation of our former colleague, Senator Cohen, at \napproximately 3:25 p.m. today.\n  Following that confirmation vote, there will be an additional period \nfor morning business in which to introduce bills and make statements. \nHowever, there will be no further rollcall votes today. The next \nopportunity the Senate will have for votes, at this point, looks like \nTuesday of next week. But we will further confirm that when we do our \nclosing statement later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, for taking up the nomination of our former \nColleague Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. As all \nSenators know, Secretary Perry, who has ably led the Department of \nDefense for the past 3 years, has departed. It is therefore essential \nthat we fill the position of Secretary of Defense as quickly as \npossible.\n  The Armed Services Committee met this afternoon in an executive \nsession and unanimously voted to recommend the confirmation of Senator \nCohen as the 20th Secretary of Defense. Senator Cohen is well known by \nall Members of the Senate for his distinguished 18 years of service in \nthe Senate representing the people of Maine. Each of us is aware of his \ncharacter, ability, and dedication to providing unquestioned support \nfor our men and women in uniform. Senator Cohen has repeatedly \ndemonstrated a vision for how the United States must meet its defense \nneeds. I believe that as the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen will \ncontinue to demonstrate the strong independent characteristics of New \nEngland gentlemen and will lead the Clinton administration to provide \nadequately for the security of the Nation and those who serve in our \nArmed Forces.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I urge \nthe Senate to confirm William S. Cohen, a dedicated public servant, as \nthe next Secretary of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee in supporting the nomination of our former \ncolleague, Senator Bill Cohen, to be Secretary of Defense.\n  I want to commend President Clinton for his willingness to reach \nacross party lines to select a creative and independent thinker like \nSenator Cohen to serve as his Secretary of Defense. With this \nappointment, the President has shown his commitment to a bipartisan \nforeign policy and a strong national defense. He has selected someone \nwho has very strong feelings about the role of Congress in making \nnational security and foreign policy, and on the need for close \nconsultation between the President and Congress in this area. I hope \nthat Congress will reciprocate by working closely and constructively \nwith the President and his new Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I come from a State that was represented in the Senate \nfor 23 years by Senator Arthur Vandenberg, who perhaps more than any \nother Senator in history stands for bipartisanship in national security \nand foreign policy. I also sit on the Armed Services Committee where \nSenator Cohen, for 18 years, served with me and displayed to me over \nand over and over again, as he did to all of our colleagues during this \nperiod, his instinct to be a true American patriot--not a Republican, \nnot a partisan, but a patriot when it comes to American security and \nforeign policy issues. I look forward to working with him in his new \ncapacity to continue that tradition.\n\n  Senator Cohen's experience in the Senate should serve him well as he \nmoves on to his new position. In his capacity as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Cohen has been a leader in virtually every \nmajor\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\nnational security debate in the Congress for the past two decades. He \nwas a forceful advocate for improving the quality--and the quality of \nlife--of the All Volunteer Force in the late 1970's. He played a key \nrole in the Armed Services Committee in drafting and passing the \nlandmark Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act in \nthe mid-1980's, as well as the legislation that strengthened our \nSpecial Operations Forces. He has been an innovative thinker in the \narea of arms control, and he helped force a bipartisan compromise on \nantiballistic missile policy in the last Congress.\n  Senator Cohen has also shown his ability to work in a constructive \nmanner across party lines on the Governmental Affairs Committee, where \nhe and I served on the same subcommittee for 18 years, alternating as \nchairman and ranking minority members. We worked together on all of the \nrecent acquisition reform legislation, including the Competition in \nContracting Act, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, and the \nInformation Technology Management Reform Act. We cooperated on \noversight hearings that led to significant savings in defense \ninventory, the purchase of commercial items, and DOD travel costs --\neverything from the purchase of commercial items--where we worked \nclosely together to make sure we buy more commercial items, to DOD \ntravel costs--where we worked to try to reduce the administrative costs \nassociated with DOD.\n\n  Outside the defense arena, we worked side-by-side on the Senate floor \nto enact the Independent Counsel Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, \nand the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  The Department of Defense and the Nation are fortunate to have been \nserved by a long line of capable and effective Secretaries of Defense. \nI look forward to working with Senator Cohen to help him continue that \ntradition of effective leadership, and I am confident that my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle share this view.\n  Mr. President, at this morning's hearing of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I shared with Senator Cohen my experience from a visit that \nI recently made to Bosnia with Senator Jack Reed, during which we met \nwith our military personnel--the men and women of our Armed Forces \nserving there--and our leadership, as well as the governmental \nleadership inside Bosnia and Serbia.\n  We met with the three Presidents and two Prime Ministers of Bosnia \nand Hercegovina, with General Crouch, the Stabilization Force or SFOR \nCommander, and the United States and French sector commanders and \ntroops, the Dayton Agreement High Representative Carl Bildt, and United \nStates Embassy personnel.\n  As a result of these meetings, I have reached a conclusion, which I \nshared with Senator Cohen this morning, that two things are going to be \ntrue relative to Bosnia. One, that we are going to need some kind of an \noutside force at the end of the 18-month period which is currently the \nmission length in Bosnia. For a number of reasons, in my judgment, \nthere is no way that the current so-called stabilization force can \nleave Bosnia at the end of 18 months with any other result but that the \nsame situation will return to Bosnia as previously existed there.\n  Conclusion No. 1: There will need to be some form of an outside armed \nforce to help maintain the stabilized situation which we are now \ncreating in Bosnia.\n  But, No. 2, we should not have our ground forces in Bosnia at the end \nof 18 months. Europe should take a greater responsibility, and there is \na new development inside of NATO which makes that a possibility.\n  There is a new development inside of NATO which is very fortuitous, \nwhich makes it possible for Europe to take over the leadership of any \nfollow-on force after 18 months. That fortuitous development is that \nNATO is developing a European security and defense identity within the \nalliance which will permit European NATO nations, with NATO consent, to \ncarry out operations under the political control and strategic \ndirection of the western European Union, using NATO assets and NATO \ncapabilities. That European initiative inside of NATO is the \nappropriate follow-on force after this 18-month period is over, should \na follow-on force be necessary. In my judgment, at least, it will be.\n  I was pleased that Senator Cohen shared my view that U.S. combat \nforces should not remain on the ground in Bosnia for more than 18 more \nmonths, and that he shared my optimism that it was at least possible \nthat this new European security and defense initiative would be the \nright follow-on force in Bosnia should an outside armed force continue \nto be necessary.\n  Although Senator Cohen has served on the Armed Services Committee for \nthe past 18 years, the committee carried out the same thorough review \nof this nomination that we do for all nominations that come before the \ncommittee. We carefully reviewed his financial disclosure and his \nresponses to the standard committee questionnaire. In late December, \nthe committee submitted an extensive set of policy questions to Senator \nCohen. His written answers were made available to all committee members \nand are part of the committee's written record of this nomination. \nEarlier today, the committee conducted a lengthy hearing with the \nnominee and examined his views on the full range of national security \nissues facing the United States.\n  Mr. President, based on the committee's review of this nomination, \nand based on my own experience working with Senator Cohen over the past \n18 years, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time do I have on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 18 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the able \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Snowe is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for yielding me this time this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on \nthe confirmation of America's next Secretary of Defense.\n  This is, of course, a position of tremendous importance and \nresponsibility--particularly as we look toward a new millennium and the \nnational security challenges that it will present. These challenges \nwill be many: restructuring our forces, modernizing our defense, \nreconciling our defense needs with the realities of our budget, our \nongoing interests in the Mideast and Bosnia, and the potential for \nother conflicts yet unknown. And as always, the world will be looking \nto us--the greatest democracy on Earth--for strong and just leadership.\n  So the individual who will hold this office must be of the highest \nmoral and intellectual fiber. This is why I am pleased and honored to \nrise today in strong support of the nomination of William S. Cohen to \nbe our next Secretary of Defense.\n  While there are now Senators in this Chamber who have never served \nwith Bill, I feel confident in saying that every one of them is \nnonetheless familiar with his contributions to this institution.\n  And yet, as we approach the time when we will confirm Bill Cohen as \nSecretary of Defense, I feel compelled to share with you my thoughts \nabout Bill as a person, as a Senator, and as a leader.\n  It seemed just yesterday that I stood on this very floor to pay \ntribute and respect to a friend and colleague who was bidding farewell \nto the institution he had served so well for 18 years. I talked about \nBill Cohen the man, and how he helped perpetuate the Senate's claim as \nthe greatest deliberative body on Earth. And I talked about how he made \nMaine and the Nation proud. Little did I know--but little am I \nsurprised--that I would soon stand before you speaking of how the \ncountry has lost a Senator but soon will gain an outstanding Secretary \nof Defense.\n  It has been said that the world is divided into those who want to \nbecome someone, and those who want to accomplish something. The irony \nis that in setting out to accomplish something, Bill Cohen has also \nbecome someone--someone we admire, someone we respect, and someone who \ncan be entrusted with one of the toughest and most demanding jobs in \nthe world.\n  Like the historic Maine lighthouses that dot Maine's coastline, \nBill's\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nrecord has been a beacon of light. His vision and resolve stood fast \nagainst the buffeting winds of political change. In a volatile and \nstormy climate, Bill Cohen and his rich experience in public service \nhelped guide us to calmer waters. But while skillful in getting things \ndone, politics is not what moves Bill. Principles and ideas are what \nBill Cohen is really about.\n  That's why Bill became the standard-bearer for modern Maine politics \nfrom his first days in public service.\n  Born and raised in Bangor, where his parents ran a bakery, he \ngraduated from Bowdoin College and from Boston University Law School 3 \nyears later. After practicing law in Bangor for several years, Bill was \nelected to the Bangor City Council in 1969 and then served as mayor of \nBangor. It was clear early on that he would have a distinguished career \nin public service.\n  In 1972, he was elected to the House from Maine's Second \nCongressional District and faced the toughest challenge of his \nfledgling tenure in Congress.\n  In the stormy sea of the Watergate scandal, while America was \nsuffering a crisis of confidence, Bill Cohen charted a course straight \nthrough the heart of the storm as a member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, which was considering Articles of Impeachment against a \nPresident of the United States. A freshman, Bill was already a man of \nconscience and courage--someone who was willing to make the tough calls \nand risk his political future for the sake of truth and America's \nhonor. And these values ultimately launched him here--to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Back in our home State of Maine, people believe the ultimate measure \nof a person is how close they remain to their principles precisely when \nit is most difficult to do so.\n  It is a tradition that Margaret Chase Smith and Edmund Muskie \nfollowed in their personal and political lives and consistent with the \nideals of Maine. Bill Cohen followed in their footsteps.\n  Throughout Bill's career, Maine and America have come to know that \nthey can count on Bill to approach issues with thoughtfulness and \nreason. And Senators on both sides of the aisle developed a tremendous \nrespect for the virtues Bill brought to this body because, above all, \nBill Cohen voted his mind and his conscience. And that is what \nAmericans want in their leaders. He has the intellect, the integrity, \nand the strength to know the right thing to do and the right way to do \nit. And he is a leader who believes in his solemn responsibility not \nsimply to echo conventional wisdom but to seriously deliberate on the \nissues of the day.\n  This is the kind of person we need at the helm of the most powerful \ndefense force in world history. We need someone with a firm grasp of \nhistory and a solid vision for the future, someone with both experience \nand a track record that engenders unflagging trust. Mr. President, Bill \nCohen is such a person.\n  The defense of our Nation is one of the most sacred responsibilities \nof the Federal Government. ``Life, liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness'' is a meaningless concept unless we have the desire and the \nability to defend those rights against those who would subvert them. We \nentrust the person who oversees our Armed Forces with nothing less than \nthe defense of the Constitution and the greatest democracy the world \nhas ever known. That is a tall order, but it is without reservation \nthat I will put my full faith and trust in Bill Cohen to be that \nperson.\n  As we all know, Bill is a respected and expert voice on intelligence \nand national security issues. As chairman of the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Seapower and chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, he played a leadership role in defense policy at a critical \ntime in our Nation's history, through some of the most trying days of \nthe cold war and the challenging moments thereafter. Bill authored the \nnuclear arms build-down proposal which became the United States \nposition in negotiations with the Soviet Union. He forged a bipartisan \ncompromise on an antiballistic-missile policy, and his unwavering \ncommitment to a strong national defense helped lay the groundwork for \nthe fall of the Soviet empire and the end to the cold war.\n  Closer to home, Bill was instrumental in bringing about significant \nreforms of the Defense Department, including reorganizing the Pentagon \nand the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be more effective and prepared for \ncombat situations and streamlining acquisition policies to ensure cost \nefficiency. His legislation also created a special operations \nantiterrorism unit designed to counter this growing scourge.\n  While serving on the Armed Services Committee, Bill was visionary in \nreshaping our military forces to be responsive to the post-cold-war \nthreats that we face globally as well as sizing and equipping forces to \ncarry out our national security policy. Bill has also been a leader in \nshaping our policy and forces to meet the future challenges we will \nface in the 21st century.\n  Bill Cohen also put forward a detailed proposal for reorienting our \ndefense structure in the nineties in a way that would reduce the burden \non the Federal budget and recognize changes in the threats facing the \nUnited States. It called for sacrificing conventional forces and \nprograms primarily designed to defeat Soviet aggression in Europe in \nfavor of those, such as power projection forces and sealift, that will \nbe needed to meet the variety of challenges the United States is likely \nto face in our changed global arena.\n  It is precisely this kind of responsible, visionary leadership that \nwill be required for the next Secretary of Defense, so I can think of \nno finer nominee than Bill Cohen to lead and prepare the Department of \nDefense for this coming century. I commend President Clinton for his \nbold and wise and thoughtful selection of Bill Cohen to be our next \nSecretary of Defense, and I am thankful that Bill Cohen has decided to \ncontinue his commitment to public service.\n  Bill Cohen brings to the Pentagon not just a sense of bipartisanship. \nHe also brings to the Cabinet expertise in working with Congress. And I \nexpect we are going to be hearing a lot from Bill because he is \nfamiliar with this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. He knows that to be an \neffective Secretary of Defense one must have a strong and trustworthy \nrelationship with the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, my fellow colleagues, the world today is much \ndifferent than the world of even 10 years ago. The Berlin wall has now \nbeen relegated to its rightful place--our museums. The Soviet Union is \nno more. And young Americans no longer go to sleep fearing that morning \nmay never come. But let us make no mistake. The world is still a \nvolatile and dangerous place, and that is why we need a person of Bill \nCohen's caliber standing watch, willing to fight, willing to stand up \nfor his principles, willing to take the time to do what he believes is \nright.\n  These are some of the qualities that Bill Cohen will bring to the \nPentagon, and so I urge you to join with me in proudly casting your \nvote to confirm President Clinton's nomination of William S. Cohen to \nbe the next Secretary of Defense for the United States of America.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield 2 minutes to the able \nSenator from Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  I support Senator Bill Cohen, now Secretary of Defense-designate Bill \nCohen, because I believe he believes in a strong national defense, and \nhe will fight to make sure that commitment remains true. He believes \nthat the President should consult with Congress before deploying \nAmerican troops into harm's way. He believes that mistakes have been \nmade in Bosnia, and I think he will keep his word when he gives it to \nCongress and to the American people regarding our role and the clear \nmission that must be stated in Bosnia. He believes that we should move \ninto the expansion of NATO very carefully, understanding that this is a \nmutual defense pact, and that we want to always keep our treaty \nobligations and therefore we must be very careful as we give them to \nmake sure that we are covered.\n  Bill Cohen believes in privatization so that we will be able to \nmaximize the use of our defense dollars for the readiness of our \nforces, the greatest forces on the face of the Earth today.\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\n  I am pleased to support the nomination of Bill Cohen, and I do wish \nto commend the President for making this kind of bold move because I \nthink he has heard many of the things Senator Cohen has said over the \npast few years about the role of defense, about the role of our \nmilitary in this great country, and I hope the President will listen as \nwe move forward together in a bipartisan way to the good advice I know \nBill Cohen will give him regarding the issues that are going to be \nbefore us. We cannot go separately when we are talking about the troops \nand the strength of our American Armed Forces.\n  So I do support this nomination, and I have every confidence that \nBill Cohen will lead us into a strong national defense and also for \nAmerica to keep all of its treaty obligations and to make sure that we \nhave the missile defense technology to protect us and our shores and \nour troops when they are in the field.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a tremendous honor to be able to \ncast my second vote as a U.S. Senator to confirm my friend and mentor, \nSenator Bill Cohen, as this Nation's Secretary of Defense.\n  In describing the characteristics that make Senator Cohen so well \nqualified for this job, it would be presumptuous and unnecessary for me \nto detail his expertise in defense matters to his former colleagues in \nthe Senate. Most of you have worked closely with him on defense issues \nfor many years, and all of you are certainly aware of the depth of his \nknowledge and experience in this arena. Simply put, Bill Cohen's \nunderstanding of the complexities of defense policy is unassailable.\n  But I do want to attest personally to Bill Cohen's integrity and \ncharacter, and on that basis there is simply no one more qualified for \nthis enormous responsibility. Bill Cohen embodies the patriotism, the \nthoughtfulness, the steadfastness, and the intellect that the task of \noverseeing our Nation's security requires. He brings to the job a \nfierce dedication to his principles, a level-headed ability to never \nmake a rash or uninformed decision, and the desire to make the Nation's \ndefense stronger while at the same time making it more effective and \nmore efficient.\n  Most important of all, Bill Cohen will never put Americans troops at \nrisk unnecessarily. In every decision involving the deployment of our \nmen and women in uniform, he will see the faces of our troops, not just \nthe statistics and logistics. He will bring to the Pentagon the \nreasoned, thoughtful approach that matters as weighty as war and peace \nrequire.\n  I have known Bill Cohen for more than 24 years. I first met him when \nhe was running for Congress in 1972, seeking the seat representing \nMaine's Second District. He was walking more than 600 miles across the \nsprawling district, introducing himself to the voters. I volunteered to \ndrive the campaign car as he criss-crossed the roads of northern Maine. \nI was inspired by his determination to meet the people whom he wanted \nto serve in Washington and by his sincere interest in their hopes and \nfears.\n  I was also impressed then, as I am now, by his commitment to public \nservice, to doing what was best for the people he represented. Over the \nyears, I saw countless examples of that commitment, whether he was \nrepresenting the people of the Second District as a House Member, or \nthe people of the whole State as a Senator. Now I have no doubt that he \nwill bring the same dedication for public service to a job at the \nhighest levels of public service, one that answers to the largest \nconstituency of all--the Nation.\n  In the more than two decades since I first met Bill Cohen, he has \nbeen my inspiration, my guide, and my friend. It gives me great pride \nto be able to be here today to endorse his nomination. I am delighted \nthat the President has made such an outstanding nomination for such a \ncritical Cabinet post. This morning I testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to urge its prompt and favorable consideration of \nBill Cohen's nomination. I am pleased that the committee was able to \nact so quickly to bring this outstanding nomination to the Senate \nfloor. And I know my colleagues will join me in unanimously approving \nBill Cohen's nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to wholeheartedly support \nthe nomination of former Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. \nSenator Cohen will be taking on a great responsibility in carrying out \nhis duties as Secretary of Defense. When confirmed, he will be \nproviding the President with essential advice about planning for the \ndefense of our Nation and in making sure that America's finest men and \nwomen have all of the assets they require to carry out their mission. I \nam pleased that the President has chosen Senator Cohen for this \nposition. The vast experience and knowledge he gained as a \ndistinguished member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees, and this body, will serve the President and the Nation \nwell. He is highly qualified for this important position.\n  I have worked with Senator Cohen on many issues and have always found \nhim to be knowledgeable, thoughtful, and a constructive consensus \nbuilder. He has demonstrated an ability to think issues through \ncarefully and thoroughly. His record on critical defense matters during \nhis tenure in the Senate speaks for itself. He has demonstrated that he \nis able to analyze the critical issues and make decisions based upon \nwhat his conscience tells him is that right thing to do for the \ncountry.\n  During this time of severe budget constraints I know that he will be \nable to help the President align budgets with priorities. Fundamental \nquestions will have to be answered as we prepare our military for the \nfuture wars they will have to fight. The world is still a dangerous \nplace. The recent missions the Department has undertaken are proof of \nthat fact. As we move into the 21st century, and as the United States \nbecomes more involved in crisis spots around the world, Senator Cohen's \nchallenge will be help ensure that our Armed Forces remain the best \ntrained, best equipped fighting force in the world. This is no small \ntask, but he has consistently supported these objectives in his \nposition as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He played \nan important role in calling for the Quadrennial Defense Review, has \nshown keen insights into the importance of weapons modernization, and \nhas been a stalwart supporter calling for ballistic missile defenses.\n  I have been very pleased to know many Secretary's of Defense in my 24 \nyears in the Senate, but I must say that I have been especially proud \nto know Secretary Designate Cohen. We began our legislative careers in \n1973. He first started in the House of Representatives, But I watched \nhis career develop there and then in the Senate where he won the \nrespect of his colleagues and became a giant here on Defense and \nIntelligence issues.\n  I have enormous respect for Secretary of Defense Designate Cohen. I \nbelieve his confirmation will be good for the country. I think it is \nfair to say that he enjoys the respect of every Member of this body. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Cohen in his new position as \nSecretary of Defense. I think the President has made an excellent \nchoice in nominating him. The people of Maine can be truly proud of his \naccomplishments, as I am proud to support his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nWilliam Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. After watching the Armed \nServices Committee hearings on his nomination I am not sure whether the \nSenate is voting in confirmation or coronation of my friend from Maine.\n  I can certainly understand how the committee provided such \noverwhelming support for this nomination. I have enjoyed working with \nBill Cohen on a wide range of issues. He and I have served together on \nthe Intelligence Committee and we have traveled together on arms \ncontrol delegations. I am gratified by the support he has lent to \nefforts I have brought before the Senate to limit the export and use of \nland mines. He has that unique New England philosophy, increasingly \nrare these days, of working in a bipartisan fashion to build support \nfor legislative initiatives for the good of the country. There will be \na void in the Senate without him but the nation is fortunate to have \nhis leadership on defense issues.\n  There are two distinct qualities about Bill Cohen that I am confident\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\nwill serve him well as Secretary of Defense. As all of us who have had \nthe honor to serve with him know, Bill Cohen is his own individual. He \nis not afraid to stand up for what he believes is best for the Nation. \nHe also possesses one of the most formidable intellects that I have \nworked with in my 22 years in the Senate. I know that these qualities \nwill serve him well as he guides the Department of Defense and advises \nthe President in the coming years.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support \nof President Clinton's nomination of former Senator William Cohen as \nSecretary of Defense. I truly believe that Senator Cohen has an \nextraordinary grasp of all defense matters, especially issues of \nconcern to the Navy, and will be an asset as Secretary of Defense.\n  I have always found Senator Cohen to be a fair and thoughtful public \nservant who takes the time to understand all issues. In fact, I am \nhappy to say that when Senator Cohen speaks on matters of our national \ndefense and foreign policy, I turn up the volume on my television so \nthat I can catch every word.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have stressed the need to be more \nbipartisan in all that we do. This is especially true when considering \nwhat is necessary for our Nation's security. I am convinced that with \nthe Senator's nomination as Secretary of Defense our ability to work \ntogether as Democrats and Republicans will be enhanced as will \nCongress' ability to work with the executive branch. The value of this \ncooperation cannot be underestimated.\n  I am also pleased that Secretary-designate Cohen has a keen \nunderstanding of international security issues across the board. He is \nparticularly knowledgeable about the Asia-Pacific region and has \ntraveled there many times. Secretary-designate Cohen supports \ncontinuing Secretary Perry's strong policy of engagement with China, \nincluding extensive military-to-military contacts. This kind of one-on-\none relationship with our Asian counterparts is vital to the continued \nprogress in our foreign policy relationship. We, however, must continue \nto maintain a strong military presence in the Pacific to protect our \ninterests. I am convinced that Senator Cohen will continue to support \nthis effort during his tenure as Secretary of Defense.\n  Eliminating sexual harassment and all forms of discrimination in our \nArmed Forces is another issue to which I know the Secretary-designate \nwill dedicate his efforts. He was a leader during the scourge of \nTailhook and I am confident that he will continue to monitor the Army's \ninvestigations into sexual harassment and assault inside its ranks.\n  Finally, I know that the Secretary-designate and I will have the \nopportunity to discuss and to work on those matter on which we do not \nsee eye to eye. As a Senator, Secretary-designate Cohen had differing \nviews on the administration's current Department of Defense \nprivatization efforts. I look forward to working with him as we \ncontinue to explore the best ways to preserve the readiness needs of \nour military and the most cost-effective means to support our \nmilitary's depot maintenance activities. I am positive that we will \nhave, as we have always had, the ability to discuss these differences \nopenly and honestly.\n  In closing, I was pleased to hear that Senator Cohen mentioned the \nproblem of access to bombmaking information on the Internet during his \ntestimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee today. This is a \nwidespread problem for which I have been seeking a solution and I am \npleased that the Secretary-designate understands its gravity.\n  I am happy to give my support for the nomination of former Senator \nWilliam Cohen to the office of Secretary of Defense. I am positive he \nwill be an asset to the Clinton administration and to our Nation as a \nwhole.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to vote for Senator \nBill Cohen's confirmation to serve as Secretary of Defense. We are all \nvery familiar with Senator Cohen's experience and commitment to the \nNation's defense as a member of the Armed Services Committee and I am \nconfident he will put those qualities to good use in leading the \nDepartment of Defense into the next century.\n  In the 8 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Department has \nguided our Armed Forces through a challenging and often painful \ndownsizing, while maintaining the preeminent position of our forces as \nthe world's strongest, best led, best trained, and finest performing \nmilitary. And we have done so while making major progress toward \nbalancing the budget.\n  Senator Cohen is eminently qualified to carry on these important \nresponsibilities.\n  We continue to face major challenges in maintaining a sound defense \nstrategy to forthcoming years in the post-cold-war world.\n  Our nuclear arsenal and that of the four other nuclear powers are \nlarger and are operated on higher alerts than the threats now justify. \nThe threat from terrorists who seek to obtain and use weapons of mass \ndestruction demands more of our attention and resources.\n  The Pentagon is embarking on a quadrennial defense review to \ndetermine the proper balance of size, structure, and funding to keep \nour forces equipped, trained, and ready. We all look forward to working \nwith Senator Cohen and the President to deal with these critical issues \nfor our national security.\n  Another vital challenge is to ensure that our military personnel have \nthe quality of life to which their service entitles them. Health care, \nchild care, and adequate housing are all initiatives on which the \ncommittee works closely with the Department, and I know these will \ncontinue to be priorities for the Pentagon under Secretary Cohen's \nleadership as well.\n  Finally, it was a special privilege for me to work with Senator Cohen \non the Seapower Subcommittee for many years on issues of special \nimportance to the Navy and Marine Corps. I commend him on his \nnomination and I look forward to continuing to deal with him on \nsafeguarding our national defense.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] asked me to submit his statement in support of William \nCohen for Secretary of Defense. As with the earlier vote on the \nnomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State, he is \nnecessarily absent for this vote because of responsibilities he has in \nleading a trade mission from his State of West Virginia to Asia. He \nregrets not being here to cast his own vote for his former colleague, \nSenator Cohen, and asks that his support for this outstanding nominee \nbe noted.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am submitting this statement \nto express my support for the nomination of my former colleague, \nWilliam Cohen, to be the Secretary of Defense of the United States of \nAmerica. Unfortunately, as with today's earlier vote for Madeleine \nAlbright to be Secretary of State, I am necessarily absent from the \nSenate, and am unable to cast my vote for Senator Cohen. Again, because \nof plans that had to be scheduled long ago, I am presently leading a \ngroup of more than 30 West Virginians on a trade mission to Japan and \nTaiwan that is called Project Harvest II.\n  I personally regret, however, that I am missing a chance to vote on \nthe nomination of William Cohen. Senator Cohen and I served together in \nthe Senate for twelve years, and in that time he distinguished himself \nas a serious legislator with a keen intellect who continually \ntranscended party boundaries to build bridges and advance America's \nnational interests.\n  The challenges facing Senator Cohen today are no less daunting than \nthose faced by Secretaries of Defense in times of war and cold war. The \nUnited States stands today as the only military superpower in the \nworld. That brings with it great responsibility to lead in all corners \nof the globe. Bill Cohen is uniquely talented to take on these \nchallenges, and like my colleagues I applaud him for agreeing to take \non this challenge, and the President for nominating him. \n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Honorable William S. Cohen was a \ngreat Senator and I am confident that he will carry on his outstanding \nrecord in public service as Secretary of Defense.\n  I compliment President Clinton both for his bipartisanship for \nnominating Bill Cohen and for his wisdom in selecting this man of \nunique ability and integrity.\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\n  I have worked closely with Bill Cohen for the past 16 years and have \nfound him to be brilliant, tenacious, honest, and hardworking. If Bill \nCohen finds all the others in a Cabinet meeting about to make an \nerroneous decision, I am confident he will be smart enough and strong \nenough to persuade them to the correct course.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Cohen on many matters in the \nfuture.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I enthusiastically support the \nnomination of our colleague Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of \nDefense.\n  I salute President Clinton for reaching out beyond party lines. I \nsalute Bill Cohen for being ready to join the Democratic \nAdministration. They both know that when it comes to the national \ndefense of our country--we have no party interest--just national \ninterest.\n  Senator Cohen has shown that he cares deeply about the national \ninterest--and that means a lot more to him than party politics. He has \nproven this time and time again, not just on national security issues \nbut when he worked on behalf of senior citizens, when he sought to \nreach a consensus on health care reform, when he supported affirmative \naction and when he fought for lobbying reform. His is a voice of \nindependence, integrity, and moderation.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he was one of the \nSenate's most articulate voices for a strong and efficient national \ndefense. He cares deeply about the men and women of our Armed Forces. \nHe has long fought to make sure that while we downsize our military--we \ndo not downgrade our military.\n  Mr. President, I believe Senator Cohen is the ideal person to lead \nour Armed Forces into the new century. I am proud to support his \nnomination, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that we \nmaintain the best equipped, best trained, and most ethical military in \nthe world.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, in my 8 years of service in the Senate, \nand in particular during my time on the Armed Services Committee and \nthe Intelligence Committee, I have had the privilege and honor of \nworking with Bill Cohen. His expertise and thoughtfulness, as well as \nhis ability to put the national interests above partisan politics, have \nmade him an invaluable asset to this body. Whether regarding arms \ncontrols, missile defense, or acquisition reform, Bill Cohen's \nindependence and reasoned approach have resulted in passage of major \npieces of legislation on highly complex and politicized matters. Those \nsame qualities will enable our next Secretary of Defense to guide the \nNation through an uncertain future, and to make the many difficult \nchoices we face in reconciling protection of our vital interests \noverseas with ever-increasing demands on our Federal budget here at \nhome.\n  Bill Perry has proven himself as one of the most capable Defense \nSecretaries ever, and Bill Cohen will have a remarkable legacy to \nfollow. But I am confident he shares the same kind of dispassionate, \nin-depth analytic qualities and measured, even-keeled leadership \nqualities that will keep America safe well into the 21st century. I \nwish him much success in his new position, and with that, Madam \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman.\n  Madam President, President Clinton performed an act of political \ncourage in reaching across the aisle and getting a proven Republican \nwarrior to take on this important post. But that act is matched by the \nindependence and, indeed, the courage that Bill Cohen brings to this \noffice.\n  For 18 years, it has been my privilege to be seated next to him on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and to travel with him throughout \nthe world.\n  The hearing today was thorough, the questions were tough, and that is \nthe way Bill Cohen would have wanted it. That is the way the committee \ndealt with him today. It was not easy. It was a thorough and careful \nhearing, and I commend the chairman and Senator Levin.\n  In the course of the questioning, by myself and others, I think \nSenator Cohen made--I do not think, I know he made a commitment to the \nCongress that he will try to work in this next Clinton administration \nto improve the consultation between the President and his advisers and \nthe Congress in a timely manner before we commit the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States into harm's way.\n  On that point, I questioned him about what standard should be \nemployed when U.S. troops are deployed into hostile situations. I drew \nSenator Cohen's attention to responses given by the Secretary of State-\ndesignate Albright at the time of her confirmation hearing on January \n8. Ambassador Albright spoke of a series of situations when ``our \ninterests and those of our allies may be affected.'' In those \ninstances, our new Secretary of State would recommend the use of U.S. \nforces. I felt that we should be more explicit in defining the standard \nfor using U.S. troops in hostile situations. In my view, the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces should know, before they are deployed by the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense, that the mission of these fine \ntroops is in our vital national security interest.\n  Senator Cohen came close defining the standard that I have applied on \nthis issue--that is, that U.S. vital national security interests must \nbe threatened before we agree to put U.S. troops in harm's way. But he \nsaid he wanted to leave room for the use of United States troops in \nthose instances where there was a potential for a situation to approach \na vital national security interest, such as in Bosnia. While he clearly \nstated that Bosnia was not in the vital national security interests of \nthis country, he pointed out that, by virtue of the intervention of our \ntroops and others, we avoided a situation where the conflict could have \nspread beyond the borders of Bosnia, thereby creating a situation which \nwould be in the vital security interests of this country and indeed \nother nations. I will continue to work with my good friend to further \ntighten his standard regarding the use of U.S. troops.\n  There were several other issues I explored with our Secretary of \nDefense-designate during this morning's hearing that I would like to \ndiscuss at this time for the benefit of the entire Senate. The first is \nthe critical issue of congressional involvement in international \nagreements which substantively modify the ABM Treaty. I reminded \nSenator Cohen that during the last Congress--and, indeed, dating back \nto 1991--he was my partner in our efforts to provide adequate missile \ndefenses for our troops deployed overseas and to Americans here at \nhome. One issue which has been of paramount concern to many Republican \nMembers of Congress is the Clinton administration's repeated attempts \nduring its negotiations with the Russians on a demarcation agreement to \napply the limitations of the ABM Treaty to our shorter range, theater \nmissile defense systems. I was in Moscow in 1972 when the ABM Treaty \nwas signed. I know that the ABM Treaty was never envisioned to restrict \nour shorter range systems.\n  Unfortunately, the battle with the administration over the \ndemarcation issue continues. Senator Cohen joined me in 1994 in \ncosponoring an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization \nAct which states that any international agreement which substantively \nmodifies the ABM Treaty must be submitted to the Senate as a treaty. \nDuring last year's conference on the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense \nAuthorization Act, National Security Advisor Tony Lake came before the \nconferees and stated unequivocally that the administration had \ndetermined that the demarcation agreement the administration had \ntentatively concluded with the Russians was indeed a substantive \nmodification of the ABM Treaty. Despite this position, and--in my \nview--the clear legal requirement that flows from the law enacted in \n1994, the Clinton administration refuses to acknowledge that it must \nsubmit the final demarcation agreement to the Congress for approval.\n  To his credit, Senator Cohen reaffirmed his view that agreements \nwhich represent substantive modifications to the ABM Treaty must be \nsubmitted to the Senate for consideration. I am hopeful that from his \nnew position, he can help us in resolving this\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nlongstanding dispute between the Congress and the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The final issue I would like to mention concerns the negative impact \nthat the Bosnia operation and other similar contingency operations are \nhaving on the overall level of military readiness, and on defense \nfunding levels. I pointed out to Senator Cohen that our troops deployed \nto such operations as those in Bosnia are distracted from their normal \ntraining evolutions which are critical to maintaining their combat \nreadiness. This problem is compounded by the ad hoc way the \nadministration has been funding these contingency operations. As \nSenator Cohen acknowledged, we will soon be faced with a supplemental \nbudget request of over $2 billion to fund our continued involvement in \nBosnia. That $2 billion will be taken out of the critical readiness and \nprocurement accounts which are already at dangerously low levels. \nSenator Cohen recognized the problems I outlined, and agreed to work \nwith the Congress to find solutions. I look forward to that dialog.\n\n  Madam President, Bill Cohen will not only be a valuable adviser to \nthe President, but I think to the Cabinet as a whole. His hallmark in \nthe U.S. Senate was to bring disparate factions together and to try to \nstrike a common ground of understanding between the strongest of \ndiffering viewpoints. Therefore, in those Cabinet meetings, I \nanticipate he will take on an added responsibility and role. He will \nquickly gain the respect, not only of the President, but of his other \ncolleagues.\n  Lastly, Madam President, might I say, on the question of sexual \nharassment, he came down with a zero tolerance standard. And that was a \nmessage that I think all Americans wanted to hear. I reminded him of \nthe success of the military in handling a very serious drug problem at \nthe time he and I first came to the Senate. That is the benchmark for \nhim to follow in dealing with the sexual harassment problem, as he \ninstitutes that zero tolerance policy, which I hope he will succeed in \nattaining.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I am honored to stand to support the nomination of our former \ncolleague, Bill Cohen, to be the Secretary of Defense. Being a member \nof the Armed Services Committee, watching Senator Cohen testify before \nus this morning, you could not help but be impressed. It was a tour de \nforce--no pun intended here--for our future Secretary of Defense. He \nwas thoughtful, he was well informed, he was strong, and he was, I \nbelieve, ready to innovate. I think you could not help but conclude, \nthough much has been made of Senator Cohen's party affiliation, that \nPresident Clinton chose Bill Cohen to be our next Secretary of Defense \nbecause he was the best person to be our next Secretary of Defense. \nAnd, incidentally, he happened to be a Republican.\n  This, obviously, is serious business and a serious responsibility \nSecretary-designate Cohen now undertakes, the security of our country, \nthe first responsibility of our Government; the power, along with the \nCommander in Chief, to put American soldiers in harm's way. I am \nconfident, because all of us know Bill Cohen. In fact, we are in an \nunusual position, an advantage that we normally do not have when we \nconsider nominees. We know this person. We know his values. We know his \nbalance. We know his strength, and therefore we know how well prepared \nhe is to be the Secretary of Defense.\n  He comes in at a time when America is the unchallenged, strongest \nnation in the world. Yet, to remain that way, not just for today and \ntomorrow but for the decades ahead, we must continue to innovate and \nlead and make tough decisions. Just like America's strongest companies \nwho, after they have completed years in which they have made record \nprofits, their CEO's come back and look for ways to innovate to make \nsure they will stay successful. That is exactly what Secretary-\ndesignate Cohen must, and I am sure will, do as our next Secretary of \nDefense. This morning he strongly supported the quadrennial defense \nreview and national defense panel as aids to him and us in carrying out \nthat responsibility.\n  Madam President, let me conclude simply by saying that this new \nassignment will test Senator Cohen's strength, his foresight, and his \ncourage. I am absolutely convinced that he is ready to pass those tests \nand serve our Nation brilliantly.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining on both sides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Five minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On both sides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 3 minutes to the able Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am pleased to share my feelings on a \nbipartisan basis for the man who is probably the best qualified \nindividual going into the job of Secretary of Defense in a very \ndifficult time in this Nation's history. I will single out four areas \nwhere he has demonstrated, in my opinion, a type of courage that many \ndo not have, not to be encumbered by partisan politics or by politics \nin general, but to be concerned only with protecting this Nation from \nattack from outside.\n\n  The first area is, under the BRAC Commission, he has made the \nstatement in the past that the burden of BRAC, the Base Realignment And \nClosure Commission, was to reduce the excess capacity and move that \nexcess capacity into consolidated functions. I have no doubt in my mind \nbut he will do this and keep that system free from political \ninterference.\n  The second area is we really cannot afford in this Nation to have \nmore defense cuts than we have already cut. I read a quote this morning \nout of a new book by Caspar Weinberger called ``The Next War.''\n\n       Even to think about, much less propose, further cutting our \n     Armed Forces, betrays a clear lack of real world thinking \n     bordering on denial and delusion.\n\n  I believe Bill Cohen understands this.\n  The third area is the practice of sending our troops into areas where \nwe do not have vital strategic interests at stake. This is something we \nhave had a chance to talk about. We stood on the floor with Bill Cohen \nas a U.S. Senator, and he expressed himself very clearly that we not \ndilute our very scarce military assets by sending our troops to places \nthat are not strategic, vital security interests of the United States.\n  Very closely associated with that is I am hoping we are going to be \nable to get away from a problem we have had for quite some time, and \nthat is the administration coming in, encumbering us, putting our \ntroops into areas such as Bosnia and approximating what it will cost, \nwhich was supposed to cost somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion and \nnow we are finding out it is going to be closer to $6 billion, $6.5 \nbillion. This is in a way disenfranchising the U.S. Senate. We should \nbe in on that decision, and I have every confidence we will be in on \nthose decisions from this point forward.\n  Then the last area is one I have been very much concerned with, and \nthat is our need for a sophisticated theater missile defense system and \na national missile defense system. I have stood on this floor and \nshared thoughts with Senator Bill Cohen concerning this problem. This \nmorning during the confirmation hearings I was just delighted to hear \nSenator Cohen make his statement as he characterized the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction to be the gravest \nproblem facing the world today.\n  I am looking forward to voting for his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I compliment the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Susan Collins, who presides over this body at this moment with \na degree of dignity and skill and efficiency that is so rare as a day \nin June.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Senator Bill Cohen to be our \nnext Secretary of Defense. He is highly qualified for this important \nposition from the perspective of the long, creative, and intense years \nhe has studied and\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nput into effect his ideas regarding a strong defense from the position \nof his membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I have worked with Senator Cohen on many issues of war and peace, of \nforeign policy, national security actions and have always found him to \nbe knowledgeable, thoughtful, with excellent insight and a distinct \nlack of partisanship, and always with an unusual dose of excellent \njudgment and innovation.\n  He has always attempted to build consensus across the aisle on vital \ndefense matters, and I have had this experience in working with him \nwhen I served as the Democratic leader and in the context of our \nmembership together on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I commend President Clinton for submitting this outstanding--truly \noutstanding--nomination. I suggest that the nomination reflects highly \non both the Senator and the President. It highlights the need for \nbipartisan national security decisionmaking, and I feel that it will be \nconstructive in taking politics out of defense budgeting and defense \npolicy.\n  It is an act of political courage on the part of the President, and \nit is matched by the independence of judgment and courage on the part \nof Bill Cohen over the years. Senator Cohen has demonstrated an ability \nto think a problem through carefully and clearly and reach consistently \nwise and independent judgments.\n  In this regard, I commend his comment in the committee's confirmation \nhearing today that there should be an end to our Bosnia deployment \nwithin the near term and that our European allies need to finally step \nup to the plate and assume whatever further military peace-enforcing \nresponsibilities remain at the end of that period.\n  I know that Senator Cohen is a strong advocate of regular substantive \nconsultations between the administration and the Congress on critical \ndefense matters, and in particular on the question of the deployment of \nAmerican Armed Forces into harm's way. I know that he urged President \nBush to come to Congress on the matter of deploying our forces to Saudi \nArabia in preparation to remove Iraq's forces from Kuwait. He has \nindicated that it is not sufficient for an administration to go only to \nthe United Nations for such approval, and he supports his argument with \nboth constitutional and practical reasons.\n  It is far sounder to deploy forces when an adversary knows that a \nnational decision in the United States has been taken which has been \nvalidated by the people's representatives. America's credibility is \nstronger under such circumstances, and we are more likely to sustain a \ndifficult operation and to prevail.\n  The nomination of Bill Cohen for Secretary of Defense is an unusually \ngood one. I look forward to working closely with Secretary of Defense \nBill Cohen on the very weighty and diverse responsibilities that come \nwith that high and critical office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes for the Senator from South \nCarolina and 1 minute for the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I now yield 1 minute to the able Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. BOB SMITH. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee very much and also thank you, Madam President. It \nisn't often you get the opportunity to preside over your predecessor's \nnew job. So it is a great honor. You will learn when Senator Byrd gives \nout compliments, he means them. So I think you should take it in that \nvein.\n\n  I am very honored and pleased and proud to support the nomination of \nBill Cohen, with whom I have worked on the Armed Services Committee for \nthe past 6 years on a number of issues. I compliment the President of \nthe United States for having the courage to make a bipartisan \nselection. I don't think he could have picked a better one.\n  If you want to bridge the gap, if you will, that sometimes occurs \nbetween those of us on the Republican side on defense matters and the \nadministration, I think if anybody can do it, Bill Cohen can do it. He \nis very knowledgeable, and I think one of the things that adds a \ndifferent, perhaps a unique, dimension to Bill Cohen as Secretary of \nDefense is his experience in foreign policy.\n  I have been on some trips with him around the world, as many of my \ncolleagues have, and he is very knowledgeable on Europe and NATO. His \nknowledge of the world is pretty well unequaled. I am proud to support \nhis nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 seconds to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the only thing I can say in 10 seconds is \nit is an inspired choice of a great man at the right time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, to Senator Conrad I yield 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I was in the centrist coalition with \nSenator Cohen. I have enormously high regard for his integrity, his \nhonesty, and his ability to work with others. A superb choice.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I now yield a half-minute to the able \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I join in the congratulations both to \nthe President, for having chosen Bill Cohen, and Bill Cohen, for making \nhimself available. Bill Cohen is one of the really great Senators with \nwhom I have had the privilege of serving in this body.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota mentioned, he and I and others were \npart of a centrist coalition that was bipartisan, which reached across \nthe aisle. We are going to see Bill Cohen conduct his office in the \nsame fashion. It is going to be an office that will provide for all \nAmericans.\n  It is with great pleasure that I second the nomination of Bill Cohen \nfor Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I now yield the remainder of the time \nto the able Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina very much.\n  I enthusiastically support the nomination of Bill Cohen for Secretary \nof Defense and commend the President for his decision. One of the \nencouraging things Bill Cohen said today, among all the other \nimpressive things he said, was his commitment to the men and women in \nuniform.\n  We have the best fighting force in the world, but you have to take \ncare of them. So the quality of life issues that are so important to \nthose men and women, whether they are four-star generals or new \nprivates or midshipmen coming in, we need to take care of them, and we \nhave a Secretary of Defense who will continue what Bill Perry was \ndoing, and that is improving the life of our men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Michigan has 4 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this morning, there were three wonderful \nintroductions of Senator Cohen to the Armed Services Committee. The \nPresiding Officer, Senator Snowe, and Senator McCain made really \nstirring introductions of our former colleague, Senator Cohen. Not only \nwere they wonderful, but it is a wonderful fact, indeed, that the \nperson who is presiding over the Senate at this moment when he will be \nconfirmed--I am sure overwhelmingly if not unanimously--is not only \nsomeone who is the successor to Senator Cohen, but someone who has \nSenator Cohen still no doubt as a mentor and was, indeed, on Senator \nCohen's staff where she served so brilliantly as a subcommittee staff \ndirector on a subcommittee that I also chaired and was ranking member.\n  So I want to congratulate the Presiding Officer for being where she \nis at this moment. It must be a treat, indeed, for her to be sitting \nthere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William S. Cohen, of Maine, to be \nSecretary of Defense? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to have 25 \nminutes after the statements on Senator Cohen appear, if that is all \nright.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I amend that consent to allow the Senator \nfrom Ohio to take 25 minutes, with the understanding that we have a few \nSenators who would like to speak first for not more than 10 minutes on \nbehalf of this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S627-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I note to those Senators who may not \nhave been told, there are no votes tomorrow or votes on Friday. I ask \nthe leader if he can clarify that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare pleased to announce that there will be no further votes today. The \nSenate will be in session tomorrow, Thursday, January 23, for a period \nof morning business, to continue the opportunity for Senators to offer \nbills and make statements on behalf of those bills.\n  The Senate then is expected to recess over until Monday, the 27th, \nfor a pro forma session only. No business will be transacted during \nMonday's session. The next time the Senate will be in session to \nconduct business will be on Tuesday, January 28, when we hope and \nexpect that we will have another nomination ready to be voted on. It \nhasn't been completed yet, but we hope to continue next week with \nconfirmation votes. After meeting with the Democratic leader, we will \nbegin to also notify Members as to when we hope bills will be coming up \nand will be ready for vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for his \ncomments with regard to the schedule and also for his cooperation in \nmoving these two nominations as quickly as we have.\n  I think the widespread support for both nominees is a real indication \nof the kind of support both colleagues have, and also a real indication \nof the kind of leadership demonstrated on the Republican side of the \naisle when it comes to these nominations. This is in keeping with the \ncomments made earlier by the majority leader. I appreciate his \ncooperation very much.\n  I yield to Senator Robb at this time and reserve my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I will submit for the Record a statement \nrelating to the nomination and confirmation of both now Secretary \nMadeleine Albright and now Secretary Bill Cohen. I was unable to get to \nthe floor during those particular periods when their virtues were being \nextolled at some length. I have enormous respect for them individually, \nas all of our colleagues do.\n  I salute the leadership on both sides of the aisle for moving these \nnominations through expeditiously. I believe they are both committed to \na strong national defense and assertive foreign policy. I think they \nwill work well together as a team and with the President. I think their \nrespective quick confirmations are good for the country. I commend all \nof those who helped to make that possible, including my distinguished \nsenior Senator from Virginia and the distinguished majority leader, as \nwell as the minority leader, for what they have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S627-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S627-S628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONFIRMATION OF MADELEINE ALBRIGHT TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the distinguished \nchoice of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. Ambassador \nAlbright has served the country with distinction over a 20-year period. \nShe brings the requisite skills, knowledge, and experience to one of \nthe most demanding jobs in Government, and I am confident that she will \nhelp President Clinton continue our leadership of the community of \nnations.\n  During her confirmation hearing, Ambassador Albright conveyed to me a \nstrong sense of how the United States must act and lead in addressing \nproblems around the world where our interests and values are at stake. \nShe demonstrated a keen understanding of how diplomacy and force work \ntogether to advance our foreign policy goals.\n  Ambassador Albright stated to the committee that ``force, and the \ncredible possibility of its use, are essential to defend our vital \ninterests and to keep America safe. But force alone can be a blunt \ninstrument, and there are many problems it cannot solve. To be \neffective, force and diplomacy must complement and reinforce each \nother.''\n  I believe we need to tangibly demonstrate our commitment to peace and \nstability, in both manpower and structure, as we forge a new security \norder in Europe and serve as a balancing wheel in Asia. American \nleadership abroad will depend on the President and his national \nsecurity team having the spine to lead our allies against inimical \nforces, including rogue nations, terrorist elements, and the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In that regard, President Clinton has chosen well in Madeleine \nAlbright. She has a direct, no nonsense style that suits these times \nwell, and will invigorate our foreign policy agenda. I look forward to \njoining hands with her as\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\nthe administration continues its efforts to promote freedom, peace, and \nsecurity abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S627-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONFIRMATION OF WILLIAM COHEN TO BE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, in my 8 years of service in the Senate, and \nin particular during my time on the Armed Services Committee and the \nIntelligence Committee, I have had the privilege and honor of working \nwith Bill Cohen. His expertise and thoughtfulness, as well as his \nability to put the national interests above partisan politics, have \nmade him an invaluable asset to this body. Whether regarding arms \ncontrols, missile defense, or acquisition reform, Bill Cohen's \nindependence and reasoned approach have resulted in passage of major \npieces of legislation on highly complex and politicized matters. Those \nsame qualities will enable our next Secretary of Defense to guide the \nNation through an uncertain future, and to make the many difficult \nchoices we face in reconciling protection of our vital interests \noverseas with ever increasing demands on our federal budget here at \nhome.\n  Bill Perry has proven himself as one of the most capable Defense \nSecretaries ever, and Bill Cohen will have a remarkable legacy to \nfollow. But I am confident he shares the same kind of dispassionate, \nin-depth analytic qualities and measured, even-keeled leadership \nqualities that will keep America safe will into the 21st century.

Madam President, I know there are a number of colleagues \nwho wish to be recognized, and I will be very brief. I wanted to \naccommodate all of those in the short timeframe that we had prior to \nthe votes, so I withheld comment at that time.\n  I congratulate both of our new members of the Cabinet on the strong \nsupport they received through the votes taken this afternoon. In the \ncase of Madeleine Albright, I have had the opportunity to inform her of \nthe Senate's vote and to personally congratulate her. Let me say how \npleased I am with the overwhelming sentiment expressed by the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Madeleine Albright is unquestionably qualified to be Secretary of \nState. She is one of our best foreign policy minds, particularly given \nthe extraordinary experience she has had in so many roles in her past. \nAs a professor at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, Ambassador \nto the United Nations, serving as a counselor to the President on \nforeign policy, Madeleine Albright, as much as anybody else, has had \nthe opportunity to be in the forefront of foreign policy in this \nadministration. This vote, obviously, was quite historic. Madeleine \nAlbright stands now as the first woman to be confirmed as Secretary of \nState in our Nation's history. I cannot think of a more appropriate \nhonor to be bestowed on a woman of this caliber and with this degree of \ncredibility. I commend her and commend the administration for \nnominating her for this most important position.\n  We stand ready to work with her in all the challenges that she now \nfaces in all parts of the world given the heavy responsibility that she \nwill face her new role as Secretary of State. I hope that we can \ndemonstrate that politics will stop at the water's edge, as it has this \nafternoon in her confirmation. I look forward to working with her. And, \nagain, let me publicly congratulate her on this historic occasion and \non the overwhelming support demonstrated for her confirmation in the \nvote just taken.\n  The same could be said of our new Secretary of Defense. From the very \noutset of his 20-plus year service in Congress, Bill Cohen has \ndemonstrated ability, independence, and extraordinary good judgment on \na range of defense and intelligence issues. Through his work on the \nArmed Services and Intelligence Committees, Senator Cohen has become a \nreal giant in the formulation of public policy and someone to whom many \nof us have gone for counsel, advice, and direction as we have faced \nmany very difficult issues. He has stood on this very Senate floor on \nmany occasions to express himself clearly and unequivocally on the \nissues confronting this body that require very careful judgment.\n  I also congratulate Senator Cohen for his clear and very decisive \nresponse to a question on the importance of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. He made a compelling case for this vital treaty. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle were listening to the comments \nmade by our new Secretary of Defense on the importance of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. His record in this Congress, including his \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee this morning, indicate \nwhy Bill Cohen is an extraordinary choice as our new Secretary of \nDefense. I look forward to working with him. I know that, again, on a \nbipartisan basis, Bill Cohen begins his tenure as our new Secretary \nwith an appreciation for the friendships that he has created and the \nstanding that he continues to have in our body with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S628-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A NEW RECORD FOR SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Finally, let me just say, for just a moment, how pleased \nI was that the majority leader marked the important new record set by \nour distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia earlier today.\n  Senator Byrd, having served 38 years and 10 days in the Senate, has \nnow become the fourth longest-serving Senator in U.S. history behind \nSenators Hayden, Thurmond, and Stennis.\n  He is a remarkable legislator. Many of us have called attention to \nhis many, many records in this body now for some time.\n  I want to be among those to honor him once more, and to call \nattention to this most historic occasion.\n  Again, let me congratulate Senator Byrd on this important day, and \nagain call attention to this milestone, and commend the many, many \ncitizens of West Virginia who have shown such good judgment to send \nRobert C. Byrd to the U.S. Senate not once, not twice, but on seven \ndifferent occasions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, if I could just briefly make some comments \nhere about our good friend, the Senator from Maine, Bill Cohen, I know \nthe Presiding Officer feels this way very, very strongly, and I know \nshe is very proud of his confirmation.\n  I must say that over the course of my tenure in the Congress I have \noften\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\nbeen very honored to know Secretaries of Defense. We have had some \ngreat ones. Still today I consider many of them personal friends but I \nhave never known one that I have been more proud of than I am today of \nWilliam Cohen in this new position.\n  Bill Cohen and I came to Congress together at the same time in 1973. \nWe served in the House together. We served in the Senate together. We \ndidn't always agree. In fact, we fought or disagreed pretty strongly \nthe first couple of years we were in Congress, and it took years to get \nover that disagreement. But over that period of time in the House and \nSenate we became close friends, and I grew to admire him and sought out \nhis advice and counsel which I found always very good even when he \ndidn't agree sometimes with what I was trying to do. He gave me advice \nand help that was invaluable. I will also be thankful for that.\n  We have much in common. We both represent small coastal States which \nface similar challenges and interests. He has truly become a great \nfriend to me and to our people in my own home State. He has my respect \nand my unqualified support as the next Secretary of Defense.\n\n  I think also we should take note of the fact that this was a grand \ngesture by the President. The President indicated that he wanted to \nhave a look at some Republicans for his Cabinet. I was not sure he \nwould do it. I know he considered several. But certainly he made a wise \npick here, and it did not go unnoticed by the Republicans that he made \nthis decision. I hope he will take the advice of his new Secretary of \nDefense. I think he will find it interesting and on occasion \nchallenging and sometimes advice that he will not find easy to accept. \nBut it will be invariably good advice.\n  Bill Cohen will have his hands full as the new Secretary of Defense. \nPerhaps the largest challenge of his illustrious career I think now \nlooms before him. I think it is to his credit that he was willing to \nstep aside from his goal of moving into the private sector to come back \nand to go into this very important, very difficult position.\n  I have become, in the last few months, increasingly concerned--\nactually, it has been moving in this direction for a number of years, \nbut I am really to the point of being alarmed about what I see \nhappening with our military, our military leadership in the Pentagon, \nand what we have been doing to the defense budget of our country. And \nso we are now reaching the point where we are, I think, developing \nserious problems in O and procurement, and so Senator Cohen is going \nto have a tremendous job in righting this military monolith that has \nnow reached the point where it has problems and will have growing \nproblems in the future.\n  I know Bill Cohen has expressed those concerns as a member, a very \ndistinguished senior member, of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nNow he will be in a position to help really do something about that.\n  Over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I must say that I think Bill Perry has \nperformed admirably in a very difficult environment. He has often been \ndealt a weak hand both by insufficient funds to do the job and multiple \ndemands that had to be fulfilled with those limited funds. But he has \nperformed always masterfully, with intellect and integrity, and I think \nhe has artfully managed the Pentagon at a very difficult time. So as he \ndeparts, Secretary Perry should be recognized for the fine job he did, \nand he truly has the gratitude of the Senate and I believe all \nAmericans for his service to the Department of Defense.\n  As majority leader and as a long-time supporter of a strong national \ndefense, I look forward to working with Bill Cohen as our new \nSecretary. Many people have voiced surprise that the President would \nmake this decision, but I was not surprised. I knew that once he talked \nto Bill Cohen, he would have to be impressed, and in fact he was. He \nrecognized him as an expert in defense and security policy. He is \nbright and capable. He will make an exceptional Secretary of Defense, \nand I am very proud of his confirmation today.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senate rules allow me to just \nobserve that the Presiding Officer, most fittingly, is the junior \nSenator from Maine at this time we in the Senate are speaking to the \nnomination of the former distinguished senior Senator from Maine--most \nappropriate.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I, too, join in sending my \ncongratulations to our new Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, someone \nwith whom I have had the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee now for the past 8 years.\n  Bill has been a most articulate and most thoughtful member of that \ncommittee--obviously, someone whom we have all come to respect, someone \nof great intellect and experience, arriving at the House in 1973 and \nspending a significant part of his lifetime serving the people of Maine \nand serving the people of this country.\n  He is known as a writer. I think he has published eight books, and so \nit was always interesting to listen to his statements in the Chamber. \nThey were always well-reasoned. They were always well-researched. They \nwere always thoughtful. They were challenging and provocative. Bill had \nan independent streak which was a great asset. It allowed him to escape \nthe orthodoxy of the political mantra we sometimes find ourselves \nrepeating without a great deal of forethought. Yet Bill's challenge, I \nthink, raised issues that we needed to discuss and needed to consider. \nWhile I did not always come to the same conclusion he did, I always \nrespected his thoughtfulness and respect for the conclusions he \nreached.\n  He now assumes a very difficult assignment. These are not easy times \nat the Department of Defense, not because we find ourselves engaged in \nany major conflict but because, for a period of more than a decade, we \nhave been undertaking a very significant reorganization following the \ndemise of the cold war and following our success in the gulf. This is \nnot without consequence, and we are now approaching, I believe, our \n12th or 13th consecutive year of reductions in defense spending.\n  That has taken its toll. It has placed us in a very difficult \nposition. Secretary-designate Cohen this morning in testimony before \nthe Armed Services Committee talked about the world as it is today, the \nchallenges that exist in that world, the threats that we still face, \nalbeit in a different form, and the need to be militarily prepared and \nto have a strong national security.\n  We are undertaking a quadrennial review process which is going to \nforce us, as Secretary Cohen said, to make and face some very difficult \nchoices. The declining budget has not allowed us to maintain the kind \nof capability that many of us feel is necessary if we are going to \npursue a two-regional-response strategy. We face some serious questions \nregarding modernization, balancing that with the need for readiness and \nthe need for adequate compensation for our personnel and adequate \nbenefits for our personnel, as well as the research and development \nneeded to take us into the next century.\n  All of these difficult choices will now fall to our new Secretary of \nDefense. He is clearly someone with whom both Republicans and Democrats \ncan work. In fact, we have worked together probably in a more \nbipartisan way on the Armed Services Committee than any other committee \nin the Senate. And so we stand ready to work with him in attempting to \naddress some of these fundamental questions that are going to determine \nthe course of our defense in future years.\n  I asked Bill Cohen this morning what experiences in his life and \nparticularly during his tenure in Congress helped shape his views in \nterms of the role of the military and the role of defense. He shared \nwith us a response which I had hoped he would give and was pleased that \nhe did give in outlining some of the experiences he has had in \ntraveling to and visiting with and being with our troops as they serve \naround the world.\n  We are often criticized here for some of the travel that we take. I \nnote the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn], is in the Chamber. I will never \nforget--and\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\nit has been a basis of some of the critical decisions I have had to \nmake regarding defense expenditures and defense policy--the trip we \ntook to Kuwait right after the war and watching Senator Glenn interact \nwith marines and naval personnel and military personnel and they react \nwith him. Senator McCain was with us. There is no substitute for \nleaving the charts and leaving the Vu-Graphs and leaving the cold facts \non a piece of paper and getting out in the field and talking to \nsoldiers, whether it is generals or captains or privates or sergeants.\n  There is no substitute for learning some of the difficulties that \ntake place, in terms of putting together an adequate defense, some of \nthe challenges that face our country and face those personnel. There is \nno substitute for dealing with that on a personal basis. Senator Cohen \nshared that view and shared the view that, when you do that, when you \npersonalize our decisions, when you realize that someone's son or \ndaughter is going to be put at risk in defense of this country, it \ngives you a different perspective in terms of the kind of equipment, \nthe kind of quality of life, the kind of support for their family, the \nkind of training and, frankly, the kind of decisions we make in terms \nof their deployment. I think it is important for every Member to have \nthat perspective.\n  I have taken advantage of the opportunity as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee to travel as much as the schedule will allow and \nspend as much time with our troops in the field as time allows. It has \nbeen just an invaluable experience. I know Senator Cohen will place \nthose experiences at the forefront of his thinking, in terms of the \ndecisions he has to make in the Department of Defense.\n  I also congratulate Secretary Perry for just an outstanding tenure as \nSecretary of Defense. I was one of the people who raised the question \nearly on as to whether Secretary Perry, while I acknowledged his \nmasterful technological skills and management skills, whether he could \nbe an effective Secretary of Defense in a political world, trying to \ndeal with all of us and the give and take that takes place, because he \nis a mild, soft-spoken man. But he is a man of steel. It does not take \nshouting and it does not take fist pounding to be effective. Secretary \nPerry proved that.\n  I watched him in negotiations with the Soviets and with the Russians. \nI watched him in serious policy debates with some of our allies. I \nwatched him interact with us on very important questions relative to \ndefense, in testimony before our committee. He was a model of civility, \na model of decency, a great intellect, a thoughtful, articulate \nspokesman for the Department of Defense. He served this country well \nand deserves our accolades.\n  Finally, let me say when Bill Cohen and I were in the House of \nRepresentatives we would participate in the annual Democrat and \nRepublican baseball game. Bill Cohen was known for the best fastball on \nthe team. He struck some fear in the hearts and minds of some of our \nDemocrat opponents. It made me glad I was a Republican. I used to warm \nup Bill Cohen and that ball was not always down the middle of the \nplate. I never saw anybody really dig in against him.\n  There probably are Members of the House today who owe their health to \nthe fact that every time Bill and I would try to run over from the \nSenate to play in that game, which Bill was then senior Senator, \nSenator Mitchell would not adjourn the Senate for us so we could \nparticipate. We had to carry our beepers. Inevitably, Senator Mitchell \nor someone else would call a vote and, before Bill made it to the mound \nto strike fear in the Democrats, the beeper would go off. I always \nsuspected Senator Mitchell had some kind of communication system with \nhis Democrat colleagues in the House and they would say, ``Cohen is \nwarming up in the bullpen, call a vote and get him out of here. Our \nvery lives are at risk.''\n  The ability to throw those high hard ones and sometimes keep his \nadversaries a little bit looser at the plate than maybe they would \notherwise be, will serve him well as Secretary of Defense in the tough \nnegotiations that he has coming before him. I wish him nothing but \nsuccess and I look forward to working with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks all \nthe people made regarding our new Secretary of Defense, now made \nofficial in that capacity this afternoon.\n  I have known Bill for many years. I worked with him. I think he will \nbe a great Secretary of Defense. He will try to fill some very big \nshoes over there that Bill Perry leaves, who I think turned into one of \nthe greatest Secretaries of Defense since there has been that position \nin Government.\n  But I have talked to Bill personally. He knows my admiration for him \nand my support for him in that office. So I just want to associate \nmyself with all the other fine congratulations that are being offered \nhere on the floor today.\n  Madam President, I also rise today to introduce the Human Research \nSubject Protection Act of 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is a \nlofty goal. I subscribe to that goal.\n  During my tenure in the U.S. Senate I have served on the \nAppropriations Committee and on the subcommittee which has jurisdiction \nover the Department of Health and Human Services and the funding \nresponsibility for the National Institutes of Health.\n  I am pleased to note that, notwithstanding very severe budget \nconstraints over the years, the subcommittee has consistently raised \nthe funding, whether it was Senator Weicker, Senator Chiles, or Senator \nHarkin, or under my stewardship as chairman.\n  When I joined the committee in 1981 the appropriations were $3.6 \nbillion. That has now risen to $12.7 billion. Since I became chairman \nin 1996 we raised the funding by 5.7 percent, and in 1997, fiscal year \n1997, 6.9 percent, some $820 million to a total now of $12.7 billion \ndollars. When the resolution calls for doubling NIH spending within 5 \nyears, that is a very, very tough goal and a very, very tough objective \nto me. That would really call for an increase of expenditures of about \n$2.5 billion a year. My own view is that it would be a priority worth \nmeeting to reach the goal of $2.5 billion a year if the allocation to \nthe subcommittee did permit that. But I have grave doubts that will be \npossible, although it is as I say a lofty goal.\n  We do need more grants in that field. There are some 27,000 grants \nnow in operation. But only a fraction of the applications receive the \ngrants, and there are many worthwhile grants that ought to be accepted.\n  There have been tremendous advances in breast cancer and prostate \ncancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and many, many more.\n  What I want to say today and do say is that as chairman of the \nsubcommittee I am prepared to commit to an increase in the next year's \nbudget of 7.5 percent, which would amount to some $950 million.\n  In making that statement, I want to emphasize how difficult it will \nbe to reach $950 million and a 7.5-percent commitment. But in \narticulating, stating that view, that is a strong stretch, considering \nthe funding and the allocation which is present for the subcommittee \nwhich I chair. So I invite my colleagues to look toward alternative \nmethods of financing if we are to be able to meet the $2.5 billion \nmark, which we really ought to do. But I did want to make a statement \ntoday, following the introduction of the resolution yesterday, that \nthere is the commitment that I am prepared to undertake the 7.5-percent \nfigure or $950 million.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. Additionally, I am \npleased to support the nomination of our former colleague, Bill Cohen \nto be Secretary of Defense.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n  I am concerned, however, about the general direction of President \nClinton's foreign policy.\n  It has been a policy with very little direction. I fear that the U.S. \narmed forces have become an international cleanup force sent to all \nparts of the world that have no strategic relationship to the United \nStates. Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and other U.N. peace-keeping missions \nhave been costly with little tangible benefits for the United States.\n  In the case of Bosnia, clearly, the administration misled the \nCongress about the length of time troops would be present there. Only \nafter the election did the President have the courage to tell the \nAmerican people that the troops would not be coming home in December of \n1996 and that the deployment would extend another 18 months.\n  Further, with respect to Bosnia, it has now become apparent that this \nconflict dragged on longer than it should have because the \nadministration and Democratic leaders in Congress blocked arm shipments \nfor the Bosnians. Yet, in a secret policy, they allowed Iran to arm the \nBosnian muslims. This administration told the Congress one thing and \nIran another.\n  This is an unacceptable way to conduct American foreign policy.\n  The Clinton administration has pursued what I call the un-Reagan \ndoctrine. Rather than preside over the decline and fall of the last \nremaining communist regimes, this administration has reached out and \nbefriended them. It gave diplomatic recognition to Vietnam. We provided \nforeign aid to North Korea, and we sought warmer relations with Fidel \nCastro until he shot down innocent civilians out of the sky. In \ncontrast, this administration ignored, almost to its peril, the new \ndemocracies in Eastern Europe and Russia, to the point that the \nCommunists tried to stage an electoral comeback in Russia.\n  This is not foreign policy America can be proud of.\n  Another problem with this administration is its handling of our \nfuture security from nuclear attack.\n  In my view, nothing is more important to the national defense of this \ncountry than deployment of a national ballistic missile defense for the \nUnited States. More than 25 countries now possess or are seeking to \nacquire nuclear weapons.\n  We have to address this issue--we cannot ignore it.\n  I would hope that the two people we are confirming today, both of \nwhom are honorable, decent, hard-working people will work on these \nissues and improve our defense and foreign policy in the next 4 years.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish Senator Cohen well in his new \nposition. I was pleased to serve with him for the last 4 years, and we \nwill certainly miss him in the Senate, but the United States will be \nbetter off by having him as Secretary of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S630-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Mr. Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and Mr. Craig of Idaho, in introducing the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1997. As a cosponsor of the legislation passed by the \nSenate during the 104th Congress, I believe this legislation represents \nthe best means of ensuring that the Department of Energy meet its legal \nobligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998.\n  Last year, nearly identical legislation was adopted by a strong \nbipartisan vote in the Senate. And with nuclear waste scattered over \nsome 35 States, including my home State of Minnesota, it was no \nsurprise that the national interest in resolving this issue is strong. \nHowever, a variety of factors, including a lack of action by the House \nof Representatives, led to the demise of the 104th Congress' bill.\n  But support for enacting a real solution has never been stronger. \nLast July, the U.S. Court of Appeals reaffirmed that the DOE continues \nto have responsibility for permanently storing our Nation's commercial \nwaste. It is no wonder, considering our nation's ratepayers have \nalready contributed some $12 billion; over $250 million from \nMinnesotans alone.\n  Having recently returned from Yucca Mountain, the proposed permanent \nstorage site located in Nevada, I believe much progress has been made \nover the last year. But after 15 years and with nearly half the nuclear \ntrust fund depleted, there still remains no measurable value and the \nAmerican public is fed up with empty promises from their Federal \nGovernment. They deserve action now.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 delivers such action. It \nprovides all the tools necessary to break our interim storage impasse. \nFurthermore, it provides mechanisms to complete the characterization of \nYucca Mountain and gets the program moving out of the current \nstalemate.\n  With 1998 just around the corner, timely action on this legislation \nis critical. For States like Minnesota, which stand to lose nearly 30 \npercent of its overall energy resources, action should have occurred \nlast year. And now, with the confirmation of a new Energy Secretary \nrequired, and the program in transition, Congress is faced with some \ntough challenges but our resolve must remain strong. And the \nintroduction of this legislation today is our first step.\n  In the coming weeks and months, we will be asking our colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this long overdue legislation. Rarely does the \nCongress have the opportunity which meets the twin goals of protecting \nour environment and strengthening our economy. Mr. President, I hope \nthat the support we had last Congress will be even stronger this year. \nI would encourage my colleagues to add their name today as cosponsors \nto the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S631-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S631-S632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE CANNELL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mike Cannell, a \ndairy farmer and sustainable agriculture advocate from Cazenovia, WI \nwho perished in a farming accident on December 2, 1996 while helping a \nneighbor unload corn. Mike died the same way he lived--helping others.\n  While those of us fortunate enough to have known Mike will miss him \nterribly, he has left us a great gift: his tireless work toward \nrestoring and sustaining an agricultural community of healthy and \neconomically viable family farms. His support of sustainable \nagriculture reflected his approach to life: balance. Sustainable \nagriculture is an integrated system of production that provides an \nadequate supply of food and fiber in a manner that enhances \nenvironmental quality, makes efficient use of limited natural \nresources, sustains small and medium sized farms and improves the \nquality of life for farmers and the community. It is an agricultural \nsystem that balances the many needs of our people and our planet.\n  Mike not only recognized the economic importance and the \nenvironmental benefits of a large number of small scale family farms, \nhe recognized the ability of successfully owning and operating one's \nown farm to instill a sense of pride, accomplishment and satisfaction \nin the farmer-owner. In Mike's view, these things were at least as \nimportant as the many economic and environmental reasons to sustain \nsmall farms. In all things, especially farming, he sought balance.\n  I first met Mike Cannell when I was a State senator. He, along with \nother dairy farmers, met with me to express concern about the \ndevelopment of a new dairy technology that he felt was ill-timed, \nunnecessary and irresponsible. That technology was Bovine Growth \nHormone, a product which when injected in cows results in greater milk \nproduction. The arguments made against BGH were many: increased milk \nproduction necessarily lowers milk prices; the technology will favor \nlarge farms over smaller ones; small farms will be driven out of \nbusiness; there may be indirect but harmful environmental impacts, and \nmany more.\n  But Mike's objections to BGH ran deeper. He did not believe in \ntechnology for technology's sake. He felt scientists and society's \nleaders were obligated to consider and recognize cultural traditions \nand predominant value systems of the community for which they were \ndeveloping new technology. To him, the economic benefits of technology \nhad to be weighed against the real or perceived ramifications on \nsociety. Mike didn't believe that the universities and private sector\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\nfirms developing BGH had done that. He predicted the outrage that \nintroduction of the product caused among dairy farmers and consumers in \nWisconsin. To this day, many dairy products in Wisconsin are labeled as \nfree of BGH in part, due to Mike's efforts. As usual, Mike's balanced \napproach was right on target.\n  Mike, however, did not reject new technology on its face and in fact, \nembraced and doggedly promoted technologies and new practices that \nadvanced his goal of a sustainable agricultural community consisting of \nsmall and medium sized family farms.\n  Mike's approach to dairy farming was unique when he began milking \ncows 15 years ago.\n  He was an intensive rotational grazier--a practice that many said \ncouldn't work in Wisconsin because of our harsh winter climate. Unlike \nconfinement dairying, rotational grazing requires fewer chemical \ninputs, less labor, less capital and is environmentally beneficial as \nwell. Mike, however, viewed grazing in a broader context. Grazing was \nnot only an environmentally friendly method of producing quality milk \nat reduced cost, it was also capable of supporting a family and \nproviding a high quality of life. Mike chose to become a dairyman \nbecause of the value he place on these last two criteria. Mike, when \nspeaking about grazing, put it in this context: ``This is the real \nreason we live: for our families and for our communities. Any practice \nthat promises to make us better farmers, in part, I evaluate by how \nmuch it contributes to our families and communities.'' For technology \nto be appropriate it had to be appropriate for the farm and the \ncommunity surrounding it. Again, this was Mike's balance. He supported \ntechnology and practices that promoted the goals he believed to be most \nimportant.\n  Mike Cannell was an innovative leader among Wisconsin farmers, \nresolutely seeking solutions to the complex problems facing our dairy \nindustry. To many farmers in Wisconsin, those problems appear \ninsurmountable; so complicated, multifarious, and seemingly \nincomprehensible that one person couldn't possibly make a dent in them. \nMike not only believed he could make a difference, he believed he had \nan obligation to use his talents to do so.\n  Even more remarkable than Mike's willingness to actively intervene in \nagricultural problems, was Mike's concept of a solution: one which was \nnot only achievable and effective but which was also socially and \nmorally responsible. In a manner more effective than few others I've \nknown, Mike was able to articulate the problems and identify solutions. \nHe was not shy at criticizing entities he felt were standing in the way \nof a sustainable family farm sector. But he always went beyond \ncriticism to suggest solutions and to actively work with the entities--\nincluding universities, local, State and Federal Government--he was \ncriticizing to eliminate the barriers facing family farms.\n  But Mike went still further. Rather than rely on others to solve all \nthe dilemmas facing family farmers, he believed farmers also had both \nthe ability and responsibility to help each other. And he put that into \npractice too.\n  Mike Cannell believed so strongly in the ability of rotational \ngrazing to reverse the dramatic losses of Wisconsin family dairy \nfarmers in the past decade that he spent the last 10 years trying to \nteach other farmers how to become graziers. He is responsible for \nstarting a grazier technology transfer discussion group on the \nInternet--known as a List Serve--so that dairymen could share their \nexpertise on grazing. That group now claims more than one thousand \nmembers. He was also the founder of both regional and statewide farmer \nto farmer grazing networks, known as the Ocooch Graziers and \nGrassworks. Because of Mike Cannell, rotational grazing is no longer \nconsidered an unusual dairying practice in Wisconsin. It is fast \nbecoming mainstream.\n  Mike also took initiative to solve one of Wisconsin's most \nchallenging farm problems--the retirement of older dairy farmers \nwithout younger farmers to replace them. The long hours, hard work, low \nreturn and often dim outlook for dairying have dissuaded many young \npeople from entering the dairy industry. Rather than consider this an \ninevitable outcome, Mike took steps to encourage young people to enter \ndairying. While his positive attitude might have been enough to \npersuade young farmers that there was a future in dairy farming, to \npersuade the cynics he founded the School for Beginning Dairy Farmers \nto teach young farmers how to be successful in a difficult profession.\n  Mike's contributions to the sustainable agriculture community are \nreal and measurable and he will be remembered for them for many years. \nBut Mike will likely be remembered more for his steady and unswerving \npursuit of a way of life he loved and from which he gained great joy, \nhis strong belief in the value of that way of life, his efforts to \nshare his success with others, and most important, for his commitment \nto community and family. In Mike's view, all things in life and \nagriculture should be conducted with an eye toward how they contribute \nto community and family. It is a valuable lesson to learn. And it is \nthe world's great loss that Mike Cannell won't be around to teach us \nanymore.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S631-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S632-S633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Paul Tsongas, \nwho lost his battle against cancer on Saturday. I have lost a great \nfriend; our Nation has lost an extraordinary American who defined the \nconcept of public service and whose courage and conviction set an \nexample for each and every one of us.\n  A son of Greek immigrants in Lowell, MA, Paul Tsongas worked in his \nfather's drycleaning business, and served in the Peace Corps, as a \nLowell City Councilor, as a Middlesex County Commissioner, as a U.S. \nCongressman and as a U.S. Senator in the seat that I am now honored to \noccupy.\n  Paul was able to achieve so much in his life because no matter where \nhe went, no matter what office he held, he never left the people of \nLowell. He instinctively understood not only their problems but also \nhow government could help provide some of the solutions which were \nnecessary to resolve them.\n  In 1992, when George Bush looked unbeatable, Paul Tsongas ran for the \nDemocratic Presidential nomination because he knew his ideas for our \nfuture were better.\n  We must not forget the timeless principles for which Paul Tsongas \nfought throughout his career in elective office: balancing the Federal \nbudget and establishing sound fiscal principles for the Federal \nGovernment, investing in our country and our children, and building our \neconomy so future generations can attain the dreams which seem to elude \nus today.\n  Although Paul did not win the nomination, he became the catalyst who \nturned the national spotlight on our fiscal policies and changed the \npolitical dialog in the United States forever.\n  After the campaign, Paul Tsongas joined with Warren Rudman and Pete \nPeterson to found the Concord Coalition to promote fiscal \nresponsibility. This organization again and again has drawn national \nattention to our Nation's fiscal agenda.\n  Since the 1992 Presidential campaign, we have cut the Federal budget \ndeficit by more than half. The question in Washington is no longer \n``Can we balance the budget?'', but ``How soon can we do so?'' Much of \nthe progress we have made can be attributed to Paul Tsongas and his \neconomic call to arms.\n  The rebuilt, reinvigorated city of Lowell, MA is another long-lasting \nmemorial to Paul. He as much or more than any other person shepherded \nthe revitalization program through the Congress, and by seeing and \nbreathing life into a local pride and spirit that were still alive, he \ntransformed a rundown mill town into an international destination with \nan amazing story to tell and show visitors from near and far.\n  Paul Tsongas' accomplishments only explain part of what made him so \nextraordinary. There is no way to explain the impact on others of his \ndecency, integrity and courage. But that impact was real and \npronounced.\n  In 1983, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The next year \nhe retired from the Senate in order to spend more time with his wife \nNiki, and his three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly. He \nsuccessfully battled cancer for over a decade with a sense of grace and \na strength of character that are remarkable.\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\n  It is terribly hard to acknowledge the death of such a person. Paul \nwill be greatly and genuinely missed because he was greatly and \ngenuinely loved. That is a compliment to which all of us can aspire \nwhen we leave this Earth. But Paul's life took him a step beyond even \nthat status among his family and friends and all who know or observed \nhim in his public service.\n  We can say truthfully and appreciatively that we are better people \nbecause of the example Paul Tsongas set during his life. In that way, \nhe not only improved the lives of many in very direct ways, he will \ncontinue to live on as an inspiration to us.\n  We will miss him, but we are comforted by what he has given to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S632-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n         the campaign finance reform and disclosure act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill that I introduce is the \nCampaign Finance Reform and Disclosure Act of 1997. This important \nlegislation will correct several of the abuses that we have seen take \nplace under the present system and will demonstrate to the American \npeople that we in Congress intend to do everything possible to bring \ncampaign-related activities into the light of day. Moreover, this bill \nwill not force the American taxpayer to further subsidize Federal \ncampaigns, nor will it impose an elaborate new system of costly and \nburdensome campaign regulations. First, the act will require that at \nleast 60 percent of a Senate candidate's campaign funds come from \nindividuals within that Senator's home State. It will terminate the \nmass mail franking privilege for Senators during the year in which he \nor she is seeking election, and thereby end one of the more substantial \nadvantages of incumbents over challengers.\n  The bill will also make the contribution limits for political action \ncommittees equal to those in place for individuals, and will index that \nuniform limit to the rate of inflation. I believe PAC's serve a \nbeneficial and necessary purpose in our system by allowing groups of \nindividuals, whether at their place of employment, through an issue \nadvocacy group, or elsewhere, to participate in a more direct way in \nthe grassroots political process that is at the heart of our electoral \nsystem. But I want those PACs to have the same allowances and the same \nlimitations as individuals, so that one does not have a \ndisproportionate advantage over the other. The bill accomplishes this \nin a simple and responsible way by leveling the playing field between \npeople who contribute to candidates directly and those who choose to \nleverage their contribution through PAC's. Individuals who wish to \ncontribute money should continue to have that choice.\n  However, I do not believe that candidates should have the right to \nbuy and then resell their office. Therefore, this bill will also place \na limitation of $250,000 on the amount that a congressional candidate \nmay repay himself from campaign funds for personal loans he or she \nmakes to the campaign. Again, this will help level the playing field \nfor all candidates.\n  In addition, the Campaign Finance Reform and Disclosure Act will ban \nonce and for all campaign contributions by noncitizens. The use of \ncampaign funds for personal use will also be totally banned. And \npolitical parties will be prohibited from accepting contributions \nearmarked for specific candidates, thereby bypassing the limitations \nthat are in our laws today.\n  Mr. President, these are the main provisions of my legislation to \nreform our campaign finance laws. As the Senate continues to address \nthis most important issue, I encourage my colleagues to review these \nsimple and workable proposals and to answer the American people's call \nfor reform in this area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 180. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nmarried individuals to contribute to an IRA even if their spouse is a \nparticipant in a pension plan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       homemaker ira legislation\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this bill closes a loophole in the \nhomemaker IRA bill that we passed in the last Congress. We made the \nhomemakers of our country equal to wage earners in their ability to \nsave for their retirement futures through individual retirement \naccounts. Presently, every person who is working at home or working \noutside the home can set aside $2,000 a year that earns tax-free \ninterest for their retirement security. However, what families are not \nable to do under existing law and what this bill will enable them to \ndo, up to $40,000 in income, is to save under a homemaker IRA even if \nthe homemaker's spouse has a pension plan. This revision is critical to \nencourage average-income families to save for their retirement.\n  Mr. President, if our young people will avail themselves of this \nwonderful new opportunity which Congress has given them to allow \nhomemakers as well as those who work outside the home to contribute \n$2,000 a year to an IRA, by the time they retire at age 65, they will \nbe able to build a nest egg of a remarkable $1 million, if they both \nstart contributing the maximum allowable amount from age 25--$1 million \nfor this working, one-income family. If they even wait until they are \n35, they would be able to build up $500,000 for retirement.\n  This is an opportunity that I hope every young couple will look at \nand take advantage of to provide for their retirement security. Last \nyear we in Congress did the right thing by extending the IRA to \nhomemakers. Now we simply need to ensure that this opportunity is \navailable to all families of up to $40,000 of income. This bill will do \njust that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Breaux, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mr. Coats, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Ford, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Bond, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Burns, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kohl, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Robb, Mr. Gregg,\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\n        Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 181. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat installment sales of certain farmers not be treated as a \npreference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       the family farm alternative minimum tax relief act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, as I introduce this legislation \ncalled the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997, it \nis a way that 54 of us in this body--and we will still yet get more \ncosponsors, I am sure--are saying, ``Shame on the Internal Revenue \nService.'' This is our effort to hold the tax-collecting bureaucracy of \nthe U.S. Government accountable to what Congress intended. We are \nholding them accountable to the taxpayers, and we will reduce somewhat \nthe power of the IRS which comes through intimidation. I have worked \nvery closely with three other Senators in a bipartisan fashion, Senator \nDorgan, Senator Gorton, and Senator Baucus. I thank them for their \nleadership and their cooperation. We have been joined now by 50 of our \ncolleagues in a broad bipartisan effort, with the support of the \nleadership of both parties, meaning Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. I \nthink that the sort of membership cosponsoring this legislation speaks \nlouder, frankly, than anything I can say about the rationale behind \nthis bill.\n  This bill repeals a very large problem created by the IRS regarding \nfarmer-deferred contract arrangements. The problem is currently at a \ncrisis level because it is income tax time. Particularly, it is income \ntax time for the farmers of America who must file earlier than others.\n  The IRS has found a way to tax farmers for their deferred sales \ncontracts. This is contrary to congressional intent. I know the \nPresiding Officer is from Kansas and he understands this, but some \nmight not. A deferred sales contract is a situation where a farmer \ndelivers his crop this year and gets paid by the local cooperative \nelevator, or privately owned elevator, or some other buyer next year. \nSince Congress intends farmers to be able to use the cash accounting \nmethod, deferred contracts have been a perfectly acceptable method to \ndefer income to another year for taxation. It has been perfectly legal \nover a long period of time.\n  Now the IRS has unilaterally decided to deem these traditional \ndeferred sales contracts as if, in the words of the IRS, these were \n``installment sales'' agreements. The problem is that installment sales \nare subject to the alternative minimum tax. Then, of course, by doing \nthis, the IRS puts the family farmer in trouble for things that, over a \nlong period of time, have been entirely legal.\n  This IRS initiative is a way for the IRS to deny farmers the use of \nthe cash accounting method. When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of \n1986, it specifically intended that farmers retain the cash accounting \nmethod. That same act repealed the income averaging method for farmers. \nIncome averaging was a way for farmers to level out their regularly \nlarge fluctuations of income between years. Farmers can have those \nfluctuations because, while local farmers are affected by local weather \nand the weather all over the world.\n  Listen to the prices of soybeans today. You will find that whether or \nnot it rains right now in Brazil or Argentina is impacting the price of \nsoybeans in Iowa and Kansas. The crop prices are affected by crop \ndisease and a host of other things that ordinary taxpayers take for \ngranted, that farmers have no control over. When income averaging was \nrepealed, Congress intended farmers to retain the cash method of \naccounting. We are here today with this bill because the IRS has \neffectively repealed cash accounting, in opposition to the intent of \nCongress.\n  Cash accounting is repealed because the traditional deferred sales \ncontracts are the practical application of cash accounting. By applying \nthe alternative minimum tax, IRS has repealed the deferral in deferred \ncontracts. They are contracts but no longer deferred income. Thus, the \nIRS has unilaterally broken the promise that Congress made to farmers, \nand our legislation rights that wrong.\n  Ironically, the IRS knows it is in the wrong on this matter, but, of \ncourse, the IRS is going to go ahead anyway. After all, they encourage, \nfrom the top to the bottom of the IRS bureaucracy, auditors to go out \nand find all the income they can to tax, and to stretch the law as far \nas they can. And if they do it in this instance, in the case of taxing \ndeferred sales contracts, do you think the Internal Revenue \nCommissioner or the Secretary of the Treasury is going to say to some \nauditor out there--slap their hands and say, ``You are wrong''? No, \nthey are not going to do that. That would be the right thing to do, but \nthey are not going to do that because that would discourage this \nattitude we have had in the IRS. They want to go out and get every \ndollar they can, even if they have to stretch the law to do it.\n  Well, in a sense, the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin--and I \nthank him--and IRS Commissioner Richardson--and I thank her--have \nagreed that this problem results from what they call legislative \noversight in 1986, because they do not want to say their auditors may \nbe wrong. So, they have agreed, in the spirit of this Presidency, this \nsecond term of office, that we are going to be bipartisan and we are \ngoing to work together to solve these problems. So Secretary Rubin and \nIRS Commissioner Richardson have said they would not oppose this \nlegislation. They agree that Congress did not intend for farmer \ndeferred contracts to make these contract incomes subject to the AMT. \nHowever, as I indicated, these two individuals believe they still must \nenforce what they know to be a bad law. Hence, the urgent need for our \nlegislation.\n  You know, it would be really simple for the Commissioner to say, ``We \nare wrong. We are not going to collect this money.'' But they cannot do \nthat, presumably.\n  Not only is this ruling of the IRS effective right now and into the \nfuture, it is also retroactive. It is retroactive because, since it is \na new interpretation of an old law, the IRS can pretend it has not \nchanged its position, though it obviously has. Since it is retroactive, \nfarmers are exposed to audit, not only for the current year and upon \nfuture years, but also on previous years. This problem is now in crisis \nproportions for farmers. The IRS made its retroactive change in October \nof 1996. At that time, much of the 1996 crop was already harvested. \nFarmers had already entered the traditional binding deferred contracts. \nThey normally do this throughout the 12 months of the year. So, do we \nwonder why it is all of a sudden a crisis among farmers?\n  Before the IRS release, farmers had every reason to believe they \nwould enjoy the same legal tax treatment previously allowed by IRS.\n  Congress and the President must address and solve this problem as \nsoon as possible. Farmers are required to file their tax returns before \nMarch 1, 1997. This is unlike most other taxpayers who have until April \n15. If Congress waits until after March 1 to fix this problem, then \nhundreds of thousands of farmers all across this country will already \nhave been injured.\n  The IRS knows it is wrong on this issue, but it is out of control. It \ninjures its own public relations by actions such as this. It is a sad \ncommentary that it takes an emergency action of Congress to make the \nIRS do its job as Congress intended. Nonetheless, our bill will do \nexactly that.\n  Mr. President, besides being on the Finance Committee where this \nlegislation will be considered, I happen to also be a member of a \ncommission the Congress set up last year to restructure the IRS. There \nare two Senators, two House Members, and 13 people from the private \nsector on that commission. We have 1 year from last fall to make our \nreport to the Congress.\n  The charter from the Congress to all 17 of us is to, in a sense, make \nthe IRS more user friendly. Although we are at the same time kept from \nrecommending changes in tax policy, how we administer the existing Tax \nCode is what we are dealing. We are examining how the IRS does its work \nand what we can do to enhance that from an efficiency standpoint. We \nwant to save the taxpayers money and also to make IRS more customer \nfriendly.\n  After 6 months of being on this commission--though the ultimate good \nis\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\nmaking the IRS more efficient and more customer friendly--it is my \nopinion that we need to make the Tax Code so simple that every single \ntaxpayer understands the Tax Code as well as any IRS auditor \nunderstands that Tax Code. The complexity of the Tax Code gives the IRS \nits power. It is the mystery of the Tax Code, a mystery that the \nbureaucrat can sort through and understand, and the inability of the \ntaxpayer to do that which brings the power of the auditor that gives \nIRS its power. The power to intimidate comes through the tax system.\n  So I ask my colleagues to observe the action of the commission to \nrestructure the IRS and work with Senator Kerrey from Nebraska and \nmyself as representatives of the Senate on this issue. Let us know your \nopinions, but also understand that the complexity of the Tax Code is \nthe major problem that we must fix. The bill that I am introducing \ntoday is just one very small example of the complexity of the Tax Code. \nIt is an action against the intimidation of the IRS and impacts. In \nmost cases, IRS usually attacks maybe just a few hundred taxpayers \nthroughout the United States on some issues. On this particular issue, \naffecting a practice that has been legal by the farmers of the United \nStates of America for decades, they are attacking thousands and \nthousands. They want farmers to think that all of a sudden what they \nhave been doing is now presumably wrong.\n  I hope that Congress will work very quickly to pass this legislation \nbefore that March 1 deadline. It is badly needed to prevent an \nirreparable injury to farmers, and to make the Tax Code more \nunderstandable for the taxpayers.

Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for giving me the \n     opportunity to meet with you to discuss your concerns about \n     an Internal Revenue Service Technical Advice Memorandum or \n     TAM concerning the tax treatment of farmers. The TAM stated \n     that farmers utilizing deferred payment contracts for the \n     sale of farm commodities were required to include the amount \n     of the advanced sale for Alternative Minimum Tax or AMT \n     purposes in the year of sale.\n       As I told you in our meeting, we believe that this TAM \n     correctly interprets current law. I understand that Congress \n     may consider legislation early next session to change this \n     result for farmers who use the cash method of accounting. As \n     you may be aware, Secretary Rubin, in a letter to Senator \n     Daschle on the same issue, stated the following regarding \n     this legislative change, ``We would support the goals of this \n     effort, as a reasonable tax policy, and recognize it is \n     likely that Congress was not aware of the effect that its \n     1986 amendments to the AMT would have on farmers. I welcome \n     the opportunity to work with you to address this matter \n     through corrective legislation.''\n       We also will be pleased to work with you and Treasury on \n     the corrective legislation. Please feel free to contact me if \n     I can be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Margaret Miner Richardson.\n\n  sMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I are \nintroducing legislation called the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax \nRelief Act. This legislation deals with a tax matter affecting farmers \nthat is a foreign subject to some people. But, simplified, what has \nhappened is the Internal Revenue Service has turned logic on its head \nand said to family farmers, ``We're going to ask you to pay taxes on \nincome you have not yet received.'' There is no basis for them doing \nthat. That is not what we ever intended them to do.\n  It is not the way they interpreted the law previously or the \ninstructions for IRS auditors and accountants all across the country or \nfarmers across the country, but they have now decided to change the way \nthey do business. The brain is apparently disconnected from the hand, \nand the hand writes that farmers should pay taxes on income they have \nnot received.\n  I introduced the first piece of legislation on this. The Senator from \nWashington pointed out it was introduced in the House. But 18 months \nbefore it was introduced in the House in the last Congress, I \nintroduced legislation to try to correct this.\n  When we introduced it today, Senator Grassley from Iowa and I have \norganized a group of 54 Senators who support this legislation, \nincluding the cosponsorship of the Republican leader and the Democratic \nleader, including the support of the Treasury Secretary and of the \nagricultural community.\n  We are going to pass this. It ought not be necessary for us to pass \nthis legislation, because the IRS should not have made the mistake it \nmade. It should not have turned logic on its head. But we must pass it \nbecause in this country when the IRS makes a mistake, everybody pays. \nSomebody once said, ``You have a right to be wrong in America.'' But \nthe IRS does not have that right. When they are wrong in this case, \nfamily farmers are going to have to pay unfairly. And we are going to \nchange that.\n  Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senator Grassley and a majority of \nour colleagues in the Senate in reintroducing my legislation to rectify \na serious tax problem confronting our family farmers.\n  The Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has, in my opinion, mistakenly \ntaken a position that threatens to hit many farmers with huge tax bills \nfor using deferred payment commodity contracts, which have been \nroutinely used in their businesses for decades. In my judgment, the \nIRS's position is dead-wrong and is going to impose an unintended and \nunacceptable financial hardship on the farming industry.\n  For years, family farmers have used deferred payment contracts to \nsell their commodities in order to better manage their business income. \nFor example, a typical grain contract between a farmer and grain \nelevator calls upon a farmer to sell and deliver grain to a grain \nelevator--often because the farmer does not have adequate storage--for \na fixed amount. In many cases, one or more payments paid by the \nelevator to the farmer under the contract occur after the close of the \nfarmer's taxable year.\n  For regular tax purposes, farmers are allowed to defer income from \nthe deferred payments under the grain contracts in computing their \nregular tax liability. But because the IRS apparently now views all \ndeferred payment grain contracts as installment sales, it now requires \nthem to add back this income in computing the Alternative Minimum Tax \n[AMT] in the tax year preceding the year of payment. As a result, \nthousands of family farmers are potentially facing hefty tax bills \nbecause they are being whip-sawed by a new IRS policy which effectively \nrepeals their ability to use such contracts, and to benefit from the \ncash basis method of accounting.\n  To make matters worse, many farmers were advised by tax experts and \nIRS field representatives, for that matter, that some traditional \ndeferred payment commodity contracts will not amount to an installment \nsale that would require an AMT calculation. For this reason, many \nfarmers have not made AMT adjustments on their income tax returns. Now \nthey are being\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\ntold by the IRS that they may owe large tax bills on income that they \nwill not receive until later. This position is based upon an incorrect \ninterpretation by the IRS which ignores the fact that our family \nfarmers are, by law, permitted to manage their business operations on a \ncash basis.\n  That's why we are reintroducing my legislation from the last Congress \nto ensure that our family farmers are allowed to engage in deferred \npayment transactions and get the same kind of tax treatment they have \nalways received.\n  We do not believe that Congress intended this kind of tax treatment \nfor farmers using deferred payment commodity contracts for legitimate \nbusiness purposes. Moreover, Treasury Department officials, who agree \nthat this misguided IRS position was likely not the intent of Congress, \nsupport the goals of this effort as ``reasonable tax policy, and * * * \nwelcome the opportunity to work with Congress to address this matter \nthrough corrective legislation.''\n  Our bill simply makes clear the original intent of Congress which is \nto allow farmers to continue to receive the tax benefit provided from \nthe use of cash method accounting and from installment sales for their \ndeferred payment transactions.\n  I urge my colleagues to include this much-needed legislation--which \nis strongly supported by the agricultural community--in any revenue \nmeasure considered by the Senate this year. This measure needs to be \nconsidered quickly to resolve any lingering doubt about the correct tax \ntreatment for farmers using deferred commodity contracts.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of \n1997. This legislation will permit farmers to continue to defer tax \nliability through the use of deferred payment contracts.\n  Like other businesses, farmers are subject to the same peaks and \nvalleys in consumer demand that govern product pricing and earned \nincome. Unlike other businesses, however, farmers are also subject to \nthe uncertainties of Mother Nature. In agriculture, poor growing \nseasons are inevitable. Probably every farmer has had a crop devastated \nby harsh weather or been challenged to feed their livestock because of \nresulting shortages.\n  The ability to defer tax liability on deferred payment contracts \nhelps farmers prepare for these difficult times. To put it simply, \ndeferred payment contracts allow farmers to receive a portion of \npayment on a crop in the next year. In addition to deferring payment, \nfarmers also defer their resulting tax liability to the following year. \nDeferring payments and tax liabilities is a limited form of income \naveraging that allows individuals to cope with seasonal difficulties.\n  Now, a recent IRS decision has put this important economic tool in \njeopardy. The IRS has stated that payments made under a deferred \npayment contract are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT]. \nUnder the IRS ruling, taxes on the latter year's payments are now due \nin the first year of the contract. With the sudden repeal of deferred \ntax liability, farmers all across the country now face unexpected, \nsizable tax bills and many could be driven out of business. This is \nabsolutely unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, for the sake of this Nation's farmers, the IRS \ninterpretation must be repealed. Since 1986, the only tool left for \ndeferring tax liability has been the use of deferred payment contracts. \nIn just the last 4 years, however, farmers in the midwest have suffered \none of the centuries worst floods, the west has endured a terrible \ndrought and last year, a long winter and tremendous rainfall \nsignificantly reduced Michigan's drybean, soybean, corn, and wheat \nharvests.\n  The Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997 will \npermit farmers to continue to defer tax liability through the use of \ndeferred payment contracts and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. With tax \ntime fast approaching, I hope that this bill can be acted upon by both \nChambers of Congress and sent to the President for his signature as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, the President of the Michigan Farm Bureau, Jack \nLaurie, recently explained the significance of the IRS's ruling in the \nMichigan Farm Bureau's Farm News. I think this article illustrates \nclearly the reasons why this legislation is necessary and I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Recent Tax Policy Issues Profound for Agriculture\n\n       As the year draws to a close, many of us will be making \n     crucial tax management decisions as a normal course of \n     business. Making advance purchases of inputs for next year, \n     delaying sales, and/or deferred payment contracts allow \n     producers to manage tax burdens in good and in bad years.\n       Tax code provisions, such as cash accounting and deferred \n     payment contracts, provide important financial and tax \n     management tools for producers. Recognizing the impact of \n     budget cuts for agricultural programs, Congress included \n     language in the 1996 budget resolution that pledged to \n     reexamine agricultural cuts unless, among other things, \n     Congress acted to provide mechanisms to allow farmers to \n     average tax loads over strong and weak income years.\n       Several pieces of Farm Bureau-supported legislation to \n     allow income averaging were considered by the 104th Congress \n     but were not enacted into law. Farm Bureau will be working to \n     secure their passage as the bills are reintroduced next year.\n       Farm Bureau supports the option of cash accounting for \n     farmers and the continuation and expansion of tax code \n     provisions that allow farmers to match income with expenses. \n     Farm Bureau also supports the reinstatement of income \n     averaging for farm income and the creation of ``farmer \n     savings plans,'' which would allow farmers to put money into \n     a pre-tax account for use during emergencies.\n       Farmers are also at risk of losing another tax management \n     tool, thanks in large part to a recent change in tax policy \n     interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service in how the \n     agency will treat deferred payments. Recent rulings in \n     Washington state and in Iowa penalize farmers attempting to \n     average their income and tax burdens from year to year \n     through the use of deferred payment contracts.\n       The IRS has begun classifying deferred payment contracts as \n     a tax preference by allowing farmers to delay income through \n     deferred payment contracts for their regular tax calculation \n     but not for their Alternative Minimum Tax calculation, which \n     can result in additional tax liabilities for farmers.\n       Several farmers in Washington state and Iowa are currently \n     being examined by the IRS regarding the use of forward \n     contracting in the sale of their crops. At least 35 \n     Washington farm families are currently in IRS appeals \n     awaiting the opinion of the Tax Court. Commodities included \n     in the proposed adjustments include sweet corn, beans, hogs, \n     potatoes, onions, and various seed crops.\n       Why is the IRS pursuing this issue? The answer is pretty \n     simple. By disallowing farmers to defer income into the next \n     year via deferred payment, they essentially throw two years \n     of income into one year. This in turn increases the amount of \n     taxes due, significantly, in some cases. There has been no \n     change in the law, only a change in the IRS interpretation.\n       Legislation was introduced last year to provide that \n     installment sales not be treated as preference with respect \n     to the Alternative Minimum Tax. This language would have \n     retroactively exempted farmers who entered into deferred \n     payments contracts from being subject to Alternative Minimum \n     Tax.\n       Unfortunately, this legislation did not pass. However, \n     there is already a movement underway to pursue this issue \n     again at the start of the next congressional session. Several \n     senators from Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, and Washington \n     will introduce legislation in January to clarify that \n     deferred payment contracts are not a tax preference item that \n     subjects farmers to AMT.\n       Michigan Farm Bureau will be working to secure the support \n     of Sens. Carl Levin and Spencer Abraham for this legislation. \n     As you go through the process of completing your farm books \n     and begin tax preparation, I encourage you to take a moment \n     to let your respective U.S. Representative and both of your \n     Senators know how vital these tax management tools are and \n     what their loss will mean to your operation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jack Laurie,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today my colleagues, Senators Chuck \nGrassley and Byron Dorgan, introduced legislation which will correct a \ntax problem facing many farmers across the country, including many in \nthe State of Colorado. Along with over 40 of my Senate colleagues, I am \npleased to join Senators Grassley and Dorgan as an original cosponsor \nto this bill.\n  Farmers have typically used the deferred payment contract system as a \nmeans for managing their business income. It is common for a farmer to \nforward contract to sell a product. Under this type of contract, a \nfarmer may deliver the product in a given tax year, and he may not \nreceive one lump-sum\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\npayment at the time of delivery. In fact, the payments may be spread \nover 2 tax years.\n  Up until recently, the farmer was taxed on this income only for the \nactual amount received in a given tax year. However, last October, the \nInternal Revenue Service issued a ruling which disallows this practice. \nUnder the ruling, all payments received under a deferred payment \ncontract are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Now, regardless of \nwhether the actual payments under the contract are spread out over a \nmultiple year period, the payments will be taxable in the year the \ncontract is made.\n  Needless to say, this ruling requiring farm families to pay a tax on \nincome they have not yet received places an unfair burden on those \nfamilies. Farmers cannot control the weather, especially in Colorado \nwhere farmers fall victim to everything from tornados to droughts. \nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in farming, deferred payment \ncontracts offer farmers a critical financial management tool. We must \nallow them to manage the risks without unfairly penalizing them.\n  With the farmers' early filing deadline looming on the horizon, there \nis a need to act upon this legislation as quickly as possible. Many \nfarmers are already calculating their taxes for their early deadline \nand without a reversal of the IRS' ruling, they will be forced to \ncomply at what will no doubt be a severe financial burden for many.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation \nand pass it in a timely manner.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I thank him for his cosponsorship of this legislation, \nbecause in the State of Minnesota obviously he has, as in my State of \nIowa, many farmers who are affected by the action of the IRS. I yield 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill introduced today \nby my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan, to clarify the \nintent of Congress and to allow farmers and ranchers to use deferred \npayment contracts without tax penalty under the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  Last year this Congress passed, and the President signed, the most \nsweeping reforms in agricultural policy in 60 years, giving our farmers \nand ranchers the freedom to farm. Farmers can now plant for the market, \nnot for Uncle Sam.\n  But our commitment to agriculture did not--and cannot--end there. We \npromised farmers and ranchers regulatory reform, free and fair trade, \nmarket-oriented tools to better manage their risk, and tax relief. \nUnfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has caused us to radically \ndepart from this commitment in regard to tax relief. By ruling that \nproducers are subject to tax liability on deferred payment contracts in \nthe year the contract is signed, instead of when he or she actually \nreceives the payment, the IRS has dealt American agriculture a very \nserious blow.\n  Cash-based accounting, as it is often called, is extremely important \nto Minnesota farmers because incomes fluctuate so radically from year \nto year depending on what Mother Nature decides to unleash on us. This \nis especially important in my home State of Minnesota because, as many \nof you know, some say it is the land of 9 months of winter and then 3 \nmonths of poor sledding.\n  But adding further to the importance of cash-based accounting is the \nfact that farmers and ranchers are only paid once or twice a year. \nUnderstandably, many farmers and ranchers like to receive their \npayments in installments. And that is much the way school teachers do \nover the summer months. Getting paid in increments can ease their cash \nflow problems that might otherwise occur.\n  Congress, to its credit, has always understood these unique \ncircumstances and therefore always intended agriculture to have the \nbenefit of cash-based accounting. As late as 1980, Congress reaffirmed \nthis. But according to the IRS, this all changed in amendments to the \nTax Code in 1986. I disagree. Without rehashing all of the arguments of \nwhy this decision is in error, let me offer just one.\n  As one Rutgers University tax law professor observed, had this been \nthe intent of the proposed changes to the Tax Code in 1986, surely \nthere would have been large-scale opposition at that time. And, no \ndoubt, the opposition would have been spearheaded by Senator Grassley, \nwho sits on the tax writing committee. But there was not a word about \nit. Maybe that is why it took the IRS a decade to find out why.\n  None of us want to point fingers at who is responsible for this \nmistake. We only want congressional intent carried out. If the most \nefficient way of accomplishing this end is to pass legislation to \nclarify things, then that is what we should do.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I \ncommend Senators Grassley and Dorgan for their leadership on this \nissue. I urge timely consideration and passage of this extremely \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, my \nfriend Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, who is on the floor, and I and \n51 other Senators have introduced today a bill on the alternative \nminimum tax as it is being unjustly and without precedent applied to \nfarmers in all of our States and across the United States of America.\n  In short, farmers are now being told that they must pay taxes on \nincome that they have not received. I repeat that, Mr. President. Our \nfarmers are now being told by the Internal Revenue Service that they \nare to pay taxes on income that they have not received when they have \ntransferred ownership of their crops to some other entity but are not \nto receive payment for those crops until the next tax year.\n\n  Mr. President, that is unprecedented. It is unjust. It is a terrible \nburden on many farmers who live under difficult circumstances and from \nhand to mouth. And it is not what Congress has intended in any of its \namendments to the Internal Revenue Code.\n  It is wrong, Mr. President. It was discovered or started initially, I \nregret to say, in the State of Washington last year aimed against a \nparticular potato farmer. It has now spread like wildfire all across \nthe country and it has become the policy of the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  A year ago, one Member of the House of Representatives from my State, \nGeorge Nethercutt, introduced a bill on this without it being able to \nattain the attention that has been focused on it since that time. As I \nsaid, there are now 54 Members of this body who are sponsors of this \nbill to bring pure justice back to the administration of the Internal \nRevenue Code as it respects our farmers.\n  I am convinced that as soon as we have a revenue bill from the House, \nwhich under the Constitution must deal with such a bill first, that we \nwill pass this proposal almost unanimously. Mr. President, so far we \nhave no revenue estimate on it. It was estimated last year to be \nminimal because of course these taxes will in fact be collected when \nthe cash is received by the farmers.\n  Farmers are not attempting through this bill to avoid a tax \nobligation. They are simply asking for the simple justice that that tax \nobligation not be imposed upon them until they have received the income \non which the obligation is based.\n  It is for that reason and under the leadership of the Senator from \nIowa and the Senator from North Dakota, who is here and whom I believe \nis next, that this bill is drafted, that we have made this proposal. We \nhave now received the support of Mr. Rubin, the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  I do not know of any reasonable opposition or, for that matter, any \nopposition at all to doing justice in this case. I am delighted we have \nsuch strong support for this bill. I urge not only action on this bill, \nMr. President, but the promptest action possible for the Senate to \nremedy an injustice against our farmers.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, join my new colleagues in \ncosponsoring this legislation. It is important that we act on this \nlegislation before April 15 to correct a ruling by the Internal Revenue \nService regarding the alternative minimum tax. It is a ruling that \ncould dramatically and unfairly increase the tax burden on our farmers \nwho use the cash method of accounting and who utilize installment sales \non crops and livestock.\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\n  It is interesting to me that this tax problem is one of the first \nissues needing legislative correction to present itself to the 105th \nCongress. It is interesting because the problem arises in the areas of \nsmall business and accounting, two areas in which I feel I have some \nparticularly relevant insight. I am a small businessman and an \naccountant--the only accountant in the Senate, in fact.\n  I have wondered for a long time why United States tax policymakers \ncontinue to subject small business owners to the onerous burden of \ncalculating both corporate and alternative minimum tax liabilities. The \nfact is that fewer than 2 percent of the companies filing Federal \nincome tax returns end up paying the alternative minimum tax. Still, \nall of these companies, many of them small businesses, have to maintain \nseparate sets of records for tax purposes, and that is at a \nconsiderable cost.\n  In 1993, a Joint Tax Committee analysis confirmed what I as a small \nbusiness owner and corporate accountant already knew, that compliance \nwith the alternative minimum tax requirements can add 15 to 20 percent \nto a company's accounting bills at tax time. The effect is that we bury \n100 percent of our small businesses in paperwork in order to increase \ntax revenue for about 2 percent of corporate tax filers. If that is not \nan unnecessary burden, I do not know what is.\n  The legislation that is introduced today will amend the 1986 Tax \nReform Act to clarify confusion that was unintentionally created by the \nrevenue act of 1987. I do not blame the IRS for the position it takes \nin the technical advice memorandum filed in 1995, which states that \ninstallment sales of farm property are not exempt from the alternative \nminimum tax liability in the year that it is expensed. It is the job of \nthe IRS to maximize tax revenue within the confines of the \ncongressionally approved statutes. The question then is, did Congress \nintend to subject cash receipts on forward commodity sales to a \nfarmer's prior year alternative minimum tax? I do not believe that the \n99th Congress intended to do that. For 10 years the IRS has not applied \nthis rule in this way. To do so now is a retroactive tax increase on \nfarmers. We, the 105th Congress, should make the necessary \nclarifications and pass this bill.\n  I believe the bill will pass because reasonable people can recognize \nsimple facts and should agree to correct the problem. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of the legislation, but I also hope that it will renew \ninterest in reviewing the issue of alternative minimum tax reform in \ngeneral. One of the issues I promised my constituents I would pursue if \nelected to the Senate is simplification of the U.S. Tax Code, and I \nbelieve that the phaseout of the alternative minimum tax is a necessary \npart of that promise. The alternative minimum tax inhibits capital \ninvestment, ties up resources and credits, and piles unnecessary \ncompliance costs particularly on small business. It actually produces \nrelatively small amounts of Federal revenue, not all of which would be \nforegone using regular tax computation.\n  The problem this bill would correct typifies the difficulties small \nbusiness owners in our country have complying with this onerous AMT \nlaw. I was pleased that the last Congress was able to achieve consensus \non a very good AMT reform bill, a bill that unfortunately became \nentangled in the highly emotional web of election year politics and \nsubsequently suffered a swift death at the hands of the President.\n  I do believe we can and should move toward a more sensible corporate \ntax system, and I hope the administration is willing to work with us on \nthat.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the legislation Senators Grassley and Dorgan are introducing today. \nThe bill addresses one of the most pressing problems facing many family \nfarms, and I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  Last fall, the IRS released a technical memorandum calling into \nquestion the tax treatment of deferred crop sales. Released during the \nharvest just as farmers were making marketing decisions, this apparent \nshift in policy created enormous confusion in the farm community. I say \napparent shift in policy because, strictly speaking, the technical \nadvice memorandum applies only to one taxpayer; the IRS has yet to \nissue a formal revenue ruling on the matter as guidance for all \ntaxpayers.\n  It has been a long-standing and common practice for farmers to sell \ntheir crops on a deferred basis. Farmers often delay their receipts \nfrom commodity sales into future years in order to maximize their \nmarketing opportunities and average their incomes over good and bad \nyears. The legal basis for these deferred contracts dates at least as \nfar back as an IRS revenue ruling issued in 1958.\n  Congress has repeatedly expressed its intention that smaller farms be \npermitted to manage their affairs on a cash-basis system of accounting. \nIf implemented, the policy described in the IRS memorandum would have \nthe effect of eliminating this important tool for many family farmers.\n  In my view, the IRS has mistakenly interpreted tax law and \nlegislative history in arriving at the conclusion that deferred \ncontract receipts are a ``preference'' for purposes of calculating \nalternative minimum tax liability. I and a number of my colleagues \ncommunicated this directly to the Secretary of the Treasury last month, \nand he agreed to support legislation to correct the problem.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that we could obtain agreement on both \nsides of the aisle to pass this legislation as promptly as possible. \nDoing so could save many families tens of thousands of dollars this \nwinter--money they never anticipated owing to the government.\n  On November 21st of last year, I asked the Treasury Department to \neither suspend the application or narrow the scope of the IRS \nmemorandum in order to prevent this from happening. Today, I would like \nto call publicly on the IRS to reconsider its resistance to my request. \nThe Treasury Department supports our effort to fix this problem \nlegislatively, and half of the Senate is cosponsoring the Grassley-\nDorgan bill. Why force taxpayers to pay money this winter that they in \ngood faith never thought they owed, and then place them in the position \nof having to file an amended return to get their money back when the \nlegislation passes later this year? Surely, there must be a better way, \nand, in the interest of taxpayer service, I urge the IRS to try to find \nit.\n  Let's not forget that farmers are the backbone of rural America and \none of the foundations of our economy. Family farmers tell me often of \nthe hardships they face in managing businesses that are often as \nunpredictable as the weather. The apparent change in IRS policy on \ndeferred commodity contracts does not help matters.\n  I congratulate Senators Grassley and Dorgan on their legislation and \nlook forward to working with them to secure its speedy passage.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor of the Family Farmer Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of \n1997. This legislation will provide relief for family farmers from a \nrecent Internal Revenue Service decision regarding deferred payment \ncontracts which could result in sizable and unexpected tax bills for \nthe coming year.\n  For over 16 years, family farmers in Maryland and across the country \nhave used deferred payment contracts to sell their crops and livestock \nin order to better manage and even out their business income from year \nto year. The tax code has specifically permitted farmers to manage \ntheir business on a cash basis of accounting and use deferred payment \ncontracts without AMT liability. However, a recent IRS decision to \nenforce alternative minimum taxation on all crop and livestock sales, \nincluding deferred payment contracts, effectively repeals farmers' \nability to use these contracts to move their tax liability into future \nyears. If relief is not soon provided, many family farmers will face \nsizable--and unexpected--tax bills for the coming tax year. The purpose \nof this legislation is to clarify the law and ensure that family \nfarmers can continue to receive the tax benefit provided from the use \nof the cash method of accounting and from installment sales for their \ndeferred payment commodities contracts as Congress originally intended.\n  I hope the committee will schedule hearings on this matter as quickly \nas possible so that this legislation can be\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\nenacted prior to the taxation filing deadline. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD:\n  S. 182. A bill to make available for obligation such sums as are \nnecessary to pay the Federal share of completion of construction of the \nAppalachian development highway system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the appalachian development highway system completion act\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critically \nimportant measure to ensure that sufficient funds will be made \navailable over the next six years to complete the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System by the year 2003, some 38 years after the \ninitial authorization of this vital 3,025-mile highway network.\n  As Senators are aware, the funding authorizations for the Federal-Aid \nHighway program will expire at the end of fiscal year 1997. \nConsequently, one of the most important pieces of legislation we will \ntake up during this congressional session will be the reauthorization \nof the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. This \nlegislation will provide new direction for our Federal highway and \ntransit programs for the next six years. I commend the Majority Leader \nfor recognizing the importance of this legislation in his remarks on \nthe Senate Floor during the first day of this session, during which he \ncited his hope that we might turn to it prior to the Easter recess.\n  Our colleagues in the other body have already completed several \nhearings on the reauthorization of ISTEA, and I understand that the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin its hearings \nshortly. As we approach the drafting of a new, comprehensive, Federal-\naid highway bill, I am introducing this bill today so that my \ncolleagues have available to them my proposal to ensure that the \nFederal government finally completes its commitment to the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System in all affected thirteen states.\n  The necessity to expand highway access to spur the development of the \nAppalachian region was first cited by the President's Appalachian \nRegional Commission of 1964. The Commission's report stated: \n``Developmental activities in Appalachia cannot proceed until the \nregional isolation has been overcome by a transportation network which \nprovides access to and from the rest of the nation and within the \nregion itself. The remoteness and isolation of the region . . . are the \nvery basis of the Appalachian lag. Its penetration by an adequate \ntransportation network is the first requisite of its full participation \nin industrial America.''\n  One year later, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 \nauthorized several programs for the development of the region, the \nfirst of which called for the construction of a new highway network. \nAccording to the Act, these highways ``will open up an area or areas \nwith a developmental potential where commerce and communication have \nbeen inhibited by lack of adequate access.'' Subsequent amendments to \nthe act defined the 3,025 miles that comprise the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System.\n  Unfortunately, today, we find that while the Interstate Highway \nSystem is virtually 100 percent complete, the Appalachian Development \nHighway System is only 76 percent complete. Of the 3,025 miles that \ncomprise the Appalachian system, roughly 725 miles remain unfinished. \nThese unfinished miles are spread throughout the 13 states that have \ncounties within the statutorily designated boundaries of Appalachia. \nThese states include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, \nNew York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of my legislation is to ensure that we \nexpeditiously complete this vital highway network. Its completion is \neven more important today than it was 30 years ago, not only for the \nlocal economies of the Appalachian region but also for the entire \nnation. The citizens of Appalachia are required to drive through the \nexisting, inadequate road system--dangerous, narrow roads which \ngenerally wind through the paths of river valleys and stream beds \nbetween mountains. These roads are, more often than not, two-lane roads \nthat are squeezed into very limited rights-of-way. They are \ncharacterized by low travel speeds and long travel distances. They were \noften built to inadequate design standards and, thus, present very \nhazardous driving conditions.\n  Just last year, the Federal Highway Administration published a report \nindicating that substandard road conditions are a factor in 30 percent \nof all fatal highway accidents. I am quite sure that the percentage is \na great deal higher in the Appalachian region. [In my own state, the \ninadequate two-lane road that currently lies along the alignment of our \nlargest uncompleted segment of the ADHS represents the second most \ndangerous road in the entire state.] The Federal Highway Administration \nhas found that upgrading two-lane roads to four-lane divided highways \nhas served to decrease fatal traffic accidents by 71 percent and that \nwidening traffic lanes has served to reduce fatalities by 21 percent. \nThese are precisely the kinds of road improvements that will be funded \nthrough the legislation which I am introducing today. And until this \nlegislation is enacted, many citizens will die unnecessarily on \ninadequate, unsafe roads.\n  While several of the thirteen Appalachian states have enjoyed \nsignificant economic expansion and job growth over the last three \ndecades, each such state continues to have pockets of severe economic \ndistress characterized by low academic achievement, chronic \nunemployment, and an inadequate tax base. There are still children in \nAppalachia who lack decent transportation routes to school. There are \nstill pregnant mothers, elderly citizens, and others who lack timely \nroad access to area hospitals. There are many people who cannot obtain \nsustainable well-paying jobs because of poor road access to major \nemployment centers. These critical conditions affect not only the \ncitizens of these local communities but also the economy of the entire \nnation. Instead of enjoying the full productive potential of all the \ncitizens of Appalachia, our nation must bear the costs of Federal \nassistance that must be provided to those who cannot adequately care \nfor themselves through no fault of their own--costs associated with \nunemployment benefits, health care, school lunch programs, etc.\n\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission has conducted a number of studies \nand surveys which confirm the linkage between economic prosperity and \nthe completion of segments of the Appalachian Highway System. These \nsame studies also highlight the fact that it is almost impossible for \ncommunities still awaiting completion of their segments of these \nhighways to attract businesses and investment opportunities to their \nareas, largely due to an inadequate transportation system, inhibiting \ntheir access to the national markets.\n  The most rigorous of these studies was financed by the National \nScience Foundation and published just a year and a half ago. This study \ncovered a twenty-year period and compared conditions in Appalachian \ncounties versus similarly-situated counties outside the Appalachian \nregion. When looking at conditions in the sixty-two rural Appalachian \ncounties, the study revealed that the income levels of those counties \nwith substantially complete Appalachian Development highways grew 80 \npercent faster and that earnings grew 62 percent faster than did the \ncounties without such highway access.\n  Mr. President, the people of Appalachia have waited long enough for \nthe Federal Government to fulfill its commitment to the Appalachian \nregion. The bill I am introducing today will ensure that sufficient \nfunds are set aside in the next major highway bill to complete the \nremaining 24 percent of the Appalachian Development Highway System in \nthe thirteen-state region. This bill takes a different approach from \nthat of the prior authorization acts for the Appalachian Highway \nSystem. The bill calls for direct contract authority to be made \navailable from the highway trust fund. This contract authority would be \ndistributed to the thirteen states of the Appalachian Region solely for \nthe purpose of completing the 725 unfinished miles of the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System.\n  One of the primary reasons why completion of the Appalachian Highway\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nSystem has lagged behind that of the Interstate Highway System is \nbecause the interstate system has benefited from the direct \navailability of highway trust funds while the Appalachian Development \nHighway System has been required to be financed largely through \nincremental annual appropriations of general funds.\n  The bill I introduce today also makes clear that funds provided to \nthe Appalachian states for the completion of the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway system will be provided in addition to the funds \nthose states will receive from the Federal Aid Highway Program for \ntheir customary purposes. These states should not be required to choose \nbetween the maintenance of their interstate and other federal highways \nand the completion of the Appalachian system.\n  Under this bill, states will still be required to provide the \nstandard 20 percent matching share for Federal funds for the completion \nof these roads, as is the case for all major Federal aid highway \nprograms. The bill authorizes the Secretary to distribute ``such sums \nas are necessary'' for the completion of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System. Similar to the manner in which Federal funds are \ncurrently administered for Appalachian highways, the funds provided \nunder this bill will be administered by the Appalachian Regional \nCommission (ARC). The ARC, with the cooperation of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, is currently updating its estimate for the cost to \ncomplete the system. This study is expected to be completed by May 1 of \nthis year, and I anticipate that, when this bill is incorporated into \nthis year's highway legislation, it will identify and authorize the \nappropriate dollar figure that results from this ongoing study.\n  I should point out, Mr. President, that the Administration shares my \ngoal for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System \nin the near term. In addition to having written to President Clinton \nseveral times in support of this legislative approach, I met with him \npersonally in the Oval Office on December 16, 1996--last year. I have \nalso had meetings on this subject with his OMB Director, Mr. Franklin \nRaines, and his Federal Highway Administrator and Transportation \nSecretary-designate, Mr. Rodney Slater. I am confident that the \nAdministration will be supportive of my efforts to complete the \nconstruction of the ADHS as soon as possible.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. Our entire nation has benefited from the improvements \nbrought about by the Appalachian Development Highway System. So, too, \nwill we all benefit from its completion in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachian Development \n     Highway System Completion Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (40 \n     U.S.C. App.) enacted into law a Federal commitment to the \n     completion of the Appalachian development highway system for \n     the purpose of expanding highway access to the Appalachian \n     region;\n       (2) economic prosperity within the Appalachian region since \n     that time has been brought about by, and has centered around, \n     the availability of adequate highway access;\n       (3) the rationale behind the completion of the Appalachian \n     development highway system is as sound today as it was in \n     1965, but while the Interstate System is nearly 100 percent \n     complete, the Appalachian development highway system is only \n     76 percent complete;\n       (4) those areas in which the Appalachian development \n     highway system is not yet complete suffer from inadequate \n     road systems characterized by low travel speeds, long travel \n     distances, and unsafe conditions; and\n       (5) there are unfinished miles of the Appalachian \n     development highway system in all 13 of the States with \n     counties in the statutorily-designated Appalachian region.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPLETION OF APPALACHIAN DEVELOPMENT HIGHWAY SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (d), there are \n     authorized to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund \n     (other than the Mass Transit Account) for the period of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2003 such sums as are necessary to \n     fund the Federal share of the total estimated cost of \n     completion of construction of the Appalachian development \n     highway system authorized by section 201 of the Appalachian \n     Regional Development Act of 1965 (40 U.S.C. App.), as \n     determined by the Secretary of Transportation.\n       (2) Transfer and administration of funds.--The Secretary \n     shall transfer the funds made available by paragraph (1) to \n     the Appalachian Regional Commission, which shall be \n     responsible for the administration of the funds.\n       (b) Federal Share.--The Federal share under this section \n     shall be 80 percent.\n       (c) Apportionment to States.--In carrying out subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall apportion the funds to the 13 States \n     in the Appalachian region in accordance with each State's \n     portion of the total estimated cost of completion.\n       (d) Allocation Percentages.--One-sixth of the funds \n     allocated by subsection (a) for the construction shall be \n     available for obligation in each of fiscal years 1998 through \n     2003.\n       (e) Delegation to States.--Subject to title 23, United \n     States Code, the Secretary shall delegate responsibility for \n     completion of construction of each segment of the Appalachian \n     development highway system under this section to the State in \n     which the segment is located, upon request of the State.\n       (f) Advance Construction.--When a State that has been \n     delegated responsibility for construction of a segment under \n     subsection (c)--\n       (1) has obligated all funds allocated under this section \n     for construction of the segment; and\n       (2) proceeds to construct the segment without the aid of \n     Federal funds in accordance with all procedures and all \n     requirements applicable to the segment, except insofar as the \n     procedures and requirements limit the State to the \n     construction of segments with the aid of Federal funds \n     previously allocated to the State;\n\n     the Secretary, upon approval of the application of a State, \n     shall pay to the State the Federal share of the cost of \n     construction of the segment at such time as additional funds \n     are allocated for the segment under subsection (d).\n       (g) Contract Authority.--Funds authorized by this section \n     shall be available for obligation in the same manner as if \n     the funds were apportioned under chapter 1 of title 23, \n     United States Code, except that--\n       (1) the Federal share of the cost of any construction under \n     this section shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b); and\n       (2) the funds shall remain available until expended.\n       (h) Inapplicability of Obligation Limitations.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any obligation \n     limitation enacted for any of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 \n     shall not apply to obligations authorized under this section.\n       (i) Other State Funds.--Funds made available to a State \n     under this section shall not be considered in determining the \n     apportionments and locations that any State shall be entitled \n     to receive, under title 23, United States Code, and other \n     law, of amounts in the Highway Trust Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 183. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \napply the act to a greater percentage of the U.S. work force, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we do a great deal of important business \nhere in the U.S. Senate, but much of it seems arcane and distant from \nthe lives of American families. But last evening, with the airing of a \nCBS made for TV movie, ``A Child's Wish,'' we had a particularly moving \nexample of the power we have to make a positive difference in the lives \nof America's families. I don't know how many of my colleagues had a \nchance to see it. It was a fictional story based on the true life \nexperiences of two families impacted by the Family and Medical Leave \nAct signed into law by President Clinton in 1993.\n  Dixie Yandle was one of those children. I believe she came from North \nCarolina, I say to my colleague from North Carolina. Dixie's father \nlost his job during her struggle with cancer as he sought to spend more \ntime with her. She and her parents testified in fact before the \nCongress about the need for family medical leave legislation so that \nwhat happened to them would not happen to the other parents.\n  The second child, Melissa Weaver, was also diagnosed with cancer that \nultimately proved to be fatal. But due to the Family and Leave Act the \nfamily was able to spend the last days of her life together. Melissa's \nstory is one of many that I heard in 1994 during a series of public \nhearings of the Commission on Family and Medical Leave on\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nthe impact of the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  ``A Child's Wish'' took the lives of these two children and wove them \ntogether to dramatize how important the Family and Medical Leave Act is \nand how meaningful it is to families. I am hopeful that this movie may \nhave helped a lot of people understand the legislation better.\n  Today, at a time when many Americans are deeply cynical toward the \nwork we do here in Washington, the family and medical leave stands in \nsharp contrast.\n  Not only is this legislation making a real difference in the lives of \nthe American people, but it has been judged by a bipartisan commission \nto be an unqualified success.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act fulfilled a genuine need among \nAmerica's working families to take leave in times of medical and family \nneed.\n  With this legislation we established in law a basic standard of \ndecency toward America's families.\n  Eligible employees were guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave during \ntimes of genuine family need--such as a birth or adoption, placement of \na foster child, or in times of serious medical emergency for a child, \nspouse or parent.\n  This minimal benefit--unpaid leave--is providing millions of workers \nand their families with vital assistance during times of crisis.\n  Yet, even with the apparent success of the FMLA there is still more \nwork to be done.\n  Millions of Americans continue to face painful choices involving \ntheir competing responsibilities to family and work.\n  Employees not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act are still \noften told that they must choose between sick family members and their \njobs.\n  In fact today, 43 percent of private sector employees remain \nunprotected by the Family and Medical Leave Act because their employer \ndoes not meet the current 50 or more employee threshold.\n  This legislation I introduce today--the Family and Medical Leave \nFairness Act of 1997--will extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to \nmillions of Americans who remain uncovered.\n  This bill would lower the threshold to include coverage for companies \nwith 25 or more workers.\n  This small step would provide 13 million additional workers with the \nprotection of the Family and Medical Leave Act--raising the total \npercentage of the private sector work force covered by the FMLA to 71 \npercent.\n  In my view, these workers deserve the same job security in times of \nfamily and medical emergency that workers in lager companies receive \nfrom the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  With this legislation they will receive it.\n  Now, for those of my colleagues who still harbor doubts about the \nsuccess of the Family and Medical Leave Act I strongly urge them to \nexamine a recent bipartisan report that documents the positive impact \nof this legislation.\n  When the bill was passed in 1993, provisions in the legislation \nestablished a commission to examine the impact of the act on workers \nand businesses.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Commission's analysis spanned 2\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  It included independent research and field hearings across the \ncountry to learn first hand about the act's impact from individuals and \nthe business community.\n  The report's conclusions are clear--the Family and Medical Leave Act \nis helping to expand opportunities for working Americans while at the \nsame time not placing any undue burden on employers.\n  According to the Commission's final report, the Family and Medical \nLeave Act represents ``A significant step in helping a larger cross-\nsection of working Americans meet their medical and family care giving \nneeds while still maintaining their jobs and economic security.''\n  Due to this legislation, Americans now possess greater opportunities \nto keep their health benefits, maintain job security, and take longer \nleaves for a greater number of reasons.\n  In fact, according to the bipartisan commission--12 million workers \ntook job-protected leave for reasons covered by the Family and Medical \nLeave Act during the 18 months of its study.\n  But, not only are American workers reaping the benefits. The law is \nworking for American business as well. In fact, the conclusions of the \nbipartisan report are a far cry from the concerns that were voiced when \nthis law was being considered in Congress.\n  The vast majority of businesses--over 94 percent--report little to no \nadditional costs associated with the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  More than 92 percent reported no noticeable effect on profitability.\n  And nearly 96 percent reported no noticeable effect on business \ngrowth.\n  Additionally, 83 percent of employers reported no noticeable impact \non employee productivity.\n  In fact, 12.6 percent actually reported a positive effect on employee \nproductivity from the Family and Medical Leave Act, twice as many as \nreported a negative effect.\n  And not only did employers report that compliance with the Family and \nMedical Leave Act was relatively easy and of minimal cost, but \nworksites with a small number of employees generally reported greater \nease of administration and even smaller costs than large worksites.\n  Today, I introduce this legislation with the hope and expectation \nthat we can put aside our political differences and build on the \nsuccess of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Last November, the \nAmerican people gave us a mandate--a mandate for good governance.\n  The Family and Medical Leave represents the fulfillment of this goal \nand I urge all my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \ncritically important legislation for America's working families.\n  I think the fact that the law has been working so well has made a \nsufficient difference in people's lives in moments of crises. The fact \nthat people are able to be there particularly when a child is dying, so \nthat you have the love of parents and a family coming together and you \ndon't have to choose between that job and your family is a wonderful \nthing. It has made such a difference in people's lives.\n  There have been many issues dealt with in this body over 16 years, \nand there is none that I am more proud of than the day that this body \nvoted to support the family and medical leave legislation, and when \nPresident Clinton signed it into law.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Daschle, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Kerry. Mr. President, I can't \nmiss the opportunity to briefly say that a friend of mine who is here \nfrom Pennsylvania, who I know is going to speak on the nomination of \nMadeleine Albright, but the body should know that the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, was an invaluable ally in that effort \nbeginning in the first day we arrived in the Senate some 16 years ago. \nWe formed a caucus on children's needs. I thank him for his efforts \nover the years in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nthose generous comments. He and I cochaired the Children's Caucus in \nthe early 1980's. And he mentioned that he and I cosponsored the first \nfamily leave act exactly 10 years ago at this time--it was in 1987--\nwhich was very important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 184. A bill to provide for adherence with the MacBride Principles \nof Economic Justice by United States persons doing business in Northern \nIreland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   the northern ireland fair employment practices and principles of \n                      economic justice act of 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Northern Ireland Fair \nEmployment Practices and Principles of Economic Justice Act of 1997. \nThis amendment seeks to deter efforts to use the work place as an arena \nof discrimination in Northern Ireland.\n  The Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices and Principles of \nEconomic Justice Act of 1997 incorporates the MacBride Principles, \nwhich are modeled after the famous Sullivan Principles, one of the \ninitial efforts to apply United States pressure to change the system of \napartheid in South Africa. The MacBride Principles are named\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nin honor of the late Sean MacBride, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and \nco-founder of Amnesty International.\n  This amendment will enlist the cooperation of United States companies \nactive in Northern Ireland in the campaign to force the end of \ndiscrimination in the workplace by:\n  First, eliminating religious discrimination in managerial, \nsupervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs and \nsignificantly increasing the representation in such jobs of individuals \nfrom under represented religious groups.\n  Second, providing adequate security for the protection of minority \nemployees at the workplace.\n  Third, banning provocative sectarian and political emblems from the \nworkplace.\n  Fourth, publicly advertising all job openings and undertaking special \nrecruitment efforts to attract applicants from under represented \nreligious groups, and establishing procedures to identify and recruit \nminority individuals with potential for further advancement, including \nmanagerial programs.\n  Fifth, establishing layoff, recall, and termination procedures which \ndo not favor particular religious groupings.\n  Sixth, abolishing job reservations, apprenticeship restrictions, and \ndifferential employment criteria which discriminate on the basis of \nreligious or ethnic origin.\n  Seventh, developing and expanding upon existing training and \neducational programs that will prepare substantial numbers of minority \nemployees for managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and \ntechnical jobs.\n  Eighth, appointing a senior management staff member to oversee the \nU.S. company's compliance with the principles described above.\n  It is in the workplace in Northern Ireland, which can be used to \neliminate discrimination, where improving the employment opportunities \nfor the underprivileged will help factor out the economic causes of the \ncurrent strife in Northern Ireland. This will hopefully begin the \nprocess toward a peaceful resolution of the so-called troubles.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with \nrespect to purchases from the strategic petroleum reserve by entities \nin the insular areas of the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the emergency petroleum supply act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency \nPetroleum Supply Act, a bill to ensure that Hawaii has access to the \nstrategic petroleum reserve during an oil supply disruption. The \nEmergency Petroleum Supply Act would guarantee Hawaii oil at a fair \nprice and give tankers bound for Hawaii priority loading during an \nemergency.\n  This legislation passed the Senate in two previous Congresses. During \nthe 104th Congress, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources once again approved the bill. Only the inability of the House \nto adopt strategic petroleum reserve reforms has prevented my bill from \nbecoming law. I will work aggressively during the 105th Congress to \nenact this measure.\n  The objective of the Emergency Petroleum Supply Act can be summarized \nin one word: access. Because of its tremendous distance from the Gulf \nCoast, Hawaii needs guaranteed access to the strategic petroleum \nreserve [SPR], as well as priority access to the SPR loading docks.\n  My bill addresses both these concerns. First, it provides a mechanism \nto guarantee an award of SPR oil. Hawaii's energy companies will be \nallowed to submit binding offers for a fixed quantity of oil at a price \nequal to the average of all successful bids. This concept is modeled \nafter the Federal Government's method of selling Treasury bills. It \nwould give Hawaii ready access to emergency oil supplies at a price \nthat is fair to the Government. Without this bill, Hawaii's energy \ncompanies, and the population they serve, face the risk that their bid \nfor SPR oil would be rejected and that oil inventories would run dry.\n  The second component of my bill addresses the problem of delay. The \nEmergency Petroleum Supply Act grants Hawaii-bound ships expedited \naccess to SPR loading docks. It would be a terrible misfortune if \ndeliveries to Hawaii were delayed because the tanker scheduled to carry \nemergency supplies was moored in the Gulf of Mexico, waiting in line \nfor access to the SPR loading docks.\n  As any grade-school geography student knows, Hawaii is a long way \nfrom the Gulf of Mexico, especially when you have to transit the Panama \nCanal. The distance between the SPR loading docks and Honolulu, by way \nof the canal, is 7,000 miles--more than one-quarter of the distance \naround the globe.\n  But distance alone is not the issue. When you add together the time \nbetween the decision to draw down the reserve and the time for oil from \nthe reserve to reach our shores, the seriousness of the problem \nemerges. It takes time to solicit and accept bids for SPR oil, time to \nlocate and position tankers, time for tankers to wait in line to gain \naccess to SPR loading docks, and more time to transit the canal to \nHawaii. Obviously, Hawaii is at the end of a very, very long supply \nline. People overlook the fact that insular areas have a limited supply \nof petroleum products on hand at any time. While Hawaii waited for \nemergency supplies to arrive, oil inventories could run dry and our \neconomy could grind to a halt.\n  Recently, the Department of Energy asked Hawaii's East-West Center to \nstudy this problem. The East-West Center report concluded that my SPR \naccess measure ``is an excellent proposal which would greatly reassure \nthe islands that their basic needs would be maintained.''\n  The East-West Center report provides strong justification for \ngranting Hawaii special access to SPR oil during an energy emergency. \nThe report found that a major oil supply disruption would have a much \nmore severe impact on the Pacific islands than on the rest of the \nUnited States. Although all of Asia would experience some degree of \ninflation and recession, the small economies of the insular areas would \nbe virtually unprotected from volatile economic forces. While the rest \nof the United States does not have to rely on ocean transport from \nother nations for essential goods and services, the economies of Hawaii \nand the Pacific islands are heavily dependent on ocean-borne trade and \nforeign visitors.\n  The need for this provision is further justified by a December 1993 \nDepartment of Energy/State of Hawaii analysis of Hawaii's energy \nsecurity which found the following:\n\n       Hawaii depends on imported oil for over 92 percent of its \n     energy. This makes Hawaii the most vulnerable State in the \n     Nation to the disruption of its economy and way of life in \n     the event of a disruption of the world oil market or rapid \n     oil price increases.\n       Currently, 40 percent of Hawaii's oil comes from Alaska and \n     the remainder from the Asia-Pacific region. The export \n     capabilities of these domestic and foreign sources of supply \n     are projected to decline by approximately 50 percent by the \n     year 2000. This will likely increase Hawaii's dependence on \n     oil reserves of the politically unstable Middle East.\n       Hawaii is also vulnerable to possible supply disruptions in \n     the event of a crisis. The long distance from the U.S. \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, combined \n     with a declining number of U.S.-flag tankers capable of \n     transiting the Panama Canal, make timely emergency deliveries \n     problematic.\n\n  Other studies have consistently verified Hawaii's energy \nvulnerability and its need for special access to the SPR. An analysis \nby Mr. Bruce Wilson, an accomplished oil economist, determined that the \ndelivery of SPR oil to Hawaii from the Gulf of Mexico could take as \nlong as 53 days. That exceeds the State's average commercial working \ninventory by 23 days. As Mr. Wilson's research shows, an oil supply \ndisruption is Hawaii's greatest nightmare.\n  Some suggest that market forces will ensure that Hawaii and the \nterritories receive the oil they need during an energy emergency. \nUnfortunately, these are the same market forces that cause Hawaii's \nconsumers to pay 50 percent more per gallon of gasoline than consumers \npay on the Mainland. When a crisis hits, our energy prices can double \nor triple.\n  Hawaii may be the 50th State, but we deserve the same degree of \nenergy security that the rest of the Nation enjoys. It's simply a \nmatter of equity. Hawaii's tax dollars help fill and maintain the \nreserve; Hawaii should enjoy the energy security the SPR is designed to \nprovide.\n  My bill will safeguard Hawaii from the harsh economic consequences of \nan oil emergency. The Emergency Petroleum Supply Act is not only good \nenergy policy, it's good economic policy for Hawaii.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide protections to individuals who are the \nhuman subject of research; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                 HUMAN RESEARCH SUBJECT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Human \nResearch Subject Protection Act of 1997. I send the bill to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, if I approached any Senator here and I \nsaid, ``You did not know it, but the last time they went to the doctor \nor went to the hospital, your wife or your husband or your daughter or \nyour son became the subject of a medical experiment that they were not \neven told about. They were given medicine, they were given pills, they \nwere given radiation, they were given something and were not even told \nabout this, were not even informed about it, yet they are under some \nexperimental research that might possibly do them harm--maybe some good \nwill come out of it, but maybe it will do them harm also--but they do \nnot know about it,'' people would laugh at that and say that is \nridiculous. That cannot possibly happen in this country. Yet, that very \nsituation is what this piece of legislation is supposed to address.\n  I have been in public life and have served this country for many \nyears. Frankly, I do not think too many things that I see surprise me \nanymore about our laws and about Government. Three years ago, though, I \nbegan to learn about a gap in our legal system that does truly concern \nme. In 1993 the Governmental Affairs Committee began to investigate the \ncold war radiation experiments. These experiments are one of the \nunfortunate legacies of the cold war, when our Government sponsored \nexperiments involving radiation on our own citizens without their \nconsent. They did not even know the experiments were being run on them. \nIt was without their consent.\n  One of the most infamous of these experiments took place in my own \nState of Ohio, when scores of patients at the University of Cincinnati \nwere subjected to large doses of radiation during experimental \ntreatments, without their consent, without their informed consent. \nDuring the course of this investigation, I began to ask the question, \nwhat protections are in place to prevent such abuses from happening \nagain? What law prohibits experimenting on people without their \ninformed consent?\n  What I found, when I looked into it, is there is no law on the books \nrequiring that informed consent be obtained. More important, I believe \nthere is a need for such a law, as there continue to be cases where \nthis basic right--I do view it as a basic right--is abused. As I \nstarted out, I would like to put this on a personal level for everyone \nof my colleagues. You just think about your own family, your own son, \nyour own daughter, or grandchildren who might be, the next time they go \nto a doctor, the subject of some medical experiment that they are not \neven told about. I do not think there can be many things more un-\nAmerican than that.\n  With the introduction of this bill today I hope to begin the process \nof correcting some serious gaps in our\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nlegal system. I want to make clear right now I am not seeking to bring \nmedical research to a screeching halt. Please do not anybody at NIH, or \nanybody doing research throughout this country, think we are trying to \nstop that. We are not. That is not my intent and not the intent of this \nbill.\n  This country has the very finest health care system in the world, in \npart because of basic research. In fact, in large part because we have \nput more effort, more resources, more of our treasure into health \nresearch than any other nation in this world. In fact, I believe most \npeople are not opposed to participating themselves in scientific \nresearch, if they are told about the pros and the cons. That is the \ngoal of this legislation, to make sure that people have the appropriate \ninformation to make an informed choice about their medical treatment.\n  Everyone listening today probably has heard of the Nuremberg Code. \nThat is the list of 10 ethical research principles which were produced \nas part of the judgment against Nazi physicians who engaged in truly \nheinous medical experiments during World War II.\n  The first principle of the Nuremberg Code states that the voluntary \nconsent of the human subject of research is absolutely essential. \nUnfortunately, as we look back through our history since the late \n1940's, it appears that researchers in America may not have taken all \nthat Nuremberg lesson completely to heart.\n  I ask my colleagues what the following names might have in common: \nthalidomide, Tuskegee, and Willowbrook?\n  Well, the answer is that these are all sad examples of unethical \nresearch conducted in the United States, and in the United States well \nafter the Nuremberg Code was issued, adopted and worldwide attention \nhad been focused on some of the abuses of that time during World War \nII.\n  Given this history, I find it astounding that even after Nuremberg, \nthe thalidomide babies, Willowbrook, Tuskegee and the cold war \nradiation experiments, and who knows how many other cases, we still \ndon't have a law on our books requiring that informed consent--those \ntwo words, ``informed consent''--be obtained prior to conducting \nresearch on human subjects.\n  I have had research conducted on me because of my past activities \nbefore I came to the Senate in the space program and so on, but I knew \nwhat was being looked at, what was being tried. I knew the objectives \nof it, and I was willing to do that. I was happy to do it. But it was \ninformed consent that I had personally, and I knew what I was getting \ninto and glad to do it.\n  I think most people feel the same way. If they know what they are \ngetting into and they feel there is a good purpose to it, they are \nwilling to do it. But to do research on people when they don't even \nknow what the research or the medicines or the radiation is that is \nbeing tried on them, I think is unconscionable.\n\n  What it comes down to is there are no criminal fines or penalties for \nviolating the spirit or the letter of that Nuremberg Code that should \nbe the basis of all of our informed consent in this country.\n  In fact, our own Constitution says, ``The right of the people to be \nsecure in their persons . . . shall not be violated.''\n  So there is no explicit statutory prohibition against improper \nresearch. I must add that just because there is no law on the books \ndoes not mean there are no protections for people from unethical \nmedical or scientific research.\n  These tragic incidents I have mentioned have resulted in changes in \nthe way human research subjects are treated. I don't want to \nmisrepresent this, because there is a very elaborate system of \nprotections that have developed over the years. Unfortunately, though, \nthis system does have some gaps and, if enacted, I believe this \nlegislation will close those gaps.\n  Let me briefly describe the system that is currently in place.\n  Regulations governing the protection of human research subjects were \nissued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1974 and \nmay be found at part 46 of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n  In 1991, 10 years after a recommendation of a congressionally \nchartered Presidential advisory board, 16 other agencies adopted a \nportion of this rule, a portion of the rule to apply to research that \nthese agencies sponsored. And at that point, these regulations became \nknown as the common rule.\n  The common rule requires research institutions receiving Federal \nsupport and Federal agencies conducting research to establish \ncommittees, and these are known as--the shorthand version is IRB's--\nInstitutional Review Boards. Their job is to review research proposals \nfor risk of harm to human subjects and to perform other duties to \nprotect human research subjects.\n  The common rule also stipulates requirements related to informed \nconsent, how researchers must inform potential subjects of the risks to \nwhich they, as study participants, agree to be exposed.\n  It should also be noted that HHS regulations contain additional \nprotections not included in the common rule for research involving \nvulnerable populations; namely, pregnant women, fetuses, subjects of in \nvitro fertilization research, prisoners and children. No other Federal \nagency has adopted these additional protections.\n  Several mechanisms have been developed by HHS and research \ninstitutions over the years to extend the common-rule protections to \nmore people. For example, many, but not all, research institutions \nwhich receive some Federal support voluntarily apply common-rule \nguidelines to all research conducted at their institutions.\n  Additionally, in order to receive approval for a drug or device from \nthe Food and Drug Administration, a research institution or \npharmaceutical company must comply with the requirements of the common \nrule as administered by the FDA.\n  In addition to the Federal regulations, most professional medical \nsocieties and associations have adopted ethical codes of conduct \nregarding research.\n  The first such ethical code, called the Helsinki Code, was adopted by \nthe World Medical Association in 1964. So it has been on the books for \na long time. Since that time, other prominent organizations, like the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Society for Clinical \nInvestigation, and the American Federation of Clinical Research have \nalso adopted such ethical codes.\n  Most recently, in October 1995, the President exhibited, I believe, \nstrong leadership and established the National Bioethics Advisory \nCommission, NBAC. This had been a long time coming. It had been \nsuggested, but no one had ever gone ahead and done this, and the \nPresident exerted the leadership and established the NBAC.\n  Quite simply, the scientific and ethical issues which the NBAC are \nsupposed to evaluate represent some of the most important, some of the \nmost complex and controversial questions of our time. NBAC's input will \nbe critical to informed policymaking for both the legislative and \nexecutive branches.\n  The two primary goals of NBAC are to, first, evaluate the current \nlevel of compliance of Federal agencies to the common rule, and, \nsecond, evaluate the common rule and advise both the executive and \nlegislative branches on any changes that might be needed to it.\n  I very strongly support the work of the NBAC but recently have become \nextremely concerned to hear that more than 15 months after its \nestablishment, the NBAC is still operating with a volunteer staff. It \nwas my understanding that a number of Federal agencies supported the \ncreation of the NBAC and agreed to back up their support with resources \nand staff. Some NBAC members have stated in public meetings that they \nare frustrated with the progress the Commission is making and attribute \nthe slow pace to the lack of resources. Additionally, the resource \nproblem may be limiting the number of meetings of the Commission.\n  Further, if this problem is not resolved in the near term, the \nCommission may have to stop meeting altogether. I sent a letter to the \nPresident's science adviser a few days ago, Dr. John Gibbons, to \nexpress my concerns about this. Dr. Gibbons was working to resolve this \nfunding problem, which I view as an urgent priority.\n  I am very glad to announce--as a matter of fact, it was just today--\nthat these groups in Government that are interested in this had a \nmeeting under Dr. Gibbons' leadership, and the $1.6 million that was \nsupposed to accrue\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nfrom these different agencies to be used by the NBAC is now \nforthcoming. So the NBAC is now funded so they can do the job they were \noriginally supposed to do.\n  We are very glad to say that has happened just today, and I am glad \nit happened today, just when I am introducing this bill, because it \nlooks as though we now truly are moving to support the NBAC that did \nnot receive the kind of monetary support, the kind of funding that we \nthought it was going to have when it was first formed a year and a half \nago.\n  There are a number of existing mechanisms that do protect human \nresearch subjects today. In fact, in March of 1996, the GAO reported to \nme that the testing protection system has reduced the likelihood of \nserious abuses from occurring. However, the GAO also pointed out a \nnumber of weaknesses and gaps in the current system.\n  There are at least four areas, four major gaps.\n  First, not all agencies have adopted the common rule, including \nagencies that currently sponsor research involving human subjects. The \nDepartment of Labor and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are examples \nof agencies that sponsor such research but those agencies have not \nadopted the common rule, which I think they should have.\n  Second, the common rule's research is voluntarily applied in many \ncases. Most institutions which receive Federal funds will voluntarily \napply the common rule to all research conducted at their institution. \nHowever, not all research institutions adopt this policy. And in any \ncase, if any improper research is discovered at these institutions, \nthere are very few steps available to the Federal Government to do much \nabout it.\n  Third, a private institution or a researcher who conducts \nnonfederally funded research or is not seeking approval of a drug or \ndevice with the FDA does not have to apply the principles of the common \nrule to its research. In other words, there is a huge area of all the \nprivate medical research out there that is not under the common rule \nunless they just choose themselves to just voluntarily do it.\n  Fourth, no Federal agency, other than HHS, has applied the additional \nprotections described in 45 CFR 46 for vulnerable populations--pregnant \nwomen and their fetus, children, prisoners--to their own research. So \nthe purpose of this legislation is to help close the gaps that exist \nwithin the current system for protecting research subjects.\n  Well, is there really a problem out there?\n  Is this just a paper loophole that I am trying to close?\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there are ongoing problems with \ninappropriate, ethically suspect research on human subjects. It is \ndifficult to know the extent of such problems because information is \nnot collected in any formal manner on human research.\n\n  The Cleveland Plain-Dealer in my home State of Ohio has recently \nreported in a whole series of articles, after much investigation of \nthis issue. And I quote from them:\n\n       What the government lacks in hard data about humans, it \n     more than makes up for with volumes of statistics about \n     laboratory animals. Wonder how many guinea pigs were used in \n     U.S. research? The Agriculture Department knows: 333,379. How \n     many hamsters in Ohio? 2,782.\n\n  So we have all this data on animals and little on human beings. I \nwould hasten to add that the guinea pigs the Plain-Dealer refers to are \nthe four-legged kind too and not the guinea pigs that are humans being \nused for research.\n  The reason we know so much about the use of animals in research is \nthat we have laws governing the handling and treatment of them.\n  For example, the Animal Welfare Act requires that certain minimum \nstandards be maintained when using animals in research.\n  Let me give you some recent examples which indicate why, \nnotwithstanding the common rule and the other protections that are in \nplace, I think additional protections are needed in statute.\n  In 1994-95, in an effort to explore the rights and interests of \npeople currently involved in radiation research conducted or sponsored \nby the Federal Government, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human \nRadiation Experiments conducted an in-depth review of 125 research \nprojects funded by HHS, DOE, DOD, VA, and NASA. According to the ACHRE \nreport:\n\n       Our review suggests that there are significant deficiencies \n     in some aspects of the current system for the protection of \n     human subjects.\n\n  The ACHRE found that documents provided to IRB's often did not \ncontain enough information about topics that are central to the ethics \nof research involving human subjects. In some cases the committee found \nit was difficult to assess the scientific merit of a protocol based on \nthe documentation provided.\n  ACHRE's report states that some consent forms studied by the \ncommittee are--and I quote--\n\n       . . . flawed in morally significant respects, not merely \n     because they are difficult to read but because they are \n     uninformative or even misleading.\n\n  The report states further:\n\n       Our review also raises serious concerns about some research \n     involving children and adults with questionable decision-\n     making capacity.\n\n  And the ACHRE concludes:\n\n       All told, the documents of almost half the studies reviewed \n     by the committee that involved greater than minimal risk [to \n     the subject] raised serious or moderate concerns.\n\n  That is a horrible indictment.\n  As I mentioned earlier, from December 15 to 18, 1996, the Cleveland \nPlain-Dealer published a series of articles entitled ``Drug Trials: Do \nPeople Know the Truth About Experiments.''\n\n       And I want to give credit to the people that worked on \n     that. Keith Epstein, has covered Capitol Hill here and has \n     written much and done much investigative reporting working on \n     this, as did Mr. Sloat, S-l-o-a-t, Bill Sloat. Those two \n     fellows worked on this and did a great job in pointing out \n     some of the problems that still exist. And we have talked to \n     them about some of these things.\n\n  The Plain-Dealer uncovered a number of disturbing cases, very \ndisturbing cases as a matter of fact, where people were either unaware \nof the fact that they were involved in research or were not provided \nfull information about potential side effects of research. The series \nraises very serious questions about the adequacy of our current system \nof protecting human research subjects.\n  The Plain-Dealer found, for example, of ``4,154 FDA inspections of \nresearchers testing new drugs on people [since 1977] . . . more than \nhalf the researchers were cited by FDA inspectors for failing to \nclearly disclose the experimental nature of their work.''\n  Another serious finding in this series is that researchers who \nreceive the most severe penalty by the FDA, being designated \n``Disqualified Investigators,'' have little fear of this fact being \nfound out by their peers or patients. One of the articles discusses \npotentially serious problems in the way research conducted outside of \nthe United States is incorporated into applications for drug approvals \nin the United States.\n  The Plain-Dealer uncovered much evidence to suggest that the Federal \nGovernment continues to sponsor research where informed consent is not \nobtained. And this fact disturbed me greatly also.\n  On November 14, 1996, the Wall Street Journal published an article \nthat examined the practice at one pharmaceutical firm, Eli Lilly and \nCo. in using homeless alcoholics in their clinical trials. The article \nraises some disturbing questions about the quality of the phase I \ntrials conducted by this one company. Also serious ethical questions \nare raised concerning the appropriateness of paying homeless alcoholics \nsignificant sums to be human guinea pigs. It is not clear from the \narticle whether these tests were reviewed by any IRB.\n  On December 27, 1996, the New York Times reported on a New York State \nappeals court ruling which found that the State's rules governing \npsychiatric experiments on children and the mentally ill were \nunconstitutional. The court found that the rules did not adequately \nprotect people who, because of age or illness, cannot give informed \nconsent to take part in drug tests or other experiments. The article \nmentions 10 to 15 of the 400 psychiatric experiments covered by the \nruling as being ``privately financed'' and therefore outside the \ncoverage of Federal rules.\n  How would you like it if your father, mother, son or daughter, \nhusband, wife was in one of those institutions and was having \nexperiments conducted on\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\nthem without your knowing about it or without them knowing about it? \nThat is what we are up against.\n  On August 15, 1994, the New York Times reported on ethical and legal \nquestions regarding a company's efforts to promote a drug that can make \nsome children grow taller than they otherwise would. The drug in \nquestion, Protropin, has been approved by FDA for use in children whose \nbodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone. \nHowever, once approved, doctors may prescribe it for other purposes at \ntheir discretion. In this case the company was apparently surveying \nschools for short children and then trying to funnel those children to \ndoctors who would prescribe the drug whether or not the children lacked \nthe human growth hormone. This unapproved research was occurring \nwithout the oversight of an IRB. And at least 15,000 children have \ntaken this drug.\n  Another illustration of the precarious coverage of the common rule \noccurred in 1995 when it became known that researchers from the Center \nfor Reproductive Health at the University of California Irvine, were \nfertilizing humans and implanting theses in different mothers without \nthe consent of the donor. This research was not being funded by any \nFederal agency; however, NIH was funding more than $20 million worth of \nother research at the university. Even though several internal and \nexternal investigations by the university and the district attorney \nwere being conducted on this experiment, a clarifying moment occurred \nwhen investigators from OPRR visited UC Irvine early last year. These \ninvestigators reminded university officials of the common rule; the \nfact that the university had agreed to apply it to all research \nconducted there--through OPRR's assurance process; and that NIH was \ncurrently funding a good deal of research at the institution. Within a \nweek of OPRR's visit, the university took public action to halt the \nresearch and formally investigate the researchers.\n\n  On October 10, 1994, the New York Times reported on a New York doctor \nwho adopted two types of drugs approved by FDA for cancer treatment and \nstomach ulcers for an unapproved use to perform nonsurgical abortions. \nThe article quotes the doctor saying that in 121 of 126 cases his \napproach was successful. The remaining five cases required surgery to \ncomplete the procedure. Because the drugs were FDA approved and the \ndoctor was not funded or connected to federally sponsored research, no \nIRB or approved informed consent procedures were required. Apparently, \neach patient signed a three-page consent form, but this was not \napproved by an IRB. According to the Times, once FDA approves a drug, \nphysicians are generally allowed to use it for off label purposes.\n  Now Mr. President, some of the issues discussed in these articles are \nproblems with how the common rule itself is being applied. Some of \nthese examples illustrate the gaps in the common rule coverage. My \nlegislation will address both the coverage and the application of the \ncommon rule.\n  Now how precisely would the legislation work?\n  It would require all research facilities to register with HHS. \nRegistration shall include: First, statement of principles governing \nthe research facility in its conduct of human subject research; second, \ndesignation of the official responsible for all human subject; third, \ndesignation of membership roster of IRB(s); and fourth, attestation \nthat the research facility is complying with the protection \nrequirements of the common rule.\n  The legislation includes a grandfather provision for all research \nentities which currently have negotiated project assurances with HHS. \nThe vast majority of research facilities have such assurances.\n  The legislation contains a 3-year reregistration requirement.\n  The legislation includes criminal penalties for failure to comply \nwith the act. Therefore, if enacted it would be a felony offense to \nexperiment on someone without their informed consent.\n  The intent therefore of this legislation is twofold: First, to fill \nin the gaps of coverage of the common rule by requiring all research \ninvolving human subjects to abide by the rule; and second, to elevate \nthe importance of conducting research ethically, the bill provides \ncriminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with the \nrequirements of this law, and by extension 45 CFR 46.\n  Finally Mr. President, my legislation would codify a recommendation \nwhich the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments made \nregarding the conduct of classified research involving human subjects.\n\n  Specifically, the advisory committee recommended that informed \nconsent of all human subjects of classified research be required, and \nthat such requirement not be subject to waiver or exemption. Under \ncurrent rule and executive order, it is possible to waive informed \nconsent and IRB review for classified research. Title II of this \nlegislation would prohibit the waiver of either informed consent or IRB \nreview for classified research.\n  The advisory committee also recommended that human subjects of \nclassified research be provided with certain information regarding that \nresearch. My legislation would require that such subjects be \ninformation concerning: First, the identify of the sponsoring Federal \nagency; second, a statement that the research involves classified \ninformation; and third, an unclassified description of the purpose of \nthe research.\n  Mr. President I have tried today to briefly lay out the case for the \nneed for the legislation I am introducing. I know that my colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine, is also concerned about the issues I have \nraised today, and about those that appeared last month in the Plain \nDealer. I believe that he has requested that the chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee hold hearings on this subject. I think \nthat is entirely appropriate. And I hope that this legislation could be \nconsidered in that process. I look forward to working with the Labor \nCommittee in this regard.\n  I do not claim to have the magic bullet solution with this bill. \nHowever, I believe there are some key principles which should guide the \nSenate's consideration of this legislation. These principles are:\n  First, informed consent and independent review of experiments \ninvolving human subjects must be required.\n  Second, anyone who violates the right of research subject to have \ninformed consent, should be held criminally responsible for that \nviolation.\n  I want to put this in personal terms once again. You can imagine your \nspouse, husband, wife, father, mother, children, being experimented on \nwithout your knowledge or their knowledge. That is unconscionable, and \nwe should not permit that. This legislation will close many of the \nloopholes that permit that to happen now.\n  As the legislative process moves ahead, it is certain that the bill \nwill undergo scrutiny and amendments. But I think the outcome, if this \nlegislation is enacted into law, will be improved protections for all \nAmericans.\n  Madam President, obviously, I welcome any cosponsors on this \nlegislation. I will be sending out a ``dear colleague'' letter to all \nthe offices, and I hope we get a good response to that. I think there \nare very few Senators who will not back this when they hear what can \nhappen then to them, their families, and their constituents back home, \nif we do not pass something like this.\n  I think this is many years overdue. I don't want to scare people to \ndeath with this, because I think most of the research in this country \nis conducted in a way that is good and is with informed consent--in \nmost cases. But just the few examples that I have mentioned here today, \nas well as the articles in the Cleveland Plain Dealer and New York \nTimes I quoted from, indicate there is still a very major problem in \nthis area and one that we want to close the gaps on so that no American \nis subjected to experiments like this, unless they know exactly what is \ngoing on and have given informed consent.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. \n        Kyl):\n  S. 194. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the section 170(e)(5) rules pertaining to gifts of publicly \ntraded stock to certain private foundations and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\n                    private foundations legislation\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation which \nmakes permanent the full value deduction for gifts of appreciated stock \nto private foundations. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Moynihan and Senator Abraham, have agreed to join me in this \neffort.\n  Since 1984, donors have been allowed to deduct the full fair market \nvalue of certain gifts of public traded stock to private foundations. \nThis provision of the tax code was added as part of the Tax Reform Act \nof 1984 to encourage individuals to create foundations during their \nlifetime. Unfortunately, when this section was enacted it included a \nsunset date of December 31, 1994 which was extended through May 31, \n1997 as part of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act. Without this \nprovision, the number of new foundations--as well as additional \nendowments to existing foundations--is likely to fall off dramatically.\n  Private foundations are nonprofit organizations that support \ncharitable activities in order to serve the common good. They provide \nsupport by making grants to other nonprofit agencies, or through \noperating their own programs. In some cases, such as scholarships and \ndisaster relief, foundations may make grants to individuals.\n  Foundations are created with endowments--money given by individuals, \nfamilies, or corporations. They make grants or operate programs with \nthe income earned from investing the endowments. Since most foundations \nhave permanent endowments, they do not need to raise funds each year \nfrom the public in order to continue their work. Freed from these \nconstraints, foundations are perfectly positioned to act as the \nresearch and development arm of society.\n  In a 1965 Report on Private Foundations, the Treasury Department \nrecognized the special nature of foundations by describing them as \n``uniquely qualified to initiate thought and action, experiment with \nnew untried ventures, dissent from prevailing attitudes, and act \nquickly and flexibly.'' Indeed, foundations reflect the innovative \nspirit of the individuals and corporations that endow them.\n  There are more than 34,000 private foundations in America today that \nprovide over $9 billion annually to support innumerable projects, large \nand small. Among other things, they help the poor and disadvantaged, \nadvance scientific and medical research, and strengthen the American \neducational system.\n  Let me give you a few examples of some of the medical advances that \nhave occurred as a result of the financial assistance provided by \nprivate foundations: The polio vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in \n1953 after the Sarah Scaife Foundation provided him with the money he \nneeded to establish and equip his virus laboratory.\n  With the help of the Commonwealth Fund, Dr. Papanicolaou discovered \nin 1923 that cervical cancer could be diagnosed before a woman \npresented any symptoms. That breakthrough led to the basic and now \nroutine diagnostic technique known as the Pap smear.\n  In 1951, Dr. Max Theiler received the Nobel Prize in medicine for his \nwork in developing the yellow fever vaccine. That effort was the direct \nresult of a 30-year, all-out commitment by the Rockefeller Foundation \nto eradicate this disease.\n  But, Mr. President, private foundations have been involved in many \nmore aspects of our daily lives than simply funding medical advances. \nDr. John V.N. Dorr was an engineer in the early 1950's. He speculated \nthat many accidents occurring on our Nation's highways during inclement \nweather were the result of drivers hugging the white lines painted in \nthe middle of the road. Dorr believed that if similar lines were \npainted on the shoulder side of the road, lives could be saved.\n  Dorr convinced transportation engineers in Westchester County, NY, to \ntest his theory along a particularly treacherous stretch of highway. \nThe dropoff in accidents along this part of the road was dramatic, and \nDr. Dorr used his own foundation to publicize the demonstration's \nresults nationally. Today, although State funds are now used to paint \nwhite lines on the shoulder side of the Nation's highways, every person \ntraveling in motor vehicles is indebted to Dorr and his foundation for \nimplementing this lifesaving discovery.\n  As these examples indicate, private foundations provide a great many \nbenefits to our society. By permanently extending this tax incentive, \nwe can continue to encourage individuals to dedicate a substantial \nportion of their wealth to public, rather than private purposes. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this legislation.\n  Our bill permanently extends the tax incentive for an individual who \ncontributes stock to a private foundation. This provision currently \nexpires on May 31, 1997.\n  Under this bill, a taxpayer who contributes publicly traded stock to \na private foundation would be allowed a deduction for the full fair \nmarket value of the stock. Absent this legislation, the deduction would \nbe limited to the cost basis of the stock, which for many donors \neffectively eliminates the incentive to make the donation.\n  The legislation also conforms the due date for a private foundation's \nfirst quarter estimated tax payment with the filing date for the annual \ntax return. Currently, a private foundation is required to make its \nfirst quarter estimated tax payment on April 15, even though the annual \nincome tax return is not due until May 15. Under this bill, a \nfoundation's first estimated tax payment would be due on May 15.\n  Finally, the bill also simplifies the rules governing distributions \nfrom a private foundation to a charity located outside the United \nStates.\n  A similar proposal introduced in the 104th Congress was estimated by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation to cost $287 million over 5 years.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Chafee, in introducing this legislation to extend \npermanently the full, fair market value deduction for gifts of publicly \ntraded stock to private foundations.\n  Much of the focus in Congress over the last several years has been on \nefforts to control or reduce Government spending in order to balance \nthe budget. As programs are cut to meet budget constraints, pressure \nwill be placed on other sectors, particularly the independent sector, \nto fill the void. Already, the extent to which nonprofit institutions \nin the United States perform functions that are typically governmental \nundertakings in other countries is perhaps not fully understood or \nappreciated. It is a unique feature of our society of inestimable value \nand must be sustained. As demand on the independent sector grows, we \nmust support its efforts to promote the common good and confront social \nproblems.\n  A bit of history: prior to 1969, contributions of appreciated \nproperty were deductible at their fair market value. In 1969, Congress \nadopted a number of rules to address certain abuses then occurring with \nrespect to a small number of private foundations. These included a \nseries of targeted Treasury Department recommendations to impose excise \ntax penalties on self-dealing transactions, excess business holdings, \ninsufficient distributions for charitable purposes, and the like. \nHowever, in response to the negative publicity surrounding private \nfoundations at the time, Congress felt it necessary to impose other \nrestrictions beyond the targeted Treasury proposals. These included a \nprovision to limit the deduction for gifts of appreciated property to \nprivate foundations to the donor's basis, usually, the original \npurchase price.\n  After 1969, the IRS and other experts concluded that the targeted \nantiabuse rules worked well to correct the problems with private \nfoundations. And nothing indicated that the 1969 limit on deductibility \nof gifts of appreciated property to private foundations was necessary \nto prevent abuse, at least to the extent that the property's value was \nreadily determinable. Thus, in 1984, Congress approved a rule, that \nsunset after 10 years, providing a deduction for the full value of \ngifts of publicly traded stock to private foundations. This temporarily \nrestored parity of treatment to contributions of stock to public \ncharities--already fully deductible--and to private foundations.\n  Then came the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was largely an effort to \nbroaden the tax base and reduce rates. One such base-broadening \nprovision was the creation of a tax preference under the individual \nalternative minimum tax [AMT] for gifts of appreciated\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nproperty to charitable organizations. Thus, taxpayers subject to the \nAMT could only deduct the basis of property donated to charitable \norganizations.\n  As it turned out, the 1986 Tax Act worked all too well. Not only was \nthe base broadened, but charitable giving of appreciated property \nnearly disappeared. And the charitable organizations let us know that \nour action had hurt them financially in such a way that not only they, \nbut the larger public trust they serve, were suffering. Thus, at the \nbehest of this Senator, in 1990 Congress at first temporarily, and then \nin 1993 permanently, repealed the tax preference for contributions of \nappreciated property.\n  At the end of 1994, however, the full deduction for contributions of \nappreciated stock to private foundations expired. It had been intended \nas a 10-year experiment; the 10 years ran out, and the experiment was \nover. But most observers concluded that the experiment had worked--the \nprivate foundation rules continued to work reasonably well to prevent \nabuse, even while gifts of appreciated stock were fully deductible. In \nparticular, the rule was not a source of compliance problems for the \nInternal Revenue Service. Thus, we agreed to extend the provision \ntemporarily just last year in the Small Business Job Protection Act. \nUnfortunately, it will expire once again at the end of May. There being \nno harm done by this provision, and much good, it is a rule we should \nlike to see extended once again--and this time permanently.\n  Mr. President, no reason exists to provide different treatment under \nthe Tax Code for gifts of appreciated stock to private foundations than \nis provided for such gifts to public charities. Private foundations are \nan important component of our nonprofit, independent sector. They make \nvast contributions to our society in the areas of education, health, \ndisaster relief, the advancement of knowledge and the preservation of \nhistorical and cultural artifacts, to name only a few. Government must \nplay a role in ensuring that nonprofit institutions not merely survive, \nbut thrive--particularly during an era of Government cutbacks. The \nlegislation we introduce today will be a great help in this regard. I \nlook forward to its early and favorable consideration in the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 196. A bill to amend the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to require \nthe Administrator of General Services to prioritize construction and \nalteration projects in accordance with merit-based needs criteria, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n the federal building construction and alteration funding improvement \n                                  act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish a system to ensure that funding for the construction and \nrepair of Federal buildings is allocated according to need and \npriority.\n  First, the bill would require the President to submit the \nadministration's building construction budget request in the form of a \nprioritized list of projects. Second, and most importantly, the bill \nwould require the General Services Administration to prepare and \nmaintain a ranked priority list of all ongoing and proposed \nconstruction projects. The list would be updated and reprioritized with \neach new project added either through administrative or congressional \naction.\n  Last year, Congress provided nearly $900 million for Federal building \nconstruction and major repairs not including the funds provided to the \nDepartment of Defense. Over the past 5 years Congress obligated over $4 \nbillion for this purpose. This is an enormous sum of money. Clearly, \nthe Federal building construction program can and must share in the \nsacrifice as we seek to gain, control over the deficit.\n  As we rein in spending, it is more critical now than ever to ensure \nthat scarce financial resources are allocated to our highest \npriorities. In order to trim the fat in an informed and efficient \nmanner, Congress, the administration and the taxpaying public must know \nwhat our construction priorities are.\n  During debate on the rescission bill in the last Congress, the Senate \nconsidered proposals to cut Federal construction funding. The list of \nprojects proposed for defunding was rather arbitrary and capricious. \nThe tenets of good government dictate that when we reduce spending, our \nlowest priorities should be put on the chopping block first. Yet, \nCongress cannot readily determine what those priorities are. By \nrequiring the General Services Administration, which administers the \nFederal building fund, to maintain a ranked list of project priorities, \nwe can be sure that funding decisions will be made on the basis of \nmerit rather than politics or congressional caprice.\n  Mr. President, foremost, this legislation will help us address the \npork barrel politics which has played far too great a role in the \nprocess of Federal building construction. Currently, when a Member of \nCongress decides a new building is needed in his or her State or \ndistrict, the General Services Administration conducts what is known as \nan 11b survey to determine the need. In most cases, the GSA determines \nthat a need exists. The study is then used to justify project \nauthorization and appropriation, even though a finding of need is not a \nfinding that such a project is a priority.\n  As projects that are not in the President's budget request are added \nby Congress, we do not always have a clear idea of where they are \nranked among competing priorities. Passage of this legislation will \nensure that this vital information is readily available.\n  I urge the relevant committees to expeditiously examine this proposal \nso that we can approve rapidly this relatively minor but, I believe, \nimportant and helpful change in procedure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        D'Amato, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Gordon H.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage savings and investment through individual retirement \naccounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the savings and investment incentives act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today we reintroduce the super IRA, a \nsavings plan that is well-known as the Roth-Breaux super IRA.\n  I'm honored again to be joined by Senator John Breaux, in introducing \nthis bill. I believe now, as I did last Congress, that this is \nextremely well conceived legislation that succeeds in strengthening two \nfundamental components of our society: the family and the future of our \neconomy. Much has been written and said about both of these lately, \nparticularly as we look to a new century. Likewise, we're hearing more \nand more about the need to promote personal responsibility and self-\nsufficiency.\n  The Roth-Breaux super IRA will have a positive influence in all of \nthese areas. Congress understands this. That's why Congress has passed \nsimilar legislation in the past. We all know that Washington must \npromote policies that strengthen family and create an environment where \nour economy can grow, this is why our IRA legislation in the past has \nbeen marked by a strong, cooperative, bipartisan spirit. In 1991, \nlegislation similar to this had 78 cosponsors. In 1994, we had 58 \ncosponsors and in 1995, 52 cosponsors. I believe this legislation will \nfind similar support.\n  Why? Because this super IRA will go a long way toward strengthening \nour families and restoring equity to work-at-home spouses and other \nworkers without pensions. It will also boost our Nation's saving rate \nand lead to capital formation, increased investment and economic \ngrowth. The lack of saving in this country, as we all know, is a real \nconcern. Chairman Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve says that the \nsingle most important long-term economic issue for this country is \nsavings--savings that are essential for jobs, opportunity, and growth.\n  This super IRA has been designed to address our Nation's need for \nsavings\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nand to provide families with as much flexibility as possible to use \ntheir savings not only for their security, but for the important goals \nand challenges in life. For example, this super IRA allows withdrawals \nto be made penalty-free to purchase first homes, to pay for college, \nand to cover expenses during extended periods of unemployment.\n  This super IRA removes many of the Tax Code's barriers to retirement \nsaving. First, this bill increases and phases out the IRA's income \nlimits over 4 years, and increases the contribution limit to keep up \nwith inflation. Furthermore, one of the key features of our bill is \nthat we separate the IRA and the 401(k) or 403(b), so Americans can \nsave the maximum in both, and so that spouses who work at home will not \nhave their savings limited by their husband's or wife's 401(k).\n  To strengthen the way this super IRA serves our families, this \nlegislation not only allows parents to use penalty free withdrawals to \nhelp their children meet these goals and challenges, but children can \nuse their IRA's to help their parents. Grandparents can make penalty \nfree withdrawals to help grandchildren. And grandchildren can use their \nIRA's to help their grandparents. Our objective is to make this IRA as \nfamily oriented, as flexible and as useful as possible. It will go a \nlong way toward promoting opportunity and reliance on self and family.\n  Let me stress, this super IRA bill builds on what we did in the Small \nBusiness job Protection Act of 1996 and eliminates the unequal \ntreatment of work-at-home spouses that now exists under current law. \nThis bill allows spouses--husbands or wives--who work at home to make \nequal IRA contributions, up to $2,000, in their own accounts regardless \nof whether their spouse has an employer pension.\n  With the super IRA, we also create a new type of individual \nretirement account--an IRA in which an individual's contribution is not \ntax deductible, but where the earnings can be withdrawn tax free if the \naccount is open for at least 5 years, and the account owner is at least \n59\\1/2\\ when the funds are withdrawn.\n  Mr. President, it's clear to see why this is a bill whose time has \ncome. We have passed it before--in both Houses of Congress--now we must \npass it again. It serves the individual. It serves the family. It \nserves the Nation. It is equitable, restoring spousal contributions to \nwhere they should be. It is flexible, offering penalty free withdrawals \nfor life's necessities. It promises the vital capital formation America \nneeds to invest in its future. And it builds upon the very important \nconcept of self-reliance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Senator Roth and I are introducing \nthe Savings and Investment Incentive Act of 1997. We have introduced \nthis bill in past Congresses but it is even more timely now as the \npressure builds to secure the retirement of the baby boomers.\n  The facts are staring us in the face. Within 30 years one out of \nevery five Americans will be over 65. The baby boomers are 76 million \nstrong, doubling the number of Social Security beneficiaries by the \nyear 2040.\n  At the same time, Social Security outlays will begin out pacing \nSocial Security receipts in 2013 and the Social Security trust fund \nwill be bankrupt in 2029 if we don't take the necessary steps to \npreserve it. And our national savings rate is only 1 percent of GDP. \nThis is one-half of what it was in 1970. By comparison, we save half as \nmuch as the Germans and one-third as much as the Japanese. This is a \nserious problem. We need to address it by reducing the budget deficit \nand eliminating the drain it places on our national savings but we need \nto address it in other ways, as well.\n  The Super IRA bill makes changes in the rules governing IRA's that \nwill expand the availability of the IRA as a savings vehicle. The \nincome caps will be eliminated over a 5-year period. Our bill creates a \nnew kind of IRA that allows taxpayers to earn tax-free income. Funds \ncan be withdrawn from either the current form of IRA or the new IRA to \npurchase a first home, meet a family's income needs during an extended \nperiod of unemployment or to pay for educational expenses.\n  IRA's have broad bipartisan support as demonstrated by the list of \ncosponsors. I hope that we will work together to pass this legislation \nthis year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 198. A bill to prohibit campaign expenditures for services of \nlobbyists, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n           THE LOBBYING CONFLICT OF INTEREST ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President today I am introducing legislation entitled \nthe ``Lobbying Conflict of Interest Elimination Act.'' This bill would \nban a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee from paying \nregistered lobbyists for political services. Additionally, the bill \nwould mandate that any political contributions made by a registered \nlobbyist be reported by such individual when he or she files his or her \nlobbying disclosure report as mandated in the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  In the last Congress, we were successful in passing legislation that \nbans gifts from lobbyists to Members and staff in order to put a wall \nbetween lobbyists who seek to curry special favor by the giving of \ngifts. Unfortunately, a loophole allows lobbyists to serve as \nfundraisers for Members of Congress, which could result in an increase \nin their influence.\n  Mr. President, this practice must stop. Registered lobbyists who work \nfor campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. \nWhen a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that Member, the \nperception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation \nwould stop such practices.\n  The two important changes made by this legislation represent a \nsubstantial effort to close any loopholes that exist in our lobbying \nand gift laws. The Congress has begun to make great strides to restore \nthe public's confidence in this institution. We must continue that good \nwork.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 199. A bill to require industry cost-sharing for the construction \nof certain new federally funded research facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         the federal research financing improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrestore fairness and fiscal accountability to the Federal Government's \nmany research and development programs and activities. The bill would \nrequire that commercial interests share the cost of constructing and \noperating new Federal research facilities that are intended to benefit \ntheir industries.\n  Last year, the Federal Government spent $73 billion for research \nprograms, including facility construction. Many of these programs are \nintended primarily to assist private industries and are sponsored by a \nhost of Federal agencies, predominantly the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the National \nResearch Council.\n  For example, the Department of Agriculture spends nearly $750 million \nper year for 116 centers under the Agriculture Research Service. These \nfederally funded centers are designed to help a variety of agricultural \nindustries, many of which have enormous resources and do not require \nFederal assistance. I understand the agency is planning to construct \neven more facilities. Last year, Congress appropriated $26 million to \nconstruct a new swine research center at Iowa State University, even \nthough we already have 12 Federal centers dedicated to swine research. \nThis additional facility will cost nearly $10 million a year to \noperate.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the importance of research and development \nto our competitiveness and economic growth, although I seriously \nquestion why we need 13 centers dedicated to swine research. \nNevertheless, given our serious fiscal condition at a time when we are \ncontemplating significant reductions in practically every area of \ndomestic discretionary spending, I see absolutely no reason why \nGovernment research that benefits private industries, many of them \nquite prosperous, should not be cost-shared by the private sector.\n  Regarding swine research centers, the pork industry generates nearly \n$66 billion per year. Surely, it is reasonable to expect the industry, \nand the many others that directly benefit from Federal research, to \nshare the cost of the centers and its operation. I should add that the \nlegislation would not require cost sharing for any research\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nconducted for the purpose of helping industry comply with Federal \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, industry is historically more cautious with their \nresources than the Federal Government. If the private sector will not \nexpend their resources for a program that is intended for their \nbenefit, one must question why we should feel compelled to spend the \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money on the same venture. Public-private cost-\nsharing arrangements for commercially oriented Federal research will \nensure that proposed activities are truly cost-beneficial and that the \npotential outcomes of the research are worth the dollars invested.\n  Again, I realize and appreciate the importance of research and \ndevelopment. I believe, however, that the legislation is a prudent and \nresponsible approach which, no doubt, can be improved, but which should \nreceive the Senate's full and timely consideration. I hope that we can \nhave a hearing in the very near future to examine what I believe is a \nvery important fiscal issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Ashcroft \nas an original cosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  S. 4 will update the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] to better \nreflect the needs of today's workers. It will provide the kind of \nflexibility that workers and employers need in an age in which more and \nmore of us are balancing roles as both parent and wage earner.\n  The current FLSA does not provide enough flexibility. S. 4 will allow \nemployers and employees together to decide whether the employee should \nreceive overtime pay or compensatory\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\ntime off for working more than a 40-hour workweek. Under current law, \nan employer cannot allow an employee to work 45 hours one week in \nexchange for 35 hours the next week so the worker can attend, for \nexample, a child's baseball game, a parent-teacher conference, or \ndoctor's appointment. S. 4 will change this rigid interpretation of the \nFLSA. It will allow workers the ability to arrange biweekly work \nschedules--the employee could work any combination of 80 hours over 2 \nweeks, if agreed to by the employer. Someone could work a long week and \nthen a short week to best fit the needs of his or her family.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act also provides, if agreed to by both \nemployer and employee, a way for employees to ``bank'' overtime hours--\nup to 6 weeks of paid time--so that, when needed, employees will have a \nway to take extended leave and still have a paycheck. In contrast, \nPresident Clinton is proposing that Congress mandate to employers that \nan employee be granted extra--that is, unpaid--time off to attend to \nfamily needs.\n  As a safeguard against abuse, S. 4 requires that any flexible work \narrangement or banked overtime hours be agreed upon by both the \nemployer and the employee, without coercion. In addition, the amount of \ntime an employee could accumulate would be limited to 240 hours. \nMoreover, at the end of the year, employers must ``cash out'' by paying \nthe employee for the unused accumulated hours--The employee must be \nable to ``cash out'' his or her accumulated leave within 30 days. \nCollective bargaining agreements would remain unaffected, but the \nrevised work schedule could be worked into a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  Families today are looking for ways to better manage work and child-\nrearing. Without imposing additional Government mandates on employers, \nS. 4 will provide employers and employees the flexibility to better \njuggle the responsibilities of work and family. According to Lynn \nHayes, author of ``The Best Jobs in America for Parents,'' when working \nparents are asked what they desire most in a job, a majority answer \n``flexibility in scheduling.'' And, according to a study commissioned a \nfew years ago by Arizona's Salt River Project of the Southwest region, \na majority of parents with children under 13 are willing to trade \nsalary increases for flexible time, leave, and dependent-care benefits.\n  There are other studies showing that Americans want flexibility in \nthe workplace. In a work/family study conducted by Johnson & Johnson, \nfor example, the company expected a need for child care to surface. \nInstead, ``the big issue that popped out was that of all the things \nthat we would do as a corporation in support of parents, the biggest \nfactor was that they wanted a flexible work schedule.''\n\n  Mr. President, the Family Friendly Workplace Act will update labor \nlaw to allow for increased flexibility in the workplace and to better \nreflect the needs of today's families. As we all know, today's parents \nare under a great deal of pressure--to provide for their children \nfinancially and provide the time needed to raise a healthy child, \ncapable of contributing positively to society. We in Congress should \nrespond by correcting the law, when possible and without mandate, to \nimprove the ability of parents to provide for their children.\n  Reforming both tax and labor law will go a long way toward improving \nthe quality of life of the American family. In 1950, the average family \npaid one dollar in taxes to the Federal Government for every $50 \nearned. Today, it pays almost $1 out of every $3 earned. That is why I \nam introducing the Tax Limitation Amendment, a proposed amendment to \nthe Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate \nto increase taxes--reducing taxes could be achieved by a simple \nmajority--and why I support such initiatives as a $500 tax cut for \nfamilies with children under 18.\n  Today's increased tax burden has kept parents working more hours to \nkeep more of their own hard-earned dollars. High taxes are more than a \nstrain on our pocketbooks--they are allowing us to spend less time with \nour children, or with others who may be dependent upon us. In concert \nwith tax relief, the hours that the Family Friendly Workplace Act can \nprovide a working mother or father to spend with growing children will \nbegin to remove some of the financial and scheduling headaches \npresented by so many jobs today.\n  Once the public learns about the Family Friendly Workplace Act, and \nwhat it has to offer the American family, I believe there will be a \ngroundswell of support that will be heard around the Capitol. I urge my \ncolleagues in both the House and the Senate to quickly pass this bill \nand send it to the President, so that he will be given an early \nopportunity to, as he has said, ``pass a flex-time law that allows \nemployees to take their overtime pay in money, or in time off, \ndepending on what's better for their family.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S653-6", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH OF CLYDE TOMBAUGH\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

MOBLEY, JR.\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I stand today in recognition of an \nextraordinary, colorful lifetime of service and dedication by one \nindividual who strove to make a difference in his community. Father \nWilliam M. Mobley was, in many respects, larger than life; he was the \ntype of person who several centuries ago would have typified the \nRenaissance man. He was a soldier, historian, teacher, playwright, and \nactor. But, in addition to his high intellect and varied cultural \ninterests, Father Mobley was a man grounded in his Catholic faith and \ndedicated to the everyday concerns of his parishioners.\n  He was known widely as Father Bill in Mukilteo and nearby Everett, \ncities just north of Seattle in my home State of Washington. It was \nhere that he served St. John's Mission and St. Mary Magdalene Church \nfrom 1987 until his death this past Christmas Eve, December 24, 1996.\n  Father Mobley came to the priesthood, and his Catholic faith, late in \nhis life. Born on April 3, 1929, he was raised in Southern Baptist \nroots in Birmingham, AL. He was first introduced to Catholicism while \nan Air Force soldier during the Korean war, and converted in 1954. In \n1956, Father Mobley graduated with honors from Birmingham-Southern \nCollege, where he was widely acclaimed for his acting, directing, and \nwriting abilities in the theater. Though he was offered a prestigious \nscholarship to the Yale Drama School, Father Mobley turned his \nattention to helping those around him. Influenced by this desire to \nserve others, Father Mobley joined Dr. Tom Barton, whom he had met \nwhile working at a hospital in Pell City, AL, and traveled to Green \nRiver, UT. From 1959 to 1970, Father Mobley assisted Dr. Barton in \nmanaging a badly needed medical center that serviced residents of Green \nRiver and east-central Utah.\n  In 1970, at the age of 41, Father Mobley entered the Pope John XXIII \nNational Seminary in Weston, MA. Unfortunately, soon thereafter, Father \nMobley suffered a heart attack, the first of three he would have in his \nlifetime, and had to have open-heart surgery. While this would have \nbeen an insurmountable hurdle for a lot of people, Father Mobley rose \nabove his physical pains and persevered to complete his ordination in \nDecember 1973.\n  He then returned to Utah to serve in the Diocese of Salt Lake City. \nWhile there, Father Mobley touched innumerable lives and hearts, \nparticipated in charitable work, and ran a retreat house in Logan, UT. \nBut the strains of his physical condition were taking\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\ntheir toll, and finally Father Mobley was forced to move from Salt Lake \nCity, where, due to its high altitude, he was always accompanied by an \noxygen mask. Although doctors advised retirement, Father Mobley chose \nto serve in the Washington Diocese in the Mukilteo and Everett areas, \nwhose residents were fortunate enough to have been touched by this \nextraordinary person.\n  Today, I celebrate Father Mobley as an active, energetic, and \ngenerous man. He was generous with his faith sharing, he was generous \nwith his counsel, and he was generous with his enthusiasm and \nconversation. Father Mobley was a man of incredible passion and \ncompassion. His friends, family, and parishioners will remember him for \nhis soulful sermons and championing of social justice.\n  Father Mobley challenged those around him to give and love \nunconditionally. This is a challenge each and every one of us can take \ninspiration from. He was truly a man who loved his fellow human beings, \nand he will be missed by those who had the opportunity to know \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S654-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GOLD STAR MOTHERS\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we begin a new session of \nCongress, I thought this would be an appropriate time to stop for a \nmoment and reflect upon some of the sacrifices that have been made by \nour citizens to ensure the protection of liberty and democracy in this \ngreat Nation. One group of citizens comes immediately to mind--the Gold \nStar Mothers.\n  This organization was formed in the years following the end World War \nI. It is a nonprofit, nonpolitical group which was organized by 25 \nmothers in June 1928 and incorporated on January 5, 1929. The cost of \nmembership is incalculable. To join, one must have lost a son or \ndaughter during a war waged by the United States.\n  As a parent myself, I know from personal experience that there is \nnothing more costly that losing a child. To raise and nurture a son or \ndaughter, instilling in them the aspirations and goals that are only \nachieved through a long and full life, and then to having their lives \ncut short is a tragic and devastating blow to any parent. The pain \nnever goes away. It is a pain that Gold Star Mothers live with every \nday.\n  What is remarkable about this group of courageous women is that they \nrefused to allow their grief to become the victor. Instead, they chose \nto channel their pain and suffering into productive work to benefit \nveterans and the community at large.\n  In 1940, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt recognized their \ntireless efforts on behalf of veterans and Gold Star family members by \nenacting legislation to honor these brave women by designating the last \nSunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day. There is no organization \nmore worthy of this perpetual honor.\n  But the Gold Star Mothers did not stop there. They wanted to expand \ntheir opportunities to assist veterans and their families and sought a \ncongressional charter so they could work in veterans hospitals \nthroughout the country. That charter was granted in 1984. The charter \noutlines the objective and purposes for which they were organized, \nincluding assisting all veterans and their dependents in claims to the \nVA; inspiring respect for the Stars and Stripes; encouraging a sense of \nindividual obligation to the community, State, and Union; perpetuating \nthe memory of those whose lives were sacrificed in our wars, and \nsupporting and extending needful assistance to all Gold Star Mothers.\n  Over the ensuing years, Gold Star Mothers has provided assistance to \ncountless veterans needing help. They do so with great dedication and \ngreat love. What greater love is there than a mother's love?\n  Although the group started out with only 25 members, Gold Star \nMothers grew quickly and today has department officers covering all 50 \nstates as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. And they \nkeep expanding.\n  I just wanted to take this time to salute this organization, to \nassure them that a grateful nation has not forgotten their sacrifice, \nand to thank them for the good work they continue to do for this great \nnation. I would like to pay special tribute to a Gold Star Mother in my \nState, Margaret Renner, who lost a son in Vietnam in 1969. She has been \nan active member of Gold Star Mothers, Inc., for many years, and all of \nus who know her are grateful for her dedicated service to the men and \nwomen who have served the Nation honorably as well as to those who have \nlost their sons and daughters to war. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S655-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S655-S656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate \nthe budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget \nOffice under section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the \nrequirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough January 22, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the budget (H.

Current level is $17.8 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 \nand $99.2 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. \nThe current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the \nmaximum deficit amount is $222.4 billion, $4.9 billion below the \nmaximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion.\n  This is my first report for the first session of the 105th Congress.\n  The report follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1997.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join over 50 of my \ncolleagues today in cosponsoring legislation to solve an unfortunate \ntax problem drastically affecting farmers in Washington State and \nthroughout the Nation. This bill will prevent the alternative minimum \ntax from being applied to deferred payment contracts.\n  Farmers routinely use deferred payment contracts to assist their \nmoney management and farm operations. Wheat growers, potato growers, \nand other farmers in Washington State often enter into contracts \nrequiring them to sell and deliver their crops on a specified date for \na fixed amount. While these contracts may be entered into one year, the \npayments to the farmers agreed to in the contract, either in total or \nin part, often will not be received by the farmer until the following \nyear. The Internal Revenue Service is now saying that farmers must pay \ntaxes in the year of the contract, not the year of payment. I think it \nis wrong to require farmers to pay taxes on income they have not yet \nreceived. I believe most Americans would agree.\n  Farmers are not trying to avoid paying taxes. They simply consider it \nunfair to be burdened with a tax liability prior to receiving payment. \nI am particularly concerned about the retroactive approach the Internal \nRevenue Service has taken with regard to this issue. While the 1986 Tax \nAct omitted the exemption from the AMT for farmers, the IRS failed to \nimpose the alternative minimum tax for 8 years. Now, all of a sudden, \nthe IRS is imposing the AMT. And not only for the current year, but for \nall years open to audit. This could well cost family farmers tens of \nthousands of dollars. We cannot afford to impose such an egregious \nobligation on our family farms. It is not right. This bill will correct \nthe situation.\n  This bill will make it clear that the alternative minimum tax shall \nnot be applied to installment sales of farmers. It will insure that \nfarmers pay taxes when they get paid, not before. It is that simple. \nWhile fancy terms like alternative minimum tax, deferred payment \ncontracts, and installment sales of inventory property make the issue \nsound complex, it is really about simple tax fairness--paying taxes on \nincome received, not on income expected.\n  The IRS Commissioner has stated that the IRS will not oppose this \nlegislation. In addition, the Department of the Treasury welcomes ``the \nopportunity to work with [Congress] to address this matter through \ncorrective legislation''. With a majority of the Senate cosponsoring \nthis bill, my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and all parts of \nthe country, I look forward to its timely consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S656-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S656-S665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

Madam President, I was very pleased that at the end of \nthe last Congress, we finally did the right thing by education. We \nincreased funding for education. It was a bipartisan effort. We got \ngood support in the waning days of that Congress for improvements in \neducation.\n  This time I believe we should not wait until the end of the Congress. \nI believe that education needs to be a top priority of this Congress \nbeginning now and continuing on through the rest of the first session \nand, of course, the second session as well.\n  For this reason, I think it is timely that Education Week, which is \nperhaps the preeminent weekly publication dealing with education issues \nat the national level, issued its report card on the condition of \npublic education in the 50 States just as this new Congress is \nbeginning.\n  The report is entitled ``Quality Counts.'' It is a very \ncomprehensive, thorough look at the issue, and it goes through great \ndetail in trying to assess how each State is doing in providing \neducation to its young people.\n  I recommend this report to all of my colleagues and anybody who is \nwatching. I think it does a good job. It focuses where we need to be \nfocused. I think it needs to be taken very seriously by this Congress.\n  In the area of quality of teaching, which I am sure we would all \nagree is essential to a strong education, this report finds that 40 \npercent of high school teachers lack a college degree in the subject \narea that they are teaching in. There are too many unlicensed teachers \nbeing used in our classrooms today. Ongoing training is still not a \nreality in most of our States. So the national grade that we received \nfor quality of teaching was a C, which I think all of us who have been \nthrough the educational system know is not a stellar performance.\n  A second finding is about ``school climate.'' Here the findings were \nthat nearly half of elementary teachers have classes of 25 or more \nstudents. More than half of high school teachers see in excess of 80 \nstudents per day. Almost 70 percent of students attend high schools of \n900 or more.\n  The reason that this last statistic is important is that we have \nseveral studies now that conclude that the quality of education and the \nquality of student performance goes down as the size of the school \nincreases. When you get a high school of more than 900 students the \nquality and level of student achievement goes down. So it is \nunfortunate that a majority of our students are in schools which our \nown experts tell us are too large. That is something we need to focus \non nationally, and we got a C-minus on school climate because of those \nfacts I just cited.\n  Third, on ``overall spending,'' the States received a C-plus. The \nreport found that most of the increases in spending have gone toward \nrising enrollment and special education and salaries for an aging work \nforce. And we are not putting the resources into education that we \nshould be, considering the growth in the school population.\n  Fourth, on ``equity of funding'', which means the disparities between \nthe rich school districts and the poor school districts, the States got \na B-minus. This is a little better than we have done in some of the \nother areas, but the report finds that the quality of the child's \neducation still depends too greatly on skin color, on family income, \nand on which school district they happen to reside in.\n  The fifth indicator is the effective ``allocation of funds.'' \nAccording to the report, classrooms still receive only 61 percent of \ntotal resources that go into our educational system. Too many of those \nresources get stopped at the administrative level. On average, there \nare still over 35 students for each multimedia computer in our school \nsystem. Thirty-three percent of districts have at least one serious \nschool construction need. So in that area of allocation of funds, the \nStates received a C-minus.\n  The sixth area is ``standards and assessments.'' There the States got \na B because the conclusion was that this is the area perhaps where we \nare making the most progress. However, in most States standards have \nnot yet found their way into the classrooms. Even if tests were \ndeveloped, we do not yet know how rigorous they are, and few States are \nready to hold either the schools or the students sufficiently \naccountable.\n  The final indicator is ``student achievement,'' which of course is \nthe bottom line, the ultimate goal of our educational system. They did \nnot give a grade there. They said that in student achievement our \n``results were disappointing.'' That was the phrase which was used. The \nreport finds that only 28 percent of fourth graders nationwide ranked \nas being proficient in reading, which is not an adequate level of \nperformance. Even the highest scoring States in the Nation have fewer \nthan half of their elementary students scoring proficient in reading \nand in math.\n  Madam President, let me put this in some perspective. Many of us who \ntry to follow education-related issues know that we have a national \ntest that is given around the country periodically called the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP for short. This is a chart \nthat shows trends in NAEP reading scores from 1971 through 1994. You \ndon't need to look at this chart long before you notice that all of \nthese lines are not going up. These lines are flat. That means that we \nessentially are seeing no significant improvement in reading scores by \nstudents in this period from 1971 to 1994. Madam President, we are \nstuck on mediocre, or perhaps stuck on even worse than that. I think \nthis is a cause for concern.\n  When I look at my own State and read this report there are three \nareas in which New Mexico performs above the national average. We get \nan A for standards, compared to the B that most States get. We get a B \nfor overall educational spending, versus the C that is given nationally \nby this report. And we get a B-minus for classroom resources, versus a \nC-minus nationally.\n  There are three other areas, however, in which my State of New Mexico \nperforms worse than the national average. First, the State's test \nscores still are near the bottom in this National Assessment of \nEducational Progress test in almost all areas. Only 21 percent of the \nfourth graders in my State were judged to be at the proficient level in \nreading, and only 11 percent were judged proficient in math. Also we \nreceived a C-minus for teaching quality, compared to a C nationally. \nAnd we received a D-plus for school climate compared to a C-minus \nnationally.\n  S. 12, the Democratic leadership education bill, does address several \nof the key issues that are raised by this report. I think they are very \nimportant issues. Let me very briefly summarize what this bill is \ntrying to do.\n  To address the low literacy rates that I described, S. 12 creates a \nprogram to increase the efforts of over 1 million teachers, parents, \nand volunteers in literacy training.\n  To lower financial barriers to college, including tuition that rose \nover 100 percent over the last 10 years, S. 12 proposes a $1,500 tax \ncredit and a $10,000 deduction for students with a B average.\n  To help schools build and repair seriously deteriorating facilities, \nwhich 33 percent of all school districts report having, S. 12, provides \n$5.75 billion in bond interest subsidies.\n  And finally, to help schools address the fact that over 70 percent of \nthe computer equipment available is outdated and cannot provide \nadequate instruction and there are roughly 35 students for every modern \ncomputer, S. 12 calls for $1.8 billion in funding for the 1994 \nTechnology for Education Act, which was funded at the level of $200 \nmillion in the current fiscal year.\n  In conclusion, let me say that this report needs to be looked at by a \ngreat many people here in the Congress and elsewhere. It clearly \nreinforces other findings and reports that have raised these same \nissues in recent months.\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\n  Second, it is clear that nothing has changed since the end of the \nlast Congress, when we finally gave education the attention it deserved \nand began to really do what should be done at the national level to \nsupport education. We need to keep that up, and maintain that momentum \nin this new Congress. I do believe we can renew our efforts to improve \neducation, renew our efforts to put resources where the people of this \ncountry want them, and that is in the education of their children. \nThere should be no letdown in the efforts of Congress in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the additional opportunities in the \ncoming weeks to focus on some of these issues, and I hope we can pursue \nthis set of issues on a bipartisan basis and make real progress for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, last summer the U.S. Court of Appeals \nissued a ruling that confirmed something that many of us already \nunderstood. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide a safe, \ncentralized storage place for our Nation's spent fuel and nuclear \nwaste, beginning less than 1 year from today.\n  This is a commitment that Congress and the Department of Energy made \n15 years ago. We have collected $12 billion from the American \nratepayers for this purpose. But, after spending some $6 billion, the \nFederal Government is still not prepared to deliver on its promise to \ntake and safely dispose of our Nation's nuclear waste by 1998. \nHardworking Americans have paid for this as part of their monthly \nelectric bill. They simply have not gotten any results.\n  So a lawsuit was filed and the court confirmed that there is, indeed, \na legal obligation as well as a moral one. We have reached a \ncrossroads. The job of fixing this program and this injustice is ours. \nThe time for fixing the program is now.\n  Today in this country, high-level nuclear waste and highly \nradioactive used nuclear fuel is accumulating at over 80 sites in 41 \nStates, including waste stored at the Department of Energy's weapon \nfacilities. It is stored in populated areas near our neighbors, near \nour neighborhoods, near our schools, on the shores of our lakes and \nrivers, in the backyards of constituents young and old across this \nland. Used nuclear fuel is being stored near the east and west coasts \nwhere most Americans live, maybe in your town and near your \nneighborhood. Used fuel is being stored in pools that were not \ndesignated for long-term storage.\n  Some of this fuel is already over 30 years old. Each year that goes \nby, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at each of these \nsites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. It is irresponsible to \nlet this situation continue. It is unsafe to let this dangerous \nradioactive material continue to accumulate in more than 80 sites all \nacross the country, in 41 States. It is unwise to block the safe \nstorage of this used fuel in a remote area away from high populations. \nIt is a national problem that requires a coordinated national solution.\n  Yesterday, on behalf of myself and 19 other cosponsors, I introduced \nthe exact text of S. 1936 from the 104th Congress as S. 104, the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This legislation was passed by the \nSenate last summer by a vote of 63 to 37. It sets forth a program that \nwill allow the Department of Energy to meet its obligations as soon as \nhumanly possible.\n  S. 104 provides for an integrated system to manage used fuel for \ncommercial nuclear powerplants and high-level radioactive waste from \nthe Department of Energy's nuclear weapons facilities. The integrated \nsystem includes construction and operation of a temporary storage \ncenter, a safe transportation network to transfer these byproducts, and \ncontinuing scientific studies at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine \nif it is a suitable repository site. During the floor consideration of \nthe bill last year, we received many constructive suggestions for \nimproving that bill. The final version passed by the Senate \nincorporated most of these changes.\n  The most important provisions of the bill include: First, the role of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. The bill provides that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency shall issue standards for the \nprotection of the public from releases of radioactive materials from a \npermanent nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nis required to base its licensing determination on whether the \nrepository can be operated in accordance with the Environmental \nProtection Agency's radiation protection standards.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA--the bill complies \nfully with NEPA by requiring two full environmental impact statements, \none in advance of operation of the temporary storage facility and one \nin advance of repository licensing by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. The bill provides that, where Congress has statutorily \ndetermined need, location, and size of the facilities, these issues \nneed not be reconsidered. There is simply no rationale for requiring \nthat.\n\n  Another concern is transportation routing. The bill provides that, in \norder to ensure that spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste is \ntransported safely, the Secretary of Energy will use transportation \nroutes that minimize, to the maximum practical extent, transportation \nthrough populated and sensitive environmental areas. The language also \nrequires that the Secretary develop, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Transportation, a comprehensive management plan that ensures the \nsafe transportation of these materials.\n  Under transportation requirements, the bill contains language \nclarifying transportation of spent fuel under this act shall be \ngoverned by the requirements imposed by all Federal, State and local \ngovernments and Indian tribes, to the same extent as any other person \ntransporting hazardous materials in interstate commerce.\n  With regard to the interim storage facility, in order to ensure that \nthe size and scope of the interim storage facility is manageable, yet \nadequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel storage needs, \nthe bill would limit the size of phase I of the interim storage \nfacility to 15,000 metric tons of spent fuel and the size of phase II \nof the facility to 40,000 metric tons. Phase II of the facility would \nbe expanded to 60,000 metric tons if the Secretary fails to meet his \nprojected goal with regard to the licensing of the permanent depository \nsite.\n  With respect to the preemption of other laws, a provision of the bill \nwould provide that if any law does not conflict with the provisions of \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act and the Atomic Energy Act, that law will \ngovern. Further State and local laws are preempted only if those laws \nare inconsistent with or duplicative of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or \nthe Atomic Energy Act. The language is consistent with the preemption \nauthority found in the existing Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n  Finally, the bill contains bipartisan language that was drafted to \naddress this administration's objections to the\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nsiting of an interim facility at the Nevada test site before the \nviability assessment of the Yucca Mountain permanent repository site \nwas available. The language provides construction shall not begin on an \ninterim storage facility at Yucca Mountain before December 31, 1998. \nThe bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability of \nthe Yucca Mountain site to the President and Congress, by the \nSecretary, 6 months before construction can begin on the interim \nfacility.\n  If, based on the information before him, the President should \ndetermine in his discretion that the Yucca Mountain site is not \nsuitable for development as a repository, then the Secretary shall \ncease work on both the interim and permanent repository programs at the \nYucca Mountain site. The bill further provides if the President makes \nsuch a determination, he shall in 18 months designate an interim \nstorage site. If the President should fail to designate a site or if a \nsite he has designated has not been approved by the Congress within 2 \nyears of his determination, the Secretary is instructed to construct an \ninterim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain site.\n  This ensures the construction of an interim storage facility will not \noccur before the President and Congress have had ample opportunity to \nreview the technical assessments of the suitability of the Yucca \nMountain site for a permanent repository and to designate an alternate \nsite for interim storage. However, this provision will also ensure that \nultimately an interim storage facility site will be chosen.\n  Without this assurance, Mr. President, we leave open the possibility \nthat we will find in 1998, just a year away, that we have, one, no \ninterim storage; two, no permanent repository program; and three, after \nmore than 15 years and the expenditure of $6 billion, we are back right \nwhere we started in 1982 when we passed the first version of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  During the debate that will unfold, we will undoubtedly have our \nfriends from Nevada oppose the bill with all the arguments they can \nmuster. That is understandable. They are merely doing what Nevadans \nhave requested them to do.\n  But the difficulty we have with this issue, Mr. President, is nobody \nwants nuclear waste stored in their State. But you can't make it \ndisappear. It has to be stored somewhere. What better site than the \nNevada test site, the area in the Nevada desert where we tested nuclear \ndevices for nearly 50 years.\n  Has any better site been identified by the scientists who have \nsearched throughout the United States and even areas outside the United \nStates? The answer is that there has not been any better site \nsuggested.\n  So I implore those who criticize how we propose to dispose of this \nobligation to consider that they, too, have an obligation to come up \nwith an alternative. The reality is, there have been a number of years \nto come up with those alternatives. Nobody has come up with one. In the \nmeantime, an industry that generates nearly 22 percent of the total \nenergy produced in this country is finding its storage sites filled to \nthe maximum. The industry ability to store spent fuel at the reactor \nsites is limited by the legal requirements of the individual States, \nand some of the antinuclear groups see this as a way to terminate the \nnuclear industry, as we know it in the United States today.\n  In my opinion, those who have this objective are irresponsible, \nbecause they fail to tell us how we are going to generate the power \nthat is currently provided by the nuclear industry in this country. Are \nwe going to have more power generated by burning coal? Is it going to \nbe more oil production? Is it going to be more hydroelectric \nproduction?\n  There is a give-and-take associated with this, and as we address the \nissues of global warming and greenhouse gases, it must be recognized \nthat the nuclear industry makes a positive contribution to energy \ngeneration in this country, as those concerns are not matters of \nsignificance relative to nuclear power generation.\n  Again, the reality is nobody wants nuclear waste in their State, but \nit has to go somewhere. I have the utmost respect for my colleagues, my \nfriends from Nevada. We have talked about this issue at length, and we \nhave a simple difference of opinion. But, again, although they \ncriticize storing it in their State, at the area where we have tested \nnuclear weapons for some 50 years, they really don't have a viable \nalternative either.\n  Some suggest we simply leave it where it is. Leave it at the sites in \nthe 41 States. Well, we can't do that, Mr. President.\n  There is other technology being developed by the French and Japanese \nthat reprocesses nuclear waste, recovers the plutonium, and reinjects \nit into the reactors, and reduces the proliferation threat. That is not \na policy that is supported by this administration. Nor is it a policy \nthat is supported by the Department of Energy although someday, I am \nafraid, we are going to have to look at that as a relief if we are \nunable to open a geologic repository for the spent fuel.\n  But in the meantime, this material is piling up at various sites \naround the United States, and a temporary central repository that \nstores spent fuel on the surface, in special casks that are approved by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is the appropriate action to be \ntaken at this time.\n\n  As U.S. Senators, we have an obligation to take a nationwide \nperspective on a problem. We must do what is best for the country as a \nwhole, and this is certainly a case in point.\n  No one can continue to pretend that there is an unlimited amount of \ntime to deal with this problem. The Federal Government has entered into \na contract with the ratepayers. They collected the funds. Now they must \nact and must act to ensure there is a safe, secure and responsible \nplace to put the radioactive waste, and it is an obligation that we \nhave committed to fulfill.\n  The court did not address the issue of remedies. The court was very \nclear that the Department of Energy has an obligation to take spent \nnuclear fuel in 1998, whether a repository is ready or not. The reality \nis a repository cannot be ready by that date. So I assume there are \ngoing to be a series of lawsuits filed against the Federal Government. \nThat is another full employment act for the lawyers, Mr. President.\n  But so far, the Department of Energy's only response to the court \ndecision has been to send out a letter asking for suggestions on how it \ncan meet its obligation to take spent fuel in 1998. It is clear that we \nall agree on the question. Now is the time for answers.\n  We have a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have one remote, \nsafe and secure temporary nuclear waste storage facility, or through \ninaction, through delay, we can face an uncertain judicial remedy which \nwill almost certainly be costly, and which is unlikely to actually move \nwaste out of America's backyards.\n  It is not morally right to shirk our responsibility to the \nenvironment and the future of our children and grandchildren. This is a \nsituation we have created, and it is an obligation we must fulfill. We \ncannot wait until 1998 to decide where the Department of Energy will \nstore this nuclear waste.\n  We have received letters from 23 Governors and attorneys general, \nincluding Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nIowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin, \nspecifically urging this Congress to pass, and the President to sign, a \nbill that will provide for interim storage at the Nevada test site.\n  Congress must speak now and provide the means to build one safe \nmonitored, temporary storage facility at the Nevada test site, a unique \nsite so remote that the Government has used it to explode nuclear \nweapons for over 50 years, or, if that is not sufficient, another site \ndesignated by the President and Congress.\n  The jury is in on this issue. The time is now. The Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1997 is the answer, and I urge my colleagues to join with \nme in cosponsoring this legislation and support the passage of S. 104 \nin the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/22/senate-section/article/S667-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S669-S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\n\n\n        COMMENDING AND THANKING THE HONORABLE WARREN CHRISTOPHER\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n4, submitted earlier today by Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Dodd, Biden, \nMoseley-Braun and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) commending and \n     thanking the Honorable Warren Christopher for his exemplary \n     service as Secretary of State.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great American \non the occasion of his retirement from Government service, the Hon. \nWarren Christopher.\n  Anyone who has been reading the headlines for the past 4 years is \nwell familiar with Secretary Christopher's many accomplishments. \nThrough negotiations on ending the war in Bosnia, restoring elected \ngovernment in Haiti, and advancing the peace process in the Middle \nEast, Secretary Christopher has kept a steady, reliable hand on the \nship of state. His calm demeanor, good humor, and sharp intelligence \nwill be missed by all who knew him. America has benefitted from his \nable leadership, and it is my hope that he will continue to be active \nin the affairs of our Nation in his retirement.\n  Less widely known than Secretary Christopher's negotiating acumen is \nthe fact that he hails from my home State, the Great State of North \nDakota. Born in Scranton, Secretary Christopher has made proud a State \nwhich prides itself on hard work, quiet strength, and doing the right \nthing. Secretary Christopher is one of my State's most distinguished \nnatives sons, and will always have a home in North Dakota.\n  In light of his many important achievements, today I am introducing a \nresolution which commends and thanks Secretary Christopher for his \nexcellent service to the Nation. The resolution highlights his \n``indefatigable commitment to advancing peace and justice, protecting \nand promoting United States interests, and preserving United States \nleadership in international affairs.'' I trust that all of my \ncolleagues will agree that Secretary Christopher deserves to be so \nhonored, and will support my resolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today on the third day of the 105th \nCongress, we cast a historic ballot--on behalf of the first woman to be \nconfirmed as Secretary of State in our Nation's proud history.\n  But, as we prepare to usher in Madeleine Albright as America's new \nSecretary of State, I wanted to take this opportunity to voice my \nstrong support for the pending resolution that honors the man whose \nshoes she will soon be filling--Warren Christopher.\n  Over the past 4 years, Warren Christopher provided the steadying hand \nand reservoir of experience that helped President Clinton successfully \nweave his way through the minefield of international diplomacy.\n  Through these efforts, he earned a revered statute--as the elder \nstatesman of the President's Cabinet.\n  In the more than 200-year history of our Republic, no Secretary of \nState traveled more miles in the pursuit of democracy, open markets, \nand the promotion of American international interests than Warren \nChristopher. From Beijing to Buenos Aires, Johannesburg to Jakarta, and \nMali to Moscow, no journey was too far and no effort unworthy of his \npersonal diplomacy.\n  In the Middle East, his diplomatic endeavors paved the way for the \nfirst steps toward reconciliation and cooperation in the age-old \nconflict between Israelis and Palestinians.\n  Generations from now, Bosnians, Serbs, and Croats will look back with \nfondness and appreciation at his tireless efforts to bring the warring \nparties together at Dayton. In fact, at Dayton, after the bags were \npacked and the participants had all but given up, it was Warren \nChristopher who convinced all sides that a peaceful resolution was the \nonly true hope for the Balkans.\n  Under his watch, the Haitian people were able to finally cast off the \nevils of dictatorship for the fruits of democracy. The Korean Peninsula \ntook its first tentative steps toward limiting the development of \nnuclear weapons and curbing tensions in one of the cold war's last \nhotspots.\n  What's more, over the past 4 years--with the strong support of Warren \nChristopher and the Clinton administration, democracy spread its wings \nacross every corner of the globe.\n  Today in Latin America every nation but one is a full-fledged \ndemocracy. In Russia, 70 years of totalitarian rule are giving way to \nfree elections and open markets. And in Africa, a region scarred for so \nlong by war, famine, and political instability, the seeds of democracy \nare beginning to take root.\n  However, for all the accomplishments that Warren Christopher achieved \noverseas, we must not forget the impact of his impressive contributions \nhere at home. Besides helping to make America more secure and \nprotecting our vital national interests, Warren Christopher presided \nover a period of great economic liberalization--a period that brought \ngreater prosperity and limitless economic opportunity to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Secretary Christopher built on the passage of NAFTA and GATT by \nworking to create a framework for regional-wide trading blocs in all of \nLatin America and the Pacific rim. The result is increased \nopportunities for export, and new developing markets for American \ncommerce.\n  But, most of all, Warren Christopher brought a quiet dignity, grace, \nand gentle demeanor to his role as Secretary of State.\n  At a time when public debate in our Nation is becoming coarser and \nmore partisan, when style seems to take precedent over substance and \nwhen shrill voices garner more attention than quiet deliberation, \nWarren Christopher proved that you can still speak softly, yet carry a \nbig stick.\n  A recent editorial in his hometown Los Angeles Times by Tom Plate \ndescribes the traits that define Warren Christopher best:\n\n       Extreme loyalty to friends and colleagues; a faith in the \n     institutions of government and the Constitution; respect for \n     careerists in the State Department as well as on his personal \n     staff; discretion approaching squareness.\n\n  These are the attributes that inspired him through four Democratic \nadministrations and years of public service. What's more, they are \nvirtues that every American should expect from their leaders.\n  As he prepares to return to his beloved California with his wife, \nMarie, to spend more time with his children and grandchildren, I join \nall my colleagues in wishing him the best.\n  What's more, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nresolution honoring a man who in all his travels--from the Great Plains \nof Scranton, ND, to the corridors of power in Foggy Bottom--never lost \nhis sense of dignity, grace, and conviction to principle.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
