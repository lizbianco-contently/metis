Mr. President, I had hoped to be in Wyoming, as a matter \nof fact, this weekend, but I had hoped--sincerely hoped--that we would \nbe working at solving the problems we have, and we do have some \nproblems.\n  But I do want to comment a little. On the way in, I heard the \nPresident speak this morning. Frankly, I was surprised that his tone \nwas that he had been offended, as a matter of fact. He indicated that \nthe Republicans had shut down the Government. I have to tell you, I do \nnot believe that is the case at all.\n  Although it does not matter who it is, the fact is he promised 25 \ndays ago to bring a budget to be balanced in 7 years based on CBO \nnumbers and has not done that, and that is the problem.\n  Mr. President, it is much more difficult to look into the future and \nseek to give the leadership that is necessary to mold the Government \ninto a form that will be useful for generations to come. It is much \neasier to defend the status quo. It seems to me that is the real issue.\n  The real issue is the growing Government, the growing debt, the \ngrowing \n\n[[Page S18776]]\ninterest, and the first opportunity that we have had in 25 years to \nchange that. Frankly, the President has been the obstacle of causing \nthat to happen, and I am sorry for that.\n  Mr. President, there is a great deal more to a balanced budget than \narithmetic, even though that is what is talked about, of course. But it \nseems to me it is the most important issue that we have had before this \ncountry in a very long time. Not only because of the arithmetic, not \nonly because we have a $5 trillion debt, not only because we pay $260 \nbillion a year in interests, and growing, and because it is the largest \nline item in the budget, that is not the only reason.\n  One of the reasons is responsibility. We are coming into a new \ncentury soon, and I think all of us have some responsibility to give \nsome thought to how we want to make the transfer of this Government and \nthis country to new generations with debt that will cost a newborn \n$187,000 during their lifetime on interest alone. Is that the kind of a \ncountry we want to bring forward, the kind of country where we have \nenjoyed the benefits of high spending but have not been willing to pay \nfor it, just put it on the credit card of somebody else? The credit \ncard is maxed out.\n  It also has to do with the concept and the size of the Federal \nGovernment, how intrusive and how large and how much spending is \ninvolved. I happen to be one of those who believe the Federal \nGovernment should be smaller, that we should, indeed, consider those \nthings that could be done better by the States, some that do not need \nto be done at all by Government, that should be done in the private \nsector.\n  I think we ought to spend a little more time with oversight, taking a \nlook at those programs, many of which have been in place for 30 years, \nthe Great Society programs, welfare particularly, and evaluate how \neffective it has been in terms of its purpose. We have more poverty \ntoday than we did when it began. Everyone wants to help people who need \nhelp and help them back into the workplace, and that has not been what \nhas happened.\n\n  So we ought to take a look at making some change, and there is great \nresistance to change, and the President is leading that resistance, I \nthink because he has to support the liberal wing of his party, but he \nis absolutely refusing to take a look at evaluating programs and see \nif, indeed, there are some ways we can do this job better.\n  So here we are. The administration has produced four budgets, none of \nwhich has balanced, and has produced a great deal of demagoguery. Even \nthe press, the national TV, the most notable one was ``Nightline'' that \nwas on Tuesday night, showed clips of where we were, one including the \nFirst Lady 2 years ago saying what we need to do is reduce the growth \nin Medicare to somewhere between 6 and 7 percent annually. We have to \ndo that. The Republican plan is more than 7 percent, and yet the White \nHouse says we are going to gut the program, do away with it.\n  The fact is, the trustees said if we do not do something, it will be \nbroke. We know that. Someone the other day, some 40-year-old said, \n``I'm very concerned about Medicare for my mother and Social \nSecurity.'' He better be worried about himself. His mother is OK in \nthat program, but you cannot continue the program as it is.\n  So we have a great deal of demagoguery going on. I happened to serve \nin the House with Leon Panetta. He was chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and he came in 4 years ago saying you have to do these \nthings, you have to slow down this entitlement growth. He was the one \nwho was saying that. Now he says the Republicans are uncaring, have no \ncompassion for wanting to do the same thing. Give me a break.\n  If we are going to have a country where we can come together with \npublic policy, where we can make some decisions based on facts--there \nhave to be some facts--I certainly understand and encourage differences \nin philosophy and I have a considerable amount of difference in \nphilosophy with some of my friends on the other side.\n  Bernie Sanders and I are good friends. Bernie Sanders is from \nVermont. He is an Independent, but he is a Socialist. That is his \npolitical philosophy. We did not agree on anything, and I understand \nthat, because his idea is the more government you have, the better it \nis; the more money you can take out of the private sector and spend \npublicly the better. I do not agree with that. And the majority in this \nCongress does not agree with that, but it is a philosophy, and that is \nOK. But you ought to balance that philosophy when we make decisions \nwith facts--facts.\n\n  The President said that we are shutting down because the Republicans \nwould not negotiate. The fact is that the Republicans now have had \nabout three different programs that do balance the budget. Their \nproposal yesterday would have added to Medicare, to Medicaid, to the \nearned income tax credit for the working poor, 75 billion dollars' \nworth, and $25 billion more in Medicare. That was the proposal at this \ntime. Republicans came to that so there would be legitimate bargaining.\n  This comes from the Washington Post--it is not Republican propaganda, \nI do not think. They featured a number of novel ways to balance the \nbudget. They are talking about the administration yesterday, who came \nto negotiate. I quote from the paper:\n\n       The White House proposal featured a number of novel ways to \n     balance spending and some traditional ones, such as selling \n     Government assets. This major new savings of $54 billion, \n     however, comes from the use of the more optimistic economic \n     assumptions of OMB.\n\n  The President signed the law 25 days ago to say these negotiations, \nthis balanced budget, will be on CBO numbers, Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers. I can imagine how tired people are of hearing CBO, OMB, \nand all that. The fact is, though, that as the President said in his \nState of the Union Message 2 years ago, we all need to use the same \nnumbers. He chose CBO. He now refuses to use them because they can cook \nthe books with the numbers they use at the White House. It is pretty \nsimple to balance the budget if you have your own projections of what \ngrowth is going to be, that there will be no turndown in the economy. \nOf course. Then, furthermore, they said if that does not work, we will \nget more revenue by reducing the tax reduction.\n  There are lots of ways to balance the budget, and that, of course, is \nwhat some of my friends on the other side say. But they say, ``We want \nto do it the right way.'' And they think the right way is to raise \ntaxes so you can continue to spend, and that is the way you do it.\n  So, Mr. President, we are engaged in a difficult thing here, a \ndifficult negotiation. I do not think anyone is happy about the \nGovernment coming to the brink of another furlough. No one wants to do \nthat. But I can tell you that people are pretty dedicated on this side \nof the aisle to the fundamental proposition of balancing the budget and \nmaking some changes for the first time in 25 years--changes that will \naffect all of us for a very long time.\n  So there are some issues--and debt is one--that we continue to go on. \nIt was $5 trillion and it is higher now. Even under this balanced \nbudget in 7 years, that debt will go up $2 trillion more in 7 years. \nYou all are going to pay for that. All of us. The younger you are, the \nmore you are going to pay. That is too bad.\n  Responsibility? We are responsible to do better than that, all of us. \nWhether you are here or in Cody, WY, whether you are a cowboy, a \nrailroader, we are responsible citizens, and a democracy goes with the \nfreedom of responsibility. One of those responsibilities is that, if we \nwant things collectively, you have to pay for them. This idea that \nsomehow we sure enjoy the programs, but we do not want to pay for them \ndoes not work.\n  Change. We are responsible to bring about change. It is easier to \nstick with the status quo and to use Lyndon Johnson's pen and veto the \nbill and say, by golly, we are going to stay with the old Great \nSociety. It does not work, but we are going to stay right there.\n  The other is all talk and no action. The White House has the bully \npulpit and cannot do it. The real issue, of course, is an honest \nbalancing of the budget, so we reduce spending from the level it is--\nand it will still continue to go up at more than 3 percent--but to be \nable to pay for what we say, and do it by real numbers. Some of the \nfolks say, ``You guys are in a adolescent food fight back there.'' I am \nsure it looks more petty than pretty, but the fact is \n\n[[Page S18777]]\nthat it is a real debate, a real culmination of a year's work, now to \ndecide whether we are successful in balancing the budget or whether we \ngo on as we have in the past, and that we do it in 7 years. Everyone in \nthis place, since I have been here this year, the first thing they do \nis stand up and say, ``I am for balancing the budget,'' and they go on \nto find 100 reasons why they cannot do it. But they want to do it in \nthe right way and that is to raise revenues so we can keep spending at \nthis level.\n  So, Mr. President, there are lots of problems here, but I think we \nneed to really come to the snubbing post and say to ourselves we are \nwilling to make changes and bring the changes forward that are based on \nreal numbers and then vote. If you do not want to balance the budget, \nfine, say so. But let us get some figures out here that legitimately \nsay this will balance. Let us not have smoke and mirrors and say we \nhave balanced it, but gosh, we have just done it with projections. They \ndo not have to do that. We have a set of numbers. They may not be \nright. No one knows whether they will be right. But they are the same \nnumbers and we are dealing from the same deck. That is what we need to \ndo.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly, as I know many, many do. I \nam offended, frankly, by the opponents of balancing the budget saying \nwe just do not have any compassion. We are going to throw kids out in \nthe street or not have schools or not have Medicare. That is poppycock. \nThat is not true. I am offended at the idea that somehow they have more \ncompassion than I do. I do not believe the Federal Government has any \nmore compassion than my State of Wyoming. We are as concerned about our \nkids as anyone. In fact, we are more concerned about our kids than they \nare about our kids, of course. So that is not the issue.\n  If we want to really talk about compassion, we ought to talk about \nwhat is going to happen in 15 years when you do not have any money \nexcept for a handful of entitlements--and that is where we are. \nEverybody knows that. We do not have the leadership or the gumption to \ncome up to it to make the decision.\n  Mr. President, I hope that happens, and I hope that we will give our \ncountry a strong future by saying we are willing to make the tough \ndecisions and balance the budget and to look out for the future, and we \nare willing to pass on a country that will be better than the one we \nhave been involved in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate your giving me an \nopportunity to step aside from presiding to make a comment or two about \nthe dilemma that we find ourselves in today.\n  The first point I want to make is that, from my perspective, we are \ndealing with a lineage of broken promises here.\n  I have been somewhat dismayed by the confusion in the public about \nwhat is going on, but I guess it is understandable, given the size of \nthe megaphone the President of the United States has. I will just run \nthrough several events that occurred over the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  First, when the President was a candidate for the Presidency in 1992, \nhe said in his campaign that he would balance the budget in 5 years. He \nwould balance the budget in 5 years. We are now 3 years later and about \nto enter the next Presidential election cycle, and he has yet to submit \na balanced budget of any kind or of any form. ``I will balance the \nbudget in 5 years,'' and he is arguing with us about trying to balance \nit in 7 years. A very meaningful promise to the American people is in \nthe trash can.\n  Two years later, he came before the American people and the Congress. \nFirst he said, ``I will not submit a budget.'' Then he said, ``No, I am \ngoing to submit a balanced budget.'' So we waited and we received his \nbudget. It was unbalanced at a level of $200 billion per year as far as \nanybody could see. ``I am going to balance it in 5 years.'' He forgot \nthat. Then, ``I will submit a balanced budget,'' and he did and it was \nnot balanced. It was not even close. It was so off the mark that the \nSenate, on two separate occasions, rejected it in a humiliating way--99 \nto 0, every Republican, every Democrat. On the second attempt, I think \nthe vote was 96 to 3, something like that. Total rejection.\n  Then we passed for the first time, this Senate and the House, for the \nfirst time in almost 30 years, a balanced budget act and sent it to the \nPresident. We said we were going to do that, and we did it. It went to \nthe President, and he vetoed it, killed it, which led to the current \nmoment of negotiations between the Congress and the President.\n  Just before Thanksgiving he and his negotiators, the President and \nhis negotiators, agreed late one evening with the leaders of the \nCongress and ultimately voted on by the Congress that he and we would \nproduce a balanced budget in 7 years and we would use the same set of \nnumbers. That is real important. We say CBO, and that means \nCongressional Budget Office. That is the entity that the President said \nis the best authority in his State of the Union Address. A month later, \nthe President had offered nothing.\n  Then, finally, at the beginning of this week he gave us the outline \nof a budget that was immediately declared out of balance by upward of \n$400 billion. It was ridiculed in the press and by everybody who saw \nit, so he said, ``Well, I'm going to really give you a balanced budget \nFriday at 10 o'clock.'' I have to tell you, Mr. President, I never \nbelieved they were going to do it, which is the second point I am going \nto make in a minute. Sure enough, midday Friday, his negotiators came \nto the Budget Committee with two sheets of paper. This was their good-\nfaith attempt, two sheets of paper, and no budget, just a handful of \nnumbers on it--it could have been done in 20 minutes--and we are \ndealing with the budget of the United States of America. They could \nhave done this in 20 minutes, and it was $75 billion out of balance. He \nhad no intention of submitting the balanced budget.\n  They had already purchased television ads Thursday to say that the \nRepublicans shut the Government down. This is scripted. This is raw \npolitics. The problem is, you are dealing with real lives and a real \ndemocracy. There are 20,000 troops headed to Europe in the Balkans. \nThey never intended to submit a balanced budget. This is why they \nwaited until the very end. They knew exactly what we would say. We \nwould say this is not what we promised America. We both promised a \nbalanced budget using CBO, Congressional Budget Office, numbers and you \ncome in at the last minute, you spend the whole month producing \nnothing, and you come in at the last hour with nothing so that you \ncould stand up and say, ``Those radical Republicans, hard-hearted, \nshutting the Government down,'' meanwhile they were buying television \nads even before the last meeting to run across the country saying, \n``Republicans shut the Government down.'' Pretty offensive politics.\n\n  This is a classic struggle between a people and their \nrepresentatives, trying to bring the financial affairs of our country \nunder control. Eighty to ninety percent of the American people want a \nbalanced budget, and they want it right now. They are tired of things \nas they have been. There is only one person standing between America \nand a balanced budget--his name is William Jefferson Clinton. He \nhappens to be President of the United States. He singlehandedly \ndefeated the balanced budget amendment by getting his leadership to \nchange their votes. He has yet to offer the Congress or the American \npeople a balanced budget.\n  We all understand that his view of how to get a balanced budget may \nbe different than ours. We welcome him to put his plan on the table, \nand then we can get down and work together, according him some of his \nwishes and according us some of ours, all of us fulfilling the demand \nof the American people, who said, ``Balance your budgets. We have to. \nOur businesses have to. You have ignored it, and you have made the \ncountry hurt because of it.''\n  This is not the typical political exercise, Mr. President. I want to \nremind our colleagues that a commission, chaired by Members of the \nSenate, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Danforth, former Senator \nfrom Missouri, \n\n[[Page S18778]]\nan entitlement commission, has produced its work early in the year, and \nit says in that report that within the decade the United States will \nexhaust all of its resources. Every dime of this huge country will be \nconsumed by just five things: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nFederal retirement, and the interest on our debt, and there is nothing \nleft.\n  What would we do if there is a Balkans war then? How would we build \nour roads? Defend ourselves? Nothing left, after these five \nexpenditures. This balanced budget, that America knows in its heart we \nhave to have, corrects that problem. It does not allow the Nation to \nrun into that wall.\n  Some people, I think, who have listened to the debate, think that \nbalancing our budget is a very painful exercise. Not only does \nbalancing our budgets immediately begin to set the right path for our \nchildren and grandchildren and for the new century, but every living \nAmerican begins to benefit immediately. The rainbow that comes from \nbalancing these budgets happens right now. Interest rates fall, so the \naverage family saves $1,000 a year paying their home mortgage. They \nsave on their car loan. They save on their student loans. They save if \nthey build an addition to the house.\n  The tax reductions benefit all families raising children. The average \nAmerican family, if this balanced budget that we propose becomes law, \nfinds 2,000 to 3,000 new dollars in their checking account to help that \nfamily raise, educate, feed, house, and provide for the health of their \nfamily. That is what happens. And it does not happen way off in the \nfuture. It happens tomorrow. We are already benefiting. Just the \ndiscussion of balancing the budget for the first time in 30 years has \naffected our economy positively. But there is more to come.\n  It is beyond me how anybody, the President or any of his colleagues, \nwould deny all America the benefits of managing our financial affairs. \nI do not understand it. It is a punishing blow to American families \nbecause it will push their interest rates up. It will slow the economy. \nWhen you do not balance your budget it is tougher to find a job. It is \nharder to start a business. They cannot get the capital that is being \nconsumed by a voracious Federal Government that will not pay attention \nto its own financial affairs.\n  So, just to repeat, and I will yield: A promise to the American \npeople by the President that we can balance the budget in 5 years--he \ntotally ignored it. A promise to the American people that he would \nsubmit a balanced budget earlier this year--he ignored it and submitted \none with deficits as far as the eye can see. And then a binding, \nintense promise made between the President and the Congress, to the \nAmerican people, just before Thanksgiving, that we would both produce \nbalanced budgets and we would both use honest numbers to do it--and he \nwalked in the last hour, having done nothing since that promise was \nmade and gave us two sheets of paper.\n  There was more time being spent producing the political ads than \nproducing the balanced budget and that is a sad state of affairs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But it is also a very good way of silencing one's voice, \nbecause when you are in the chair you are forbidden to speak or react \nor do anything other than to declare whether a quorum is or is not \npresent, or inform errant Senators that they should please take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom--not the most edifying kinds of things \nto be able to say.\n  So I take the opportunity that today's circumstance gives me to offer \na few more words in the ongoing debate about the balanced budget, in \nresponse to some of the things that were said last night.\n  I want to focus a little bit on the issue of the tax cuts. We were \ntold last night that the most disgraceful part of the Republican \nattempt to balance the budget was that in our Balanced Budget Act we \ncalled for tax cuts. Disgraceful, we were told, when the public needs \nthe money that you are going to cut in taxes.\n  Behind that statement lies one of the great misconceptions of this \nbody, and frankly this Government and the various groups that advise \nthis Government. It gives me an opportunity to get on one of my soap \nboxes that I have been on before. But I warn the Senate there is no \nsuch thing as repetition. You can give the same speech again and again \nand again and it is always treated as if it were new and, indeed, maybe \nthe repetition is necessary. So I will launch, once again, into an \nattempt to set the record clear about tax cuts and the way they are \nviewed in Government.\n  We make the mistake in this Chamber and elsewhere of assuming that \nthe Government's business is like a family income, where mother and dad \nsit around the kitchen table adding up the bills at the end of the \nmonth, scratch their heads, with very nervous looks on their faces, and \nsay, ``We cannot make it. We must do one of two things. We must either \nincrease our income by dad's getting a raise or mother working more \nhours at her part-time job, or somehow getting an inheritance from a \nrich uncle, or we must cut down our expenditures.''\n\n  It is a two-dimensional problem. We must either increase revenues, or \nwe must decrease expenses. That is all there is to it. And we are told \naround here that the Government has only two choices to balance the \nbudget. We must either raise taxes or cut expenditures. And the analogy \nsounds wonderful, and it is easy to understand. Every one who sat \naround the kitchen table worrying about the bills identified the limit. \nThere is only one problem though. It is not reality. It does not \nconform to the way the world really works.\n  If I may switch the analogy, Mr. President, the Government is not \nlike a family. The Government is like a business. And I have run some \nbusinesses. I have run some of them successfully, and I have run some \nof them unsuccessfully. Indeed, the lessons I learned from the business \nwhich failed under my hand were probably responsible for my ability to \nmake some businesses succeed under my hand.\n  The business is not a two-dimensional circumstance. It is three. \nThere are three things you can do if your business is not making enough \nmoney to cover its monthly bills.\n  First, yes. You can cut spending. You can cut your overhead. That \ncorresponds with the family sitting around the table. You can say we do \nnot need as many people as we have here. We do not need as fancy \nsurroundings as we have rented. We can move into smaller quarters. You \ncan do all kinds of things to cut your overhead and cut your expenses.\n  Second, raise revenues. In business that is called raising prices. In \nGovernment it is called raising taxes. In business it is called raising \nprices, except every good businessman and businesswoman knows that \nraising prices is a very dicey way to try to increase your income \nbecause there are customers out there that may not like it. There are \ncustomers out there that may say, ``Oh. If you are going to raise the \nprice on your widgets, I am going to buy widgets from somebody else.''\n  I have increased the bottom line in businesses that I have run by \nraising prices. It is a wonderful way to do it. It is painless. If the \ncustomer will, indeed, pay the increased price. In business we have a \nphrase we call price sensitive. That is a fancy way for saying we do \nnot dare raise the price on this product because, if we do, nobody will \nbuy it. But, if you have a hot product, if you have something everybody \nwants, it is not particularly price sensitive and you can increase your \nincome 10 percent by raising your prices \n\n[[Page S18779]]\n10 percent. And that is clearly the easiest way to do it.\n  Sometimes, however, Mr. President, businessmen know that they can \nincrease their profits the third way, which is increase sales, cause \nthe business to grow bigger than it is. And increasing sales sometimes \ncomes from--wonder of wonders--increasing overhead. Oh, how can you do \nthat? Well, you can buy an ad for one. You can put something on \ntelevision telling people about your product. That is increasing your \noverhead but, if it increases your sales by significantly more than the \noverhead, it is the wise thing to do.\n  You can increase your overhead by hiring additional salesmen who will \ngo out and hawk your wares, and thereby cause the business to grow. Or, \nfor many businessmen, the answer is cutting prices. Cutting prices--not \nincreasing prices--many times is the road to success and profit.\n  Look for just a moment, if you will, Mr. President, at the fastest \ngrowing portion of the economy which is the computer driven portion. \nWhat has happened to prices of computers? I will give you a rather \ngraphic example.\n\n  When I was once president--or actually chairman of the board, a fancy \ntitle; the company did not have any money; so they gave me a big title \nrather than a big salary--of a company that produced computers. We had \ntwo that we offered for sale. One, it was a dual-floppy disk computer. \nWe sold it for $3,300. The other was a 10-megabyte hard disk computer \nwhich we sold for $30,000. We sold every one we could produce literally \nin a garage. Yes. This was one of those stories of a computer company \nthat started in somebody's garage. We produced them in a garage, and \nevery one we could produce we could sell immediately, there was enough \ndemand for it.\n  People would say, ``Gee. You are in the computer business. IBM \ndominates the computer business.'' With great foresight I said, ``IBM \ndoes not understand small computers. They only make mainframes. This is \na business that will be reserved to us alone.''\n  Today for under $2,000 you can buy a computer that has 40 megabytes \nof hard disk connected with it. A color monitor connected to it in a \nlaptop makes the thing we produce--it was about the size of a good \nwasher-dryer set with these 10 megabytes of hard disk, and it sold for \n$30,000, under everybody else. Now you can buy something that is so \nmuch better than that, and there is no comparison at all, for a \nfraction of the cost we used to charge.\n  If the people in the computer industry had been Government-oriented \nin their pricing, they would have said, ``Gee. Mr. Bennett, you are not \nmaking any money with that $30,000 computer. The solution is to raise \nyour prices'' when the folks at Apple down the street understood that \nthe solution was to cut the prices.\n  Well, what does this have to do with the debate we are having here? \nSimply this: That all of the figures we are throwing back and forth \naround this Chamber about cutting taxes $240 billion, raising taxes $28 \nbillion, and so on, are ignoring the fact that there are customers out \nthere who will react to the new prices on Government service by \nchanging their behavior just the way they are customers for products.\n  An interesting article appeared in the Wall Street Journal about a \nmonth ago. I am going to dig it out and put it in the Record. Marty \nFeldstein, a respected economist, went back and did something we never \ndo in Government. He analyzed the Clinton tax increase 3 years after it \nwas put in place to see what happened. He came up with the most \nastounding fact, Mr. President. The Clinton tax increase yielded in \nrevenue one-third of the amount of revenue that was projected at the \ntime it was passed.\n  We debated back and forth on this floor. And we were told again and \nagain that we must have this tax increase to cut the deficit, and it \nwill cut into the deficit x billion dollars. Now, 3 years later, the \ngood economist Dr. Feldstein, has looked at it, and said, ``Do you know \nwhat? You raised the taxes x amount, and you got one-third x in \nrevenue.''\n  We never look at that around here. We never pay any attention to \nthat. We are like the businessman who says, ``I will raise my prices, \nand my revenue will come in without any question,'' and then discovers \nthat the customers do not buy it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the the article in the \nWall Street Journal by Martin Feldstein be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Oct. 26, 1995]\n\n      Board of Contributors: What the '93 Tax Increases Really Did\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       President Clinton was right when he recently told business \n     groups in Virginia and Texas that he had raised taxes too \n     much in 1993, perhaps more so than he realizes. We now have \n     the first hard evidence on the effect of the Clinton tax rate \n     increases. The new data, published by the Internal Revenue \n     Service, show that the sharp jump in tax rates raised only \n     one-third as much revenue as the Clinton administration had \n     predicted.\n       Because taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal \n     tax rates by reducing their taxable incomes, the Treasury \n     lost two-thirds of the extra revenue that would have been \n     collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior. \n     Moreover, while the Treasury gained less than $6 billion in \n     additional personal income tax revenue, the distortions to \n     taxpayers' behavior depressed their real incomes by nearly \n     $25 billion.\n       To understand how taxpayer behavior could produce such a \n     large revenue shortfall, recall that the Clinton plan raised \n     the marginal personal income tax rate to 36% from 31% on \n     incomes between $140,000 ($115,000 for single taxpayers) and \n     $250,000 and to 39.6% on all incomes over $250,000. \n     Relatively small reductions in taxable income in response to \n     these sharply higher rates can eliminate most or all of the \n     additional tax revenue that would result with no behavioral \n     response.\n       If a couple with $200,000 of taxable income reduces its \n     income by just 5% in response to the higher tax rate, the \n     Treasury loses more from the $10,000 decline in income \n     ($3,100 less revenue at 31%) than it gains from the higher \n     tax rate on the remaining $50,000 of income above the \n     $140,000 floor ($2,500 more revenue at 5%); the net effect is \n     that the Treasury collects $600 less than it would have if \n     there had been no tax rate increase.\n       Similarly, a couple with $400,000 of taxable income would \n     pay $18,400 in extra taxes if its taxable income remained \n     unchanged. But if that couple responds to the nearly 30% \n     marginal tax rate increase by cutting its taxable income by \n     as little a 8%, the Treasury's revenue gain would fall 67% to \n     less than $6,000.\n       How can taxpayers reduce their taxable incomes in this way? \n     Self-employed taxpayers, two-earner couples and senior \n     executives can reduce their taxable earnings by a combination \n     of working fewer hours, taking more vacations, and shifting \n     compensation from taxable cash to untaxed fringe benefits. \n     Investors can shift from taxable bonds and high yield stocks \n     to tax exempt bonds and to stocks with lower dividends. \n     Individuals can increase tax deductible mortgage borrowing \n     and raise charitable contributions. (I ignore reduced \n     realization of capital gains because the 1993 tax rate \n     changes did not raise the top capital gains rate above its \n     previous 28% level.)\n       To evaluate the magnitude of the taxpayers' actual \n     responses, Daniel Feenberg at the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research (NBER) and I studied the published IRS estimates of \n     the 1992 and 1993 taxable incomes of high income taxpayers \n     (i.e., taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000, \n     corresponding to about $140,000 of taxable income). We \n     compared the growth of such incomes with the corresponding \n     rise in taxable incomes for taxpayers with adjusted gross \n     incomes between $50,000 and $200,000. Since the latter group \n     did not experience a 1993 tax rate change, the increase of \n     their taxable incomes provides a basis for predicting how \n     taxable incomes would have increased in the high income group \n     if its members had not changed their behavior in response to \n     the higher post-1992 tax rates. We calculated this with the \n     help of the NBER's TAXSIM model, a computer analysis of more \n     than 100,000 random anonymous tax returns provided by the \n     IRS.\n       We concluded that the high income taxpayers reported 8.5% \n     less taxable income in 1993 than they would have if their tax \n     rates had not increased. This in turn reduced the additional \n     tax liabilities of the high income group to less than one-\n     third of what they would have been if they had not changed \n     their behavior in response to the higher tax rates.\n       This sensitivity of taxable income to marginal tax rates is \n     quantitatively similar to the magnitude of the response that \n     I found when I studied taxpayers' responses to the tax rate \n     cuts of 1986. It is noteworthy also that such a strong \n     response to the 1993 tax increases occurred within the first \n     year. It would not be surprising if the taxpayer responses \n     get larger as taxpayers have more time to adjust to the \n     higher tax rates by retiring earlier, by choosing less \n     demanding and less remunerative occupations, by buying larger \n     homes and second homes with new mortgage deductions, etc.\n       The 1993 tax law also eliminated the $135,000 ceiling on \n     the wage and salary income subject to the 2.9% payroll tax \n     for Medicare. When this took effect in January 1994, it \n     raised the tax rate on earnings to 38.9% for taxpayers with \n     incomes between $140,000 and $250,000 and to 42.5% on incomes \n     above \n\n[[Page S18780]]\n     $250,000. Although we will have to wait until data are available for \n     1994 to see the effect of that extra tax rate rise, the \n     evidence for 1993 suggests that taxpayers' responses to the \n     higher marginal tax rates would cut personal income tax \n     revenue by so much that the net additional revenue from \n     eliminating the ceiling on the payroll tax base would be less \n     than $1 billion.\n       All of this stands in sharp contrast to the official \n     revenue estimates produced by the staffs of the Treasury and \n     of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation before the \n     1993 tax legislation was passed. The estimates were based on \n     the self-imposed ``convention'' of ignoring the effects of \n     tax rate changes on the amount that people work and invest. \n     The combination of that obviously false assumption and a \n     gross underestimate of the other ways in which taxpayer \n     behavior reduces taxable income caused the revenue estimators \n     at the Treasury to conclude that taxpayer behavior would \n     reduce the additional tax revenue raised by the higher rates \n     by only 7%. In contrast, the actual experience shows a \n     revenue reduction that is nearly 10 times as large as the \n     Treasury staff assumed.\n       This experience is directly relevant to the debate about \n     whether Congress should use ``dynamic'' revenue estimates \n     that take into account the effect of taxpayer behavior on tax \n     revenue. The 1993 experience shows that unless such behavior \n     is taken into account, the revenue estimates presented to \n     Congress can grossly overstate the revenue gains from higher \n     tax rates (and the revenue costs of lower tax rates). \n     Although the official revenue estimating staffs claim that \n     their estimates are dynamic because they take into account \n     some taxpayer behavior, the 1993 experience shows that as a \n     practical matter the official estimates are close to being \n     ``static'' no-behavioral-response estimates because they \n     explicitly ignore the effect of taxes on work effort and \n     grossly underestimate the magnitude of other taxpayer \n     responses.\n       If Congress had known in 1993 that raising top marginal tax \n     rates from 31% to more than 42% would raise less than $7 \n     billion a year, including the payroll tax revenue as well as \n     the personal income tax revenue, it might not have been \n     possible for President Clinton to get the votes to pass his \n     tax increase.\n       Which brings us back to President Clinton's own statement \n     (half-recanted the next day) that he raised taxes too much in \n     1993. Congress and the President will soon be negotiating \n     about the final shape of the 1995 tax package. The current \n     congressional tax proposals do nothing to repeal the very \n     harmful rate increases of 1993. Rolling back both the \n     personal tax rates and the Medicare payroll tax base to where \n     they were before 1993 would cost less than $7 billion a year \n     in revenue and would raise real national income by more than \n     $25 billion. Now that the evidence is in, Congress and the \n     President should agree to undo a bad mistake.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I suggest to you, Mr. President, that we need to pay \nclose attention to what happens when tax rates are cut. It is the same \nthing that happens to a well-run business when prices are selectively \nand intelligently cut on certain products. If we cut the tax rate on \ncapital gains, which is where most of the heat is coming from on the \nother side of the aisle, I am willing to bet a fairly substantial \namount of money that we will see Government revenue from capital gains \ngo up and not down.\n  Is not that what we are after? We want to balance the budget. We want \nmore revenue, do we not? We ought to do that which will bring in more \nrevenue. And the way to bring in more revenue is to cut prices on the \nproducts that are slow moving.\n  I tell you, Mr. President. Ever since we raised prices on capital \ngains by increasing the capital gains rate, the Government revenue from \ncapital gains has been going steadily down. And any decent business \nperson will tell you we made a mistake with that price increase.\n  We ought to cut the price back to where it was before, and people \nwill start buying our widgets again. We ought to cut the capital gains \ntax rate back down to where it was before. I will tell you the figure \nthat I will settle for, Mr. President. I will settle for the figure on \ncapital gains proposed by John F. Kennedy, President of the United \nStates. He wanted a capital gains rate lower than the one we are paying \ntoday and nobody accused him of trying to throw widows and orphans out \ninto the street, or little children being driven away from their school \nlunches when John Kennedy proposed a cut in the capital gains tax \nrate. His cut was passed. And what happened when they cut prices on \nthat particular governmental service? The revenue from capital gains \nwent up.\n\n  What is the objection? As nearly as I can tell, the only objection to \nthe Government getting more money from people who have capital gains is \nthat the people who have capital gains are supposedly the wealthy. I \nwill not argue with whether they are the wealthy or not. We can do that \nat another time. And there are plenty of charts to indicate that that \nis not the case.\n  The point I am making is this. If I am a businessman and I wish to \nincrease my bottom line, I really do not ask whether or not the \ncustomers who are benefited from my cutting prices are rich or poor. I \nreally do not care. All I want is enough money to keep my doors open. I \ndo not think the Government ought to really care whether the people who \nbenefit from a capital gains tax cut--in the rate--are rich or poor as \nlong as the Government gets more money.\n  I was not sent here by the voters of Utah to punish or reward. I was \nsent here to balance the budget, and one of the ways I balance the \nbudget is to get more revenue to the Government. And one of the ways I \nget more revenue to the Government is to cut the prices on capital \ngains transactions so that more people will do more of them and the \neconomy will grow and the Government will get more money.\n  So I say to those who are hung up about tax cuts and tax increases \nand who we are hurting and who we are helping, will you change your \nfocus just a minute and ask who you are here to represent and what your \nassignment is. Your assignment is to get the Government's fiscal \naffairs in order, and if that is done everybody benefits. And if in the \nprocess of getting more revenue into the coffers you happen to help \nsomebody who probably does not need help in terms of his own personal \nfinancial circumstances, do not let that bother you. Go ahead, take his \nmoney anyway. Go ahead, balance the budget anyway, even if somebody who \nis rich now happens to benefit by the fact that you are balancing the \nbudget and making life more secure for everybody else. Look the other \nway and take his money anyway. If we did that around here, I think we \nmove toward solving the problem.\n  I thank the Chair for his patience. I realize this is not the most \nstimulating conversation in the world because we are here, frankly, \nwaiting on a group of negotiators to try to solve their problems. And \nthe only comment I would give to them would be this one. You have made \nyour point. You have shown how tough you are. You have shut the \nGovernment down. Everybody knows you are powerful. Will you please \nstart to negotiate, having made your point, and let us get on with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/16/senate-section/article/S18778-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18780-S18781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have personally been heartened by the \nsigns of progress we have witnessed since the budget crisis and the \nGovernment shutdown the week before Thanksgiving. The Congress and the \nWhite House have been at the bargaining table. Additional \nappropriations bills have been signed into law, and new estimates from \nthe Congressional Budget Office have offered the promise of greater \nflexibility. I thought these new estimates would have provided the \nflexibility in setting our budget priorities, and yet we are again \nfaced, unfortunately, with the prospect of a gridlock. Indeed, it is \ntaking place as I am privileged to address the Senate this afternoon.\n  The congressional leadership has been deeply disappointed with the \nlack of a substantive balanced budget from the White House, that is, \nthe Republican congressional leadership. Promises in good faith have \nbeen made for 25 days under the last continuing resolution only to have \nunworkable solutions presented in the 11th hour by the President and \nhis representatives. The Republican leadership, if it is to remain true \nto its pledge to the American people to balance the budget, has been \nleft with little choice. The Congress and the White House agreed that a \n7-year balanced budget plan based on CBO numbers would at least be \nagreed upon, and I was privileged to have been a \n\n[[Page S18781]]\npart of those negotiations some several weeks ago. It was absolutely \nclear that it would be a 7-year balanced budget. That was the condition \nfor the last short-term spending bill, and that condition, despite our \nefforts, has clearly not been met.\n  The remaining Federal offices regrettably now to be subject to a \npossible shutdown during the course of this weekend include the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, Education, Interior, Health and Human Services, \nLabor, State, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans, and Justice, as \nwell as certain sections of EPA, NASA, and federally funded functions \nin the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, again, it is my privilege to represent many of these \npeople who live in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I am deeply \nconcerned and express my compassion to them. But if an agreement is not \nreached, workers in all these categories again are to be held, as some \nwould say, hostage by the continuing budget crisis. Personnel \nperforming vital emergency functions will come to work and not be paid, \nand all staff involved in nonemergency functions will be asked to stay \nat home. These individuals, both in Virginia and across the Nation, \nhave my pledge that I will work once again, as I did during the last \nbudget crisis, to ensure that they will be made whole financially for \nany lost compensation. I also offer my pledge that their sacrifices \nwill not have been made in vain.\n  The Federal Government is in a state of budget crisis, as I said, and \nit is becoming increasingly difficult to patch together these short-\nterm resolutions.\n  It is my hope, however, that this weekend that can be achieved, and \nthat all Federal workers, indeed all Americans will recognize the \nunprecedented confrontation taking place between the White House and \nthe Congress and demand that good faith bargaining be resumed.\n  The Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate has had its sleeves \nrolled up for weeks--Senator Dole, Senator Domenici, and I particularly \nwant to pay my respects to Congressman Kasich of the House. They were \nmaking enormous efforts to address the differences expressed by the \nWhite House in a desire for the 7-year balanced budget plan. That 7 \nyears is absolutely the bedrock; it is not movable. It is not \nchangeable.\n  Federal employees should know that this is serious business of the \nfirst order and not just some new form of politics. Our ultimate \nobjective is a balanced budget agreement. This is important, not only \nto the Republicans in Congress, but also to Americans everywhere, \nparticularly children and future generations.\n  I recently received a position paper from the Chamber of Commerce of \nStaunton-Augusta County in my State of Virginia. This states far more \neloquently than I could the need to stay the course, stick with the \nbalanced budget and stay the course, 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that position paper be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. When we finally achieve the balanced budget agreement, \nthe Nation's house will, hopefully, be put back in order. We want that \nstability to be one that will last, not just weeks, but to protect our \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Staunton-Augusta County\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                       Staunton, VA, Nov. 7, 1995.\n\n                             Position Paper\n\n     Subject: Balanced Budget.\n     Position of: Government Relations Committee.\n       Background:\n       The economic case for reducing the Federal budget deficit \n     is compelling. Despite this fact, since 1985 neither normal \n     processes of government nor extraordinary statutory \n     restrictions imposed on the budget process have succeeded in \n     reversing the deficit's long-term upward trend. In fiscal \n     year 1994, the total federal deficit was $203.4 billion and \n     the gross federal debt was $4.6 trillion, according to the \n     Department of the Treasury. Because of the deficit and the \n     mounting interest which must be paid, money is diverted from \n     investment in the private sector, economic growth is \n     inhibited, productivity is reduced, and export becomes more \n     difficult. This situation threatens the standard of living \n     for future generations.\n       In June 1995, both houses of Congress passed the FY 1996 \n     Budget Resolution which calls for a balanced budget in 7 \n     years (2002) while providing a $245 billion tax cut. The \n     resolution provides that tax cuts will be available only \n     after congressional committees produce enough spending cuts \n     to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. Proponents believe \n     the 7-year approach provides the right balance between easing \n     economic adjustments while maintaining the credibility of the \n     government's deficit reduction plan. Opponents believe that \n     this plan is too aggressive and should be phased in over a \n     longer period.\n       Committee Position:\n       Moving spending from government to the private sector will \n     enhance saving and investment, boost productivity, and \n     increase the economy's trend rate of growth. Reducing \n     government waste means greater long-term benefits which in \n     turn will create more businesses and greater purchasing power \n     for American households.\n       Recommendation:\n       A balanced budget and deficit elimination are vital for our \n     nation's future. The Board of Directors of the Staunton-\n     Augusta Chamber of Commerce reiterates its support for the \n     passage of a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/16/senate-section/article/S18780-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume consideration of the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 2127, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2127) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies, for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1996, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry that we find ourselves in this \npresent situation. I had thought that we could have worked out an \nagreement on Labor-HHS appropriations, whereby we would not be faced, \nagain, with another cloture vote on it, but that we could have agreed \nto have brought up the bill and perhaps even passed it by voice vote.\n  There have been, I know, a lot of discussions. I know my colleague, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who is the chair of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor and Health and Human Services, has \nbeen working very diligently to try to get an arrangement whereby we \nmight bring this bill up and expeditiously move it so we can get \ntogether with the House and try to work out our differences.\n  This is an important bill. It is the second largest appropriations \nbill, second only to defense. It covers not only all of the Department \nof Labor, job training programs, but it also covers education, all the \neducation programs--everything from title I to college student aid. It \ncovers Health and Human Services, everything from Head Start to funds \nfor the operation of the Social Security system and Medicaid, plus a \nlot of related agencies, including the National Institutes of Health \nand biomedical research. Yet, this bill languishes because of the \ndetermination of a few to attach riders to it, riders that have no \nbusiness being on Labor-HHS, riders which should be brought up in the \ncontext of an authorization and not an appropriations bill.\n  Now I note for the Record, Mr. President, that other riders that have \nbeen put on other appropriations bills have been taken off, clearing \nthem for approval to be acted on and sent down to the President. I will \njust mention three. The Treasury-Postal appropriations conference \nagreement, they dropped their effort to attach the so-called Istook \nantilobbying rider. Once this was taken off, it cleared the bill for \napproval and was sent down to the \n\n[[Page S18782]]\nPresident. Also, there was agreement on a compromise on the abortion \nrider on the Defense appropriations conference report, which cleared \nfor approval for both Houses and was sent to the President. I might \npoint out they dropped all 17 House-approved EPA riders on the HUD-VA \nconference agreement. It passed and was sent on to the President.\n  I know people attach these riders for well-intentioned purposes. They \nhave a philosophy or a view or something they want to attain, but quite \nfrankly all of these riders that were dropped appropriately belong not \non appropriations bills, and cooler heads prevailed, they were dropped, \nand the bills went through. There is a rider on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill that cannot pass the Senate. Three times this year \nit was brought up, and it could not get enough votes for cloture and \nthere are not enough votes for cloture. That is the so-called striker \nreplacement provision.\n  This side, I might say, earlier on was unable to pass last year, when \nthe Democrats were in the majority, the striker replacement bill that \nwould have prohibited companies, employers, from permanently replacing \nstrikers if it was a legitimate, legal strike. We were unable to get \nthat through.\n  This year, the President of the United States decided, using his \nconstitutional authority--and I do not think anyone has challenged that \nhe does not have the legal authority to do it--implemented a policy at \nthe Executive level that said that the U.S. Government, the Federal \nGovernment, would not engage in contracts or renew contracts with those \nentities doing business with the Federal Government if they did engage \nin permanent replacement strikers. That was challenged in the court. \nThe court upheld the President.\n  Now there is an attempt by some to overturn that, to say that, no, \nthe President cannot do that, and that is what the rider is on the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. We had three votes on it this year. We \nhad one vote on the first rescission bill, and we have had two on this \nbill, on the Labor HHS bill. Both times it did not have sufficient \nvotes to provide for a cloture.\n  You do not have to take my word for it; you can take the word of the \ndistinguished majority leader. I will quote from the Congressional \nRecord of September 29, 1995, when we tried to get the bill through \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. Senator Dole said:\n\n       I talked with the leader about this bill, and we do waste \n     time periodically in the Senate, but this is a total waste of \n     time to continue on these two bills because they are not \n     going anywhere. I know some want to make a point. I agree \n     with the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa \n     that we ought to pass that bill on a voice vote. We cannot \n     get cloture. There were two votes, 54-46, party-line votes. \n     My view is we ought to do it, pass it, and find out what \n     happens in the veto in the next round.\n\n  I agree with Senator Dole that that is what we should have done, that \nwe agree to take off that rider that they have on it, as others have \ndone on other appropriations bills. I know there are some that want to \nhave a debate and a vote on one or two abortion amendments. I think we \ncan work that out with a time agreement, have a vote on the Senate \nfloor, and move it out. So what we are engaged in now with this motion \nto proceed is just another waste of time. There will be a vote on \nMonday or Tuesday, whenever the vote is called by the majority leader, \nand they will not get cloture. It is a forgone conclusion. They will \nnot get cloture, and we are right back where we started from.\n  It is a shame we have to waste more time of the Senate and go through \nthis exercise again. If cooler heads would just prevail and take that \nrider off, we could bring the bill out under a time agreement and \nprobably get the bill passed within an hour and then sit down with the \nHouse and try to iron out our differences in conference.\n  Mr. President, I was prepared to come to the floor to ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed to H.R. 2127, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and \nto have it go through on a voice vote pursuant to what Senator Dole \nsaid on September 29. However, I am aware there is no one on the other \nside to object to my unanimous-consent proposal, so I will not offer \nthat unanimous-consent in keeping with the comity of the Senate. \nPerhaps when we come back Monday and there are people, I may propound \nit again at that time, only again to show there is no objection on this \nside to bringing up the Labor-HHS bill and passing it by a voice vote \nas long as that rider is taken off. If that rider is taken off, there \nis not one objection on this side to bringing up the bill and quickly \ndisposing of it.\n  I wanted to take the floor to make that point in the hope that those \nwho have that rider on the bill will listen to the majority leader and \nlisten to Senator Specter if they do not want to listen to me and take \nthat rider off, and we can get this very important bill passed before \nwe, hopefully, go home for Christmas.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, not in keeping with this bill--I guess it is \nsomewhat in keeping with this bill--we are right now in a shutdown of \nthe Government. There are those that work for the Federal Government \nthat are now not going to work today and tomorrow, and I hope by Monday \nwe will at least get a continuing resolution to put us through maybe \nFebruary. It is a shame we have to do this. I hope that this weekend \nthe President of the United States would exercise his authority under \nthe law to provide funding for the Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, last year this Congress, Republicans and Democrats, \nappropriated $1.3 billion to provide some assistance for low-income \npeople to heat their homes during the winter. It passed with Republican \nand Democrat support. It was not a partisan issue at all. Also, earlier \nthis year, Republicans and Democrats, working together, provided for a \nrescission. We rescinded $300 million of that $1.3 billion. But it \nstill left $1 billion in there to help low-income people heat their \nhomes in the winter.\n  Because we have been under a continuing resolution, that money has \nbeen held up. We have not been able to get the money out for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\n  Mr. President, I want you to know that people in Iowa, people all \nacross the northern part of this country, have endured a very severe \nwinter thus far. There are people in our northern States who are now \nreally deciding whether they are going to buy some fuel or whether they \nare going to buy food or pay for their prescription drugs.\n  As Senator Wellstone has so eloquently stated many times here, \nincluding yesterday--and I know he cannot be here today, he is on his \nway to Minnesota--as he pointed out, there are people right now in his \nState, and I know in my State and I know in a lot of northern States, \nliving in one room of their homes. They have the oven on, because they \nare trying to cut down on their fuel bills because they do not have the \nmoney to pay them.\n  I know in some States, the State authorities that put out the money \nfor low-income heating assistance are saying they only have enough \nmoney to put it out in a crisis situation, and that is if an elderly \nperson or low-income person has been notified that they are going to \nget cut off.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of the money we put into LIHEAP, the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, 80 percent of it goes to people \nwith incomes of less than $8,000 a year; less than $8,000 a year. In my \nown State of Iowa there are elderly people living alone in small \nhouses, in small towns--mostly women, elderly women--whose total income \nis $4,500, $5,000, $6,000 a year on Social Security. That is all they \nhave. Now they are being forced to decide how they are going to pay \ntheir heating bills with a very cold winter upon us.\n  We have a window of opportunity. The President of the United States \nhas a window of opportunity. Since there is not a continuing \nresolution, we now fall back under the old law. The old law provided \n$1.3 billion. As I said, we rescinded $300 million. There is roughly \nclose to a billion dollars out there that needs to be put out for low-\nincome heating. I am calling on the President, and I hope the President \nwill as soon as possible get that money out. It has been appropriated. \nWe appropriated the money last year. There is no reason to hold it up \nany longer.\n  I am informed that as of this time, as of January of last year, about \n90 percent of the money appropriated for last year was put out. We are \nnot anywhere \n\n[[Page S18783]]\neven near that now. We are not even anywhere near 30 percent of the \nmoney being put out. Yet this is the time when people need that money.\n  So I hope the President will exercise his authority and get that \nmoney out as soon as possible, this weekend. It is an opportunity, I \nthink, for us to show, however bad this budget may seem to a lot of \npeople, there are still a number of people here who care about ensuring \nthat low-income and elderly people, especially, have enough money to \nheat their homes in the winter.\n  I do not put this in a partisan context. Mr. President, 53 Senators \nsigned a letter to the President on this very issue of getting the \nmoney out, and there were Republicans and Democrats on that letter. So \nI do not see it as a partisan issue, I see it as just a humane issue, \nan issue of decency and compassion. We ought to get this money out as \nsoon as possible. So I hope the President of the United States will \ntake this opportunity. It is sad to think we have to do something like \nthis during a period of time when the Government is shut down, but we \nmust take this period of time right now and get that money out so \npeople can heat their homes.\n  Lastly, I came across an interesting document earlier today, this \npiece of paper. I was on a radio show this morning with a small radio \nstation in Iowa, Webster City, IA. There were a number of questions, \npeople calling in asking, ``Why is the Government shutting down again? \nWhy are we going through this again?''\n  I have to tell you, maybe I am a little chauvinistic about this, but \nI happen to think my constituents, Iowans, are pretty reasonable \npeople. They are pretty smart and they have a lot of common sense. One \nof the callers said, ``You had this last shutdown but the people got \npaid anyway?''\n  I said ``Yes.''\n  He said, ``What is the purpose of it, then?''\n  I said, ``You tell me. I cannot tell you.''\n  He said, ``Will the same thing happen now? If the Government is shut \ndown, will these people get paid again?''\n  I said, ``I suppose so. They are going to get paid. We are going to \nshut down but they will get paid anyway.''\n  What is the purpose of it? It makes no sense to Iowans and makes no \nsense to me. Perhaps with this piece of paper I came across today, \nmaybe it starts to make sense. This is a piece of paper dated November \n29, 1 p.m. It is called--it has a title on it, ``Building An Effective \nGovernment We Can Afford. Government Shutdown Project.'' That is how it \nis titled.\n  I am told this piece of paper came from the Republican Caucus--\nconference on the House side. It came from the leadership, from \nCongressman Gingrich's office: November 29. It says, ``Government \nShutdown Project.'' This is November 29. Listen to this. The goal: \n``Hold effective hearings, press conferences and communication \nopportunities between December 4-13 to demonstrate mismanagement, \npoliticization of government shutdown or to expose waste in government \nfunctions that was evidenced by government shutdown. (see themes \nbelow)''\n  Here are the themes they say. Here are the ``themes.''\n\n       Clinton politicized the shutdown--harming people \n     unnecessarily.\n       Clinton is fighting to protect big government and the \n     status quo.\n       Shutdown exposed Government functions that are wasteful and \n     unnecessary.\n\n  And then they have the hearings here: ``Committee, chairman, date, \ntopic.'' Here is activity one: ``Hearing, Government Reform \nSubcommittee on Civil Service. Chairman: Mica. Date: 12/6. Topic: \nMismanagement of shutdown.''\n  Here is the next, ``Hearing, Government Reform Subcommittee on \nNational Economic Growth. Chairman: McIntosh. Date: 12/7 or 8. Topic: \nRubin''--meaning Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin--``scare tactics \nand raiding trust funds.''\n  On and on. I could read the whole thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed \nin its entirety at this point in the Record so people can read it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Building an Effective Government We Can Afford\n\n\n                      government shutdown project\n\n     Goal\n       Hold effective hearings, press conferences and \n     communication opportunities between December 4-13 to \n     demonstrate mismanagement, politicization of government \n     shutdown or to expose waste in government functions that was \n     evidenced by government shutdown.

So, I think this paper makes it clear why we are in a \nGovernment shutdown. This was by design, by the Speaker of the House. \nThis is dated November 29. ``Hold effective hearings, press conferences \nand communication opportunities between December 4-13.'' They did not \nwant to reach an agreement. This is all a plan and a scheme to make \nthis a political issue. That is sad.\n  I wish I had this this morning when I was on the radio. I did not \nhave it then. If I had, I would have read it on the radio this morning \nto my constituents in Iowa, saying, ``Here is a piece of paper from the \nSpeaker's office dated November 29, saying that their plan is to shut \ndown the Government on December 15, and here is how you get ready for \nit. You have all these hearings and you have all these meetings and \nhere is how you discuss it. It is all laid out there.''\n  I suppose maybe he did not figure anybody would get a hold of this \npiece of paper. Once again, it shows you, in Washington, if you put \nsomething on a piece of paper someone is going to get a hold of it that \nyou did not want to get a hold of it.\n  So, Mr. President, there is only one reason why we are in a \nGovernment shutdown and that is because the Speaker of the House and \nhis people over there, his allies over there, have decided that they \nwant to do this to create a crisis, to create chaos, to create a \ndisturbance, because Mr. Gingrich says he is leading a revolution, \nleading a revolution.\n  I did not get a chance to read much of the paper this morning but I \ndid read a little part of the paper in which Mr. Gingrich is saying \nsomething--in the Post this morning he said something like: Well, this \nis like 1933. It is a revolution like 1933, he said.\n\n  Well, first of all, I think the Speaker has an overinflated view of \nhimself as a historic person, first.\n  Second, how can he possibly compare himself to Franklin Roosevelt, or \ncompare what they are doing to government to what we did in 1933? The \nSpeaker said, ``This is a historic moment, a moment fully as important \nas 1933.'' \n\n[[Page S18784]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is a moment when we decide what we are about as a \nnation and where we want to go. It is a moment where we choose whether \nwe want America to move forward, or to turn it back before 1933.\n  So, Mr. Gingrich is right in one respect. In 1933, President Franklin \nRoosevelt looked at the United States of America, and he said, ``I see \na country one-third ill housed, one-third ill clothed, and one-third \nill fed.''\n  Now, if that was Mr. Gingrich in 1933, he would have said, ``I see an \nAmerica where two-thirds of the people are well fed, two-thirds are \nwell clothed, and two-thirds are well housed,'' ignoring the third that \nwere being left out of our system. There is a difference between Mr. \nGingrich's philosophy and Franklin Roosevelt's.\n  Franklin Roosevelt and that Congress decided never again--that we \nwere going to change government to provide that ladder of opportunity \nfor people at the bottom as well as the people at the top. How can Mr. \nGingrich, how can the Speaker of the House, in any way compare his \nphilosophy or what he is trying to do to what Franklin Roosevelt did in \n1933? I am incredulous. Rather, what the Speaker is trying to do is to \nundo everything that he did to make this country a little bit more \nfair, a little bit more just, and a little bit more compassionate.\n  So, yes, we do have kind of a historic moment right now. Are we going \nto say that everything we have done to build a ladder of opportunity \nfor people at the bottom we are going to take away; that what we did to \nprovide for decency for the elderly in Medicare and Social Security, we \nare going to take that away, and turn it back to what it was before \n1933?\n  We have to decide whether it is right to take $270 billion out of \nMedicare for our elderly without mounting a real attack on the waste, \nfraud, and abuse that is rampant in the system--that every senior knows \nabout but we cannot seem to attack.\n  It is a moment when we decide whether to raise taxes on working \nfamilies and tell them, ``We are not going to only raise your taxes, \nbut we are going to cut your Medicaid, and now you are going to have to \npay for your parents' or grandparents' nursing home, too.''\n  It is a moment when we decide whether it is responsible to make it \nharder for students to go to college and easier for companies to take \ntheir jobs overseas.\n  It is a moment when we decide whether we are going to scrap the \ndirect loan program for students, or whether we are going to let the \nbanks have a nice, cushy deal and make billions of dollars in interest.\n  It is a moment when we decide whether we are going to cut our \ninvestment in education and training and give billions more to the \nPentagon, more than they have ever asked for.\n  It is a moment when we decide whether we are going to pull the rug \nout from under family farmers in rural communities and stick them with \na farm bill that I call a Welcome to Welfare Act.\n  So, yes, it is a historic moment. It is a historic moment. It is \nnothing like 1933, though, because what we are doing here is we are \nturning--if we adopt this budget that the Speaker of the House has come \nup with, if we adopt that budget, we are turning our backs on progress \nin America.\n  I swear--some people ask me a lot of times, ``What does Mr. Gingrich \nreally want? What kind of America is he looking at?'' I swear that he \nwill not be satisfied until we have an America that looks like a Third \nWorld country where a few rich are at the top and everybody else is at \nthe bottom where there is no way for the people at the bottom to get to \nthe top.\n  I have always believed, Mr. President, because of my background, that \nin America you ought to be a success. There is nothing wrong with that. \nThere is nothing wrong with making money in this country. There is \nnothing wrong with being rich. I do not begrudge Bill Gates with \nbillions of dollars. Look what he has done. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. That is the American dream.\n  But I have always believed, Mr. President, that when you make it to \nthe top, when Bill Gates makes it to the top, or if I make it to the \ntop, that one of the primary responsibilities of government is to make \nsure that we leave the ladder down there for others and that we do not \npull it up behind us.\n  This budget proposal that has come to us from the House of \nRepresentatives allows those who get to the top to pull that ladder up \nbehind them. It not only allows them to do it, but it encourages them \nto do it with the aid and the assistance of the Federal Government.\n  Mind you, Mr. President, I said, a ``ladder of opportunity.'' I have \nalways believed in that. I did not say escalator. I did not say \nsomething that someone can get on and get a free ride up. I said a \nladder, because with a ladder you still have to exert some work to get \nto the top. But the structure is there.\n  When you take away that structure of prenatal care, the Head Start \nProgram, college student loans, and you take away Medicaid that is \ngoing to help the elderly pay for the nursing home bills, and when you \ncut Medicare and make the elderly pay for their monthly premiums when \nthey do not have it, when you cut out the Low-Income Energy Assistance \nProgram for people that make less than $8,000 a year, and when you turn \nright around and give more tax benefits to corporations and you do not \ngo after corporate welfare in this country, more tax benefits to those \nwho already have a lot, when 30 percent of the tax relief in the Mr. \nGingrich's budget goes to people making over $100,000 a year, when in \nthat budget families making less than $30,000 a year pay more in \ntaxes--when you do that, you are pulling away the ladder. You are \ndestroying the structure that allows people who start at the bottom to \nget to the top.\n  So, yes, I believe in that American dream. I believe that people \nought to be a success. But I am not going to stand here or be a part of \nthe Senate without raising my voice and casting my vote against any \nbudget that would take that American dream away for future generations \non the bottom rung of the ladder. And that is as I see this budget.\n  So, I close my remarks, Mr. President, by saying that I think the \nSpeaker of the House really ought to examine what happened in 1933 and \ntake a look at what kind of a historic figure Franklin Roosevelt really \nis and what he did for this country to move it ahead out of the dark \nages of the past and to provide that ladder of opportunity for families \nlike mine.\n  If Mr. Gingrich looks at that and is indeed honest with himself, then \nhe will see that what he is about is undoing all of that and turning us \nback to where we were before. But maybe that is what he wants. Maybe \nthat is what Mr. Gingrich wants to do. Well, if so, that is his \npolitical philosophy.\n  I do not want to turn this country back, and I do not want to take \naway that ladder of opportunity. I hope that more reasonable Members on \nthe other side of the aisle, both in this body and in the House, will \ncome to a reasonable bipartisan conclusion--that, yes, we need to \nbalance the budget but not just do it on the backs of those on the \nbottom rung of the ladder.\n  I believe if we work together in a spirit of compromise, We can get \nit done and we can get out of here for Christmas. But if Mr. Gingrich \nproceeds with this plan of his in shutting down the Government, well, \nthen it looks like we might be here over Christmas and New Year's, too. \nIf that is what it takes, I am prepared to stay here. If that is what \nit takes to stop this folly that the Speaker of the House is trying to \ninflict upon the American people, well, then I guess we will have to \nstay here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/16/senate-section/article/S18781-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18784-S18785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on December 15, 1995, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing \n\n[[Page S18785]]\nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1747.

I might say for the information of my colleagues we did \nhave a meeting this morning with reference to welfare reform. We think \nwe are very close to an agreement. We hope to have that before the \nSenate next week. The House will act first. We hope to take it up on \nTuesday or Wednesday.\n\n  We also believe that we have resolved the problem with the D.C. \nappropriations bill, and it is possible that might be acted on \ntomorrow. It is unlikely. But it would be acted on by Monday. We could \ntake it up on Monday. I know there have been conversations with the \nMayor today to indicate that we hope to have the D.C. appropriations \nbill wrapped up on Monday and on the way to the President, and on that \nbasis I understand that there will not be any shutdown of anything in \nthe District of Columbia. At least that is what I was advised.\n  We also met with reference to the foreign operations appropriations \nbill. We have not yet resolved the one issue remaining with reference \nto abortion. But it is our hope that we could come to some resolution \nof that on Monday. If that were the case, then we will have completed \naction on all the appropriations except Labor, HHS, which we are unable \nto take up because of objections on the other side of the aisle. If \ncloture is invoked, then we can complete action on that.\n  I would just say with reference to the budget negotiations, we have \nheard nothing from the President or any of the President's \nrepresentatives today. It may be that there will be some information \nlater today or tomorrow. We are available. We are prepared. We believe \nwe should have serious discussions. If we are not going to have serious \ndiscussions, then we ought to sit down and say, OK, it is not going to \nhappen this year and make some arrangements so that many Members and \nothers and those who may be affected by a Government shutdown can be \nprotected.\n  I hope that we could get serious about this, sit down and start \ntalking with the President of the United States, with the Speaker, with \nthe majority leader of the Senate present so that we could make some \nmovement. I think one way it might help is if we start canceling all \nthe press conferences that everybody is having downtown and up here. \nThat might speed up the process because it seems to be that every time \nyou have a meeting you have to have a press conference. I am not sure \nthat has been productive the last couple, 3 days.\n  In any event, if the President wants us to be responsible, we are \ncertainly prepared to do that. We are waiting for him to get with all \nof us. We would be glad to come to the White House or anywhere else to \nmeet with the President to talk about the balanced budget in 7 years \nand how we can reach an agreement between now and next Friday, December \n22. If not then, sometime in the following week before New Year's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/16/senate-section/article/S18785-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 5 P.M.
