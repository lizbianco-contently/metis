Mr. President, I rise to discuss President Clinton's \n``do nothing--and I repeat ``do nothing''--response to the threat to \nour national security from the rising tide of oil imports.\n  Mr. President, the threat posed by our growing dependence on foreign \nenergy is once again in the spotlight because of last Thursday's \nrelease of the Commerce Department's report to the President titled \n``The Effect of Imports of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Products on \nthe National Security.'' The report found that:\n\n       * * * the reduction in exploration, dwindling reserves, \n     falling production, relatively high cost of U.S. production, \n     and the resulting low rates of return on investments all \n     point toward a contraction of the U.S. petroleum industry and \n     increasing imports from OPEC sources. Growing import \n     dependence, in turn, increases U.S. vulnerability to a supply \n     disruption because non-OPEC sources lack surge production \n     capacity; and there are at present no substitutes for oil-\n     based transportation fuels which account for two-thirds of \n     U.S. petroleum consumption.\n\n  Based on these findings, the Secretary of Commerce formally advised \nthe President that:\n\n       The Department found that petroleum imports threaten to \n     impair the national security. I recommend that you confirm \n     this finding.\n\n  Mr. President, it is reasonable to expect the President of the United \nStates to take bold action--bold action--if the national security is at \nrisk. President Clinton agreed that it is at risk, but he simply \nrefuses to take action or propose anything. In his statement, President \nClinton said:\n\n       I am today concurring with the Department of Commerce's \n     finding that the nation's growing reliance on imports of \n     crude oil and refined petroleum products threaten the \n     nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to \n     oil supply interruptions.\n\n  So far, so good. But President Clinton went on to say:\n\n       [[Page S2986]] I also concur with the Department's \n     recommendation that the Administration continue its present \n     efforts to improve U.S. energy security, rather than to adopt \n     a specific import adjustment mechanism.\n\n  So that is out.\n  Further, Mr. President, translated into English, President Clinton \nwill not do anything; the administration will simply continue its \nexisting policies--the very policies that allowed the threat to our \nnational security to occur in the first place. I would have hoped that \nhe would come up with at least one new initiative. I know that I could \nhave. But he did not.\n  It is not that the report is trivial and can be ignored. It was put \ntogether by a high-level interagency task force led by the Department \nof Commerce, and included every major Federal agency; namely, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of the \nTreasury, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council \nof Economic Advisers, and the U.S. Trade Representative. Public \nhearings were held throughout the country, and testimony was received \nfrom 69 witnesses. The report is well researched, thoughtful, and based \non fact.\n  It is not that the President does not have any authority to act. He \ncertainly does. Under the Trade Expansion Act, once a determination is \nmade that imports threaten the national security, the President obtains \nbroad powers. These powers have been used in the past against other \nthreats to the national security, just as they should have been put to \nuse here. Moreover, even if the President did not want to make use of \nthe Trade Expansion Act authority, there is a host of other regulatory \nand administrative changes the President could take under existing law. \nIf the President found these powers too limited, he could have proposed \nlegislative changes. But for reasons I cannot fathom, he has not done a \nsingle thing other than continue the administration's policy which \nmakes us more dependent on imports.\n  The President's don't worry, be happy attitude may be disturbing, but \nI guess it is not surprising. He is equally unwilling to promote \nhydroelectric power, nuclear power, or coal power. He strongly supports \nthe use of natural gas, but not the domestic production of natural gas. \nBased on unfounded fears of the environmental community, he is \nunwilling to open up even the smallest amount of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge for exploration and development, just as he does not \nwant to see additional onshore and offshore Federal lands opened up.\n  I find it ironic that at the very moment that the President of the \nUnited States is saying that the administration will do nothing new to \npromote energy production in the United States, the Secretary of Energy \nis in China promoting Chinese energy production. Perhaps we should \ninvite the Chinese Secretary of Energy to the United States to help our \nindustry.\n  To this Senator, the President's decision to do absolutely nothing \nabout a threat to our national security is nothing short of incredible. \nTo agree with the Department of Commerce that the national security is \nat risk, but to take no action, is simply unconscionable. That is \nparticularly mystifying because in 1992 candidate Bill Clinton made the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       Our reliance on foreign oil is a genuine threat to our \n     national and economic security. When George Bush took office, \n     foreign oil made up a third of our trade deficit, and since \n     then the U.S. has not had an energy policy. Now we import \n     nearly half our oil, which accounts for two-thirds of our \n     trade deficit. Even James Watkins, the President's Secretary \n     of Energy, has written that the U.S. imports much of its oil \n     ``from potentially unreliable suppliers half a world away.'' \n     That kind of dependence makes us vulnerable, and we must \n     change that situation.\n\n  That was President Clinton the candidate.\n  Mr. President, there is an old saying that those who do not learn \nfrom the past are condemned to repeat it.\n  Does President Clinton remember the shortages, price increases, and \nlong gasoline lines caused by the 1973 Arab oil embargo?\n  Does he remember the energy shortages during the 1976-77 winter, \nwhich shut down schools and businesses throughout the Midwest?\n  Does he remember the Khomeni revolution and the Iraq-Iran war which \nthreatened international oil supplies?\n  Does he remember our reflagging Kuwaiti oil tankers to allow the \nUnited States Navy to protect them from Iran?\n  And, finally, does he remember Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which \nthreatened two-thirds of the world's oil reserves and resulted in one-\nhalf million United States troops laying their lives on the line?\n  Mr. President, that was a war over oil, make no mistake about it.\n  In refusing to take any action, however modest, President Clinton is \nputting hope over experience. He is also placing our energy and \neconomic destiny into the hands of foreign producers--producing nations \nwho have demonstrated time and time again, that they have their \npolitical and economic interests in mind, not ours.\n  Mark my words: If we do not pay attention to the present, we will \nrelive the past.\n  We will look at the energy situation very briefly this morning.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that each day our energy \nsituation is increasingly perilous. That is obvious from the data which \nI would now like to provide for the benefit of the Senate. I will first \ndescribe the rapid decline in U.S. crude oil production, and the state \nof natural gas production.\n  In 1970, U.S. crude oil production hit its all-time peak of 9.6 \nmillion barrels per day. In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, \nU.S. production had fallen to 9.2 million barrels per day. Today, we \nproduce only 6.6 million barrels per day, a 28-percent decline since \n1973 and a 32-percent decline since 1970.\n  Today, the United States produces less crude oil than we did back in \n1955. Had environmentalists succeeded in preventing the development of \nthe Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, the United States would now be producing \nless oil than before 1949, the first year for which we have data.\n  I might add, that Prudhoe Bay has been contributing about 25 percent \nof the Nation's total crude oil for the last 17 years. That production \nis now in decline. We would like to open up new areas in Alaska to \nreplace the decline of Prudhoe Bay, but clearly it is not the present \npolicy at this time. I would hope the President would see fit to change \nhis mind. He has been known to do that on occasion.\n  As bad as that sounds, it is only going to get worse. According to \nthe Department of Energy, in 5 years the United States will be \nproducing only 5.4 million barrels per day of crude oil. In the year \n2005--only 10 years from now--U.S. oil production will fall to 5.2 \nmillion barrels per day. Thus, unless we take action, and take it now, \nin the year 2005 we will be producing about the same amount of crude \noil as we did back in 1949.\n  To put this all in perspective, in 1949 there were only 36 million \ncars on the road; today there are 143 million on the road, four times \nas many. The good news, of course, is that energy efficiency has \nincreased dramatically.\n  Although natural gas production has increased over the past 2 years, \nit is still 13 percent below the 1973 production rate. Moreover, the \nDepartment of Energy forecasts that natural gas production will not \nkeep pace with increased demand over the next decade.\n  Let me now very briefly talk about our dwindling reserves of crude \noil and natural gas.\n  As worrisome as the decline in U.S. production may be, the decline in \nU.S. proven reserves of crude oil and natural gas is even more \nworrisome.\n  From 1949 until 1968, the combined U.S. reserves of crude oil and \nnatural gas increased every year. Beginning in 1968, however, \nproduction exceeded net additions to proved reserves, and net reserves \nbegan their current decline. Since 1968, except for the addition of \nAlaska's North Slope reserves in 1970, our combined proven reserves of \noil and gas have consistently declined.\n  Today, U.S. proven reserves of crude oil are 40 percent below their \npeak in 1979. They are even lower than they were back in 1949.\n  Today, U.S. proven reserves of natural gas are 43 percent below their \npeak in 1967. They are also lower than they were back in 1949.\n  In this connection, it is interesting to note that the Commerce \nDepartment's report cites the decisions \n[[Page S2987]] ``against developing other geological prospects such as \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf'' \nas key factors contributing to the decline of U.S. oil reserves.\n  It should not come as any surprise that the combination of increasing \ndemand and declining production results in growing foreign dependence \non imported oil.\n  In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, we imported 6.3 million \nbarrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products. We were 36 \npercent dependent on foreign oil.\n  Today, we import 8.9 million barrels per day of oil, making us more \nthan 50 percent foreign dependent.\n  By the year 2005, the Department of Energy projects that we will \nimport 12.5 million barrels per day of oil, making us 68 percent \nforeign dependent.\n  Although we are less dependent on imports of natural gas than we are \non imports of oil, our natural gas imports are also rising. In 1973, we \nimported 5 percent of the natural gas we consumed. Today, we are \nimporting 12 percent, and the Department of Energy projects that by the \nyear 2005 our foreign dependence will increase to 14 percent.\n  As the Commerce Department's report notes, our growing dependence on \nforeign energy is very worrisome because:\n  ``The United States and the OECD countries have limited prospects to \noffset a major oil supply disruption ***.'' and that ``(d)uring a major \noil supply disruption, there could be substantial economic austerity as \na result of the decreased availability of oil *** (which would) pose \nhardships for the U.S. economy.''\n  Our foreign oil dependency also has significant financial \nimplications for the United States, particularly with respect to the \ntrade deficit.\n  Each and every day we spend $140 million on foreign energy--$55 \nbillion last year alone. Altogether, over the past decade we have spent \none-half trillion dollars on imported energy.\n  Clearly, our economy would have been healthier and more of our \nworkers employed if we had spent that money on domestically produced \nenergy instead of on imports.\n  Imports of foreign energy have cost oil workers thousands of jobs, \naccording to IPAA and Department of Commerce statistics. In 1981, there \nwere 15,000 independent oil and gas producers; today there are less \nthan 8,000. Total employment in oil and gas production has fallen from \n700,000 in 1982, to 350,000 today--a 50-percent decline. We can only \nexpect this to get worse over the next decade as domestic production \ndeclines and imports increase.\n  You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what it all \nmeans. The Department of Commerce is right on target. Our economic and \nnational security is threatened. Our growing dependence on foreign \nenergy leaves the United States vulnerable to the whims of foreign \nproducers. No matter how stable our energy supply now appears, the \nprice and availability of energy from foreign nations has been, and \nwill continue to be, a function of their political and economic \npriorities, not ours.\n  The problem is largely self-made. For example, the entire east coast \nof the United States is under a leasing moratorium, just as is the west \ncoast and the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida's coast. There is \ngreat oil and gas potential there which can be developed with due \nregard to the environment. Drill in ANWR? Not a chance, says the \nenvironmental community.\n  We must not forget that the picture is no better for our other energy \nresources. For example, no new nuclear powerplant has been announced \nfor two decades. It is difficult and costly for U.S. refineries to \ncomply with environmental restrictions. Federal environmental laws and \nregulations likewise make it difficult and very costly to build a \nnatural gas pipeline, a coal-fired powerplant, an electric transmission \nline, or a hydroelectric dam.\n  There is much that can be done to promote the production of domestic \nenergy from our abundance resources. It ranges from the mundane to the \ncontroversial. But if we do not take action, our children are going to \nbe very critical of us as they sit in long gasoline lines or are cold \nat night or are unemployed.\n  Mr. President, the Commerce Department's report is a clarion call to \naction, not a lullaby to put us to sleep. We have a choice: Produce \nmore energy domestically, or suffer the consequences of our dependency. \nI choose the former; President Clinton chooses the latter.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the press \nrelease from the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, and the National Stripper Well \nAssociation be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, these press releases really express the petroleum \nindustry's deep disappointment with the President's response to the \nCommerce Department's finding that oil imports threaten the national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I also want to bring to the attention of the Senate a \nletter to the President dated February 10, 1995, sent by 70 Members of \nCongress, myself included. This bipartisan letter identifies a host of \nadministrative, regulatory, and legislative actions that the President \ncould have taken in response to the Department of Commerce report. But \nas I have stated before, the President instead decided to do nothing, \nand this is disappointing to me and to my colleagues who signed the \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Congress of the United States\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Secretary of Commerce recently \n     reported to you the results of an investigation, conducted \n     under the Trade Expansion Act, into the impact of crude oil \n     imports on the national security of the United States. The \n     investigation determined that oil imports threaten to impair \n     the national security of the United States. While this \n     finding may be startling to some, that is exactly the point \n     that so many of us made when we met with you, Secretary \n     Bentsen, and Deputy Secretary White last June.\n       As required by the Administration's Domestic Natural Gas \n     and Oil Initiative, the Department of Energy recently \n     completed a cost benefit analysis to quantify the costs of \n     imported oil that are not reflected in the price. DOE's \n     analysis determined that the United States pays a hidden and \n     exorbitant economic and environmental price for imported oil.\n       Clearly, it is imperative that we take immediate action to \n     alleviate this threat to our national security. By removing \n     unnecessary impediments to domestic exploration and \n     development we can strengthen our domestic oil and gas \n     industry and begin to correct this dangerous oil trade \n     deficit.\n       During the 103rd Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators \n     and Representatives submitted to you the attached \n     comprehensive domestic oil and gas policy initiative. This is \n     a balanced package of legislative proposals and regulatory \n     actions that could immediately boost domestic energy \n     production.\n       As you will recall, the Departments of Energy, Treasury, \n     and Interior favorably expressed a willingness to work within \n     the framework of this bipartisan policy proposal in an effort \n     to respond to the crisis in the domestic oil and gas \n     industry.\n       In addition to the widespread support on Capitol Hill, all \n     of the segments of the domestic energy industry \n     enthusiastically support our proposed solutions.\n       Mr. President, the Trade Expansion Act requires you to take \n     action within ninety days of the Secretary of Commerce's \n     report. We strongly believe that our recommendations to \n     preserve marginal well production, encourage new oil and \n     natural gas drilling, reduce regulatory compliance costs, \n     abolish existing prohibitions against the export of domestic \n     crude oil production provided that full and adequate \n     protections for the domestic merchant marine industry are \n     assured, and ensure reasonable access to oil and gas \n     resources on public lands, provides a blueprint for fast, \n     effective action to protect our Nation's vital economic and \n     security interests.\n       We are confident that working together with the \n     Administration, we can quickly implement these proposals and \n     reduce our dangerous dependence on imported oil.\n       We look forward to working with you to protect our \n     Country's future.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bill K.

The provision will allow a $3 per \n     barrel tax credit for the first 3 barrels of daily production \n     from an existing marginal oil well and a $0.50 per Mcf tax \n     credit for the first 18 Mcf of daily natural gas production \n     from a marginal well.\n       The current definition of marginal wells will be expanded \n     to include a new category for ``high water cut property''--\n     producing 25 barrels per day or less per well, with produced \n     waters accounting for 95 percent of total production. In \n     addition, techniques such as waterflooding and disposal, \n     cyclic gas injection, horizontal drilling, and gravity \n     drainage should be encouraged to enable domestic producers to \n     capture more of the oil in a given marginally economic \n     property.\n       The provision will also include a tax credit for production \n     from new wells that have been drilled after June 1, 1994. The \n     provision will allow a $3 per barrel tax credit for the first \n     15 barrels of daily production for such oil wells and a $0.50 \n     per Mcf for the first 300 Mcf per day for such gas wells.\n       The tax credit will be phased out in equal increments as \n     prices for oil and natural gas rise. The phaseout prices, \n     which are based on BTU equivalence, are as follows: Oil--\n     phase out between $14 and $20; Gas--phase out between $2.49 \n     and $3.55.\n       The tax credit is creditable against regular tax and AMT.\n\n\n                   additional legislative initiatives\n\n       Geological and Geophysical Costs. We continue to urge the \n     administration to support the current expensing of G costs. \n     We understand that the administration is studying the tax \n     treatment of G costs, and we recognize that legislative \n     action may be required.\n       Eliminate the Net Income Limitations on Percentage \n     Depletion. Currently, the depletion deduction cannot exceed \n     100% of income from the property, and the deductions from all \n     properties cannot exceed 65% of taxable income. Many of \n     producers have so little income from the property that the \n     net income limitations further restrict the value of their \n     deductions. We support the repeal of both these limitations.\n       Limitation on Exports. We favor abolishing the existing \n     prohibitions against the export of domestic crude oil \n     production provided that full and adequate protections for \n     the domestic merchant marine industry are assured.\n       OCS Deepwater and Frontier Area Production. With domestic \n     reserves dwindling, areas with potential for new production \n     are the deepwater of the Outer Continental Shelf (water \n     depths greater than 400 meters) and frontier areas. The costs \n     of finding and producing most oil and gas in these areas \n     exceed the current price for that oil and gas. We support the \n     consideration of a per barrel tax credit to encourage \n     deepwater and frontier production.\n\n\n                 Administrative/Regulatory Initiatives\n\n       Oil Pollution Act of 1990. We believe that the financial \n     responsibility requirements of OPA '90 are excessive, and we \n     support a reduction in the dollar levels. In addition, the \n     agencies implementing the financial responsibility \n     requirements should revise their regulations to make the \n     requirements more realistic in several ways. First, the \n     regulations must recognize that Protection and Indemnity \n     Clubs function as indemnitors, rather than guarantors. \n     Second, we support a thorough examination of existing \n     resources to identify those that are available for immediate \n     response and those that are available to pay damage claims \n     and restoration costs. Third, we believe that the MMS should \n     propose regulations regarding de minimis quantities. Finally, \n     the MMS should apply the requirement for offshore facilities \n     to maintain financial responsibility only to the area seaward \n     of the coastline, consistent with prior agency actions \n     implementing the OPA '90 and with the February 28, 1994, \n     Memorandum of Understanding establishing Federal \n     jurisdictional boundaries for offshore facilities.\n       Royalty Reduction. To remain competitive in attracting \n     capital, U.S. royalty laws should be reassessed. The existing \n     royalty reduction for marginal oil wells on public lands \n     (onshore) should be expanded to include marginal natural gas \n     wells. The royalty reduction for offshore production should \n     be extended for new activity, especially deep water and other \n     frontier areas, and marginal properties. Finally, we support \n     legislation that would temporarily suspend the collection of \n     royalties from wells in deep water, such as the bill that was \n     approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee.\n       Royalty Collection. `Reinventing Government'' legislative \n     proposals establish an unworkable, unfair penalty regime that \n     will have particularly adverse affects on natural gas \n     production. The Administration should withdraw this proposals \n     and work with industry to eliminate royalty collection \n     problems.\n       Underground Injection Control. The EPA is developing \n     revised regulations, reportedly deviating from \n     recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on UIC. \n     Indications that the EPA is considering tightening \n     regulations are disappointing, especially in light of its \n     report to Congress which found that any problems could be \n     solved by enforcing existing regulations, rather than \n     adopting new rules. This proposal could be extremely costly \n     to the industry without improving environmental protection. \n     We oppose the EPA proposed revision of existing UIC \n     regulations.\n       Natural Resources Damage Assessment. The Departments of \n     Interior and Commerce are developing regulations to impose \n     liability on natural resource producers for injuries caused \n     by hazardous discharges. Although relevant statutes do not \n     require it, damages could include emotional loss of persons \n     who do not suffer from direct contact or use of the natural \n     resources. The ``non-use'' damage proposal relies on an \n     economic methodology known as contingent valuation (CV).\\1\\ \n     However, a panel of economists created by NOAA was unable to \n     confirm that CV was a reliable methodology. We believe that \n     CV for damage assessments is seriously flawed and oppose the \n     inclusion of liability for non-use value loss in the final \n     regulations.\n     \\1\\A simplified example of the use of CV is as follows: \n     Trustees representing the public's interest in natural \n     resources injured by an oil spill conduct a survey in which \n     individuals are asked to state an amount they or their \n     household would pay to prevent this injury. The reported \n     amounts are averaged and then multiplied by the number of \n     affected individuals or households. Since no actual use of \n     the injured natural resource is required, the multiplier is \n     frequently quite large and the resulting ``damage'' figure \n     can run into the billions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Oil and Gas Leasing on Public Lands. The Interior \n     Department is conducting an internal review of leasing to \n     promote a new approach called ``ecosystem management.'' \n     Current law, the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLMPA), \n     is based on multiple use, including oil and gas leasing \n     activity. We urge the Interior Department to abide by the \n     principle of multiple use.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Independent Petroleum Association of America\n\n       Independent Oil and Gas Producers Reject Clinton \n     Administration's Do-Nothing Strategy, Call for Congressional \n     Hearings on Risks Posed by Oil Imports.--Independent \n     producers are stunned and disappointed by President Clinton's \n     response to a Commerce Department finding that oil imports \n     threaten to impair national security. ``The good news is the \n     president agreed that oil imports pose a national security \n     threat. The bad news is he's not going to do anything about \n     it,'' said IPAA Chairman George Alcorn. ``That's a do-nothing \n     approach from an administration that talks about taking \n     action but fails to follow-through.''\n       ``It is unprecedented for a president not to take any new \n     action, direct or indirect, to address the national security \n     threat,'' said Alcorn. ``All other presidents who have \n     concurred with the national security finding have proposed \n     specific new initiatives.''\n       IPAA and a nationwide coalition of producers petitioned \n     Commerce to launch the investigation under section 232 of the \n     Trade Expansion Act last March following a drop in world oil \n     prices that forced producers to shut-in wells and lay off \n     thousands of employees. Last year the amount of oil the \n     United States imported reached an all-time high--over 50 \n     percent of demand--while domestic production fell to a 40-\n     year low. During the first two years of the Clinton \n     administration, over 22,000 more American workers in the U.S. \n     oil and gas industry lost their jobs. ``It has all happened \n     on the Clinton administration's watch,'' said Alcorn.\n       ``This industry has been made noncompetitive by over-\n     regulation and a confiscatory tax policy. Congress has \n     recognized the threat and asked for presidential leadership \n     in a letter written only a week ago,'' said Alcorn. ``Faced \n     with congressional support and evidence provided by the \n     administration's own investigation that the loss of this \n     strategic American industry poses a national security risk, \n     the president still proposes no specific action.''\n       ``The lack of leadership and action by this administration \n     again demonstrates a flawed view of national security and \n     economic stability that cannot be allowed to prevail,'' said \n     Alcorn. ``Therefore we are calling upon Congress to \n     investigate the threatened impairment of national security \n     and to act where the president has failed to do so.''\n       IPAA Hails Energy Bill.--Today the Oklahoma Congressional \n     delegation led by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), a key member of \n     the Senate leadership and a member of the Finance Committee \n     and Energy and Natural \n     [[Page S2989]] Resources Committee, introduced a \n     comprehensive energy bill designed to help put the domestic \n     oil and natural gas industry back to work and strengthen the \n     U.S. economy by increasing domestic production and creating \n     jobs throughout the 33 oil and gas producing states.\n       ``This bill goes a long way toward developing a national \n     energy strategy that will make the domestic oil and gas \n     producer more competitive,'' said IPAA President Denise Bode. \n     ``These energy initiatives are far-reaching because they will \n     impact virtually every producer who explores for and produces \n     oil and natural gas in the United States. The legislation is \n     the foundation for much-needed energy reforms and it has the \n     support of independent producers.''\n       The bill was introduced in the House and Senate by \n     Congressmen Bill Brewster, Tom Coburn, Ernest Istook, Steve \n     Largent, Frank Lucas, J.C. Watts and Senators Nickles and \n     James Inhofe. It includes tax and regulatory measures that \n     will help maintain production from marginally economic wells, \n     encourage new drilling, provide relief from an unpredictable \n     royalty collection system, promote the cost-benefit analysis \n     of new regulations and support the export of Alaska North \n     Slope crude oil.\n       ``This energy bill is clearly a way we can alleviate the \n     oil import crisis and jump-start the domestic industry,'' \n     said Bode. ``It will put domestic producers back to work, \n     benefiting the nation with more jobs, economic wealth and tax \n     revenue.''\n       If you need additional information or would like to talk to \n     an independent producer for a local angle on this story \n     contact Kate Hutcheons or Jeff Eshelman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      American Petroleum Institute\n\n       Washington, February 22.--The surest and most important way \n     to stem rising oil imports is to produce more oil and natural \n     gas at home, the American Petroleum Institute emphasized \n     today.\n       The API made that observation after expressing \n     disappointment in President Clinton's reaction to the \n     Commerce Department's study and finding that rising oil \n     imports are a threat to the nation.\n       ``The President had the opportunity to express his \n     commitment to open federal lands to new oil and gas leasing, \n     exploration and development,'' the API said in a statement, \n     ``but he chose to emphasize federal programs that have had no \n     impact on rising oil imports, such as promoting alternative \n     fuels and renewable energy resources.''\n       The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in \n     Alaska holds the promise of billions of barrels of oil, as do \n     the offshore areas of California and Florida, now closed to \n     leasing by the federal government, API noted. The new \n     Congress indicates a willingness to grant greater access to \n     federal lands, but the President's support is vital, API \n     added.\n       In 1994, for the first time in history, more than half of \n     the oil used in the United States was imported. The 8,894,000 \n     barrels a day of crude oil and petroleum products amounted to \n     50.4 percent of domestic demand and set an all-time record. \n     At the same time, domestic crude oil production averaged \n     6,629,000 barrels a day--the lowest level in 40 years.\n       The President often speaks of jobs and the need for federal \n     revenues. Both could be attained by opening new areas to oil \n     and gas development, API said. Tens of thousands of jobs, not \n     only in the oil fields, but in the host of service industries \n     and factories throughout the country would be created. At the \n     same time billions of dollars in revenues would accrue to the \n     federal treasury in the payment of bonuses, rentals, \n     royalties and income taxes.\n       The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 1982, \n     employment in the exploration and development sector of the \n     petroleum industry reached a high of 754,500. At the end of \n     December 1994, that number stood at 332,800--a loss of \n     421,300 jobs! The principal cause, the API said, were unwise \n     federal government policies closing lands onshore and \n     offshore to oil and gas development.\n       ``The opportunity exists now to reverse these unwise and \n     unsound policies,'' API said, ``and initiate policies to \n     increase oil and gas production that would impact on oil \n     imports.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n  National Stripper Well Association Blasts Clinton Administration's \n  Response to Oil Imports Security Risk--Joins Call for Congressional \n                                Hearings\n\n       Virginia Lazenby, president of the National Stripper Well \n     Association, made the following statement regarding President \n     Clinton's Feb. 16 response to the Commerce Department's \n     finding that oil imports threaten to impair national \n     security:\n       ``I am enraged, not for myself, but for the thousands of \n     U.S. oil and natural gas producers the National Stripper Well \n     Association represents.\n       President Clinton agrees that the rising level of oil \n     imports--now over 50 percent--pose a threat to U.S. security. \n     That's a step in the right direction. What the Clinton \n     administration failed to do is address the threat by \n     proposing new initiatives such as tax and regulatory measures \n     that would help boost domestic production. The Clinton \n     administration's inaction is unacceptable.\n       In addition to the nine-month national security \n     investigation, other studies were completed last year, \n     including one by the National Petroleum Council, which \n     supports the call for the passage of initiatives to maintain \n     production from the nation's marginally economic wells. NSWA \n     played a key role in developing the report. At the time of \n     its release Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said \n     ``There are actions we can and must take that will benefit \n     the gas and oil industry.''\n       Why the administration has decided against taking action is \n     shocking. Nearly half-a-million people in the domestic oil \n     and gas industry have been forced out of their jobs over the \n     last decade as low-priced oil has been imported into the \n     United States. Domestic production is at a 40-year-low. The \n     nation can not afford to lose an increasing amount of \n     production from marginal wells which represents $10 billion \n     of avoided imports each year.\n       NSWA joins the Independent Petroleum Association of America \n     in its call for Congressional hearings on this matter and \n     hopes that the members of Congress will take action.''\n       The National Stripper Well Association represents domestic \n     producers who produce oil and gas from so-called stripper or \n     marginal wells which are wells that produce less than 15 \n     barrels per day. NSWA was among the groups that petitioned \n     the Commerce Department to conduct the national security \n     investigation last March.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2985-6", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2989-S2990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FLAG RAISING AT IWO JIMA\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am here today to speak about another \nbill, but I listened with interest to the comments of my colleague from \nAlaska on our energy crisis and would like to associate myself with his \ncomments.\n  I know, as does he, that we are more dependent now, I guess, than at \nany time in our history on foreign oil. And anyone who thinks that the \nwar in the gulf was anything other than a war over oil is being naive. \nI think, as my friend from Alaska, that trading the blood of American \nsoldiers is a pretty darned poor trade for oil. But clearly, if we do \nnot have some kind of coherent energy policy and if we do not move to \ndevelop our resources, we are destined to do more battle on foreign \nlands.\n  It also is interesting to me to note that when we do have public \nhearings about developing America's natural resources, some of the \npeople who protest the development show up in automobiles getting about \n4 miles to the gallon.\n  At any rate, I look forward to working with the chairman on trying to \nenhance production of American resources.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2990-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE NATIVE AMERICAN FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to speak on \nlegislation I introduced last week entitled the ``Native American \nFinancial Services Organization Act,'' S. 436. This legislative \ninitiative is the culmination of extensive deliberations between \nofficials from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the USDA, members of my staff, and staff of \nthe Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  The primary purpose of the Native American Financial Services \nOrganization Act is to begin to look at innovative funding mechanisms \nto address the critical housing needs prevalent in most native American \ncommunities.\n  The cornerstone of this legislation is the establishment of a native \nAmerican Financial Services Organization as a limited-government \nchartered corporation that would have the authority to:\n  Assist native American communities to create local financial \ninstitutions that will attract capital investment in housing and \neconomic development in Indian communities.\n  And, to develop and provide specialized technical assistance on how \nto overcome barriers to primary mortgage lending on native American \nlands, such as issues relating to trust lands, discrimination, and \ninapplicability of standard underwriting criteria.\n  As a matter of consistency this legislation is intended to \nsupplement, not duplicate, the efforts of any other government-\nsponsored enterprise or organization.\n  Through a cooperative agreement with the Community Development \nFinancial Institutions [CDFI] fund established in the Riegle Community \nDevelopment Banking and Regulatory Improvement Act, the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization will provide technical assistance to \nnative American financial institutions pursuant to the provisions of \nthe CDFI fund.\n  Mr. President, last week Secretary Cisneros testified before the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. In his remarks, he discussed HUD's \nreinvention blueprint for native American programs in the context of \noverall HUD reorganization.\n  I was particularly impressed with his commitment to revitalize and \nreorganize the Department of Housing and Urban Development so that \nlocal communities, and in this instance Indian communities, are further \nempowered to administer housing programs with greater flexibility.\n  In addition to consolidating many existing programs into funds, which \nwill be administered as block grants, the Secretary reiterated his \ncommitment to seek out alternative, innovative funding mechanisms that \ncould be a catalyst for supplementing existing Federal dollars with \ngreater private investment.\n  Mr. President, as the Chair is probably aware, housing on Indian \nreservations is terrible. The existing housing conditions prevalent in \nmany Indian reservation communities are so bad an estimated 50,000 \nfamilies are in need of new homes. And further, according to a study \ncompleted by the Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and \nNative Hawaiian Housing, the total backlog of needed homes approaches \n5,500 or an estimated cost of $460 million.\n  I think it is realistic to say that under our current fiscal \nconstraints, Congress will probably not be able to appropriate the \nnecessary funding to meet such a large backlog of basic housing needs.\n  It is for this very reason that I believe the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization Act is a viable solution to existing \nhousing crisis in our Indian reservation communities. I want to thank \nmy colleagues Senator McCain, Senator Inouye, and Senator Daschle for \ncosponsoring this important legislative initiative and look forward to \nits speedy passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is about time to lay to rest the \nfears of duck hunters across America about the effects of S. 219, the \nRegulatory Transition Act of 1995, on this year's duck hunting season.\n  This bill, which would impose a moratorium on all new Federal \nregulations, is an integral part of our regulatory reform agenda. It is \ndesigned to protect the public from regulatory overzealousness, but \ncertainly not at the expense of one of our country's most enjoyable \npastimes.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Don Nickles, Senator Bond, and \nmyself, cosponsored by 36 Members of the Senate, clearly exempts \nregulatory activity if the President finds the action is a routine \nadministrative action or principally related to public property \nbenefits or contracts.\n  No activity of the Federal Government can be considered more routine \nthan setting limits on duck bags.\n  But, fueled by faulty information and media hype, millions of our \ncountry's sportsmen are crying foul. We call these tactics the close-\nthe-Washington-Monument syndrome. The bureaucrats say if you are going \nto do something we do not like we will make the most ridiculous \ndecision possible and try to blame you for it.\n  The proponents of this legislation have no intention of shooting \nthemselves in the foot by losing the support of duck hunters for new \nregulatory common sense in our Federal Government. I have cosponsored \nthe Federal regulatory moratorium and am a lead sponsor of the \nmoratorium on the Endangered Species Act because they are important \ntools in our fight to protect private property rights and to safeguard \nsmall businesses and communities throughout the country from excessive \nGovernment regulation. Ill-conceived regulation curbs economic growth \nand curtails productivity at a significant cost to our taxpayers and it \ncosts jobs in America.\n  While the moratorium would achieve the desired effect of slowing down \nthis \n[[Page S2991]] administration's appetite for Government control of our \nbusinesses, it certainly is not intended to prevent routine Government \nprocedures, or to deprive our citizens of their favorite leisure \nsports. And we have gone out of our way to take care of these concerns.\n  While the opponents of these bills are likely to continue to try to \nruffle the feathers by trying to scare the public, the public's \ninterest would be far better served by imposing moratoriums. It will \nprevent further regulatory burdens from being added before this \nCongress can revise current laws, and add common sense to overzealous \nregulations. That is our goal, common sense.\n  I think the close-the-Washington-Monument tactics show how little \ncommon sense there has been in the regulatory climate. The public \nunderstands one point all too clearly: Regulatory reform is an issue we \ncannot afford to duck.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2990-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2991-S2992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HUNGER\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the other evening in a meeting in North \nDakota with a couple hundred North Dakotans, mostly farmers, I asked to \ndo something different. I asked if those who came to the meeting to \nparticipate would spend a little time talking about what is right, what \nworks, which Government programs are good and address real needs in the \nright way?\n  It was an interesting exercise. The sport in America, the pastime in \nour country that consumes the minutes of virtually every town meeting \nof every Member of Congress, is talking about what is wrong. I \nunderstand that. We should figure out what is wrong and make it right. \nBut it is also important to understand that there are a lot of things \ndone in this country that are good, that are worthwhile, that make this \ncountry better.\n  There is, it seems to me, a requirement from time to time for us to \nstop and think about that. What is it that works? What is worthwhile?\n  We have in this country today something called a Contract With \nAmerica, which was offered by the majority party in the House of \nRepresentatives. In the last election, when the American people decided \nwho would govern, 20 percent of those who were eligible to vote cast \ntheir vote for Republicans, 19 percent of those eligible to vote cast \ntheir vote for Democrats. In other words, the Republicans won 20 \npercent to 19 percent, and 61 percent decided they would not bother to \nvote at all. That was the score. The 20-to-19 victory produced was \ncalled a mandate by some. This 1 percent mandate in the House of \nRepresentatives then provided us with something called a Contract With \nAmerica. The Contract With America has some things in it that I support \nand some things that we on the Democratic side of the aisle have \nbrought to the floor of the Senate previously. There are things in it \nthat I think are bipartisan and that will enjoy bipartisan support. \nThere are other things that cause me great concern, which is where I \nthink we are going to be in some public policy aggressive discussions \nlater this year.\n  We are now discussing the constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget on the floor of the Senate. Consuming a substantial amount of \ntime in that debate is the notion that there are some people in this \nCongress who want to spend a lot of money and there are others who are \nconservative that do not.\n  Something happened last week that once again belies that general \nnotion. In the House of Representatives, the majority party, the \nconservatives, the ones who push the Contract With America, said they \nwanted to add $600 million in defense spending to a bill. The Secretary \nof Defense said, ``No, we do not want that. We do not need that. We do \nnot support that.'' The conservatives said, ``No, no, no, we insist. We \nwant $600 million more for you to spend.''\n  The question is, Who is conservative and who is liberal? We have \nconservatives saying the Defense Department should be given more money \nthan they want or need because that is where they want to spend money. \nWhere did they get it? They said, ``We will not increase the deficit. \nWe will take the money that's in an account for improvements for \nschools in low-income neighborhoods and we will use that to give the \nDefense Department money it says it does not need. We will cut job \ntraining for disadvantaged youth in order to give the Defense \nDepartment money the Defense Department says it does not want.'' This \ncoming from conservatives.\n  So, who is a liberal and who is a conservative? Who are the big \nspenders? Are the big spenders people who want to stuff another $600 \nmillion over to the Pentagon when the people who run the Pentagon say, \n``We do not want it, we do not need it, we did not ask for it, do not \ngive it to us?\"\n  I take from this lesson the general notion that is there is really \nnot a plugged nickel's worth of difference between Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals, in their appetite for spending \nmoney. Everyone wants to spend resources. The question is, on what? One \nwants to build star wars, another wants a feeding program for children. \nBut both want to spend money.\n  I think a century from now one will be able to look back at this \nsociety, at this country, at this group of people and make a reasonably \ngood judgment about who we were and what we were about and what kind of \npeople we were by how we decided to spend public resources.\n  One will be able to look at the Federal budget 100 years from now and \ndecide: Here is what the American people felt. Here is what they \nthought was important in the year 1995, because the Federal priorities \non spending, the priorities of the Federal and State governments and \nthe other uses of public funds establishes what our country and its \npeople thought was important.\n  There are some things in this country that are of national \nimportance, that we have decided were important over 20 and 50 years. I \nhave worked on one of these issues a great deal for many, many years. \nIt is that issue--hunger--which persuaded me to come to the floor for \njust a couple of minutes today. I have traveled to refugee camps around \nthe world. I chaired a task force on hunger with the chair of the \nHunger Committee, the late Mickey Leland, when I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. We have the winds of hunger blowing every day \nin every way in every country around the world--killing 40,000 to \n45,000 people a day, most of them children. And yet it is not a \nheadline anywhere. It is just a persistent, chronic problem that \nimposes massive suffering on millions and millions of people. Hunger is \nnot some mysterious disease for which we do not have a cure. We know \nwhat causes it. We know what cures it. Hunger is a very serious \nproblem, and there is a national responsibility and a national \nrequirement to respond to it.\n  The national priority to respond to hunger has been manifested in \nthings like the school hot lunch program, the WIC program, the Food \nStamp Program, a whole range of programs that invest in those who find \nthemselves with the misfortune of being poor and hungry, particularly \nin young people.\n  We are told now in the Contract With America that the new way to \nrespond to these issues is through block grants. Substantially cut the \ntotal amount of money for a number of programs, especially programs \nthat affect the poor, the vulnerable, and the hungry. Substantially cut \nthe money in the aggregate, roll it into one block grant, move it back \nto the States, and say to the States, ``Use it as you wish. Address \nthese problems as you will. It is your choice.'' Presumably, the State \ngovernments are more efficient and more effective than the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I will admit that there are many areas where the delivery of services \nby State governments can be more efficient and more effective. I also \nwould say that, just because people talk about wanting to create block \ngrants and use them as the device to save money, this does not in any \nway obliterate urgent national needs. Hunger and poverty are among \nthose urgent national needs.\n  Block grants will create a system, to ask the poor and the most \nvulnerable--and, unfortunately, especially the hungry and the \nchildren--to compete against a range of other urgent needs because, if \nwe say we are going to roll all of these programs into a block \n[[Page S2992]] grant, there then is no national priority that says we \nare going to feed hungry kids. It becomes a decision by 50 different \nStates about how much money they have to feed hungry kids versus the \nneeds of all of other interests that are at their doorsteps asking for \nfunds. Block grants themselves are not, in my judgment, the answer.\n  Yes, we use block grants from time to time, and, yes, they can be \neffective in some cases. But, frankly, I am pretty unimpressed with \nsome of these new Governors who are busy cutting taxes at the State \nlevel and puffing out their chests, walking around holding their \nsuspenders, and boasting about what a great job they are doing cutting \ntaxes back at home. Then they come here and walk through these doors \nwith a tin cup asking if they can have money, no strings attached, in \nthe form of block grants which eliminate the kind of things we have \ntargeted as national needs, things that effectively respond to hunger \nin children. If they can get their hands on that money with no strings \nattached, then they have the resources to respond to the problems they \nhave caused by their own tax cuts. I say, if they want resources, let \nthem raise them.\n  If you want to cause maximum waste in government, just decide to \ncreate a government in which you disconnect where you raise money from \nwhere you spend it. Decide to raise it here and spend it there, I \nguarantee you it will be free money in the eyes of those who spend it. \nYou can look at program after program for examples. Go back to the Law \nEnforcement Assistance Act (LEAA) and ask yourselves if some of the \nmost egregious wastes of Federal money did not occur under its block \ngrants. I have some specific examples I could use, but I will do that \nat a later time.\n  The point I want to make today is that it might be out of fashion to \nbe poor. It might be out of fashion to be hungry. There may not be a \nlot of high-paid lobbyists around supporting the interests of the \nhungry, but that does not mean that they are not people with compelling \nneeds, and that does not mean that we do not have a responsibility as a \nnation to respond to their needs.\n  The young boy named David Bright came to Congress one day. He was 10 \nyears old, living with his mother and a brother and a sister in a \nhomeless shelter in New York, lost, troubled, living in squalid \npoverty. He talked about the rats in the shelters. Then he said \nsomething I have never forgotten. He said, ``No 10-year-old boy like me \nshould have to put his head down on his desk at school in the afternoon \nbecause it hurts to be hungry.'' No 10-year-old boy should have to put \nhis head down on his desk at school in the afternoon because it hurts \nto be hungry.\n  If anyone in this Chamber or in the House Chamber or elsewhere can \nlook in the eyes of 10-year-old kids who are hungry because their \nfamily does not have enough money to buy groceries, their family does \nnot have a home, their family does not have enough to eat and say that \nthere is not a national need, not an urgent priority, you do not rank \nup here, you go down and compete someplace for some block grant that we \ngave to a Governor who talks about cutting taxes back home, then this \nis a debate I am anxious to have on this floor.\n  We need to debate what our national priorities are. Yes, we need \nincentives to tell people who are down and out, ``Here is a stepladder \nto get up and going again.'' We need incentives to say, ``You go from \nwelfare to work.'' We need all of those things. I will be one \nsupporting others on this floor who say, ``Let us change the welfare \nsystem.'' But I will not be part and parcel of that discussion and \ndecide, as some have, that this is a kind of a survival-of-the-fittest \nsociety where, if you are poor, you do not matter, and if you are a kid \nwho is hungry, you are not a national need.\n  When I see what happens over in the House, where they say, ``We are \nconservatives. We think that the Government wastes too much money, and \nso here is 600 million bucks we want to stick into the Pentagon,'' and \nthe Pentagon says, ``We do not want it and we do not need it and please \ndo not give it to us,'' and the House says, ``Sorry, but we are going \nto give it to you anyway, and we will take the money from a program \nthat helps poor kids,'' then I think something is wrong with the \nthinking around here. That's why I hope we can have legislation and \nsubstantial debate about what this Nation's urgent needs and priorities \nare.\n  As we do that, I at least hope all of us will understand this \ncountry's kids deserve to have a prominent place in the array of \nnational needs that this Congress decides to establish. We have spent a \nlong time looking at this country's problems and trying to address \nthem. No one here, I think, has decided to do that in any other manner \nbut with good will and with their best judgment. We have made some \nmistakes along the way. There is no question about that. But we have \nalso done some good things, and I would hate very much to see this wave \nof emotion about the Contract With America sweep out the door with some \nof the inefficient things that we certainly should change a set of good \nprograms and a set of urgent national priorities that respond to the \ninterests of the most vulnerable in this country, our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I begin the substance of my \nremarks, I would like to comment briefly on the comments of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. In case he missed an election last November 8, the \nAmerican people want to do things differently from what was just \nespoused by the Senator from North Dakota. It is not old fashioned to \nwant to have a change in the way that we address the problems affecting \nAmerica. It is not old fashioned to recognize that the programs so \ngreatly espoused and seeking to be continued by the Senator from North \nDakota have failed.\n  I would urge him to consider the words of our new Congressman from \nOklahoma, Congressman J.C. Watts, Jr., who said, ``We don't measure \ncompassion by the number of people who are on welfare. We measure \ncompassion by the number of people we can get over the welfare.''\n  The spirited defense of the status quo and business as usual just \narticulated by the Senator from North Dakota is ample evidence to me \nthat he has not gotten the message of November 8 as the American people \nwant things done differently, not business as usual. I believe that, if \nthe Senator in North Dakota would check around, he would find that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans want the Contract With America \npassed.\n  They want the Contract With America because they lost confidence in \nthe way that the Senator from North Dakota and the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle was running America. They are totally \ndissatisfied. They want change. They are going to get change. I am \nproud of the job that is being done by my colleagues in the House and \nthe courage that they are showing in taking on some sacred cows.\n  If the Senator from North Dakota thinks this old line about being \ncruel to poor people and depriving food from people's mouths is going \nto work, my message to him is, it ``ain't'' going to work.\n  I also look forward to a spirited debate and discussion with him \nbecause we have to find new ways to attack old problems, rather than \ngoing back to the old ways of spending more money on programs that have \nfailed to fulfill our obligation to those in our society.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I only have 10 minutes. I will be glad to yield to the \nSenator from North Dakota at the expiration of my time, if I have any \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2991-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2992-S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE BASE CLOSING COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the fact that \nthere will not be, I am told by the leadership, a vote on the nominees \nfor the Base Closing Commission today.\n  The fact is, on February 28, the Secretary of Defense will file for \nthe Federal Register a list of bases that the \n[[Page S2993]] Secretary of Defense is recommending that will be closed \nfor the consideration of the Base Closing Commission.\n  Mr. President, this will make it very difficult, if not impossible, \nfor the remaining nominees to the Base Closing Commission to be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I view failure to move forward with the base closing \nprocess as an unconscionable act that will deprive the young men and \nwomen in the military today of their ability to defend this Nation's \nvital national security interests. We cannot spend money on bases and \ninfrastructure which are no longer needed in light of the reduction of \nsome 40 percent in the defense budget.\n  We have, in the words of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Colin Powell, reduced our defense spending somewhere around 40 \nto 45 percent since 1985. At the same time, we have reduced our base \ninfrastructure by some 10 to 15 percent.\n  We have gone through two painful rounds of base closings and now the \nthird one, hopefully the last, will be facing us. If we do not move \nforward with this base closing process, we will not close bases in this \ncountry. We have proven that to anyone's satisfaction, which is why we \nwent to the base closing process to start with.\n  Mr. President, there are people on both sides of the aisle and both \nends of Pennsylvania Avenue who do not want to see this process move \nforward.\n  I believe that there is one egregious incident, for example, of a \nnominee, Gen. J.B. Davis, where incorrect information was spread around \nHill offices which tied him to an organization that had considerable \nfinancial interests at many installations. I do not know who originated \nthe memorandum setting out this flawed data, but it was further \ndisseminated by consultants and others who somehow failed to check the \nfacts of this matter.\n  But the primary fact is, Mr. President, if we do not move forward \nwith the base closing process, we have forgotten several things. The \ncold war is over. The defense budget is small. We have excess \ninfrastructure that needs to be closed. The BRAC will go on regardless \nof Senate action, but will suffer in quality if the names are not \nbrought to a vote immediately. I believe my constituents and our \nnational security interests deserve the best possible Commission we can \nprovide. I hope that all my colleagues will agree with that.\n  Mr. President, if we do not approve the nominees, then former Senator \nAlan Dixon, who is the Chairman of the Commission, by law must proceed \nwith the process. That will leave the review of the entire base closing \nproposals in the hands of one individual. He will have only one choice \nand that will be to rubberstamp whatever the Defense Department has \nrecommended.\n  I am convinced that that is not what the Congress had in mind when we \nset up the BRAC process. And I am convinced that the American people \nwill thereby be shortchanged and bases may be closed that do not need \nto be closed and bases will be kept open that do not need to be kept \nopen.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is clear that the fact that one of the \nnames was removed almost without cause--or at least for some period of \ntime there was no information--from the nominating list by the White \nHouse contributed to this problem significantly. But I think there are \nways that we could have worked it out, maybe, by withholding one name \nnominated by the other party as well as one nominated by the \nRepublicans, and the other names sent forward, we could have worked \neffectively in that fashion.\n  I am convinced that if we do not move forward today on these \nnominations, it places the entire concept of base closing in \nsignificant jeopardy.\n  Mr. President I hope that the leadership will reconsider their \ndecision on this issue and move forward today with the nominees for the \nBase Closing Commission for the sake of national security and for the \nsake of young men and women that are in our military today.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota what \nremaining time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

And since he did not, this side of the \naisle will, both from the other body as well as from this one.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               RAY NATTER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since 1989, Ray Natter has been the \nRepublican general counsel on the Senate Banking Committee. Ray came to \nthe Senate in 1987 after mastering the complicated area of banking law \nas special counsel to the House Banking Committee and senior counsel at \nthe Federal Reserve. Prior to coming to the Hill, Ray also spent 10 \nyears as a legislative attorney at the Congressional Research Service. \nWithout a doubt, Ray knows banking law and the legislative process.\n  Ray worked on several important issues in the last Congress, \nincluding interstate banking, fair trade in financial services and \ncommunity development banking. In previous years, he had a significant \nimpact on various important pieces of legislation, including the \ndrafting of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act, which \nhelped end the savings and loan crisis.\n  When Ray worked for Chairman Garn he not only wrote significant \nportions of FIRREA and FDICIA, he also worked on the important issue of \nlender liability, which was particularly critical to bankers in my \nState.\n  Regardless of how busy he was or how many major banking bills Ray was \nworking on, he always had time for the problems that I needed help \nwith. Sometimes New Mexicans had ideas for legislation that I would ask \nRay to review. Sometimes I would have a constituent who felt the RTC \nneeded a little congressional oversight. Ray always gave me good \ncounsel and advised me of all the pertinent laws.\n  When I was new on the Banking Committee, Ray helped me and my staff \nnavigate the complicated world of financial institution regulation. He \nwas always knowledgeable, accurate and willing to give his time to \nensure that we became as well-informed as he was on these difficult \nissues.\n  I am not going to serve on the Banking Committee this Congress. I \nwould have preferred to stay on the Banking Committee but too many \nothers wanted an opportunity to participate under Chairman D'Amato's \nleadership.\n  I want to thank Ray for his 8 years of service to the Senate Banking \nCommittee, three chairman, and through passage of numerous public laws. \nRay will be joining the staff of the general counsel of the Comptroller \nof the Currency. The Senate will miss Ray's expertise and his \nwillingness to help members of the Banking Committee and the Senate. I \nhave no doubt that the Comptroller's Office will recognize immediately \nthat they have landed one of the best banking lawyers in Washington.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2993-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2993-S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE 1995 BIRD HUNTING SEASON\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on the Senate floor today, one of my \ncolleagues challenged my concern shared by thousands of Minnesotans \nthat S. 219, a bill that would create a moratorium on new regulations, \nwould have the effect of limiting or eliminating the 1995 migratory \nbird hunting season. I take strong exception to my colleague's comments \nand will continue to \n[[Page S2994]] fight to protect this cherished annual Minnesota event.\n  The divergence in our two views apparently comes down to this: The \njunior Senator from Texas apparently believes that the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service's annual rulemaking process required by current law to \nopen the hunt fits under some exclusion in S. 219 for routine \nadministrative matters. I see no such exclusion.\n  Presumably, the language in S. 219 that my colleague thinks exempts \nthe annual migratory bird hunting rulemaking from the strictures of the \nmoratorium is found in the section which excludes ``any agency action \nthat the head of the agency certifies is limited to repealing, \nnarrowing, or streamlining a rule, regulation, or administrative \nprocess, * * * or otherwise reducing regulatory burdens * * *.'' \nClearly, the duck hunting rulemaking does not ``repeal[], narrow[], or \nstreamlin[e] * * * [an] administrative process.'' In my view, reading \nthis language to exempt the duck hunting rulemaking is forced, at best.\n  I might point out that my colleague is from a southern State, where \nthe normal duck hunting season opens later than it does in Minnesota. \nIf the Fish and Wildlife Service's estimated best-case scenario proves \ncorrect, S. 219 would serve to delay the necessary rulemaking, and thus \nthe opening of the season in Minnesota, by no less than 30 days. Since \nMinnesotans do the majority of their hunting at the local shoot early \nin the season--beginning around the beginning of October--before the \nlocal ducks fly south, such a delay would effectively cancel this part \nof the season. On the other hand, in Texas the regular duck season \nopens in mid-to-late November. Therefore, the Texas season may not be \nas affected by the delay in the rulemaking process.\n  If S. 219 becomes law without being changed to clearly exempt the \n1995 duck hunting rulemaking from the moratorium, here is a possible--\nperhaps even likely--scenario: The Fish and Wildlife Service proceeds, \nas it has been, with rulemaking action to open the 1995 season on time. \nSomebody opposed to duck hunting sues to stop the hunt--that's right, \nthe moratorium bill also allows lawsuits for people adversely affected \nby an agency violation of the moratorium. The whole thing winds up in \ncourt.\n  Yesterday, I introduced a bill to protect the 1995 hunting season \nfrom S. 219's moratorium provision. If the sponsors of S. 219 do not \nmean to threaten the 1995 duck hunt, then why don't they come on board \nmy bill? I say S. 219 is perfectly clear--it would negatively impact \nthe 1995 season in Minnesota.\n  So I challenge the sponsors of S. 219 to ask the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to adopt explicit language exempting the 1995 duck hunting \nseason rulemaking from the moratorium. The language of my bill would do \nthat nicely. If they would just fix the problem they created in the \nmoratorium bill, then this whole issue would go away. If it is not the \nintent of the sponsors of S. 219 to impact the 1995 duck hunting \nseason, then surely they should have no objection to my request.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2993-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute, \ntoday, to a native son of Nevada, Fred Dallimore. Fred is completing \nhis 26th year, as a baseball coach, at the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas. He has served as the head coach for the last 22 years. His \ncareer is a distinguished one. Under his guidance, UNLV has made 6 NCAA \nappearances and has had 16 winning seasons. The 728 career victories he \nhas attained ranks him 36th among the NCAA all-time winningest division \nI coaches. More than 80 young men, coached by Fred, have advanced to \nprofessional baseball. Several have made it to the major leagues \nincluding the San Francisco Giants, Matt Williams, a Nevadan from \nCarson City.\n  Fred's success at UNLV is the result of dedication, loyalty, and a \nlot of hard work. Over the years it was not unusual to see Fred out on \nRoger Barnson Field mowing the grass, dragging and watering the field, \nand performing every duty necessary to prepare the field for practice \nand games. The brand new Earl E. Wilson Baseball Stadium at Barnson \nField is a state-of-the-art facility made possible by a gift from the \nWilson estate. It is also the culmination of a dream come true for \nFred.\n  Fred comes from a long line of native Nevadans. He was born in Reno, \nNV on October 21, 1944. He attended Reno High School where he was an \nall around athlete lettering in football and baseball. An All State \npitcher, in his senior year, he led Reno to the State AAA baseball \nchampionship. During his 4 years at the University of Nevada, Reno he \nearned All West Coast and All Far West honors as a left handed pitcher. \nHis 11-1 record his senior year earned him All American honors as \nchosen by the American Association of Collegiate Baseball Coaches, \nPlayer of the Year, as selected by the San Francisco Examiner and the \nSierra Nevada Sportswriters and Broadcaster Athlete of the Year. The \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno honored him in 1982 by inducting him into \nthe UNR Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1994 UNLV honored him by inducting \nhis 1980 baseball team into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame.\n  Fred and his wife Alice are the proud parents of two children, Jamie \nand Brian.\n  Fred is a husband, father, teacher, and coach. I am proud to have him \nas a friend.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2994-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2994-S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        COMMENDING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE CHIROPRACTIC PROFESSION\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the chiropractic \nprofession which was founded on September 18, 1895, and is celebrating \n100 years of providing chiropractic services to Americans across the \ncountry.\n  The chiropractic profession was founded in Davenport, IA, when the \nfirst chiropractic adjustment was performed in an office building on a \njanitor named Harvey Lillard. One hundred years later, the chiropractic \nprofession is now recognized by Congress which included chiropractic \ncare under Medicare and authorized the commissioning of chiropractors \nas officers in the military.\n  Today, the chiropractic profession is practiced by doctors throughout \nthe world, including 50,000 chiropractic physicians throughout the \nUnited States. As the number of chiropractors continues to grow, so do \nthe standards in chiropractic education, research, and practice. This \nhas led to broadening acceptance of the benefits of chiropractic health \ncare by the public and the health care community.\n  According to health care experts, as many as 80 percent of Americans \nwill suffer back pain at some point in their lives. Low back problems \nare the most common health complaints experienced by working Americans \ntoday. For this reason, every year millions of Americans choose \nchiropractic health care for the restoration and maintenance of their \nhealth. For many who suffer from pain, chiropractic care is a natural \nmethod of alleviation that does not require the use of drugs or \nsurgery. Chiropractors around the country have made and continue to \nmake a significant contribution to the health and welfare of many \npeople whose lives would not be the same without their services.\n  On March 18, members of the chiropractic profession will gather in \nLas Vegas to honor those dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for \nmany \n[[Page S2995]] people in the Silver State. I would like to extend my \nthanks and appreciation to the devoted professionals involved in this \noccupation for their commitment and service. Chiropractors have made \nmany Nevadans' lives better through their practice.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2994-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know that my colleague, Senator \nKerrey from Nebraska, has come to the floor to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, after he speaks, it then be in order to \ncall up a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this debate is about amending the U.S. \nConstitution. If we approve the proposal as offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and others--as the House already has--\nit will be up to the States of this country to ratify or reject what \nwould become the 28th constitutional change in 206 years.\n  The Constitution of the United States represents the greatest \ndemocratic achievement in the history of human civilization. It--and \nthe self-evident truths which are its bases--has guided the decisions \nand the heroic sacrifices of Americans for two centuries. Its precepts \nare the guiding light and have been a shining beacon of hope for \nmillions across the globe who hunger for the freedoms that democracy \nguarantees. It has served not only us, it has served the world, as \nwell.\n  It is not, Mr. President, a document, therefore, to be amended \nlightly. Indeed, my strongest objection to this proposal is that it \ndoes not belong in our Constitution; it belongs in our law.\n  In addition to this argument, I also intend to suggest that the \npolitical will to enact changes in law to balance our budget--which was \nmissing from many previous Congresses--now appears to be here.\n  In fact, I wish the time taken to debate this change in our \nConstitution was instead spent debating the changes needed in the \nstatutes that dictate current and future spending. This does not mean, \nMr. President, I agree with those who have complained about the length \nof time we have spent on this proposal. This complaint is without \nmerit.\n  This great document should not be amended in a rush of passion. It is \nevident from the Constitution itself that its authors intended the \nprocess of amendment to be slow, difficult, and laborious. So difficult \nthat it has been attempted with success only 17 times since the Bill of \nRights. This document is not meant to be tampered with in a trivial \nfashion.\n  As I said, the proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution is \nintended to affect the behavior of America's congressional \nrepresentatives. In that regard, it is unique. Except for the 25th \namendment, which addresses the issue of transfer of power, other \namendments affecting the behavior of all Americans by limiting the \npower of Government, protecting public freedoms, prohibiting the \nmajority from encroaching on the rights of the minority or regulating \nthe behavior of the States.\n  This would be the only amendment aimed at regulating the behavior of \n535 Americans, who the amendment assumes are incapable of making the \ndifficult decisions without the guidance of the Constitution's hand. \nThat theory is grounded in the assumption that Congress and the public \nlack the political will to balance the budget.\n  Specifically, the proposal contains 294 words. It would raise from a \nsimple majority to three-fifths the vote necessary in Congress for \ndeficit spending. It would set a goal of balancing our budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  The amendment empowers Congress to pass legislation detailing how to \nenforce that goal, but does not itself specify enforcement measures. \nThe only answer to the question of what will happen if Congress and the \nPresident fail to balance the budget is that nobody knows. The only \nmechanism our country has for enforcing the Constitution is the courts. \nSo the amendment's ambiguity prevents the serious possibility of \nprotracted court battles which give unelected judiciary unwarranted \ncontrol over budget policy.\n  The proponents of this amendment sincerely believe our Constitution \nneeds to be changed in order to force Members of Congress to change \ntheir behavior, which supporters argue they will not do because they \nare afraid of offending the citizens who have sent them here in the \nfirst place. On that basis there is a long list of constitutional \nchange they should propose, including campaign finance reform, lobbying \nreform, and term limits, just to name a few.\n  Mr. President, I support the goal of a balanced budget, and have \nfought and am fighting and will continue to fight to achieve it. \nHowever, desirability of a goal cannot become the only standard to \nwhich we hold constitutional amendments. Constitutional amendments must \nmeet a higher standard.\n  The Constitution and its 27 amendments express broadly our values as \na Nation. The Constitution does not dictate specific policies, fiscal \nor otherwise. We attempted to use the Constitution for that purpose \nonce, banning alcohol in the 18th amendment, and it proved to be a \ncolossal failure. Fundamentally, we should amend the Constitution to \nmake broad statements of national principle. And most importantly, Mr. \nPresident, we should amend the Constitution as an act of last resort \nwhen no other means are adequate to reach our goals.\n  We do so out of reverence for a document we have believed for two \ncenturies should not be changed except in the most extraordinary \ncircumstances. We have used constitutional amendments to express our \npreference as a Nation for the principles of free speech, the right to \nvote and the right of each individual to live free.\n  The question before Members today is whether the need for a balanced \nbudget belongs in such distinguished company. While I oppose this \namendment, Mr. President, I understand the arguments for it. I have had \nthe privilege of serving here for 6 years and I am entering my seventh \nbudget cycle as a consequence. Every time the President of either \nparty, since I have been here, has sent a budget to this body it has \nbeen greeted with speeches and promises and rhetoric about the need to \nbalance the budget. And each time, those speeches and promises and \nrhetoric have been greeted with votes in the opposite direction.\n  Many of those whose judgment I most respect in this body support this \namendment, including the senior Senator from Nebraska, whose reputation \nas a budget cutter needs no expounding by me. I am sympathetic. Clearly \nsomething is wrong with a system which so consistently produces \ndeficits so large.\n  The question for me is not whether something is wrong, but precisely, \nwhat is wrong? Do we run a massive deficit because something in the \nConstitution is broken? Were the Founding Fathers mistaken in assigning \nthe elected representatives of the people the task of setting fiscal \nand budget policy? And is a constitutional amendment, as opposed to a \nstatute requiring a balanced budget, the only workable solution? If the \nanswers to these questions were yes, then a constitutional amendment in \nmy judgment would be appropriate. But my answer in all three of these \nquestions, is a resounding no.\n  If, on the other hand, the problem lies in the behavior of the 535 \nindividuals whose actions produce the deficit, as opposed to the \ndocument that governs it, then a constitutional amendment is both an \ninappropriate and ineffective means for balancing the budget. If a \nsimple statute rather than an \n[[Page S2996]] amendment will work, we should leave the Constitution \nalone.\n  Supporters of the amendment note we tried statute in 1985 in the form \nof the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law and that law failed miserably. \nTherefore, the argument goes, a more powerful tool than ordinary \nstatute--in other words, constitutional amendment--is necessary. The \nassumption, apparently is that a constitutional amendment mandate would \nprovide the legal and the political cover needed to cast the tough \nvotes in a climate in which the political will for doing so does not \nexist.\n  But the fact is, Mr. President, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings failed not \nbecause it was a statute as opposed to an amendment, but because the \npolitical will to balance the budget did not exist in 1985. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings set deficit targets to set up on a glidepath, a term we \nare hearing again today, to achieve zero deficits by 1991.\n  The deficit target for 1986 was $172 billion. We end up $222 billion \nin the hole. President Reagan's budgets did not even meet the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings targets in that year, much less a balanced budget. And \neven though Gramm-Rudman-Hollings provided the legal and political \ncover for deficit reduction, neither Congress nor the President has the \nstomach for it. Now we are attempting to find in the Constitution what \nwe could not find in ourselves.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that 1995 and 1985 are two very different \ntimes. I have heard the American people say loud and clear in this last \nNovember election that not only does the will to balance the budget \nexist, it thrives. We all know that the political will to balance the \nbudget exists today to a much larger degree than it did in 1985. In \nfact, there is much more enthusiasm than existed even in 1994. The \npolitical dynamic has changed in this Congress. I believe the political \nwill now exists to make the tough choices.\n  To illustrate this change, consider our attitude toward spending cuts \ntoday. A year ago when a bipartisan coalition of Senators offered and \nfought for an amendment which would have cut $94 billion in spending \nover 5 years, the administration argued against it, saying our economy \nwould enter a recession. But since the election, Mr. President, the \nsame administration opponents are scrambling to propose cuts that are \nlarger than the ones that they opposed just a little over a year ago.\n  There are far more Senators and Representatives today who are \nprepared to vote for spending cuts than there were last year. And there \nis evidence of a willingness to form bipartisan coalitions in the \nbeginning to tackle the problem, including our most politically charged \nproblem, Federal entitlements.\n  So I say that after the rhetoric for and against this amendment is \nover, let Senators get to work to show Americans we have the courage \nthis amendment presumes that we lack. While it is true that the \nPresident's recently submitted budget does little to reduce the \ndeficit, the stomach for the tough choices does exist in this body. If \nthe appeal of a balanced budget amendment is simply the legal or \npolitical cover it provides for the tough choice, a statutory change \nwould provide the same cover. If the presumption behind the amendment \nis that the political will to balance the budget does not exist, then \nmake no mistake, those who lack that political will can find a way to \ncircumvent this amendment.\n  An amendment to the Constitution of the United States is a powerful \nweapon, not one to be taken lightly. This weapon can be disarmed with \n60 votes in the Senate, only 9 more than it takes for deficit spending \ntoday.\n  And beyond all the legal maneuvers, there is no cover for tough \ndecisions but the courage to make them. So I simply am not convinced a \nbalanced budget amendment is necessary. It assumes a structural flaw in \nour Constitution that prevents the 535 Members of Congress from \nbalancing the budget. In fact, there is no such flaw in the \nConstitution. To the extent such a flaw exists, it is in the 535 \nMembers of Congress themselves, not the document that governs us.\n  The fact is, we can balance the budget this year if we wanted to, and \nwe can by statute direct the Congress to balance the budget by 2002, \n2003, or any other date that we choose.\n  Furthermore, I believe this debate is misdirected. The balanced \nbudget amendment tells us what to do over the next 7 years but ignores \nthe following 20, the years which ought to command our attention.\n  A balanced budget by the year 2002 still ignores the most important \nfiscal challenge we face: The rapid growth in entitlement spending over \nthe next 30 years. The year on which we ought to be focused is not \n2002, but 2012 when the baby boomer generation begins to retire and \nplaces a severe strain on the Federal budget.\n  Our biggest fiscal challenge is demographic, not constitutional, and \nthe amendment before us does not and cannot address it. Unfortunately \nand conveniently, this demographic challenge is kept from our view, not \nby an incomplete Constitution, but by a budgeting process that \ndiscourages long-term planning.\n  The budget the President sent us tells us what to do for the next 5 \nyears--5 years, Mr. President. The balanced budget amendment tells us \nwhat happens over 7 years. Five- and seven-year spans are completely \ninadequate when the most difficult budget decisions we need to make \ndeal with problems we will face 20, 25 and 30 years down the road, when \nthe aging of our population propels entitlement spending out of \ncontrol.\n  The most important recommendation of the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform is that we began to look at the impact of \nthe budget over 30 years, rather than just 5 or 7. The reason that our \ncountry looks very different and our current budgets look very \ndifferent viewed over that span is, as I said, not one of our \nConstitution, not, indeed, even one of our statute, but one of \ndemographics.\n  We can see the trend in the short-term. The big four entitlement \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement--\nwill consume 44 percent of the budget this year. Mandatory spending \nwill consume 65 percent. By 2000, it will be 70 percent. By 2005, the \nnumber is 78 percent. Those numbers, Mr. President, are straight from \nCBO. If we project further, we see that by 2012, mandatory spending \nplus interest on the national debt will consume every dollar we collect \nin taxes. By 2013, we will be forced to begin dipping into the surplus \nof the Social Security trust funds to cover benefit payments, a \npractice that will go on for no more than 16 years before the trust \nfund goes bankrupt in the year 2029.\n  These trends have nothing to do with the Constitution, political will \nor pork barrel politics. They have to do with the simple fact that our \npopulation is getting older while the work force gets smaller. My \ngeneration did not have as many children as our parents expected and, \nas a consequence, the system under which each generation of workers \nsupports the preceding generation of retirees simply will not hold up \nmuch longer.\n  Indeed, long-term entitlement reform, coupled with a reasonable \nreduction in discretionary spending, including defense, would reduce \ninterest rates dramatically and achieve the goal of this amendment \nwithout tampering with the Constitution.\n  In this context, I need to address the role of Social Security in \nthis debate. I have heard speaker after speaker come to the floor on \nboth sides of the issue and announce their support for this program. I \nagree with them all. Social Security is one of the most, if not the \nmost, important and successful Government programs we operate. Social \nSecurity should not and, indeed, does not need to be used to balance \nthe budget. However, we cannot ignore the fact that Social Security \nwill start running a deficit in 2013, due, as I mentioned earlier, to \nthe retirement of the baby boomer generation and the fact that more \nretirees will be drawing from the trust funds while fewer workers \ncontribute to it.\n  The general fund currently borrows against the surplus, and when \nSocial Security begins running a deficit, the decisionmaking capacity \nof future Congresses will be limited, because large amounts of the \ngeneral fund will have to be used to repay the money we are borrowing \nfrom the trust fund today. That situation will tempt future Congresses \nto run Social Security in deficit if it is exempted from deficit \ncalculations. That development would, of \n[[Page S2997]] course, only further jeopardize the program.\n  Even today, our decisionmaking capacity is already limited by the \ngrowth of entitlement spending. In 1963, a little more than 30 years \nago, spending on entitlements and interest on the national debt \nconsumed 30 percent of our Federal budget. This year, entitlements and \nnet interest will devour 65 percent. The present budget assumes 66 \npercent for next year and by 2000, the number will be 70 percent.\n  Mr. President, that is the problem that we face. That is why we are \nforced year after year after year to come and cut domestic \ndiscretionary programs, whether it is defense or nondefense. The \npressure is coming from entitlement programs that are consuming a \nlarger and larger percent of our budget inexorably by the year 2013, it \nwill be 100 percent, converting the Federal Government into an ATM \nmachine.\n  The result is a question of fairness between generations. Today there \nare roughly five workers paying taxes to support the taxes of each \nretiree. When my generation retires, there will be fewer than three \nworkers per retiree. Unless we take action now, the choice forced upon \nour children will be excruciating. Continue to fund benefits at current \nlevels by radically raising taxes on the working population or slash \nbenefits dramatically.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we debate this amendment, I hope we keep \nour eyes on a larger prize in blind reference to the idea of a balanced \nbudget. Our goals should, in my view, be economic prosperity. I support \ndeficit reduction as a means to that end. Deficit reduction is \nimportant not as an abstract ideal but as an economic comparative. I \nbelieve in balancing the budget because it is the surest and most \npowerful way to increase national savings. And increased national \nsavings will lead to increased national productivity which in turn will \nlead to higher standards of living for the American family.\n  There is no short cut to savings and no substitute that will get \nresults. Increased national savings mean lower long-term interest rates \nand increased job growth in the private sector. The balanced budget \namendment assumes that a balanced budget is always the best economic \npolicy. A balanced budget, Mr. President, is usually the best economic \nstrategy, but it is by no means always the best strategy for this \ncountry. Downward turns in the economy complicate the picture. Downward \nturns will result in lower revenues and higher spending so there will \nbe times, although very few of them, when a strict requirement for \nbalancing the budget harms the economy by requiring the collection of \nmore and more taxes to cover more and more spending in an economic \nenvironment which makes revenue collection more difficult in the first \nplace.\n  As I say, I believe those times are few and far between. But the \nConstitution is too blunt an instrument to distinguish between good \ntimes and bad. The American people hired us to do that job, not to cede \nit to a legal document that cannot assess the evolving needs of our \neconomy.\n  The bottom line for me as we debate this amendment is whether it \nmoves us toward achieving the correct goals and whether, if it does, we \nneed to amend the Constitution to get there.\n  My answer to the first question is mixed. I believe a balanced budget \nis an important goal, but only as a component of an overall economic \nstrategy which recognizes that skyrocketing entitlement spending is the \nmost serious fiscal challenge we face.\n  My answer to the second question is more certain. I believe that once \nwe set those goals, we can achieve them by statute or, more \nimportantly, by changing our own behavior rather than changing the \nConstitution. My respect for this document precludes me from voting to \ntamper with it when I am not convinced that we must. This proposal for \na 28th amendment does not command for me the same reverence in which I \nhold the 1st amendment or the 13th or the 19th and, therefore, Mr. \nPresident, while I will continue to fight for its admirable goal, I \nwill vote no on the balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to call up motion No. 3 at the desk and that it be \nconsidered as one of my relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I might, it \nis my understanding that there are two unanimous consent requests which \ndeal with two amendments of the Senator from Minnesota. I wonder if I \nmight make those requests and see if they are suitable to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, and we can proceed in that manner.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that will be fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be recognized to call up his motion dealing with homeless \nchildren; and that time prior to a motion to table be limited to the \nfollowing: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone; 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Hatch; and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the majority leader, or his \ndesignee, be recognized to table the Wellstone motion; and that that \nvote occur at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the Wellstone motion dealing with homeless \nchildren, Senator Wellstone be recognized to call up his filed motion \nNo. 2, and that time prior to a motion to table be limited to the \nfollowing: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone, 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Hatch, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time the majority leader or his designee \nbe recognized to make a motion to table the Wellstone motion, and that \nvote occur in the stacked sequence to begin at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                            Motion to refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nArizona and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me for my colleagues----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for just a moment \nwhile the clerk states the motion, please.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] moves to refer \n     House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee with \n     instructions to report back forthwith House Joint Resolution \n     1 in status quo and at the earliest date possible, to issue a \n     report, the text of which shall be as follows:\n       ``It is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     Congress should take no action which would increase the \n     number of hungry or homeless children.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. The motion is self-\nexplanatory, it is very reasonable, and it is very important.\n  What this motion says is not that we should delay the vote on the \nbalanced budget amendment. We will have that vote. This is not a part \nof that constitutional amendment at all. This is just simply a motion \nwhich says we will go on record through the Senate Budget Committee \nthat in whatever ways we move forward to balance the budget, whether \nthis constitutional amendment is passed or not --there is really no \nlinkage here--we will go on record, and I would like to again now go \nthrough the operative language, it is the sense of the Senate to the \nBudget Committee:\n\n       That in enacting the policy changes necessary to achieve \n     the more than $1 trillion in deficit reduction necessary to \n     achieve a balanced budget, Congress should take no action \n     which would increase the number of hungry or homeless \n     children.\n\n  [[Page S2998]] That is what this motion says. One more time, it is \nnot an amendment to this constitutional amendment. It does not put off \nthe date that we vote on this amendment. I simply ask that the Senate \ngo on record through the Budget Committee that if this amendment passes \nor even if this amendment does not pass, we will take no action which \nwould increase the number of hungry or homeless children.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Chamber from the beginning of this \nsession with just this amendment which has received, I think, 43 votes. \nI do not understand why the Senate is not willing to go on record on \nthis question.\n  Mr. President, this motion is essentially a statement by the Senate; \nit is a request to colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, that we \nspeak boldly and we speak directly, as we understand children are the \nmost vulnerable citizens in this country.\n  Every time I hear one of my colleagues talk about how we have to \nreduce the deficit--and by the way, sometimes people get confused \nbetween annual deficit and this huge debt we have built up--and that we \ncannot put this deficit on the shoulders of our children and our \ngrandchildren, the best thing we can do for the children of our Nation \nis to balance the budget, I say to myself, fine, I agree. I am a \nfather. I am a grandfather. But what about the vulnerable children in \nthe United States of America today?\n  Why cannot the Senate go on record--it is a sense of the Senate--that \nwe certainly understand as we go forward with deficit reduction we will \nnot do anything which would increase hunger or homelessness among \nchildren in our Nation. Is that too much to ask? What possibly could be \nthe reason for voting no?\n  Senators are talking about how we have to balance the budget for the \nsake of the children of the future. How about the lives of children \nliving now? How about children right now who happen to be among the \nmost vulnerable group in this Nation?\n  The context is important. The Food Research and Action Center in 1991 \nestimated that 5.5 million children under 12 years of age are hungry at \nleast one day a month in the United States of America. Second Harvest \nestimated that, in 1993, emergency food programs served 10,798,375 \nchildren. The U.S. Council of Mayors found that, in 1994, 64 percent of \nthe persons receiving food assistance were from families with children. \nCarnegie Foundation, late 1980's--68 percent of public schoolteachers \nreported that undernourished children and youth are a problem in \nschool. By the way, I talk to teachers in Minnesota who tell me the \nsame thing.\n  Children are among the homeless in this country and indeed families \nwith children are a substantial segment of the homeless population. The \nU.S. Council of Mayors estimates that, in 1994, 26 percent of the \nhomeless were children, based upon requests from emergency shelters. \nThat is a pretty large percentage of the homeless population. And, in \n1988, the Institute of Medicine estimated that 100,000 children are \nhomeless each day.\n  Mr. President, what does it mean that children are hungry? In \ncomparison to nonhungry children, hungry children are more than three \ntimes likely to suffer from unwanted weight loss, more than four times \nas likely to suffer from fatigue, almost three times as likely to \nsuffer from irritability, and more than 12 times as likely to report \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, let me discuss the context one more time. I have been \nin this Chamber from the beginning of this session with this basic \nproposition, either in amendment form, or now, in the most reasonable \nform possible; as just a motion, a sense of the Senate that would go to \nthe Budget Committee. It is not a part of the constitutional amendment. \nThis motion merely has us going on record that as we move toward a \nbalanced budget, which we are all for as well as deficit reduction, we \nare not going to take any action that would increase the number of \nhungry or homeless children in America. Will the Senate not go on \nrecord supporting this?\n  I hear Senators say that they are going to make these cuts; that is \nthe best thing they can do for our children and our grandchildren. What \nabout these children? One out of every four children in America is \npoor.\n  Children's Defense Fund came out with a study last year--this data is \naccurate and I wish it was not. I wish this was not the reality. One \nday in the life of American children, three children die from child \nabuse. One day in the life of American children, nine children are \nmurdered. One day in the life of American children, 13 children die \nfrom guns. One day in the life of American children, 27 children, a \nclassroomful, die from poverty. One day in the life of American \nchildren, 63 babies die before they are 1 month old. One day in the \nlife of American children, 101 babies die before their first birthday. \nOne day in the life of American children, 145 babies are born at very \nlow birthweight, less than 5.5 pounds--yet the House of Representatives \nyesterday voted to block grant and cut Women, Infants and Children \nprograms. Cut nutrition programs--that was the vote in the House \nyesterday.\n  One day in the life of American children, 636 babies are born to \nwomen who had late or no prenatal care. One day in the life of American \nchildren, 1,234 children run away from home.\n One day in the life of American children, 2,868 babies are born into \npoverty. One day in the life of American children, 7,945 children are \nreported abused or neglected. One day in the life of American children, \n100,000 children are homeless.\n\n  I hope my colleagues are not bored by these statistics. These are \nreal people. These are children in the United States of America. These \nchildren, all of these children, are our children.\n  Moments in America for children? Every 35 seconds a child drops out \nof school in America. Every 30 seconds, a child is born into poverty, \nevery 30 seconds a child is born into poverty. Every 2 minutes a child \nis born low birth weight. Every 2 minutes a child is born to a woman \nwho had no prenatal care. Every 4 minutes a child is arrested for \nalcohol-related crime. Every 7 minutes a child is arrested for drug-\nrelated crime. I have given this figure before: Every 2 hours a child \nis murdered and every 4 hours a child takes his or her life in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, I received a letter from Ona. I do not use last names \nbecause I never know whether citizens want to have their names used or \nnot. Ona is 8.\n\n       My name is Ona and I go to public school and I'm 8. My \n     class has 26 kids in it and only three of them, Iman, Jasmin, \n     and me bring lunches to school. Twenty-three kids in my class \n     depend on the school lunch and now you want to cut those \n     programs. Which do you think is more important, cutting the \n     debt or having poor helpless children having nothing to eat? \n     Senator, that's not right because almost my entire class \n     depends on school breakfast and school lunch, and if you cut \n     these programs they will starve. How do they explain to a \n     starving child, oh, we are cutting the debt. It will be good \n     for you.\n\n  She is 8 years old. How come my colleagues do not get this?\n\n       How do they explain to a starving child, oh, we are cutting \n     the debt. It will be good for you. Life is already hard \n     enough for us with pollution, crime and disease. I hope you \n     change your mind.\n\n  Ona, you do not have to ask me to change my mind. And she is so \nright.\n  Some of my colleagues say this is just a scare tactic. Prove me \nwrong. I will give you a chance at 3 o'clock today to prove me wrong. \n``This is just a scare tactic.'' Who is kidding whom? Look at the \nheadlines:\n  ``House Panels Vote Social Funding Cuts.''\n  ``Republicans Trim Nutrition, Housing.''\n  Washington Post, front page story:\n\n       House Republicans, wielding their budget-cutting axes more \n     forcefully than at any time since taking power, yesterday \n     proposed slashing some $5.2 billion of spending approved by \n     previous Democratic Congresses * * *.\n       Included in the lengthy list of cuts voted out by five \n     appropriations subcommittees during a hectic day of meetings \n     were rural housing loans, nutrition programs for children and \n     pregnant women * * *.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       * * * nutrition programs for children and pregnant women, \n     spending on urban parks, and assistance to the poor and \n     elderly for protecting their homes against the cold.\n\n  That is right. They want to eliminate LIHEAP, Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. I have spent time with families in Minnesota--it is \na cold weather State--who depend on \n[[Page S2999]] LIHEAP. You are going to cut their energy assistance so \nthey have a choice between heat or eat?\n  It is time to get a little bit more real with people in this country \nabout what this agenda translates into. Another headline, ``House Panel \nMoves To Cut Federal Child Care, School Lunch Funds.'' Washington Post, \nThursday, February 23, 1995.\n  I have been saying that this would happen from the beginning of the \nsession and I have had people on the other side of the aisle say we are \nnot going to do that. ``We care as much about children as you do.'' \nProve me wrong. You get a chance to vote on this today.\n  The article reads:\n\n       After a full day of beating back Democratic amendments to \n     restore the programs or soften their impact on welfare \n     recipients, Chairman William Goodling said his committee will \n     complete work today on a bill that will abolish the school \n     breakfast, lunch and other nutrition programs for women and \n     children and replace them with a block grant to the States.\n       The Republican measure would freeze the amount of money \n     given to States for child care at $1.94 billion a year, the \n     current level. Representative George Miller [who is right] \n     charged that because the number of needy children is expected \n     to increase, the freeze would cut off child payments for more \n     than 377,000 children in the year 2000.\n       By contrast, funding for the school lunch and nutrition \n     programs would be allowed to grow by $1.87 billion over 5 \n     years. But committee Democrats said this was grossly \n     inadequate and would fall $5 to $7 billion short of what is \n     needed.\n\n  It is block granted but it is bait and switch. It is block granted \nwith cuts and, in addition, it is no longer an entitlement. So during \nmore difficult times such as recession, if there are additional \nchildren who now need the assistance, those who are receiving \nassistance will have their assistance cut or some will be cut off the \nsupport. It is simple.\n  ``House Moves To Cut Federal Child Care, School Lunch Funds.''\n  ``House Panels Vote Social Funding Cuts, Republicans Trim Nutrition, \nHousing.''\n  Including the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  I have had some colleagues say to me this is just a scare tactic. But \nit is not. Because this is precisely where the cuts are taking place.\n  Mr. President, may I have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend until the Sergeant at \nArms has restored order in the galleries, please.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish that I did not have to come to the floor with \nthis motion.\n  I wish that this was not real. But the evidence is crystal clear. All \nyou have to do is look at the state of children in America today. They \nare the most vulnerable citizens, the most poor. I am just saying to my \ncolleague, can we not go on record that we are not going to pass any \nlegislation or make any cuts that will increase hunger among children?\n  Then I look at what has happened on the House side. They are cutting \nnutrition programs--cutting nutrition programs--the very thing that my \ncolleagues over here said we will not do. And what people now say is do \nnot worry about the House. The U.S. Senate is a different body, and it \nis. We are more deliberative. We do not ram things through. We are more \ncareful. But now what I have to say to some of my colleagues is two or \nthree times I have come to this floor and asked you to please go on \nrecord that we will not do anything that would increase hunger or \nhomelessness among children. And each time, you voted no.\n  Mr. President, The Children's Defense Fund that reported on where \nthis balanced budget amendment will take us--I do not have the chart I \nusually have with me. But, roughly speaking, if you include in this \npackage the baseline CBO projections plus tax cuts, which do not make a \nlot of sense when you are trying to do deficit reduction, broad-based \ntax cuts, plus increases in the Pentagon budget, it is about $1.3 \ntrillion that needs to be cut between now and the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, if Social Security is off the table--and it should \nbe--if you are going to have to pay the interest on the debt and if \nmilitary spending is going up, then it is pretty clear what is left. \nWhen you look at what has been taken off the table and what has been \nleft on the table, it is crystal clear that you are going to have to \nhave, about 30-percent cuts across the board. It may be that veterans \nprograms will not be cut 30 percent. I hope not. But you basically have \nhigher education; you have Medicare and Medicaid; you have veterans; \nand you have these low-income children's programs.\n  Yesterday in the House, they are talking about cutting the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, and the school lunch program. They are \ntalking about eliminating the low-income energy assistance program. \nThat is for low-income people in cold-weather States like Minnesota. I \nvisited with those families. These issues are real to them.\n  But when Senator Feingold and I came out on the floor of the Senate \nlast week, and we had a very reasonable motion, that the Senate would \ngo on record through the Budget Committee that we will consider $425 \nbillion of tax expenditures, many of them loopholes, deductions and \noutright dodges for the largest corporations and financial institutions \nin America, they voted it down.\n  So I understand what the Children's Defense Fund understands, that on \npresent legislative course, this is where we are heading: By year 2002, \n7.5 million children lose federally subsidized lunches, 6.6 million \nchildren lose their health care through Medicaid, 3 million children \nlose food stamps, and 2 million young children and mothers lose \nnutritional assistance through the WIC program. This is a very \ndestructive way to ensure that our children are not burdened by debt.\n  May I repeat that? This is a very destructive way of assuring that \nour children will not be burdened by debt, to cut into the very \nnutrition programs that benefit children right now who are so \nvulnerable in the United States of America, all for the sake of making \nsure that our children in the future are not burdened by debt.\n  I wish my colleagues were as concerned about the children right now \nas they are about the children in the future.\n  Mr. President, I might ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has approximately \n20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah is interested in responding, \nthen I will yield the floor for a moment and reserve the rest of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be \nrecognized to call up his amendment No. 301 following the remarks of \nSenator Hollings today, and that time prior to a motion to table be \nlimited to the following: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd, \n30 minutes under the control of Senator Hatch, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time, the majority leader or his \ndesignee be recognized to make a motion to table the Byrd amendment, \nand that vote occur in the stacked sequence beginning at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, we are now--let me take a few minutes--in our 25th day \nsince this amendment was brought to the floor. Twenty-five days have \nexpired since we started debating the balanced budget amendment. As you \ncan see, I have added one more day, the 25th. This red line all the way \nfrom there over to here happens to be the baseline of $4.8 trillion, \nwhich is our national debt. It is $18,500 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America, plus it is going up every day. Each day that we have \ndebated this balanced budget amendment, I just want the American people \nto understand that our national debt has gone up $829 billion. We are \nnow in the 25th day, and our national debt has been increased since we \nbegan this debate $2.736 billion.\n  I do not care who you are. You have to draw the analogy between Rome \n[[Page S3000]] under Nero, as he fiddled while Rome burned. \nFortunately, we do have a vote next Tuesday. We will decide this one \nway or the other, whether we are going to put a mechanism into the \nConstitution that will force Members of Congress to at least look at \nthese details and do something about it. We will make it more difficult \nfor them to spend more and to take more. It does not stop them, but it \ncertainly makes it more difficult.\n  What I have to say is that predicted opponents of the balanced budget \namendment are trotting out a series of sympathetic Government \nbeneficiaries and attempting either to exempt them from the balanced \nbudget amendment or use them to argue against not just the amendment \nbut indeed against balancing the budget at all.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator understands that this is a motion. It is \nnot an amendment to the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nThis has no linkage. This is simply a sense-of-the-Senate to the Budget \nCommittee that when it comes to balancing the budget, we will go on \nrecord that we will not increase the number of hungry and homeless \nchildren. That is all this motion says.\n  The Senator speaks to that, and that is why I asked the question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. This motion, in my opinion, is just another \nin a parade of exemptions which the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment have tried to tack on. I know the Senator is sincere. I have \nworked with him ever since he has been here. He has a great deal of \nsincerity with regard to the people who are in difficulty and have \ndifficulty, and especially the homeless. But I think, in that sense, it \nis just as inappropriate as the other motions that have been brought to \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, does the Senator understand that this \nis not an amendment to the constitutional amendment and, in that sense, \nit is not an exemption? It just simply asks us to go on record, through \nthe Budget Committee, that we will not do anything that would increase \nmore hunger or homelessness among children. Does the Senator understand \nthat?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is all I am asking.\n  Could the Senator tell me, does the Senator know, during this period \nof time, how many more hungry or homeless children there have been in \nthe United States of America?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think anybody fully knows.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But is it not interesting that we do not know what we \ndo not want to know. Why do we not know?\n  Mr. HATCH. I disagree with the Senator that I do not want to know. I \nthink the Senator knows my whole career has been spent helping those \nwho are less fortunate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator does. I certainly do understand that. That \nis why I asked the Senator from Utah, who is probably one of the \nSenators I consider to be a really good friend.\n  Let me ask the Senator, why is this an unreasonable proposition, \ngiven the headline ``Republicans Trim Nutrition, Housing,'' what is \ngoing on on the House side right now, and given the fear of so many of \nthe people that are working down in the trenches with children, that we \nboth admire, about where these cuts are going to take place?\n  This is not an amendment to the constitutional amendment. This is \njust a sense of the Senate. Why is it so unreasonable, since we will \nhave the vote on Tuesday--no more delay--why is it so unreasonable for \nme to ask the Senate to go on record that we will not make any cuts \nthat will increase hunger or homelessness among children? Why does the \nSenator from Utah not support this, since he cares about this certainly \nas much as I do, and others?\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me try to answer the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Founders gave Congress the power to spend money. \nThey did not go on record as being opposed to action which would \nincrease the number of homeless children or any other budget policy \nissue. They understood that the Constitution establishes the processes \nand the procedures under which our Government operates or would operate \nfrom that point on. Which policy choices may be made under those \nprocedures do not belong in the discussion of the great principles of \nour Constitution.\n  We are talking about a constitutional amendment that could save our \ncountry, because our country, as we can easily see, is going more and \nmore into debt to the point where interest against the national debt is \nnow consuming 50 percent of all personal income taxes paid every year.\n  Now, I know my colleague is concerned about the homeless--so am I--\nand so many others, from child care right on through to people with \nAIDS.\n  I testified yesterday in favor of the Kennedy-Hatch Ryan White bill, \nwhich, of course, provides money for the cities with hardcore AIDS \nproblems. So I feel very deeply about these issues.\n  But I feel very deeply that those moneys are not going to be there if \nwe keep running this country into bankruptcy. And if we think we have \nhomeless people now, wait until you see what happens as that interest \nkeeps going to the point where it consumes all of our personal income \ntaxes. It is now consuming half of the personal income taxes paid in \nAmerica today. We are going up, as this balanced budget amendment debt \ntracker shows, as this debate continues. We are already up to $20 \nbillion, almost $21 billion, in the 25 days that we have debated this \namendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am concerned about it. Of course, we will do \nwhat we think is best for the children of America and for the homeless \nof America. But the least thing we can do for them is to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment so they have a future, so that Members of \nCongress, most of whom are altruistic and want to do good for people, \nhave to live within certain means, have to live within the means of \nthis country.\n  You know, if you think about it, if we pass the balanced budget \namendment, then I think we will have an answer to the question why a \nchild born today will pay an extra $100,000 in taxes over his or her \nlifetime for the debt that is being projected to accumulate in just the \nfirst 18 years of that child's life. And there will be another $5,000 \nin taxes for every additional $200 billion deficit.\n  Mr. President, our President has sent us a budget that for the next \n12 years projects $200 billion deficits a year. That is billion, with a \n``b.'' Every year that happens, these children's taxes will go up \n$5,000 more. They will become more tax debt owing, $5,000 more for each \nyear there is a $200 billion deficit. So if it is 12 years, that is \n$60,000 more on top of the current $100,000 they are going to be \nsaddled with because of the way we have been handling situations.\n  Mr. President, most Government programs have beneficiaries with some \npolitical popularity or power or attractiveness. And that is why they \nreceive benefits in the first place. But this kind of thinking, that we \nshould spend for these worthy beneficiaries whether we have the money \nor not, is precisely why we have the colossal national debt that we do.\n  And I am just pointing to the balanced budget amendment debt tracker, \nwhich just shows the 25 days of increased debt, $21 billion so far.\n  The power of the tax spenders has always been built on appealing to \nan attractive, narrow interest and that power has always outweighed the \nmore diffused interest of the taxpayers and of our children, who cannot \nyet vote whose moneys we are spending in advance.\n  Mr. President, this is business as usual, and it is what the balanced \nbudget amendment is designed to end. The purpose of the balanced budget \namendment is to ensure that Congress takes into account increased \ntaxes, stagnant wages, higher interest rates, and the insurmountable \ndebt that we will leave to our children if we keep spending the money \nthat we do not have.\n  [[Page S3001]] The parade of special interest groups embodied by so \nmany of the amendments which have been offered against this balanced \nbudget amendment, including this one, is to take the focus off our \nchildren's future and put it on the short-term interest of another, \nperhaps worthy, special interest group. There are thousands of special \ninterest groups in our country. I wish we had enough money to take care \nof all of them and to do it in a way that would give them dignity and \nwould help them to find their own way, would empower them to be able to \nmake something of their lives. There is no question that all of us want \nto do that.\n  But we are never going to do it--we are going to have more homeless, \nwe are going to have more children bereft of what they need, we are \ngoing to have less of a future for them--if we do not pass this \nbalanced budget amendment and get this spending under control.\n  Make no mistake, those who keep bringing up these amendments for \nspecial interest groups, who are needy and whom we all want to help, in \norder to kill this amendment by 1,000 cuts, I think their efforts ought \nto be rejected. And that does not mean that they are not sincere or \nthey are not good people or they are not trying to do their best.\n  I find no fault with my friend from Minnesota in worrying about those \nwho are homeless. I do, too. But if we are really worried about them, \nthen let us get this country's spending practices under control so that \nthis country's economy is strong so we can help them. I am willing to \ndo that, and I have a reputation around here for trying.\n  I think the Senate should get on with its business of weighing each \nof the interests presented to make choices among all the worthy \nprograms within the constraints of the revenues we are willing to \nraise, like reasonable economic actors.\n  Our problem today is, because we do not have a balanced budget \namendment, people do not care how much they spend of the future of our \nchildren. They can feel very good towards themselves that they are \ncompassionate and considerate of those who need help. But what they do \nnot tell is the other side of that coin--that all of us are going to \nneed help in the future if this country's economy becomes less than \nwhat it is, and it has no other way to go if we do not start getting \nour spending under control.\n  So I suggest that, in spite of the sincerity of my friend from \nMinnesota, we vote down this amendment, as we have had to do, in order \nto preserve this concept of a balanced budget in the Constitution.\n  This is our last chance. This is the first time in history, the first \ntime in history, that the House of Representatives has had the guts, as \na collective body, to get a two-thirds vote--which is very, very \ndifficult to do--to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  The reason they have is because of the budget-courageous Democrats \nand Republicans who decided the country is more important than any \nspecial interest. And that we have to get the country under control and \nspending practices under control if we are really going to help the \nspecial interests, many of whom are worthy interests.\n  On the one hand, I commend the distinguished Senator for his \ncompassion and his desire to help people. On the other hand, I have \ndifficulties with those who have brought up these amendments because \nevery one of these amendments would make the balanced budget amendment \nless important.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I find the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Utah to be very important. I want to come back to a couple of \nbasic points because I really believe that the vote on this motion is a \nreal moment of truth here.\n  First of all, Mr. President, this is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. That is not what they \nare voting on.\n  This motion just says that we go on record we will not take any \naction which will increase the number of hungry or homeless children. \nIt is that simple. I did not say we should balance the budget. I did \nnot say we should not have serious deficit reduction. We have to make \nchoices. It is a question of whether there is a standard of fairness. I \nwant the Senate to go on record.\n  Second of all, Mr. President, my colleague from Utah talked all about \nthe Constitution, and therefore this is no place for a discussion of \nhunger and homelessness among children, because it is a different order \nof question. I might remind my colleague that the Preamble of the \nConstitution says: ``We, the people of the United States, in Order to \nform a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \nTranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general \nWelfare.'' I would think that children are a part of how we promote the \ngeneral welfare. Do not tell me that being on the floor of the Senate \nand talking about children does not have anything to do with the \nfounding documents of our Nation. We talk about promoting the general \nwelfare, I assume that includes children.\n  The third point, Mr. President, I heard my colleague use the words \n``special interest'' more than once. Children are special interests. We \nare all for the future, and we are all talking about we want to make \nsure that our children and grandchildren do not have to carry this \ndebt. How about the children now?\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not have such a fancy chart but the facts \nremain. Every 5 seconds a student drops out of school; every 30 \nseconds, a baby is born into poverty; every 2 minutes a baby is born at \nlow birthweight; every 2 minutes a baby is born to a mother who had no \nprenatal care; every 4 minutes a child is arrested for an alcohol-\nrelated crime; every 5 minutes a child is arrested for a violent crime; \nevery 7 minutes a child is arrested for a drug crime; every 2 hours a \nchild is murdered; every 4 hours a child commits suicide.\n  I spoke about 100,000 homeless and 5 million hungry children earlier.\n  I hear my colleague talking about our generosity. We cannot talk \nabout our generosity. We have abandoned many children in the United \nStates of America. I might add we devalued the work of many adults that \nwork with those children. That is what these statistics say. And now, \nrather than investing more in our children, we are cutting programs.\n  Three children die from child abuse; 1 day, 9 children are murdered; \n1 day, 63 babies die before they are one month old; 1 day, 101 babies \ndie before their first birthday; 1 day, 145 babies are born at very low \nbirthweight. And I can go on and on.\n  Mr. President, why do we not juxtapose these figures, these \nstatistics about children in America today, with the headlines in the \nWashington Post, ``House Panels Vote Special Funding Cuts, Republicans \nTrim Nutrition, Housing''; ``House Panel Moves To Cut Federal Child \nCare, School Lunch Funds.'' I do not really think my colleagues can \nhave it both ways.\n  Let me get right down to the essence of this motion. We have these \nfigures. We have the Children's Defense Fund which has been the \norganization most down in the trenches with children. I have State-by-\nState variations. I could read from every State--Idaho, Minnesota, \nUtah--about the projected cuts, because we know there will be cuts in \nthese programs. We have to cut somewhere.\n  Now, I came on to the floor of the Senate during the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and I had an amendment that came from Minnesota \nthat essentially said before we send the balanced budget amendment to \nthe States, let Senators lay out where we will be making the cuts. It \nwas voted down. The minority leader, Senator Daschle, had a similar \namendment. It was voted down.\n  My colleagues will not specify where they will make the cuts, but \nwhen Senator Feingold and I said how about oil company subsidies, \npharmaceutical subsidies, or $425 billion in tax holes, loopholes, \ndeductions, and sometimes outright dodges, would we consider that in \nhow we would balance the budget? No. That was the vote.\n   My colleague from Utah says we have to make difficult choices. That \nis true. I am for cutting the Pentagon budget. I do not think military \ncontractors are in a position where they cannot afford to tighten their \nbelt. They are not being asked to tighten their belt. Nor \n[[Page S3002]] are we going after tax dodges and loopholes and \ndeductions, and we have a bidding war on tax cuts. So there we have \n$1.3 trillion. We will not specify where we make the cuts, but we know \nwhat is left.\n  I am saying to my colleagues, we cannot have it both ways. Do not, \none more time on the floor of the U.S. Senate, say to me or say to \nchildren in this country, that this is just a scare tactic. I wish it \nwere just a scare tactic. Or this is just a political strategy to get \npeople on record.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues is, is it too much to ask that we \ngo on record saying to our Budget Committee, as we go forward with \ndeficit reduction and as we go forward to balancing the budget which we \nare all for one way or the other, we go on record, we are not going to \ndo anything that will increase hunger, homelessness among children? \nKnow why my colleagues will not vote for this Mr. President? Because \nthat is what we are going to do.\n  The reason my colleagues will not vote for this is because that is \nprecisely what we are going to do.\n  I do not understand for the life of me why I cannot get the U.S. \nSenate on record on this very fundamental basic question. We cannot go \nforward with deficit reduction. I do not want to let colleagues say he \nis just doing this motion because he is not in favor of deficit \nreduction. That is not true. I voted for huge deficit reduction. I want \nto see all sorts of cuts. I would like to see the oil companies tighten \ntheir belt. I do not hear anything about that. But, no, I do not want \nto see the most vulnerable citizens being hurt.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a couple of colleagues talk about the \nlast election.\n And the people voted for change. People voted for change, but not this \nkind of change. There is too much goodness in the United States of \nAmerica to cut nutrition programs and school lunch programs and child \ncare programs, all in the name of deficit reduction. That is not where \npeople in the United States of America want to see the cuts. My \ncolleagues need to understand that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I come out here determined because I have a real \nsense of trepidation. I know what is going to happen with these \nprograms. I know the majority leader was out on the floor saying we \ncare as much about children as the Senator from Minnesota. I know my \ncolleague from Utah says that.\n  I now say prove me wrong. Prove now this afternoon that this is just \na scare tactic. I want to be wrong. Prove this afternoon that this is \njust some political strategy. Let us go on record, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that we are serious about deficit reduction, we are \nserious about balancing the budget, because I think we all are. And \nwhat we are going to do is go on record this afternoon, not with an \namendment to this constitutional amendment--that is not what this is. \nThis is just simply a motion to go on record that when we make these \ncuts, we are not going to do anything to increase hunger or \nhomelessness among children. I do not understand why I cannot get 100 \nvotes for it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah is finished \nwith his remarks, I will be pleased to yield him some of my time if he \nneeds it, or I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to agree to that, to yield back time on \nboth sides. And then the votes are to be stacked, as I understand it, \nbeginning at 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled to occur at 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to table and ask \nfor the yeas and nays with the understanding that the vote not occur \nuntil 3, or should we just wait until then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First we must announce the result of the \nrequest for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays, with the understanding that it will not be voted \nupon until 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur beginning at 3 o'clock \ntoday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For a few moments, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next \namendment, let me just say a few words about the impact of the deficit \non the average American.\n  We need to stop talking and start working on getting our fiscal house \nin order by passing the balanced budget amendment and working together \nto balance the budget.\n  The American people want and need us to do this. Our large national \ndebts and the yearly deficits that help it grow hurt real people, \naverage working people all over the country--everybody. Continuing down \nthe path we are on will only make matters worse for all of us and all \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  Recently, the Washington Post ran an article by James Glassman, who I \nbelieve did an excellent job of stating in an understandable way how \nand why the deficit hurts the average working American. He called his \ndiscussion the ``Plain English Guide to the Federal Budget,'' and it \nbegan with the sage assertion that ``big deficits can make you poor.''\n  That is it in a nutshell, Mr. President. For all of those of you who \nare listening to the debate, you should know this and tell your \nSenators that you want them to pass the balanced budget amendment to \nstop making you poor. ``Big deficits can make you poor.'' Mr. Glassman \nexplained, ``they tend to retard the growth of the private sector, \nraise interest rates, and weaken our economy.''\n  That is exactly why we need the balanced budget amendment, because \nCongress' fiscal madness is destroying the ability of the working \nAmerican to make enough money to survive.\n  Every year, hard-working Americans pay the price for our profligacy. \nThe tax foundation has calculated that in 1994, the average American \nworked from January 1 to May 5 just to pay his or her taxes. They did \nnot get to keep 1 cent of the money they earned until May 6. Put \nanother way, in an 8-hour work day, the average American works the \nfirst 2 hours 45 minutes just to pay his or her taxes. This is bad \nenough but that is not the end of the story.\n  The increasing Federal debt will force us to raise taxes to \nastronomical rates just to keep the country solvent. The National \nTaxpayers Union has estimated that a child born today will pay on \naverage $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or her lifetime \njust to pay for the interest on the national debt which accumulates \nduring the first 18 years of that child's life. Just think, by the time \na child becomes old enough to vote, there will already be a $100,000 \ntax bill looming on his or her horizon if we do not get it under \ncontrol, and that is only to pay the interest on the debt accumulated \nin that child's first 18 years.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has also determined that for every year \nwe endure another $200 billion deficit, it costs the average child over \n$5,000 in additional taxes over his or her lifetime--every year we do \nthat.\n Mr. President, the budget submitted by President Clinton, as I have \nsaid earlier, projects $200 billion deficits for each of the next 5 \nyears, actually each of the next 12 years. By conceding defeat on \ndeficit reduction, President Clinton is condemning every child in \nAmerica just over the next 5 years to an additional $25,000 in extra \ntaxes--in that child's next 5 years.\n\n  When a child born this year is 10 years old, in fiscal year 2005, the \nCBO's conservative projections show that the \n[[Page S3003]] deficit will top $400 billion, more than twice today's \nlevels. That year alone, this child will be socked with a $10,000 tax \nbill just to pay interest on the deficit--that year alone. The debt \nwill reach nearly $6.8 trillion or 58 percent of our GDP. Now, that is \nthe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, Economic and Budget Outlook \nfor fiscal year 1996 to the year 2000.\n  But the bad news about the debt does not end there either. The \nCompetitiveness Policy Council has shown that the rising budget \ndeficits have led to a 15 percent decline in real wages in the last 15 \nyears, and the National Taxpayers Union has further calculated that in \nthe next 45 years, unless we get our spending under control, after-tax \nincomes will rise over the total 45 years by a cumulative meager $125. \nThat is all we will gain over 45 years is another $125.\n  Mr. President, these deficits are strangling middle-class Americans \nthroughout our country. How can people be expected to bear the burden \nof stagnating wages and higher tax bills and rates? We simply cannot \ncontinue blindly down this road to economic oblivion.\n  Why act now? Why? Because so much is riding on our vote. Next \nTuesday, this is going to be the most important vote in the eyes of \nmany in this century.\n  If we do not act, just think of the fate we are leaving to our future \ngenerations. As Senator Daschle said last Congress when he voted in \nfavor of the balanced budget amendment, ``We are leaving a legacy of \ndebt for our children and grandchildren.''\n  Every child born in America today comes into this world, as I have \nsaid, over $18,500 in debt. That is what they are born with, and that \nis growing.\n  In President Clinton's fiscal year 1995 budget, it was estimated that \nfor children born in 1993, the lifetime net tax rate will be 82 \npercent. The net tax rate is the estimate of taxes paid to the \nGovernment less transfers received, if the Government's total spending \nis not reduced from its projected path and if we do not pay more than \nprojected. The 82-percent figure for our children stands in stark \ncontrast to the 29 percent net tax rate for the generations of \nAmericans born in the 1920's and the 34.4-percent net tax rate for the \ngeneration born in the 1960's. Now, that comes right out of the Clinton \nadministration 1995 budget generational forecasting. That is this \nadministration.\n  It took our Nation 205 years, from 1776 to 1981, to reach a $1 \ntrillion national debt. It took only 11 years to quadruple that figure. \nToday, the national debt stands at more than $4.8 trillion. Citizens of \nother nations, like Argentina, Canada and Italy, have faced stagnant \nand lower living standards when their governments ran up huge debts. \nOur future generations face higher interest rates, less affordable \nhousing, fewer jobs, lower wages, and a loss of economic sovereignty.\n  Now, we must get Government spending under control. The only way to \ndo that is to change the way Congress does business with a permanent \nunavoidable rule. That rule will be the balanced budget amendment that \nwe are debating here--bipartisan consensus, Democrat-Republican \namendment. It will force Congress to consider the costs as well as the \nbenefits of every program in the Federal Government. We will lower the \nunbelievable amount of Government spending and bring the deficit under \ncontrol.\n  All other attempts to balance the budget have failed and failed \nmiserably. We went through all of the statutes that we have tried to \nuse. Every one of them has failed. Every year the debt grows \nrelentlessly, sapping the life out of the American economy as it does. \nUnder the President's latest plan, the debt will grow another $1 \ntrillion in the next 5 years. This is not an attempt to reduce the \ndeficit. It is a recognition that unless we change the budget process \nto eliminate Congress' spending bias, it is impossible to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, we now have the opportunity to make a historic change. \nWe can pass the balanced budget amendment and preserve the future for \nour children, our grandchildren, and this country. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the balanced budget amendment so that we and our \nchildren will have a prosperous tomorrow. As we have said, every day \nwhile we talk about the debt, we leave our children and our \ngrandchildren in debt a shocking amount, $829 million each day. This \nmust end and it must end soon.\n  Mr. President, let us stop talking and start acting to bring this \ncountry to fiscal sanity. Let us pass the balanced budget amendment and \nsend it to the States for ratification and get along on this business \nof balancing the budget.\n  In just the 25 days we have been debating this amendment, our \nnational debt has gone up almost $21 billion, and it is going up every \nday right on through February 28. I am hoping there will be a \nliberation day February 28 when this balanced budget amendment passes, \nand it will be the beginning of liberation and freedom, more freedom \nthan ever before because it will mean that Congress will have to get \nspending under control and live within its means over a period of time. \nThis balanced budget amendment will be the mechanism by which we will \nget Congress to do that which it should have been doing all of these \nyears.\n  We have only balanced the budget once in the last 36 years, and I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that this is our time to really strike out and \ndo what is right and liberate Americans from the crushing burden of \nnational debt and these deficits that occur every year.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Minnesota is prepared to go \nahead, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will shortly call up my motion. I, \nfirst of all, just want, in the debate time we have, to respond to some \nof the words of my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. President, as far as liberating the people of this country, we \nhave, roughly speaking, a CBO baseline of $1 trillion plus we have to \ncut to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. Then for reasons that \nescape me, there have been proposals to raise the military budget by \nsome $82 billion over 5 years plus--not cut, increase. Then in \naddition--all of it has to do with, I guess, political popularity--\nthere has been a bidding war on tax cuts. So what we are saying to \npeople is we are going to balance the budget by 2002, but we are going \nto increase the Pentagon budget and, by the way, one of the ways we can \nbalance the budget is by cutting your taxes more.\n  That is pretty amazing. But, by the way, Mr. President, this is a \nfoolproof formula for political success in the very short term. That is \nto say, we can say to people in the country, ``We call on you to \nsacrifice. What we would like for you to sacrifice by way of deficit \nreduction is to let us cut your taxes further.'' It is not surprising \npeople say we would be pleased to make that sacrifice. Of course it \ndoes not work out that way. That adds to the deficit.\n  So when I hear my colleague talk about liberating people, I want to \nbe clear. This is the credibility gap. We have heard on the other side \nof the aisle, roughly speaking, about $277 billion of budget cuts, to \nreach $1.481 trillion worth of cuts. That is a pretty huge credibility \ngap. Over and over again some of us have tried to get everybody to be \nhonest and straightforward about where these cuts are going to take \nplace. For a while at least a good many of us talked about how our \nState legislatures should know what cuts are going to be made. I was on \nthe floor with a resolution that came from my State. The State wanted \nto know how these cuts would impact Minnesota. We talked about: \nLegislatures should know, people in the country should know. But we do \nnot know. We are voting for this balanced budget amendment without our \nown Budget Committee laying out any kind of projections.\n  The reason I mention all this is that people may agree in the \nabstract but not in the specifics. For example, we have no separation \nof capital budget from operating budget. My family does not cash flow \nour mortgage. We do not cash flow the car we buy. Families separate \ncapital budgets from operating budgets. Over 40 legislatures do but we \ndo not.\n  Then in addition we were not willing to specify where the cuts would \ntake place. We were not willing to take Social Security off the table \nin terms of what might be considered deficit reduction. And we are \ngoing to raise the \n[[Page S3004]] Pentagon budget. And we are going to have tax cuts. And \nwe do not want to touch any of the subsidies that go to large oil \ncompanies or all the rest.\n  We will see whether people feel liberated. I guess the way we are \ngoing to get from $277 billion to $1.481 trillion is to cut Federal \nchild care, school lunch programs, and to cut child nutrition programs. \nBy the way, that is not what people in the country are for. There are a \nwhole lot of other choices we can make instead. So I just want to \nremind my colleagues I think it is not so simple as it seems.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I now call up my motion No. 2, which \nhas been previously filed and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone]\n        moves to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 in status quo and at the earliest date \n     possible, to issue a report, the text of which shall be as \n     follows:\n       ``It is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     Congress should take no action which would result in \n     significant reductions in assistance to students who want an \n     opportunity to attend college.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment. This has nothing to do with the vote Tuesday. \nIt is not linked to this constitutional amendment, but it does make it \nclear that the Senate should go on record that we will take no action \nthat will result in significant reductions in assistance to students \nwho want the opportunity to attend college.\n  Just yesterday the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor-HHS \nslashed a student aid grant program, an education program for dropouts \nand homeless people, and the vocational education grant program. Please \nremember all those who signed the Contract With America have signed a \ndocument that says they intend to support cuts in student aid.\n  This motion really comes from my own background as a college teacher. \nSo many of us talk about the importance of doing a good job of \nrepresenting the middle class. My prior amendment dealt with hungry and \nhomeless children. I think they are a very special interest. They do \nnot have a lot of people lobbying for them here. But now I really am \ntalking about the middle class. I would just like to say to my \ncolleagues, there really is nothing more important that we could do to \ndo well for the people we represent, including middle-class people, \nthan to make sure, through good public policy, that higher education is \naffordable.\n  What this amendment says is we go on record we are not going to take \nany action that will result in reductions in assistance to students who \nwant an opportunity to attend college. I do not think that is too much \nto ask.\n  I was a college teacher for 20 years and I had an opportunity \nteaching--I guess you could say 5 generations of students. You know, \nyou count them 4 years at a time. I had an opportunity to see how a \nspark of learning, if ignited, can take a student from any background \nto a life of creativity and accomplishment. The worst thing we could do \nwould be to pour cold water on that spark.\n  We always talk about higher education as key to a successful economy, \nto a literate, high morale, trained work force. That is true. I also \nthink John Dewey, the great educational philosopher, was right that \nhigher education, for that matter K-12 education, is critical to \nrepresentative democracy because we have to have men and women who can \nthink on their own two feet, who have conceptual tools that they can \nuse to understand the world that they live in and who understand the \ncourses of action that are available to them to contribute to our \ncountry and to their communities.\n  But if you talk to families in Idaho or Minnesota or Utah or Wyoming, \nI know that listed among their top three concerns is how are we going \nto be able to send our sons and daughters on to college? I want to be \nvery clear. I spend a lot of time on campuses and all too often I will \nmeet students who sell their plasma at the beginning of the semester to \nbuy a textbook. Let me repeat that. All too often I meet students who \nsell plasma at the beginning of the semester to buy their textbooks. \nAll too often I meet students who are working 40 hours a week while \ngoing to school--that is not uncommon. That is why it takes many \nstudents 6 years to complete their undergraduate work rather than 4 \nyears.\n  I think the nontraditional students have become the traditional \nstudents. Students are no longer out of the ``Brady Bunch.'' They are \nno longer 19 years of age and living in the dorm. I think almost the \nmajority of students are older, they have gone back to school, many of \nthem are single parents, many of them have children. It is terribly \nimportant that we go on record that we will not take any action that \ncould result in significant reduction to assistance to students who \nwant an opportunity to attend college.\n  I do not think that is too much to ask.\n  I remember a gathering at Moorhead State, Moorhead, MN. A student \nsaid to me, in front of everyone, ``You know, my mother and father, \nthey told me that the college years would be the best years of my \nlife.''\n  Then he looked at a really crowded forum. He looked at everybody, and \nhe hesitated, and he said, ``These are not the best years of my life. I \nam working three minimum-wage jobs, 40 hours a week, and trying to go \nto school. These don't feel like the best years of my life.'' This \nwhole question of how we make higher education affordable is key to \nwhat our Nation is all about, which is a nation of opportunity for \nevery person from every background.\n  The total cost of attending a 4-year public institution averages \nabout $7,600 a year. The average cost to go to a 4-year private \ninstitution is around $16,000 a year. Tuition alone has increased more \nthan 120 percent over the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, today I am going to be formally requesting of the \nGeneral Accounting Office that they do a study of the increase in \ntuition costs, the magnitude of it, and the way it affects our young \npeople, or not so young people.\n  At this cost, higher education is out of reach for many middle-class \nfamilies. For the 1993-94 academic year, students borrowed a record \namount, $23 billion, from federally guaranteed loan programs, and the \naverage loan exceeded $2,700 annually. By the way, understand that \nbecause the whole ratio of grants to loans has shifted to the loans, \nstudents graduate in enormous debt when they are getting ready to start \nout their life.\n  I feel very, very lucky. It was just a matter of accident of when I \nwas born that I was able to go to the University of North Carolina. \nAbove and beyond wrestling, and I think I had some academic \nscholarship, I was able to receive a National Defense Act low-interest \nloan because I was going to go into education. I did not graduate \nsaddled with that kind of debt. But that is not the case today.\n  Krista--I will not use her last name--is a sophomore who will be \ngraduating from community college and going to Mankato State University \nto get a B.A. She is 24 years old and married. She writes:\n\n       I do not receive State or Federal grants, nor do I receive \n     any scholarships. In order to pay for my 2 years at a \n     community college, I had to take out over $5,000 in student \n     loans. Last year, I was receiving help through the State \n     Work-Study Program. When that was cut, I suffered again. I \n     realize that part of education is receiving some debt and \n     that it should not be a free ride. But neither should it be a \n     weight tied around my neck. So I ask that whatever decision \n     you make, you consider that many students like myself are \n     choking with this weight.\n\n  Congress should go on record. We will not do anything that will \nresult in significant reductions to students who want an opportunity to \nattend college. Is that too much to ask; that we go on record on this \nbasic question that affects a huge, broad section of the population?\n  As I said earlier, the typical student these days is not the Brady \nBunch kid who graduates from high school and goes straight on to \ncollege: 45 percent of the student bodies these days are over 25 years \nof age; 45 percent of the students are over 25 years old. In fact, \nnearly 20 percent of all students are \n[[Page S3005]] older than 35, and many of them are single parents.\n  Mr. President, many of them are students of color. And by the way, we \nwant to talk about, with welfare reform, single parents being able to \nbe on their own and going to school.\n  It has to be affordable. We cannot be cutting these grant programs \nand low-interest loan programs. But we are going to. You bet we are \ngoing to, because there is no other way we can get to $1.481 trillion \nby 2002. We know it. I hear discussion about we want to take this debt \nburden off the shoulders of the young. What are we doing to the young \nright now?\n  Denise, from a suburb of Minneapolis, writes:\n\n       I am a 29-year-old single parent, currently enrolled as a \n     junior at the University of Minnesota. Because of the \n     excellent support of financial aid and other programs, I have \n     been successfully maintaining a 3.76 GPA.\n\n  That is pretty good. That is out of 4.0.\n\n       Before returning to school, from the time my son was 6 \n     weeks old, I worked as a medical assistant making $9 an hour. \n     Without the needed assistance, the rug would be pulled out \n     from under me. I cannot make it otherwise. Don't cut grant \n     and loan assistance that would deny me my opportunity to \n     pursue my higher education and my dream in life, Senators.\n\n  That is what Denise writes.\n  Sandra, from St. Louis Park, another suburb:\n\n       I am devastated at the idea of any financial aid cuts. Not \n     only would I need to drop out of college--I am a sophomore--\n     but it would leave me with only two options. First, I could \n     obtain an entry-level position; second, I could remain a \n     public assistance recipient for awhile. At any rate, the best \n     I could do for myself and my son in society is to maintain at \n     the below-poverty level.\n       I faced these obstacles after a miserable divorce, which \n     left me without home or money or even credit to plan for the \n     future. I have goals not only for myself, but to be allowed \n     to contribute and replace whatever I have used. By the time I \n     graduate in 1997, I will be financially independent. \n     Likewise, I am setting an example for my son to achieve \n     independence and pride, which are invaluable to our society.\n\n  Sandra is saying to us: Senators, please, when you do your deficit \nreduction, and I want you to, and you go to balance the budget, whether \nthis amendment is passed, please do not make any significant reductions \nin higher education programs that would deny me my opportunity to \nattend college.\n  Our Federal commitment to higher education should be strengthened, \nnot cut. But we are going to cut it. In 1990, about 5 million students \nreceived Federal student aid under one or more Federal programs. In the \n1993-94 academic year, about 3.8 million students received Pell grants, \n4.5 million received Stafford loans, 991,000 received supplementary \neducation opportunity grants, 697,000 received Perkins loans, 713,000 \nreceived Federal work-study awards, and 650,000 received State student \nincentive grants.\n  Most of this financial aid is based upon need. Pell grants are \ntargeted to the neediest students and the campus State programs give \nfinancial aid offices the flexibility to respond to unique student \nneeds. And they are needed. These programs help low-income and middle-\nincome families. Of the Pell grants awarded to dependent students, \nthose who are financially dependent on their parents, 41 percent go to \nstudents with families with incomes less than $12,000 a year and 91 \npercent go to students with families of incomes below $30,000. This is \na critical lifeline program. Among Pell recipients who were financially \nindependent, 73 percent have incomes below $12,000 a year.\n  I could go on and on. Let me just assure you that all the low-\ninterest loans and on campus work-study programs are all targeted \ntoward students that come from low- and moderate-income families.\n  Mr. President, we say that we are for the young and we are for \nopportunity. We cannot give lie to that commitment. We have to be \nwilling to make some investment. I just have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, the most shortsighted thing we could do would be to now cut \nin these very programs.\n  By the way, there is a huge difference in the future of those who go \nto college and those who do not. I could go through the statistics. But \nI do not think I will because I think we all know. If you graduate from \ncollege, you have a much better chance than if you graduate from high \nschool, a much better chance to be able to do well economically for \nyourself and for your family.\n  Mr. President, if there is anything to the American dream--I can say \nthis as a son of a Jewish immigrant from Russia who loved books and \nideas--the biggest thing in our family was that children go on to \nhigher education; they could do better than their parents; they could \nhave a rewarding life.\n  But let us be clear about it. We are going to have to cut $1.4 \ntrillion from the budget. We have to pay the interest on the debt. I \nthink there is a commitment to not touch Social Security, as there \nshould be. We are going to increase the Pentagon budget. We are going \nto do the tax cuts. So where else is there to cut?\n  If you just take what is left on the table, you would have to cut 30 \npercent across the board from domestic discretionary spending. I do not \nknow whether that is going to be Medicare or veterans' benefits. It \nlooks from the House for sure that it is going to be nutrition programs \nand child care programs.\n  I do not know whether it is going to be Pell grants, Stafford loans, \nwhat loan programs, but it is going to happen--30 percent across the \nboard, maybe more in some, maybe less in others.\n  So let us talk a little bit about what this means.\n  Pell grants would be slashed by one-third, from a maximum of $2,230 \nto $1,560. Alternatively, if we did not do that, we could just slash \nthe number of students receiving Pell grants. So some 1.1 million \nstudents would not receive Federal aid at all to attend college.\n  Mr. President, there are proposals to no longer exempt the interest \nthat students accumulate--I believe Chairman Kasich of the House Budget \nCommittee said--while they are at college or university. Find out how \nthe students in Idaho or Minnesota like that. Interest that accumulates \non their loans while in school will no longer be forgiven, and then \nthat gets added on. I think for a typical family that ends up to over \n$3,000 more in interest.\n  Mr. President, the campus-based programs also would include \nsupplementary education opportunity grant programs. And the contract \ntalks about the termination of some of these programs. That is $583 \nmillion. The work study program, that is $616 million; and the Perkins \nLoan Program, that is $176 million. If these programs are cut, that is \na $1.4 billion cut in financial aid.\n  So, Mr. President, let me go back to this motion. Let us be \nstraightforward. Are we going to, in balancing this budget, put into \neffect deep cuts in a Pell Grant Program which right now is hugely \ninadequate in relation to those students that need this grant \nassistance? Are we going to put into effect deep cuts, 30 percent or \nmore, in needs-based, work-study or low-interest loan programs? Is that \nwhat we are going to do?\n  Well, Mr. President, my motion just simply says that we go on record, \na sense of the Senate that we will take no action that would result in \nsignificant reductions in assistance to students who want the \nopportunity to attend college. That is what this motion says.\n  Mr. President, might I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 25 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are other Senators here. I do not \nknow whether they want to speak on this or not. I have more to say on \nthis.\n  I think the Senator from Wyoming wants to respond.\n  Let me just reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate that from my friend \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I have listened with great interest. I yield myself 11 minutes of the \nremaining time of the floor manager and would share with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota that I had not intended to come by, but I was moved by \nhis comments. His remarks were very heartfelt. They were very sincere. \nI have no doubt that he speaks from the heart \n[[Page S3006]] when he expresses these concerns about the Nation's \nchildren, and that has been the subject of the morning's activity.\n  The reason I came here, Mr. President, is that all of us share these \npassions, all of us share these pent-up feelings. And yet those \npassions and feelings led me to almost precisely the opposite \nconclusion reached by my friend from Minnesota.\n  I look at our Nation, I look at our Federal budget, and I see the \ninjustice done to America's children. I see a Federal Government that \nspends 11 times as much per capita on the elderly as we do on the \nchildren. I see a Government unresponsive to the needs of children. We \nsee these poverty rates for children surpassing poverty rates for any \nother group. I am completely in agreement with the Senator from \nMinnesota when he decries the diversion of national resources from the \nchildren.\n  But I will tell you what is happening to children in this country. \nWhat is happening is we have gone from a society that used to channel \nits resources toward the young into one which channels resources away \nfrom them. If you want to know why we do not devote the proper share of \nresources to our children, it is very simple. It is because of \nexploding spending in other parts of the Federal budget is paralyzing \nour ability to make proper choices.\n  Here is a statistic, and I shared it the other day: In the year \n2013--and this scenario was agreed to by 30 of the 32 of us on the \nEntitlements Commission--due to the growth in entitlements, every penny \nof Federal revenue under current law will only be sufficient to fund \nentitlements and interest on the debt.\n  That is not a dry statistic. It means something. It means this \ncountry is depriving itself of the ability to make decisions how to \nprovide for transportation, education, and child nutrition.\n  All of this leads to one issue. What are we going to do with Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement? This is not about \ndefense or spending on highways or education. It is about writing \nchecks from one generation to another.\n  Some powerful statistics have been shared by the Senator from \nMinnesota. May I share just a few of my own. Here is one: The national \ndebt is 48,000 bucks per taxpayer. Assuming 100 million taxpayers, that \nwill soon be 50,000 bucks a taxpayer, with a national debt of $5 \ntrillion.\n  Children now come into life owing that when they are born. That is \nthe burden we place on them. We pay more than $200 billion a year to \nfinance the debt. What could that do for child nutrition, for \nvaccination, for education? It is not there. It is gone. Went out the \nwindow. An interest payment.\n  Also, I do not find the argument compelling that we should simply \ngive up on a balanced budget amendment and continue to add to that \nburden. And we will always give up, because we will come to this floor \nand vote for everything our constituents ask us to bring home. We are \nlike pack horses. They just load us with requests for funding, and we \ncome out here and we load the money home.\n  Here is another statistic for you. The elderly make up 12 percent of \nthe Nation's population. What percent of the Federal entitlement \nspending do they receive? The answer is 60 percent. Not 60 percent to \nthe most needy population group--children--but 60 percent going to this \nother relatively smaller group, the 12 percent of our country who are \nsenior citizens.\n  And here is one for you. If you are a millionaire, a millionaire over \nthe age of 65, these are the various Federal entitlements you can \nreceive. You can get Social Security, Medicare, an extra tax deduction, \nsenior nutrition programs, and other subsidies under the Older \nAmericans Act. That is if you are a millionaire--and those keep coming \nafter you receive your entire lifetime contributions in Social Security \nback, plus interest.\n  We act around here as if there are no consequences to what we do. I \nwish I had not served on the Entitlements Commission, and yet I am very \npleased I did. I admire Senator Kerrey and Senator Danforth so very \nmuch.\n  So the reaction from everybody I talk to is, ``Well, OK, I do have \nsome ideas. Where are they? Why don't we means test part B premiums so \nthat a millionaire pays as much for the benefit as the working class \ntaxpayer?''\n  On, no, we could not do that.\n  What are we going to do when two people are paying in and one person \nis taking out of the Social Security system? How long do you think \npeople are going to stand still for that?\n  So the inevitable result of shoveling so much of our Nation's \nresources in the direction of one politically organized, powerful voter \ngroup--the seniors--is precisely why we are here in this situation.\n  It is a situation where there is nothing left for the children. That \nis precisely why we must stand up to the endless pressure to lavish \nentitlement benefits even on wealthy seniors. I am not talking about \nneedy seniors portrayed as foraging out of garbage cans in alleys, but \nwhether upper income beneficiaries should receive those ever-increasing \nGovernment benefits.\n  I implore the body to free itself from illusions about our Federal \nbudget situation. We cannot hold entitlement benefits for the wealthy \nsacrosanct on one day--when they now make up the majority of the \nbudget--and come on hard the next to decry the lack of help for our \nchildren. That simply does not add up.\n  In the year 2040 what fraction of the national payroll taxes will be \nneeded simply to support two programs, Social Security and Medicare \nunder current law? The answer is 38 to 53 percent before we collect a \npenny of income tax.\n  Anyone truly concerned about the welfare of the children should come \nhere and explain why we should fail to means test Medicare part B, why \nwe should give full Social Security COLA's to millionaires--when COLA's \nwere never part of the original contract. Remember these are the \nprograms sucking it up. So, explain that to our children, why we should \ncontinue to do this to them.\n  When I am joined by Senators who are ready to do this kind of work, I \nwill feel more heartened in the cause. Then I guess there is another \nthing. I heard the letters read, and they are poignant.\n  Let me tell you one from real life. My wife's father worked on the \nrailroad in Greybull, WY. He died when she was 16. Her mother and the \ntwo other children had only their home. So their mother went to \nLaramie, the home of the University of Wyoming, and became a house \nmother at the Kappa Sig house. My wife Ann and her twin sister Nan \nworked their way all the way through college. So did their brother Rob. \nThe sisters worked as waitresses, and they worked as cabin girls at \ndude ranches. She bought all of her own clothes and necessities, worked \nfor everything she obtained, and earned all of her own money, and never \nthought of herself as a victim. It is called going to work to achieve \nsomething you can achieve.\n  Now we have an entire country waiting for the Federal Government to \nmake them whole. And we can all read stories like those shared. It is \nnow a nation of victims. The greatest victims are the children, and the \ngreatest reason for that is because there is not one on the floor who \nwill take on the senior citizens of America who--regardless of their \nnet worth or their income--are pulling the temple down.\n  I have no further remarks at this time. I reserve the remainder of \nthe time for Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Part of the reason I have so much respect for the Senator is because \nof his directness. I must say to my colleague, at the moment I find \nmyself in profound disagreement with his remarks.\n  First of all, given what the Senator from Wyoming has said, he ought \nto support both of these motions. It sounds like we are in agreement on \nat least one part of the equation. I really appreciate the fact that he \nhas come out here and said that there is a huge disconnect between our \nrhetoric and the speeches we give and our support of young people.\n  I think the Senator from Wyoming has been clear about that. In a \nsense I think he would be supportive especially of the first motion--\nthat is No. 1--which makes it clear when we sort out these priorities \nand make the tough decisions, the most vulnerable citizens are the \nhomeless and hungry children. There is nothing the Senator from Wyoming \nsaid that would prevent him \n[[Page S3007]] from supporting that motion. Everything he said, I \nthink, would make him want to support that.\n  Second of all, my own view about these deficits and this debt that we \nhave built up, is that I at least can say that when we went back to the \nearly 1980's and decided that we would go forward with what President \nBush once called voodoo economics, what was called euphemistically, the \nEconomic Recovery Act, huge tax cuts for the wealthiest, dramatic \nincreases in the Pentagon budget. And remember, all of that was going \nto lead to productivity and jobs--this was the Laffer curve--and it \nwould reduce deficits.\n  It did not work out that way, did it? We really got ourselves into a \nmess. I was not here during that time. We have to work ourselves out of \nthat mess. I must say I think the 2002, I think that the direction we \nare going in right now does not add up.\n  Now, Mr. President, getting back to the issue here. I appreciate my \ncolleague's concern about children because before I was told that I was \nout here for the special interests. I think children are a very special \ninterest. I disagree that our only choice is between older people, \nelderly citizens and the children.\n  My colleague said this way, now we get to the stereotype of the \ngreedy geezers that are out there in the golf courses living high on \nthe hog.\n  Mr. President, I believe--and it is off the top of my head--that the \naverage income of a man 65 years of age and over is $15,000 a year. For \na woman, it is $8,000 a year. Now, Mr. President, that is hardly the \nprofile of these older people, that they are the problem.\n  I was at a gathering in Rosedale, Fairview Senior Center, the other \nday. I think it was a very interesting gathering. I asked the people \nthere--and of every gathering of senior citizens--what are the top \nthree issues you care about. They always put children at the top. We \nare talking about the children and the grandchildren of the elderly in \nthis country.\n  It is not true that the elderly are so wealthy and have such high \nincomes. I would say to my colleague here that if we want to talk about \nwhy there should be a subsidy on part B Medicare for older people \nmaking incomes of $100,000 a year and over, I agree. The problem is \nthere are not very many older people that make $100,000 a year and \nover. It just is not true.\n  Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota said the test of a society and \na government is the way we treat people in the dawn of life, children; \nthe way we treat people in the twilight of their lives, the elderly; \nand the way we treat people in the shadow of their lives, those \nstruggling with an illness or a disability and those who are needy or \npoor. I believe that.\n  The choices are not between our going on record that we will not do \nanything that will increase hunger or homelessness among children, or \ngoing on record to do anything that would cut programs that enable \npeople to be able to go on and afford higher education, versus we have \nto cut benefits for the elderly across the board.\n  Mr. President, there are other options. We did not need to get into \nthis bidding war on tax cuts. But we have. And the projections on \nthat--and again I am speaking off the top of my head--I believe it was \n$500 billion, up to 2002 and then another $700 billion beyond. Going in \nthe opposite direction of deficit reduction.\n  I would say to my colleagues, if you are so concerned about deficit \nreduction, why are you talking about these broad-based tax cuts? Mr. \nPresident, there are other choices. It is not children versus the \nelderly. I do not accept this tradeoff. I do not believe a rigorous \nanalysis supports this tradeoff. We do not have to be increasing the \nPentagon budget. We could be cutting it.\n  I cosponsored a bill with Senators Bumpers and Bradley that dealt \nwith about $30 billion in military cuts over 5 years based on some GAO \nstudies of some wasteful weaponry. Weapons and programs that make no \nsense. But the military contractors are not being asked to tighten \ntheir belts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just say two other things. First, \nSenator Feingold and I have examined a book from the Joint Tax \nCommittee, I say to the Senator from South Carolina, it must have been \nthis thick on tax expenditures, some of which go back before 1950, some \nof which are necessary, but many of which are just outright tax dodges \nfor corporations in America, and the U.S. Senate would not vote for a \nmotion that said we should at least consider some of these subsidies.\n  And, second, even though we do not need to get into the debate today \nabout single payer, which the General Accounting Office and \nCongressional Budget Office said would save over $100 billion in \nexpenses every year with universal coverage, I must remind my \ncolleagues that the big entitlement programs that are skyrocketing are \nhealth care programs, but the insurance companies did not like that. I \nintroduced a bill that dealt with the Medicare entitlement program, but \nrather than cut it, it was a way of really being able to afford these \nprograms.\n  So let us not have some false choice in dichotomy out here on the \nfloor that a Senator from Minnesota can only come out here fighting for \nchildren and fighting for affordable higher education if that Senator \nfrom Minnesota is willing to say, ``We've got to have deep, drastic \ncuts in programs that support elderly citizens in this Nation.''\n  No. 1, it is not true that they have such high income and wealth, and \nthey are all greedy geezers out on the golf course. That is a cultural \nstereotype and, two, those are not the only choices. I just outlined \nfour other options, none of which are being considered.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me make one other point and then I \nwill yield the floor to the Senator from Montana, reserving, after \nthat, the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, let me one more time focus attention on these two \nmotions. The first motion is a motion to refer to the Budget Committee \na sense of the Senate that when we do deficit reduction and balance the \nbudget that we are not going to do anything to increase the number of \nhomeless and hungry children. This is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget at all. It does not say \nthe vote on the amendment is put off. It is separate. It just says when \nwe do the deficit reduction and move forward to balancing the budget--\nall of us are in favor of doing that; not all are in favor of this \nconstitutional amendment --that we go on record that we are not going \nto do anything to increase hunger and homelessness. I say to my friend \nfrom South Carolina, part of reason I do this are these headlines: \n``House Panel Moves to Cut Child School Lunch Program,'' ``House Panel \nTrims Nutrition Programs and Housing Programs,'' the WIC Program.\n  The second motion is very similar. It is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is just a sense of \nthe Senate that we go on record ``that we take no action that would \nresult in significant reductions in assistance to students who want an \nopportunity to attend college.''\n  My colleague from Wyoming talked about how he heard me read some \nletters from students in Minnesota and he thought too many students \nwere viewing themselves as victims. I do not think that is what the \nstudents are saying.\n  The alarm clock has gone off, students and young people in the \ncountry; it is time to get engaged because you need to understand there \nare going to be deep cuts on the present course in Pell grants and low-\ninterest loans, not in a lot of other areas that I mentioned. The only \nway you are going to be able to do something about it is to get \ninvolved in politics.\n  We need to have an education day all across this Nation, within the \nnext month, where all congressional delegations are called back home--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike--and meet with younger people, college \nstudents, high school students, teachers, parents in which we need to \ngo on record as to whether or not we are or are not going to support \naffordable higher education.\n  They are not feeling like victims, I say to my colleague from \nWyoming, Mr. President. That was not the point of those letters. What \nthose letters were saying is, we want you to do a good job of \nrepresenting us, and we believe that one of the most important \n[[Page S3008]] issues for us--and I hear it from the parents as well--\nis to make sure higher education is affordable. Of course, we are \nwilling to contribute; of course, we do, but we feel like that is some \nthing that is a part of what this country is about: Affordable \neducation. That is all that meant. That is all this motion is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Montana, after \nwhich I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if I can have 6 minutes of the \ntime of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for the purpose of introduction of a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 465 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair, and I deeply thank my good friend from \nMinnesota for so graciously yielding the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Montana for his fine work.\n  Mr. President, I wonder whether or not the Senator from Utah might \nwant to respond. We will wait for just a moment.\n  I do not think, Mr. President, there is any reason to repeat \narguments, but I wish to wait for my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again, I understand what my colleague is \ntrying to do, but I just have to say, well, here we go again, another \nexemption. We have already seen various proposals to exempt veterans, \nSocial Security, homeless children, capital expenditures, and here is \nanother one, college tuition. When will it end? I suppose next Tuesday \nit will end.\n  Mr. President, these are all very important groups. I feel very \ndeeply about all of them collectively myself. But all these proposed \nexemptions demonstrate exactly what the problem is. We cannot reduce \nthe deficit because there is no incentive to do it. Every time we try, \nsomebody brings up another exemption that they want to take care of or \nanother special interest group, all of which have merit, all of which \nhave meaning. But that is why we need a balanced budget amendment--free \nfrom special interest exemptions and loopholes--to get this country's \nfiscal house in order.\n  The balanced budget amendment that we propose here is a bipartisan \nconsensus, Democrat-Republican amendment that we have worked on for \ndecades. We have brought a vast majority of people in both Houses \ntogether on it. For the first time in history, the House of \nRepresentatives has passed it by the requisite two-thirds vote. It has \nnot been easy. Everybody knows that. But what it does is it sets rules \nwithin which we will have to set priorities.\n  This debate about priorities, it seems to me, should wait until after \nthe balanced budget amendment passes. Then we will get serious about \nthe priorities that have to be made. No one wants to harm anyone who \nrelies on governmental assistance--nobody, least of all this Senator. \nNone of us does. But we must make choices among priorities, and we must \nmake these choices among priorities within the constraints of our \nresources. We no longer can afford to just throw money at everything. \nPriorities are going to change from year to year. So every year after \nwe pass this amendment, every year we will debate priorities. Some are \ngoing to fare very well, as you know--in fact, most all of them will. \nBut the fact of the matter is we will have to debate them, and we will \nhave to set fiscal constraints for the first time since I have been \nhere, and to me that is pretty important. I think it is to anybody who \nlooks at it.\n  However, that debate will only come after we pass this balanced \nbudget amendment. It is the only way. I think almost everybody knows \nthat here.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator, for whom I have great feeling as a \nperson, as a compassionate individual, is arguing for some pretty good \ninterest groups here. He is arguing for some good exemptions. On the \nother hand, no exemption is good if it takes away from somebody else, \nif it makes it more difficult to help others who may be just as needy, \nif not more so.\n  The best way to handle this is with a balanced budget amendment that \nsets a mechanism in place, that shows us how to do it and has a rule to \nit and reason to it that makes us make priority choices. It is the fair \nway to do it. It is the only way to do it, and that is what this \nbalanced budget amendment does. So I hope our colleagues will vote for \nthe balanced budget amendment next Tuesday. I do hope we will vote down \nthese two motions to defer because I think they just point out more \nthan anything else, or at least as much as the other amendments why we \nneed a balanced budget amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I might respond, I must say that the Senator's last \nremark makes me extremely nervous, when he states these motions--again, \nthese are not amendments to the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--these motions really make the case for why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The Senator said a little earlier that no one wants to hurt the most \nvulnerable citizens, so I do not know why a motion that we go on record \nas we move to balancing the budget we are not going to do anything to \nincrease hunger or homelessness among children makes the case for a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  My colleague from Utah keeps talking about these exemptions, and I \njust would say to my colleague, if the proponents of this amendment \nwould have provided some detailed analysis as to where we are going to \nmake the cuts, then I would not have to be in the Chamber saying let us \nat least go on record we are not going to do this to children or we are \ngoing to make sure that higher education is not affordable, let us make \nsure of that. If there was a detailed analysis, there would be no \nreason for any of us to come out to the floor to make these motions.\n  There is no detailed analysis. We have tried over and over again to \nget Senators to step up to the plate. They have been unwilling to do \nso. The credibility gap is huge--so far I have heard $277 billion of \nbudget cuts outlined by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nThat takes us a little bit toward $1.481 trillion, not very far.\n  Mr. President, I have to say one more time the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey] said it well. We can go forward every single year with \nmore deficit reduction. I voted for I think the largest deficit \nreduction we have had probably in the last decade and a half. I stepped \nup to the plate and we can do much more on deficit reduction and we can \nbalance the budget. I do not know that it can be done in 2002. I think \nthat is an unrealistic date. I think it is a political date. But we \nabsolutely have to do it.\n  Mr. President, you do not need to have a balanced budget amendment in \nthe constitution, locking us into all these cuts without telling \nanybody in the country what we are going to do in order for us to step \nup to the plate every single year and do the necessary deficit \nreduction.\n  I might add, there is another deficit.\n   There is an investment deficit, especially in education and children \nand young people. We can do that now.\n\n  Finally, I do not understand this discussion about special interests. \nMy view is that, yes, children and young people are very special \ninterests. But, I say to my colleague, it simply is not the case--I \nhope he is not arguing: Look, the reason we cannot vote for these \nmotions is we know we are going to make cuts in this area because we \nhave to make cuts in this area if we are going to balance the budget.\n  That is not true. We do not have to make cuts in these areas if we \nare going to balance the budget. Mr. President, $420 billion of tax \nexpenditures--we do not have to raise the Pentagon budget, we do not \nhave to do all the tax \n[[Page S3009]] cuts. There are lots of other ways to balance the budget \nas opposed to focusing on the young, focusing on education, or focusing \non the most vulnerable citizens.\n  My final point. The reason I have been so insistent today on the \nfloor of the Senate about these motions--and I am going to wear my \npolitical science hat for a moment; I am a political scientist--is my \nsad but true judgment that all too often the actual deficit reduction \nand cuts are made based upon the path of least political resistance. \nThose citizens who do not have a lobbyist, do not make the large \ncontributions, are not the heavy hitters, are not the big players, are \nthe very citizens who are asked to tighten their belts. The very \ncitizens we ask to tighten their belts are the very citizens that \ncannot.\n  I have been out here saying we ought to consider cutting subsidies \nfor oil companies, subsidies for pharmaceutical companies, all sorts of \nother subsidies for large corporations and financial institutions and \nthe silence on the other side of the aisle has been deafening. It has \nbeen voted down.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator makes a good point, but it is a good \npoint for the balanced budget amendment, that if there are subsidies to \nlarge corporate America and other entities that he disagrees with, we \nwill have to look at those. That is why I think, to be honest with you, \nwe need the balanced budget amendment.\n  Is my colleague prepared to yield back his remaining time? I am, too.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have about 15 seconds left.\n  Let me be clear. Neither of these motions say anything about voting \nfor or against the balanced budget amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me on the question if the choices we have to make are we are \nnot going to take any action which would increase the number of hungry \nor homeless children and we are not going to make higher education not \naffordable for young people who want to go on to colleges and \nuniversities. That is all it says. It is a sense of the Senate. We \nought to be able to vote for that right now, advocates for the balanced \nbudget amendment and those who are opposed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time if I have any time to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and I move \nto table the amendment and will ask for the yeas and nays with the \nunderstanding that the vote will be at another time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me acknowledge my respect and \nfriendship for the distinguished Senator from Utah. He has worked hard \non this issue, but I rise today to speak out against the particular \nlanguage in section 7 of the amendment that includes Social Security \nrevenues in its definition of receipts.\n  I have supported and would continue to support a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution if we did not have to breach the contract \nof 1935 with respect to Social Security.\n  Taking Social Security out of deficit calculations is not just \nanother attempt to carve out exemptions. There are no special taxes for \neducation. There is no special tax for women, infants and children \nfeeding. There are no special taxes for law enforcement. However, the \nSocial Security tax is exclusively levied for the benefit of future \nrecipients.\n  So the matter of excluding Social Security funds from deficit \ncalculations should not be confused or distorted. In 1983 we received \nthe Greenspan Commission report and increased FICA taxes on middle \nAmerica. If we had come at that time and said: These taxes will be used \nto pay for defense or welfare or foreign aid, that legislation would \nhave been killed immediately. If you said these taxes were going to be \nused for the deficit, people would have said: ``Wait a minute. We are \ntalking about the Social Security deficit. We are not talking about the \noverall Government deficit.''\n  Mr. President, I voted three times for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution and have worked as hard as anyone to get the bills \npaid. It has not always been easy, but I am quite willing to stand on \nmy record. In the 104th Congress, the very first bill passed was \ndesigned to put the Government under the same rules and regulations \nthat the average citizen has to abide by.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, many of the laws that we enact here in \nWashington require Americans to tell the truth. As part of the statutes \nof the United States, we have the Truth in Fabrics Act, the Truth in \nFurs Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Lending Simplification \nand Reform Act, the Truth in Mileage Act of 1986, the Truth in \nNegotiations Act for Military Procurement, the Truth in Savings Act, \nthe Truth in Securities Act, and others as well. But, much to my \nchagrin, the fact of the matter is that we do not have a Truth in \nBudgeting Act.\n  Like Fred Astaire, we tap dance all around a particular issue with \nfancy dance steps until we are left like an octopus that is cornered--\nwith nothing left to do but to squirt out the dark ink of confusion and \nescape to the next election.\n  I graduated from truth in budgeting and I know the issue. As a young \nGovernor elected back in 1958. I was only 36 years of age, and we were \nthe second lowest per-capita income State. I realized at that \nparticular time that no one was going to invest in Podunk. To attract \ninvestment and create jobs, we had not only to pay our bills but we had \nto guarantee they would stay paid. To do it, we raised taxes. I could \nhear all of the arguments bandied about: It falls on the middle class; \nit is the regressive; we have a poor State, and shouldn't be raising \ntaxes.\n  But I was not granted the luxury of choice. I had to raise taxes and \nsuffer the consequences. That in part led to my defeat in 1962 when I \nran for the Senate. But in public life, I think you ought to lose a \ngood election like that. It is the most instructive lesson you can \nlearn. I remember that election better than the six times since that I \nhave been elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  But as Governor of South Carolina, I had a little provision that \nintrigued the folks at Standard & Poors and Moody's. We had put in a \nrule that required the comptroller to issue a certificate to the \nGovernor for each quarter that the expenditures were within the \nrevenues. If the books were not in balance, the Governor was required \nby law to cut spending straight across the board. The bond agencies \nsaid, ``We had not heard of that.'' They called me a few weeks later \nand said that South Carolina would qualify for a AAA credit rating.\n  While some may think that a constitutional amendment is an iron-clad \nguarantee, I know from hard experience that such is not the case. We \nhave an amendment to the South Carolina Constitution that was enacted \nin 1895 that says, in effect, ``The budget shall be balanced.'' It was \na constitutional provision quite similar to what we are debating, but \nit was honored more by violation than by conformance.\n  Specifically, with respect to truth in budgeting, there is an old \nlegal maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity. He who comes in \nthe court of equity must come with clean hands. I have asked my \ncolleagues to show me their plan to balance the budget. But in seeking \nthis equity, I have also done equity. I have put in my own so-called \nbudget, which I proposed in January. I have put it in the Record \nseveral times and would now ask unanimous consent that it again printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       [[Page S3010]] Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on \n     the budget on Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 95 (using trust funds).             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, the 49er's did not go to the Super Bowl in Miami last \nmonth, take their seats in the grandstand there in the Joe Robbie \nStadium, and start shouting, ``We want a touchdown, we want a \ntouchdown.'' They got down on the field and they scored the touchdown.\n  Similarly, we are the Government, and now it is our duty, our \nresponsibility to act.\n  When we tried to move the ball downfield 2 years ago with the largest \ndeficit reduction package in our history, we could not get a single \nvote on the other side of the aisle in the House and in the Senate.\n  Likewise, when those on the other side of the aisle start to \ncriticize the President by saying--``Where's his courage? He's waving \nthe white flag,'' it is truly the pot calling the kettle black.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is high time we had some truth in \nbudgeting.\n  Look at the record that I have made here of some 110 proposed \nspending cuts, eliminations, or retrenchments of different programs. \nYou will see the savings that it gives in 1996 and 1997.\n  I struggled, taking some of the CBO cuts, the Concord Coalition cuts, \nthe Kasich spending cuts and others. And you will see there are 110 of \nthem here, amounting only to $37 billion in the first year and $58 \nbillion in the second year. This 2-year projection is important because \nit underscores the fact that the Congress will have to have further \ncuts next year and each year thereafter to stay on the glide path. \nThus, the reality is that you are not going to balance the budget from \nspending cuts and growth alone.\n  Aversion to higher taxes is usually a necessary, healthy impulse in a \npolitical democracy. But when the alternative becomes self-evidently \nthreadbare and groundless, as has the growth argument, we are no longer \ndealing with legitimate skepticism, but with what amounts to, in the \nwords of David Stockman, ``a demagogic fetish.''\n  We will have to do the best we can on spending cuts. We will have to \nfreeze spending. That is what President Clinton had in his budget along \nwith spending cuts of $144 billion.\n  We will have to close tax loopholes and prevent the transitional rule \ncrowd from putting in $200 million for airlines out in St. Louis. That \nprovision was part of GATT but had nothing to do with international \ntrade. We have to curb such practices and tell the American people the \ntruth.\n  I once took a lie detector test, but the after first question--I \nflunked. They asked a question, and I started my answer, ``Well, in my \nhumble opinion,'' and the needle just went right off the chart. \nLuckily, the fellow gave me a second chance and after 2 hours I passed.\n  Well, here we go with the truth. We have to have taxes. This \npredicament did not develop overnight. President Bush was a good man \nbut he was misled on the critical need to bring the deficit under \ncontrol. I made my own efforts appearing before the Finance Committee \nand introducing a value-added tax for the deficit and debt.\n  Today, with a 5-percent value-added consumption tax and $1.2 trillion \nin spending cuts over 7 years, we can put Government back into the \nblack by the year 1999 and start paying off our $4.8 trillion debt. You \ndo not have to wait for the year 2002.\n  I have just been informed that the proponents of the constitutional \n[[Page S3011]] amendment have the votes. Assuming that to be true, \npeople tell me, why don't you go along now and save your record? Mr. \nPresident, I want to save my record. That is why I am talking. We have \na record of a contract started in 1935. We have a record of a trust. I \nwant to save that record.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not believe they have the votes yet. \nThey may have them in the final analysis but I do not believe they have \nthem yet.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will try to move along so the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia can be heard here.\n  Mr. President, we need truth in budgeting. We should tell the \nAmerican people that the big lie in the land is the slogan ``I'm \nagainst taxes'' because the simple fact is that we are raising taxes $1 \nbillion a day through interest payments on the gross Federal debt.\n  When the Simon amendment came up in 1993, I was not an original \ncosponsor, but I had supported the amendment in 1986. I voted for the \nSimon amendment believing at the time that the Hollings amendment \npassed in 1990 which took the Social Security trust fund off-budget \nexcluded these funds from deficit calculations. When my amendment \npassed the Senate by a vote of 98 to 2, I believed, as similarly \nasserted by the distinguished majority whip, Senator Lott, that: \n``Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, moderate, is \neven thinking about using Social Security to balance the budget.''\n  But Mr. President, unbeknownst to me, just 13 days before the vote, \nSenator Gramm of Texas, who has been a leader on budget matters, \nintroduced a bill to balance the budget. Later on in the year, I had my \nstaff scrutinize it; they found this particular provision which I wish \nthe Senator from Utah would listen to this:\n\n       Exclusion from budget, section 13-301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990 is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following: ``This subsection shall apply to \n     fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2001.''\n\n  I found this provision particularly interesting because back on July \n10, 1990, Senator Gramm had been the lone dissenting vote when I \nintroduced the Hollings amendment to take Social Security off-budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this particular time that rollcall vote in \nthe Budget Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  1990 Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay:\n       Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     and Mr. Bond.\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Having voted against my amendment in the Budget \nCommittee, having proposed to amend section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act, I said, ``Heavens above, I better start checking this \nthing.'' I soon recognized that the Constitution preempts statutory \nlaw, and that the amendment to take the Social Security Trust fund off-\nbudget would be constitutionally repealed by the language of this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  John Mitchell, the famous Attorney General of the United States under \nPresident Nixon, said, ``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' And what \ndo they do? When I argue about these things, I go right to the author \nof that particular Simon balanced budget amendment. I refer to the \nMonday, February 20, roll call, by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois and I quote:\n\n       One paradox is that some Democrats during the Senate debate \n     that is now underway are offering amendments that would \n     imperil both the balanced budget amendment and Social \n     Security by taking Social Security off the budget. These \n     waivers are being offered in the name of protecting--\n\n  That is a true statement, they are offered to protect Social \nSecurity.\n\n       * * * Sponsors of these amendments have an argument that is \n     superficially popular.\n  We are not trying to make it popular; we are trying to make it law.\n       Opening a Social Security loophole in the balanced budget \n     amendment also invites abuse by future Congresses undermining \n     confidence in the integrity of Social Security.\n\n  Now, my dear colleagues, who is opening a Social Security loophole? \nIt is open right now. It is right there. What section 7 does is create \nthe loophole. Whoever votes for this language is opening the loophole. \n``Invites abuse by future Congresses.'' Mr. President, I am not talking \nabout future Congresses. I am talking about this present Congress that \nis willing to abuse the Social Security trust now. I have told them \ntime and time again, you have Hollings' vote if you put in the Social \nSecurity trust fund exemption.\n  That is clear as a bell. They know it. But they think they have the \nvotes. My distinguished colleague from West Virginia thinks otherwise. \nI hope he is right.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici of \nNew Mexico, and the former Senator of New Hampshire, Warren Rudman, of \nthe Concord Coalition, are both on the Strengthening of America \nCommission and have put out a proposal to balance the budget. Remember \nJohn Mitchell. ``Watch what they do, not what they say.'' Here is what \nthey say in their plan. I quote:\n\n       The goal of the plan is to balance the unified budget \n     without using the Social Security surplus by the year 2002. \n     America would then be saving its Social Security surplus, \n     helping to avoid a fiscal train wreck 25 years from now when \n     the general fund must begin repaying the Social Security \n     trust fund. Continuing to divert Social Security surplus to \n     fund current spending instead of building up reserves for the \n     future is bad fiscal policy and bad social policy.\n\n  Mr. President, when the same gentleman took to the floor here last \nweek and, he instead talked about including supplementary security \nincome under the rubric of Social Security. He noted that under the \nlaw, SSI is administered by the Social Security group. True. However, \nhe further claimed future Congresses might include SSI outlays as part \nof the Social Security trust fund.\n  Now, we live in the real world. Any Senator who is fool enough to try \nand finance welfare with Social Security trust funds would make a quick \nexit from the political scene. They will not need a term limitation \nbill to be passed. He would be run off the floor of the Senate or House \nof Representatives. I do not believe he could get a single cosponsor or \nSenator to support him. But even if he did, he would have to get 60 of \nthem because a 60-vote point of order would lie against such a change.\n  I read here where the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire--and I \nread here from a release. It is reported about their particular news \nconference last week, talking about Senator Tsongas, former Senator \nTsongas, and former Senator Rudman, and I am just reading the report. I \nwill give you the quote.\n\n       Both former Senators emphasized the need for Social \n     Security to remain on the table in the budget cutting \n     process.\n\n  Now, that is the report. And here is the quote from Senator Rudman.\n\n       ``To try to fool the American people by setting Social \n     Security aside is delaying the inevitable,'' said Rudman, who \n     added that protecting entitlement spending from cuts would \n     result in the need for ``unworkable'' cuts in the nondefense \n     discretionary spending and aid to state and local \n     governments.\n\n  Here again they raise the straw man. We are not talking about fooling \nanybody about the inevitable. We are talking about the fraud that is \nbeing exacted on the people of America, and particularly people paying \ninto Social Security this minute. The young woman who is paying in now, \nher money will be spent under Section 7. Then when she gets eligible in \nthe year 2020, 2025, they will have to tax her a second time.\n  I quoted earlier from Senator Rudman. Let me now quote from the other \nco-founder of the Concord Coalition, Paul Tsongas, who was even \nharsher. And I quote:\n\n       ``Those who vote to exempt Social Security are voting to \n     kill the balanced budget amendment,'' said Tsongas, co-\n     founder of the Concord Coalition and anti-deficit Group. \n     ``They are putting their own reelection ahead of the future \n     of their children and grandchildren.''\n\n  [[Page S3012]] Who is putting their future ahead of the children and \ngrandchildren? Anybody who votes for section 7 of the present balanced \nbudget amendment joint resolution proposal, that's who. they are the \nones, ``putting their own reelection ahead of the future of their \nchildren and grandchildren.''\n   I have worked in the vineyards for a long time trying to restore the \ndiscipline of a balanced budget in the U.S. Government. I obtained it \nat the State level. I voted for it in 1968-69 when we called over to \nMarvin Watson and we cut $5 billion more. Do you know the entire budget \nin 1968-69, for the Great Society, for the war in Vietnam, was $178 \nbillion? Now we are up to $1.6 trillion. But we gave Richard Milhous \nNixon not only a balanced budget but a $3.2 billion surplus.\n  I got together with Senator Harry Byrd in 1978. We put into law the \nByrd amendment which was later amended by the Reagan crowd. We took \nSocial Security off-budget under President Bush, and now they are \nasking me to repeal that law by voting for section 7 of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  No way. The Social Security surplus is now almost $500 billion. By \nthe year 2002 we are supposed to have a $1 trillion surplus. But \ninstead, we keep spending it for foreign aid, for welfare, for all \nthese other things that you can possibly think of in the budget except \nSocial Security.\n  Here is Robert M. Ball. I ask unanimous consent that this entire \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Robert M. Ball,\n                                  Alexandria, VA, January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Last month the Entitlement \n     Commission, appointed jointly by the President and the \n     Congress, held its final meeting without coming to agreement, \n     but with many Commissioners issuing statements of their \n     individual views. I have been and remain greatly concerned \n     about the misinformation about Social Security that has \n     accompanied discussion of this last meeting and which \n     persistently accompanies so many discussions of Social \n     Security financing. Since most of my career has been devoted \n     to Social Security policy and administration, I feel \n     obligated to do what I can to set the record straight.\n       First, a word about my experience. I was U.S. Commissioner \n     of Social Security under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and \n     Nixon, and after leaving government I have continued to give \n     advice on Social Security to both the Congress and the \n     Executive Branch. I was a member of the statutory Advisory \n     Councils in 1979 and 1991 and am a member of the current \n     Advisory Council that is now studying the program and that \n     will report its findings and recommendations later this year. \n     I was also a member of the small negotiating group from the \n     Greenspan Commission which worked out the agreement with the \n     White House that led to the 1983 Amendments.\n       The Entitlement Commission looked at many programs in \n     addition to Social Security, and frequently in its \n     presentations lumped everything together, but it also, \n     correctly, made separate proposals and separate cost \n     estimates for Social Security. There was a consensus that \n     Social Security was adequately financed for a long time, but \n     not for the full 75 years for which the estimates are \n     traditionally made. What the Commission did not say, however, \n     is equally important.\n       The Commission did not find that Social Security benefits \n     would have to be drastically cut or contribution rates \n     greatly increased to bring the program into long-run balance. \n     True, some Commission members talked this way, one referring \n     to Social Security as ``unsustainable,'' and\n      the plan proposed by Chairman Kerrey and Vice-Chairman \n     Danforth would, over time, have resulted in benefit cuts \n     of over 40 percent for workers earning the average wage \n     (partly offset by a compulsory government saving plan, \n     also included in their recommendation). Such drastic cuts \n     were necessary in their plan because they nearly doubled \n     Social Security's estimated shortfall by cutting the \n     employee contribution, and then, in addition, greatly \n     over-financed the program, using the surplus to show a \n     smaller deficit in the rest of the budget.\n       But at the same time that Senators Kerrey and Danforth \n     submitted their preferred plan, they demonstrated that Social \n     Security could be brought into long-range balance with much \n     more moderate changes. The alternative they presented to the \n     Commission avoided any contribution increases and brought the \n     program into balance entirely by benefit cuts. Over the long \n     run, cuts for the average worker would have reached 15 \n     percent. Had they depended partly on contribution rate \n     increases (which would not have been necessary until some 25 \n     years from now), the benefit reductions, of course, could \n     have been cut in half, or reduced even more.\n       Four points about Social Security financing are critical \n     for an informed debate about Social Security's future:\n       First, Social Security is adequately financed for the next \n     20 to 25 years and consequently, as has been indicated by the \n     President and the Congressional leadership, no changes in \n     Social Security are needed for the next few years. However, \n     it would be desirable soon thereafter to balance estimated \n     income and outgo over the whole 75 years for which the \n     estimates are made.\n       The Trustees of the Social Security funds estimate that the \n     funding provided under present law will produce a continued \n     build-up in the Social Security Trust Funds until about 2020 \n     when the official estimates start to show a decline in the \n     funds and later on a shortfall. Although there is plenty of \n     time to await studied consideration of the best course of \n     action (including the recommendations to be made by the \n     current Advisory Council), it would bolster public confidence \n     in the program to put in the law soon changes to be effective \n     later that would eliminate the estimated long-run deficit.\n       Second, there are many ways of bringing Social Security \n     into long-range balance within the principles of the program \n     and avoiding most of the 15 percent benefit cut in the \n     Commission Chairman's ``modest'' alternative.\n       One way to produce balance, at least theoretically, would \n     be to: (a) accept the Commission staff's estimate of the \n     saving to Social Security of an expected Labor Department \n     correction of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (This alone \n     reduces the long range deficit by a third); (b) credit Social \n     Security with the proceeds of the 1993 tax increase on Social \n     Security benefits, just as the earlier taxing provisions \n     credited the proceeds to Social Security. (Adding this saving \n     to the CPI correction cuts the deficit in half.) In the 1993 \n     change, the proceeds\n      went to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund because the Budget \n     rules would have required 60 votes in the Senate to \n     increase income for Social Security; and, (c) schedule a \n     contribution rate increase in 2020 of one percent of \n     covered earnings each for employers and employees. (This \n     change would eliminate the other half of the deficit.) \n     Such a rate increase is not trivial, but is easily \n     supportable--offsetting only about 9 percent of the growth \n     in earnings projection between now and then.\n       Because the effect of the change in the CPI is uncertain, \n     and the saving in the staff estimate so large, I have \n     attached an illustration showing another way the program \n     could be brought into long-range balance with modest changes \n     and without relying on savings from the CPI revision. Of \n     course, there are many ways of combining more benefit cuts \n     with lower contribution rate increases than in the \n     illustration, including raising the first age at which full \n     retirement benefits are paid from the presently scheduled 67 \n     to, say, 68. The point here is simply that the alarmist \n     rhetoric used by some Entitlement Commission members about \n     the need for major cutbacks in Social Security is completely \n     unjustified.\n       Third, the estimates of long-range Social Security costs \n     and of the proposals for change take full account of the \n     retirement of the baby boomers.\n       It is now commonplace among journalists to assume that the \n     decline in the number of contributors per beneficiary, which \n     begins about 2010, will cause enormous problems for Social \n     Security as future workers face an ``impossibly large burden \n     of support for retirees.'' But this new rate does not come as \n     a surprise, and its effect has been included in the Trustees' \n     Social Security cost estimates and in the estimates for the \n     Social Security changes discussed here.\n       Stepping back from considering Social Security financing \n     alone, and looking instead at the basic economic question of \n     the burden of support of dependents, we find no problem at \n     all. In estimating the ability of a workforce to support \n     dependents, what counts is the ratio of all non-workers, old \n     and young, to the active workers producing the goods and \n     services on which all must depend. As the following numbers \n     indicate, the total dependency burden will never be as high \n     as it was in 1965 when the baby boomers were children.\nDependents--both those 65 and over and those under 20--per 1,000 active \n                                workers\n\nYear:\n  1965..............................................................946\n  1990..............................................................700\n  2010..............................................................652\n  2040..............................................................791\n  2070..............................................................828\n         \n       As economist Frank Ackerman has observed, ``If we could \n     afford to live through the childhood of the baby-boom \n     generation, we can afford to live through their retirement.''\n       (4) The widespread belief that Social Security is \n     contributing to the current budget deficit and has caused \n     part of the rise in the national debt is just wrong.\n       Since 1937, when Social Security first collected earmarked \n     contributions from employers and employees, $4.3 trillion has \n     been paid in and $3.9 trillion has been paid out, including \n     administrative expenses (now running at one cent for each \n     dollar of benefits). This leaves a balance of about $400 \n     billion, just about right today for a contingency reserve.\n       Social Security is a contributory program supported by \n     deductions from workers' earning, matched by employers (and \n     to a small \n     [[Page S3013]] extent by taxation of Social Security \n     benefits). As part of Social Security's financing plan, the \n     contribution rates are now producing surpluses and will for \n     many years. However, it would be bad policy if in order to \n     reduce the general deficit, Social Security were called on to \n     build greater surpluses than needed to finance the program. \n     Flat-rate earmarked deductions from workers' earnings are \n     justified as a way of paying for specified social insurance \n     benefits, but not as a substitute for the general taxes \n     needed to pay for other government services. Cutting Social \n     Security benefits to help meet the budget deficit while \n     imposing higher contribution rates than needed for Social \n     Security financing would be unfair and would certainly lack \n     public support. As the Commission concluded in its Interim \n     Report, any savings from Social Security changes ``should be \n     used to restore the long-term soundness of the Social \n     Security Trust Fund.''\n       The Social Security program deserves the bipartisan backing \n     it has enjoyed in recent years, not just because it is \n     popular, but because it works. It is our biggest anti-poverty \n     program, and, at the same time, it is a universal retirement, \n     disability, and life insurance system, important to just \n     about everyone. Social Security is keeping 15 million people \n     out of poverty and many millions more from near poverty. \n     Today the poverty rate for senior households is about 13 \n     percent, approximately the same as for the population as a \n     whole, but without Social Security, it would be about 50 \n     percent, and public assistance paid for by the general \n     taxpayer would be much, much larger. Social Security requires \n     all of us--provident and improvident alike--to join with our \n     employers in paying directly toward our own future security, \n     and thus holds down the need for public assistance.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  ILLUSTRATIVE PLAN TO BRING SOCIAL SECURITY INTO LONG RANGE BALANCE\\1\\ \n            [Figures shown are a percent of taxable payrolls]           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent estimate of long-range deficit................  .......     2.13\nExtend Social Security to the one-third of State and                    \n local employees not now covered (new hires only as                     \n was done when Federal employees were covered)\\2\\.....     0.23  .......\nCredit Social Security with the proceeds from the 1993                  \n tax increase on Social Security benefits\\3\\..........     0.36  .......\nCompute benefits over 38 years instead of 35 years as                   \n in present law.......................................     0.30  .......\nTax Social Security benefits for those who have                         \n incomes above $25,000 if single; and $32,000 if joint                  \n income tax filers, in the same way government career                   \n pensions and private pensions are taxed (that is, to                   \n the extent benefits exceed what the worker has paid                    \n in, computed individually)...........................     0.14  .......\nIncrease the contribution rate one percentage point                     \n each, for employees and employers, beginning in 2020.     1.12  .......\n                                                       -----------------\n      Total...........................................     2.15  .......\n                                                       =================\nInteraction among the various proposals...............     -.02  .......\nReduction in deficit..................................  .......     2.13\nDeficit after changes.................................  .......        0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Many other plans are easily developed, some reducing benefits more-- \n  for example, by raising the age of first eligibility for full benefits\n  to 68 instead of the presently scheduled age 67--other raising        \n  contributions more--for example, by moving the effective date of a    \n  rate increase from 2020 to 2010.

Time is of the \nessence here. We have to move along. Robert Ball has worked under \nPresident Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon and, after \nleaving there he has been the chief adviser to the Social Security \nAdministration and to the executive branch--total credibility.\n  I have another item. I ask unanimous consent this article in Business \nWeek dated February 20 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, Feb. 20, 1995]\n\n            Social Security: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Tinker\n\n                          (By Robert Kuttner)\n\n       Social Security is supposedly in long-term demographic \n     crisis--too many retirees living longer, not enough wage \n     earners to pay the freight. As a result, there have been \n     calls for reduced Social Security payouts, deferred \n     retirements, perhaps even means-testing. But a closer look at \n     the economic assumptions behind the Social Security Trustees' \n     Report reveals a very different sort of crisis--one that \n     calls for different solutions.\n       Social Security is financed by payroll taxes. Unless we \n     raise tax rates, growth in payroll-tax receipts will depend \n     on growth in taxable wages. The trustees project likely \n     annual real wage growth of just 1% per year over the next 75 \n     years. By contrast, during the past 75 years, annual real \n     wage growth was about 1.7%. Because of compounding, this \n     seemingly small difference puts the economy on a wholly \n     divergent growth trajectory. With 1% real annual wage growth, \n     Social Security will be hundreds of billions in the red. With \n     1.7% growth, the system will be in the black forever.\n       Why the trustees' pessimism? Wage growth has indeed been \n     dismal during the past two decades. From 1953 to 1973, annual \n     productivity grew by 2.3%, and wages grew annually at 2%. But \n     in the slow-growth decades from 1973 to 1993, while annual \n     productivity grew at just 0.9%, real wages actually \n     declined--an average of 0.2% per year.\n\n\n                              productivity\n\n       The key question is whether coming decades will resemble \n     the fat years or the lean ones. Here perhaps is some good \n     news. First, 1973-93 had unusual demographic trends unlikely \n     to be repeated. Baby boomers and women flooded into the \n     workforce, leaving less wage per worker. Baby boomers, male \n     and female, are now more experienced and presumably more \n     productive workers. Women workers are now being paid wages \n     closer to their male counterparts. On both counts, the one-\n     time depression in wages should be reversed.\n       A second source of lower wages has been the galloping \n     increase in the cost of fringe benefits. Wages are subject to \n     Social Security taxes; benefits are not. Here again, the \n     recent past does not predict the future. One way or another, \n     via market forces or government regulation, the escalation in \n     health premiums will level off. The other major fringe \n     benefit, pensions, is already declining as a share of total \n     compensation.\n       Third, many economists expect the boom in information \n     technology to translate, at last, into higher productivity. \n     Economic history suggests long lags between the introduction \n     of new, productivity-enhancing technology and its broad \n     economic diffusion. In addition, as Massachusetts Institute \n     of Technology economist Frank S. Levy notes, the productivity \n     gains of the 1950s showed up almost immediately in higher \n     purchasing power because they were concentrated in consumer \n     goods. The productivity improvements of the 1980s and '90s, \n     in contrast, have been in producer technologies. However, as \n     computers proliferate and information technology produces \n     productivity gains in everything from banking and retailing \n     to telephone service, these gains will likely yield gains in \n     real wages, too.\n\n\n                                Moronic\n\n       Offseting this optimism, however, are two other factors. \n     First, income distribution has become increasingly unequal. \n     If that trend continues, too few of the productivity gains \n     will show up in pay packets subject to payroll taxation. \n     Moreover, despite the new competitiveness and resulting low \n     inflation, the Federal Reserve seems determined not to let \n     the economy reach its full growth potential. But here the \n     solution is not to wreck Social Security. It is rather to \n     pursue policies that reverse the growing income inequality \n     and permit greater economic expansion.\n       Nobody, of course, can predict the rate of wage increases \n     75 years into the future. As one expert working on the Social \n     Security actuarial assumptions confesses, on deepest \n     background: ``The whole exercise, really, is moronic.'' \n     During the past 75 years, we experienced one entirely \n     unanticipated wage collapse, the Great Depression; an equally \n     unexpected stimulus to wage growth, World War II; and a third \n     unpredicted slowdown after 1973.\n       In truth, even under pessimistic assumptions, Social \n     Security will remain nicely in balance for at least the next \n     20 years. Whether the system goes into the red after that \n     depends on trends nobody can forecast with certainty. Rather \n     than hack away at Social Security, Congress should legislate \n     standby adjustments to take effect only if the doomsayers \n     prove right. We should continue to pursue economic expansion \n     and rising wages--both for Social Security and for their own \n     sakes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will just read one sentence there, by the \ndistinguished economist Robert Kuttner.\n\n       In truth, even under pessimistic assumptions, Social \n     Security will remain nicely in balance for at least the next \n     20 years.\n\n  We have the authorities. We know what is happening. But they have \nused this argument that Social Security is insolvent as the dark ink of \nthe octopus in order to confuse people.\n  [[Page S3014]] We face two arguments. One concerns discipline: \nCongress is never going to do it unless you put it in the Constitution. \nFalse. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nthat I wrote last year entitled, ``From Tragedy to Farce'' which \naddresses this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Mar. 1, 1994]\n\n  From Tragedy to Farce--If History Repeats Itself, a Balanced-Budget \n    Amendment Won't Force Congress To Be Disciplined--Just Creative\n\n                          (By Ernest Hollings)\n\n       Here's a terrific, no-pain solution to Washington's budget \n     deficit mess. Instead of cutting spending, raising taxes and \n     angering voters in an election year, why not zap the deficits \n     by simply declaring them unconstitutional? Why not a \n     balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution?\n       Mind you, I support the balanced-budget amendment, knowing \n     full-well it alone won't balance the budget. What I oppose is \n     the cynical selling of this amendment by politicians who have \n     no intention of following through with the nasty, wrist-\n     slashing work of actually balancing the federal budget.\n       Recall that Congress has passed a balanced-budget amendment \n     once before. It was called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Like \n     today's balanced-budget amendment, the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings amendment boldly promised a balanced budget in five \n     years' time. It, too, was embraced by big, bipartisan \n     congressional majorities and enjoyed public support. Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings cut the deficit to a low-water mark of $150 \n     billion, but was later gutted by a succession of budget \n     summits. The deficits exploded once again.\n                         lessons of a crack-up\n\n       A wise man once observed that history repeats itself, the \n     first time as tragedy and the second time as farce. The \n     balanced budget amendment could prove to be the ultimate \n     farce unless we learn from the mistake of the past. As a \n     veteran of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings crack-up of 1990, I \n     offer the following lessons.\n       Follow the money. The deficit this fiscal year, $223 \n     billion, is nearly the same as when we began the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings exercise in 1985. The difference is that, \n     after eight years of steady economizing, we have already \n     strip-mined the easy budget cuts. What's more, Congress last \n     year took the unprecedented step of imposing a hard freeze on \n     discretionary spending for the next five years. A balanced-\n     budget amendment on top of this will require cuts of nearly \n     $600 billion between 1995 and 1999.\n       Using the Congressional Budget Office's most recent \n     projections, to balance the budget by 1999 without new taxes \n     we would have to cut all federal spending (except mandatory \n     spending for judges' pay and interest on the debt) by $26 \n     billion in 1995, $73 billion in 1996, $119 billion in 1997, \n     $162 billion in 1998, and $205 billion in 1999. This includes \n     cutting Social Security by $130 billion by 1999.\n       Of course, Congress wouldn't dare cut Social Security by \n     one dollar. So exempt Social Security from cuts: now the \n     required across-the-board cuts rise from 10.7% to 14.2% in \n     1999.\n       Inevitably, other programs--including veterans' benefits, \n     military pay, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition \n     program--would also be sheltered from cuts. As the burden of \n     $600 billion in cuts falls on a smaller and smaller share of \n     the total budget, reductions of 20% and up would be required \n     in unprotected areas such as law enforcement, education and \n     environmental protection.\n       Beware of political chickens posing as budget hawks. Sixty-\n     one senators and 271 representatives hitched a ride on the \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bandwagon in 1985. But later, when \n     those same politicians were asked to cast tough votes to \n     actually cut the deficit, they lit out for the tall grass. \n     For example, in 1990 in the Senate Budget Committee, I \n     proposed a strict spending freeze to meet that year's Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction target; the most zealous \n     supporters of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings joined forces to kill the \n     freeze.\n       Face it, most members of Congress view a ``yea'' on the \n     balanced-budget amendment as a free vote. They get to preen \n     their deficit-hawk feathers in an election year, comfortable \n     in their belief that doomsday won't arrive until 1999.\n       The rule in Washington's budget battles is: ``Fight until \n     you see the whites of their eyes.'' The theory of the \n     balanced-budget amendment is identical to that of Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings: if you put a gun to Congress' head, Congress \n     will get discipline. The reality, however, is that when you \n     put a gun to Congress' head, Congress gets creative.\n       Bear in mind that both Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the \n     balanced-budget amendment are strictly process-oriented \n     mechanisms. Process can always be defeated by 3ore process. \n     The process of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was defeated by the \n     counter-process of the ``budget summits.''\n       History now repeats itself with the balanced-budget \n     amendment. Already the cloakroom conspirators are talking \n     about ``process reforms'' that will assist in ``balancing'' \n     the budget: moving more programs ``off budget'' and creating \n     a separate ``capital budget'' to finance ``investments'' with \n     deficit spending. What's more, the balanced-budget amendment \n     expressly allows Social Security Trust Fund surpluses to be \n     siphoned off to help ``balance'' the budget; in 1999 alone, \n     we will be robbing $100 billion from Social Security. \n     ``Balanced budget,'' indeed.\n\n\n                         avoid the gamesmanship\n\n       So let us debate, pass and ratify the balanced-budget \n     amendment. But let's avoid the gamesmanship that betrayed \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. If you're not for massive cuts in \n     federal spending, or for making up the difference with new \n     taxes, then hold the hypocrisy; vote no on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That was almost a year ago. I said at that time: Watch \nwhat they do, not what they say. Congress gets very creative.\n  Point: Right this minute, section 7 gives them creatively $636 \nbillion that they will not have to find in order to comply with the \nliteral wording of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Thus, in the year 2002, the budget will not be balanced. There will \nbe trillions of dollars worth of IOU's in the Social Security trust \nfund. But they will say, ``we have complied literally with the \nwording.'' That is one particular creativity that you see going on now \nthrough the violation of the Hollings amendment--a reason for calling \nthis a fraud.\n   I have made the tough votes. Just yesterday I voted to table Senator \nRockefeller's amendment to exempt veteran's programs from deficit \ncalculations. I helped coauthor the WIC Program, education programs, \nbut I would likewise vote against amendments to exempt them from \ndeficit calculations. Those programs do not have trust funds; we do \nunder Social Security.\n  There are other ideas of creativity around this town. Mr. Greenspan \nhas given cover to those who want to redefine CPI. Reducing it by 1 \npoint would forgo the need for an additional $150 billion in spending \ncuts over 5 years.\n  Similarly, there's a move not to continue with the pay-as-you-go \nprovisions requiring legislation outside the budget resolution to be \ndeficit neutral over 10 years. When President Clinton wanted a 5-year \nrule so he did not require the 60-vote margin on GATT, I held fast. I \nsaid, ``We have to maintain the discipline.''\n  When I offered an amendment to make the 10-year rule part of the \nCongressional Budget Act last week before the Budget Committee, \nRepublicans said, ``No, no, not now, maybe a later time would be \nbetter.'' They are going to get it a later time, that you can be sure \nof.\n  So there it is. You can see what is on course. The distinguished \nSpeaker of the House said earlier this year at a town meeting in \nKennesaw, GA:\n\n       We have a handful of bureaucrats who all professional \n     economists agree have an error in their calculations. If they \n     cannot get it right in the next 30 days or so, we will zero \n     them out. We will transfer the responsibility to either the \n     Federal Reserve or the Treasury or tell them to get it right.\n\n  That is what they are going to do. They are going to do away with the \nSecretary of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics because, if they \ndo not do it the way we want, we will get a different referee.\n  It is my hope that we will amend section 7 excluding Social Security \nso that we will pass this balanced budget amendment. They think they \ncan pressure old Hollings. But I stood for the truth in public service \nall my life. I found out it paid off. Let us sober up in this town, \nspeak the truth, and come under the auspices of the first thing we \npassed last month which puts Congress under the same rules as the \npeople outside this beltway. Let's have truth in budgeting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, not a day goes by that we are not shocked by \na violent crime described on the nightly news or in the newspaper. We \nlive in a world, in a country, in cities and towns, in which violent \ncrimes--murders, robberies, and rapes--have become commonplace. Within \nthis body, one Senator's wife was held at gunpoint in front of her \nhome, and another Senator's aid was murdered just a few blocks from \nthis Chamber.\n  The statistics are overwhelming. In 1993, the most recent year for \nwhich data are available, there were over 1.9 million violent crimes \ncommitted in this country. There were 24,530 murders. There were \n104,810 reported--Reported--forcible rapes. There were 659,760 \nrobberies. There were 1.135 million aggravated assaults. Clearly crime \nis a serious national problem which must be addressed.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a violent crime \noccurs in America once every 16 seconds.\n  And the stopwatch is set, as you can see, at 16. It represents one \nviolent crime every 16 seconds.\n  Someone is murdered every 21 minutes. A woman is raped every 5 \nminutes.\n  A robbery is committed every 48 seconds. One burglary is committed \nevery 11 seconds. One motor vehicle is stolen every 20 seconds. One \nproperty crime is committed every 3 seconds.\n  Today, Mr. President, Americans are over four times more likely to be \nthe victim of a violent crime than they were 30 years ago. This \nincrease has occurred during almost the same time period that I have \nserved as a Member of the Senate. In the past three decades, the rate \nof violent crimes has increased 364 percent--eight times faster than \nthe population of this country has grown.\n  This crime plague is no longer confined to urban areas and large \ncities. Administrator Thomas A. Constantine, of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, said it best when he recently testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       And this epidemic of violent crime is no longer confined to \n     big cities like New York or Los Angeles or Miami. It has \n     reached deep into our heartland. Last year, for example, \n     Indianapolis, Indiana, a city known more for its Midwestern \n     hospitality than its violence, recorded a homicide increase \n     of over 60 percent * * *. Homicides in Buffalo, New York, \n     increased by almost 20 percent from 1993 to 1994. And, in \n     Richmond, Virginia, homicides increased over 30 percent from \n     1983 to 1994.\n\n  My own State of West Virginia has prided itself for many years for \nhaving the lowest overall crime rate in the Nation. In West Virginia, \nunlocked doors and evening strolls have long been the way of life, but \nthat is changing, and it is a crying shame. Crime in West Virginia has \nincreased threefold since the 1960's. Over the past 5 years, the rate \nof violent crime in West Virginia has risen by 11 percent, a rise \ngreater than the national average. The numbers of murders, rapes, and \nassaults are climbing, and, paralleling the national pattern. Even the \nnumber of juvenile crimes in West Virginia is skyrocketing.\n  Now in West Virginia's small, rural communities, drugs are being \npeddled, children are shooting children, women are being attacked on \nthe streets in front of their homes, and families are connecting alarms \nto their bedroom windows.\n  Like so many other States, West Virginia has recognized the crucial \nneed to respond to rising crime rates by putting more police on the \nstreets, building more prisons, and providing better resources to law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. President, I have several charts that indicate the level of this \ncrime epidemic and how it is breaking out among the youth in this \nNation.\n  The first chart shows that the record level of all violent crime has \nrisen over the past decade. In 1985, approximately 1.3 million \nAmericans were victims of violent crime. In 1993, that number had risen \nto over 1.9 million Americans. That is a 45-percent increase in just \neight years!\n  The next chart shows the number of murders committed. In 1985, there \nwere 18,980, murders in the United States. In this same 8-year period \n(1985-1993), the number of murders per year had risen to 24,530. That \nis an increase of 29 percent!\n  The next chart is the most alarming. For in spite of all of our law \nenforcement efforts at the Sttate and national levels, press reports \nshow that juvenile crime is increasing at a breathtaking rate. From \n1984 to 1993, the juvenile arrest rate\n for murder has risen from 1,305 to 3,788. In other words, it almost \ntripled.\n\n  Mr. President, many of the advocates of this balanced budget \namendment have stated their intentions that defense and Social Security \nshould be spared from any of the cuts that will occur under this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget if it is, indeed, \nadopted by the Congress and ratified by the record number of States. I \nsay that again: The advocates of this ill-advised amendment have stated \ntheir intentions that defense and Social Security should be spared. But \nit does not make any difference what their intentions may be. It is \nwhat that constitutional amendment says. That is where the courts would \nultimately look. They will look within the four corners of the document \nitself, the amendment itself.\n  It does not make any difference what the advocates say. It is not \ntheir intention to do this. It is not their intention to do that. It is \nnot their intention to include defense. It is going to be exempted. It \nis not their intention to include Social Security. It does not make any \ndifference what their intention is. It does not say that in the \nconstitutional amendment itself. It does not say that defense will be \nexempted. It does not say the Social Security will be exempted. That is \nwhere one has to look to see what the amendment says and what it will \ndo.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yes, I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the Senator's study of this \namendment, about what the amendment does do and does not do, during the \ncourse of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, we had the testimony \nof Mr. Dellinger that was similar to the kind of testimony that was had \nduring the course of your own hearings about what the responsibility of \nthe Chief Executive might be if this were to go into effect.\n  There was very substantial constitutional opinion that a President, \nhaving sworn to uphold the Constitution, would therefore be required to \nactually impound the expenditures if the receipts and expenditures did \nnot balance.\n  This has not, really, been debated or discussed very much. I had \nhoped at some time to have an amendment to try to make sure that the \nSenate as an institution was going to have an opportunity to address \nthat issue. I understand that given our situation we may have to defer \nthe vote on that until Tuesday next.\n  I am interested in the Senator's concern about that particular issue; \nto \n[[Page S3016]] wit, that a President, should the balanced budget \namendment actually be ratified, would be put in a position that, having \nsworn to uphold the Constitution, that he may be compelled, himself, to \ngo ahead and impound the resources or funds or appropriations, and that \nthis would be something that would be a far reach from whatever had \nbeen thought of by our Founding Fathers or considered during the \nConstitutional Convention, which I know the Senator has talked about \nduring the earlier discussion and debate.\n  I just wonder whether the Senator from West Virginia, as one who \nchaired those hearings, had heard a considerable amount of debate and \ndiscussion about this issue, whether he had formed any opinion or \nwhether he himself was concerned about the ambiguity. The reason I \nbring this up, as the Senator was just pointing out to the Members that \nthere is so much that is left unsaid and so much left unstated and so \nmuch left up in the air, this, too, might be something that at least, \nas far as the Senator from West Virginia is concerned, would be left up \nin the air prior to consideration or prior to the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nquestion. It goes right to the heart of the matter. During the hearings \nthat were conducted last year by the Appropriations Committee in 1993, \nthe year before last, during those hearings several constitutional \nscholars were invited to appear before that committee. I was then the \nchairman.\n  All of those constitutional scholars who appeared before that \ncommittee had a great concern with respect to this constitutional \namendment. As precisely as I recall, the same amendment--I do not think \nany changes had been made in it since those hearings were held. I \nbelieve that it is, word for word, as it was then.\n  Most all of them, if not all, were concerned about the very \npossibilities that the Senator has stated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield, Mr. President, on this point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have the hearings here, the excerpts. \nHere Archibald Cox, in his statement, talks about impounding funds \nunder some appropriations, while continuing spending under others. \n``Probably this would be the sensible course; but it means that the \nproposed amendment would enlarge the power of the President, vis-a-vis \nthe Congress.''\n  That is Archibald Cox who indicated that that power would be with the \nPresident. And Walter Dellinger, who is a distinguished constitutional \nscholar, was asked, ``Would the amendment authorize the President to \nimpound funds?''\n  Mr. Dellinger said, ``Yes, I think it would.''\n  And Charles Fried, who was a distinguished Solicitor General during \nthe Reagan period, when asked during the course of hearings, he said \nthat ``total outlays shall not exceed total revenues.''\n\n       If in the course of a budget year earlier projections prove \n     false, this provision would offer a President ample warrant \n     to impound appropriated funds. In the past such impoundments \n     were based on claims of the President's inherent powers.\n\n  Coming close to the point of voting on the Senator's amendment--and \nthe Senator was talking about the ambiguity of this amendment, about \nwhat was included and what was not--at an appropriate time, I will \noffer an amendment that will make it clear, that opportunity for the \nSenate to go on record that we do not believe we should give that kind \nof a power, the power of general impoundment, to a president, if this \nwere to go into effect.\n  The principal reason I asked the Senator from West Virginia is \nwhether he feels that this is an issue that ought to be addressed as \nwell, in the course of the debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do.\n  I think there is very much a likelihood that power would be shifted \nfrom the legislative branch to the executive and to the courts. I can \nimagine easily the situation in which the Congress failed to enforce \nthe amendment by appropriate legislation.\n  By the way, the President can veto that ``appropriate legislation'' \nif he does not agree with it. I can see a situation in which the \nCongress failed to enforce and implement the article, in which case the \ncounsel to the President would advise the President: Mr. President, \nthis budget is out of balance. People on Capitol Hill, just like they \nwere back there when they adopted the amendment with flying colors, if \nit is so adopted, they still do not have the spine that that amendment \nwas supposed to implant in their frail bodies. And, consequently, Mr. \nPresident, it is up to you to see that this is done. We recommend that \nyou impound moneys.\n  The President would say: Naturally, well, I cannot do that, because \nof the 1974 Budget Impoundment and Control Act, I cannot do that.\n That would be against the law.''\n\n  The council would say, ``Well, Mr. President, there is now a higher \nlaw. It has been written into the organic law of this country; \ntherefore, you are bound, upholding your oath of office, to balance \nthis budget.'' And the President would impound moneys.\n  Of course, then matters would get into courts because some of the \npeople, some of the citizens who are entitled under the laws to receive \ncertain funds, certain payments from certain programs would say, \n``Well, look, the book says I'm entitled to'' thus and so. They go into \nthe courts and the courts will be brought into the action. There is \nnothing in here that forbids courts to enforce this amendment, nothing \nin here that requires them to enforce it. Those constitutional \nscholars, many of those professors, as the Senator has pointed out, who \nappeared before the Appropriations Committee, so stated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, in the Senator's review of those debates \non the power of the executive and legislative branches that took place \nat the Constitutional Convention, does not the Senator feel that this \nis really standing the whole Constitution on its head in terms of how \nour Founding Fathers view the delegate powers to the executive and to \nthe legislative branches? Does this not really effectively corrupt the \nwhole separation of powers, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, as \nto the taxing authority and the executive authority?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has asked a very timely and decisive question. \nIf Congress does not enforce this amendment, once it is in the \nConstitution, if it were not enforced, then that would be the other \nnightmare. One can speak of all the nightmares that would occur during \nthe enforcement of this amendment.\n  If it is not enforced, on the other hand, that constitutes another \nnightmare in that the faith and confidence of the American people in \nthe Constitution of the United States will be damaged, and the \nConstitution will suffer thereby.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I be correct in concluding, when Senator Johnston \nand I have an opportunity to offer an amendment that would just state, \n``Nothing in this article shall authorize the President to impound \nfunds appropriated by Congress by law or to impose taxes, duties or \nfees,'' that the Senator would support that amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to read the language, but I am certainly \nsupportive of the concept and would, in all likelihood, support the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for yielding for those questions. I \nhope to have an opportunity to submit that amendment and to speak to \nthe amendment and have an opportunity to vote on it. I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  John Marshall said that this Constitution is intended to endure for \nages to come and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of \nhuman affairs. I think we are going very much against what John \nMarshall said and we will, in my judgment, be committing a horrible and \nunforgivable blunder if we adopt this amendment.\n Furthermore, as Senators are aware, the so-called ``Contract With \nAmerica'' contains a massive tax cut. If we exempt defense and Social \nSecurity from budget cuts and if we adopt the tax cuts called for by \nthose who signed onto the so-called ``Contract With America,'' and if \nwe pay for the interest on the national debt, then every other program \nin the budget would have to be cut by 30 percent across-the-board in \norder to achieve budget balance by the year 2002.\n  [[Page S3017]] It is clear, then, that a balanced budget amendment \nwould have a catastrophic impact on Federal law enforcement and our \nefforts to combat violent crime in America. In the words of the \nAssistant Attorney General, Sheila F. Anthony:\n\n       * * * Congress should be keenly aware of the impact that \n     such an amendment could have on the essential operations of \n     the federal government in general, and of the Department of \n     Justice in particular. In a word, the impact could be \n     devastating!\n\n  It would significantly setback any progress that this Nation has made \nin combatting violent crime, the importation of illegal drugs, and \nillegal immigration. Instead of bolstering and enhancing our law \nenforcement programs as proposed in the FY 1996 budget, we will be \ndismantling and disarming our side in the war against violent crime, \nand retreating in our efforts to control our Nation's borders.\n  I think it is important to take a brief look at what has happened to \nlaw enforcement funding during the past few years in response to the \nrising tidal wave of crime. When I assumed the chairmanship of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee in January 1989, the Department of \nJustice budget stood at $5.4 billion. The budget for Treasury law \nenforcement bureaus was $2.083 billion. The Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund did not even exist. That was just 6 years ago. And during \nthat period of very tight limitations on discretionary spending--with \nthe help of our subcommittee chairmen, Senator Hollings and Senator \nDeConcini, and the leadership of our authorizing committee\n chairman, Senator Biden, and the support of members on the other side \nof the aisle, such as former Senator Rudman, Senator Domenici, Senator \nBond, Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, and, of course, Senator \nHatfield--we put forth aggressive efforts to fight the war on violent \ncrime.\n\n  Last August, we sent an appropriations bill to the President that \nprovided the Department of Justice with budgetary resources totalling \n$13.7 billion--a funding increase of over 250 percent in just six \nyears. For the Department of Treasury law enforcement programs, fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations totaled $2.8 billion, or a 36-percent increase \nsince 1989. And, we provided $38 million to the Departments of Health \nand Human Services and Education, for crime prevention programs that \ndid not exist in 1989. We aggressively attacked the crime problem \nbecause the people were demanding that the issue be addressed. And they \nwere right to demand it because their demand got results. This \nincreased spending has been well worthwhile. It is providing a big bang \nfor the buck, but not big enough.\n  For example, look at our Federal Bureau of Prisons. In 1989, our \nFederal Prison System housed 54,000 inmates and had an operational \nbudget of $1.2 billion. We made resources available to build additional \nprisons and have continued to provide increased funding for prison \nguards and support personnel to activate those prisons. The Federal \nPrison System's annual budget has doubled since 1989 to $2.6 billion. \nIn 1995, our Federal Prison System will house over 102,000 inmates. In \njust six years we have doubled the number of criminals who have been \nput away under lock and key and taken off the streets so that they can \nno longer terrorize law-abiding citizens.\n  But, the greatest growth in Department of Justice appropriations has \nbeen in Federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. \nIn 1989, the Congress provided $229 million in such assistance. In \n1995, the Justice Department will make available almost $2.4 billion \nfor state and local law enforcement assistance programs. Much of this \nincrease was provided through appropriations which funded the new \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly called \n``the crime bill.''\n  Appropriations were also increased for the main investigative and \nprosecutorial divisions of the Department of Justice--the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshal, \nand U.S. Attorneys. Total funding for these bureaus has been increased \nfrom $2.5 billion in 1989, to $4.5 billion this year.\n  For FY 1996, the President's budget proposes to continue large \nincreases for the Department of Justice and Federal law enforcement. \nThe budget proposes to increase the Department's budget from its \ncurrent level of $13.7 billion to $16.5 billion. That is an increase of \n$2.8 billion in just 1 year,\n for the activation of prisons and the construction of new prisons in \nTexas, California and Hawaii. In the next 5 years, as prisons under \nconstruction are activated and brought on line, we will be adding \n30,000 new prison beds to the Federal system. The 5-year budget \nprojections for the Federal Prison System call for the agency's \noperating budget to rise from its current level of $2.3 billion to over \n$3.5 billion. Please note, this increased requirement will occur during \nthe same period that the balanced budget amendment calls for the budget \nto be balanced.\n\n  For the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the President's \nbudget request proposes an increase of $442 million or 21 percent. It \nwould provide for 700 new Border Patrol agents, 680 new inspectors for \nborder crossings, and 165 support staff so agents can patrol the border \nand not spend their time performing paperwork. And the budget proposes \nto increase by $170 million payments to States for the cost of housing \nincarcerated illegal aliens in State prisons.\n  With respect to total law enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernments, this is again the area of the largest increases in the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget. For the Justice Department, the \nbudget would increase such assistance by almost $1.6 billion or 66 \npercent. The budget contains $3.965 billion for programs such as, Byrne \nformula grants, community policing, juvenile justice programs, violence \nagainst women, and prison grants. Again, much of this assistance--\n$3.456 billion or 87 percent--would come through appropriations \npursuant to the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established in the \n1994 crime bill.\n  The President's budget has proposed that violent crime prevention \nprograms operated by the Departments of Education and Health and Human \nServices be increased. In fiscal year 1996, it proposes $175 million \nfor prevention programs financed through the new Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund, an increase of $137 million above current levels. \nThese programs will help local communities strengthen their prevention \nefforts through economic partnerships, before and after school \nprograms, rape education and prevention programs, shelter grants for \nbattered women, and demonstration grants.\n\n\n    impact of balanced budget amendment on law enforcement programs\n\n  Mr. President, with a balanced budget amendment in force we will \nlikely not be seeing that continued enhancement of law enforcement the \nPresident has described in his budget proposal. Unless we exempt \nFederal law enforcement and violent crime programs, we will destroy \neverything that has been achieved since 1989. We will be sounding the \nretreat in our war against crime and backpeddling on our hard won \nefforts to protect law-abiding citizens.\n  If the Federal law enforcement and violent crime reduction and \nprevention programs receive their fair share of reductions required by \nthe balanced budget amendment, then the following types of impacts \nwould occur:\n  For example, the Federal Prison System will not be bringing new \nprison beds on-line this year. It will not be adding another 30,000 \nbeds and new prisons in the next 5 years as prisons are delivered by \ncontractors and come out of the pipeline. We will not provide for the \nnew staffing and operational requirements to operate these facilities. \nNo, instead the Bureau of Prisons would have to close 37 of the 79 \nexisting Federal prison facilities. We would either have to let \nprisoners go, or crowd over 100,000 Federal inmates into the remaining \nfacilities. Overcrowding would be at over 250 percent. Let me say that \nagain. Overcrowding would be at over 250 percent.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in local newspapers about \novercrowding and violence at the District of Columbia's Lorton prison \nfacilities just 20 miles south of here. That is what the future holds \nfor our Federal prisons under a balanced budget amendment, with the \nbalancing done on the back of non-defense discretionary programs.\n  Secondly, a balanced budget amendment would severely set back, if not \ntotally destroy, our efforts to combat \n[[Page S3018]] illegal immigration and control our borders. At the very \ntime the Mexican peso is being devalued and the economic attraction of \nthe United States is greatest, we would be letting down our guard.\n  We would not be providing the increased numbers of Border Patrol \nagents and inspectors proposed in the fiscal year 1996 budget. We would \ninstead be laying off or ``RIF'ing'' agents that we added during the \npast 2 years, and would go well below the staffing levels in effect \nwhen I took over as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The \nBorder Patrol would be reduced by approximately 1,600 agent and support \npositions. INS inspectors would be cut by approximately 400 positions. \nThe INS detention and deportation program would be reduced by over 500 \npositions.\n  The impact of reductions of this magnitude cannot be overstated. The \nlack of patrols will allow more illegal aliens to cross the border and \nreach the United States. Patrols in critical choke points such as San \nDiego, California, and El Paso, Texas, would have to be cut back. The \nstaffing reductions at ports of entry would cause horrendous traffic \njams at the border, and would have a negative impact on commercial and \nnoncommercial traffic to and from Mexico and Canada. The number of \naliens who could be detained and the number of removals which could be \naccomplished annually will drop. This would facilitate efforts by \naliens to abscond and remain in the country illegally.\n  Moreover, a balanced budget amendment would also have a debilitating \nimpact on our Federal investigative and prosecutorial agencies.\n  The U.S. Attorney offices across the country would have to \nsignificantly reduce the number and experience level of Assistant U.S. \nAttorneys. The Federal Government would have to decline to prosecute \ncases where there is shared jurisdiction with State and local laws. At \na time when violent crime is the foremost concern of American citizens, \nthe U.S. Attorneys would not have the resources necessary to prosecute \nviolent offenders in a timely manner.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration are personnel intensive and would be severely impacted \nby reductions necessitated by a balanced budget amendment. The FBI \nwould lose over 4,100 agents and over 5,000 support positions. The DEA \nwould have to cut 2,000 positions, including almost 900 agents. Both \nthe FBI and DEA would have to discontinue hiring and training of new \nagents. Both agencies would have to reduce investigative operations and \nfocus solely on crimes that are Federal in nature. The FBI and DEA's \nsupport to State and local task forces, such as Safe Streets, would \nhave to be disbanded. Finally, both agencies would have to close small \nrural offices across the country.\n  Additionally, with respect to State and local assistance for law \nenforcement and prevention of violent crime, the balanced budget \namendment would undo much of the progress made in last year's crime \nbill. We would have to make severe reductions to a number of programs, \nincluding community policing, grants to construct prisons, programs to \nprevent violence against women, Byrne formula grants, and crime \nprevention programs. Valuable prevention programs, like the Community \nSchools Program and the National Domestic Hotline run by the Department \nof Health and Human Services, would have to be reduced significantly. \nNew prevention programs authorized from the Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund, such as community programs on domestic violence, grants for \nbattered women's shelters, education to prevent and reduce sexual abuse \nof runaway children--would never get off the ground.\n  This would have a staggering impact on programs designed to prevent \ndomestic violence and rape. For example, failing to fund the Crime \nTrust Fund programs on rape prevention would deny services to 700,000 \nwomen in fiscal year 1996. Eliminating the domestic violence \ndemonstration program would deny critical education services designed \nto prevent domestic violence to nearly 2 million Americans.\n  A balanced budget amendment would also force significant reductions \nin the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms at the Department of the \nTreasury. ATF would be reduced by some $116 million, or one-quarter of \nits size and personnel. Investigations of armed career felons using \nfirearms to commit crimes would be substantially curtailed. This would \nresult in more illegal firearms on the streets being used for illegal \nactivities. The National Tracing Center, which aids in tracing weapons \nused in crimes, would be virtually inoperable. Recent gun legislation, \nsuch as Brady and the assault weapons ban, could not be effectively \nimplemented. The balanced budget amendment would essentially undo \neverything the Congress has done in this area in the past 10 years.\n In addition thereto, even the U.S. Secret Service, with its very \nessential mission of Presidential protection, would likely be cut under \na balanced budget amendment.\n\n\n           exempting law enforcement and prevention programs\n\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It provides Federal \nlaw enforcement, and violent crime reduction and prevention programs \nwith the same protection as we assume would be accorded the Department \nof Defense and Social Security. These crime control programs, in fact, \nare defense and security programs. They are domestic defense programs \ndesigned to protect Americans against threats to their security and \nsafety.\n  Without my amendment, the balanced budget measure likely would \ndebilitate Federal law enforcement and violent crime reduction and \nprevention programs. It would largely nullify the crime bill.\n  My amendment protects the Senate's commitment to the war on violent \ncrime, and our efforts to combat illegal immigration. It sends the \nright signal to organized crime, to drug smugglers, to those who commit \nviolent crimes. And, it sends the right signal to the man and women \nserving our Nation--to FBI agents, to DEA agents, ATF and Customs \nagents, to U.S. prosecutors and Border Patrol agents out on the line. \nAnd, it sends the right signal to the American public that we are not \ngoing to undo the progress that we have made.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the past 6 years \nand as a Member of this body, I have worked very, very hard to provide \nthese law enforcement programs with the resources necessary to fight \ncrime.\n  As I said earlier I was joined in this by the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, former distinguished Senator, Mr. \nDeConcini, from Arizona, and Senator Hatfield, the then-ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee, now the chairman, and the subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees to which I have \nalready alluded.\n  Look at the record. As I have stated, enhancements in Justice and \nTreasury law enforcement programs to combat violent crime was carried \nout on a bipartisan basis. I would hope that we could continue to \naccord these law enforcement and violent crime reduction and prevention \nprograms with protection on a bipartisan basis now.\n  This Senator is surely not going to let this progress be undone if he \ncan help it. I am not sure that I can. That would be my desire and \nhope. If it is the will of this Senate to balance the budget on the \nback of law enforcement, then we must ensure that the funding for these \nprograms is protected.\n  We have talked a great deal about the Constitution in this debate but \nlet me take a moment here and read from another great document which \nhas also been an inspiration to generations of Americans, The \nDeclaration of Independence.\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these \n     Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever \n     any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it \n     is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to \n     institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such \n     Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to \n     them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and \n     Happiness.\n\n  Note the words ``Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n  There is one murder every 21 minutes in this country. Are we \nguaranteeing \n[[Page S3019]] the unalienable right of life? There is one forcible \nrape every 5 minutes in America and one violent crime every 16 seconds \nin the United States. What about the unalienable rights of life and \nliberty in light of those chilling statistics? There is one burglary \nevery 11 seconds and one property crime every 3 seconds. Have we done \nour job in protecting the pursuit of happiness? These are dismal, \ndismal numbers and they rob our people daily of their lives, their \nliberties, and their happiness.\n  This balanced budget amendment and the cuts it will most assuredly \nimpose upon funding that is designed to protect the life, liberty, and \nthe safety of our citizens in their homes and on their streets will \nlessen our ability to provide our people with what to me is a basic \nright--namely freedom from the terror of violent crime.\n  Unless we continue our strong commitment to keep the criminals off \nour streets, track them down, lock them up, and reclaim this violent, \nviolent country, we will be failing in our duty to provide our people \nwith their basic right to safety.\n  Our children are increasingly under the influence of drug dealers. \nOur schools, in many communities, are hotbeds of crime and drug use. \nLife, limb, and personal property are daily at peril in America, and we \nowe our law-abiding citizens every effort we can muster to control the \nawful scourge of violent crime in America. The enemy within can be \nevery bit as dangerous as the enemy from without. The rampant plague of \ncrime threatens the very fiber of American life, and government must \nnot turn away from its duty and commitment to make America's streets \nsafe once again.\n  It is a priority. It takes money to fight crime, money to lock up \ncriminals, money to stop the drug dealers. And unless we protect our \nlaw enforcement effort from the deep chop of the balanced budget knife, \nthat money will not flow to the cities and towns of America and the \nthugs and the criminals will win.\n  Arguments rage about what government ought and ought not to be doing \nin this land, but I believe that there can be little disagreement about \ngovernment's role with regard to battling crime and protecting law-\nabiding citizens at risk from thugs and drug dealers. We must protect \nthe effort we have begun. We must insulate our law enforcement efforts \nfrom the slash of the budget ax. The crime clock is ticking. Let us \ntake this step to slow the bloody whirl of its hands.\n  Mr. President, there was a time agreement on this amendment. Whatever \ntime I have used, I will be happy to charge it against the time that \nwas on the amendment or I will be happy to cut down on the time, if the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah wishes to do so. I apologize for taking \nthis amount of time. I hope I am not cutting out the time for my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 301\n\n   (Purpose: To protect Federal outlays for law enforcement and the \n               reduction and prevention of violent crime)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 301, which is at the \ndesk, and which is on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 301.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 8, strike ``principal.'' and insert \n     ``principal and those for law enforcement and the reduction \n     and prevention of violent crime.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, can I inquire how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the present agreement the time is \ncharged to the amendment as offered and it is the opinion of the Chair \nthat the Senator began to speak at 2 o'clock, the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time I have \ntaken making my statement be charged against the time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is my understanding there was a desire to start voting \nat 3 o'clock?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague. \nAs usual, he is always very gracious. I understand the time for the \nvoting will begin at 3, so this will be the third vote.\n  If I could just say a few words about the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe my record on fighting for crime control \nlegislation is equal to that of any other Member in this body. Violent \ncrime is rampant in our society. The distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has made that case, and the American people have demanded that \nwe respond to this crisis as well.\n  Indeed, the issue is far too important for our Nation to be used as a \npolitical football, and I do not accuse the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia of doing that. But I do believe that it deserves effort \nother than on the balanced budget amendment. His amendment to exclude \nspending for law enforcement and the reduction and prevention of \nviolent crime in the constraints of the balanced budget amendment is in \nreality, in my opinion, a spending loophole that has very little to do \nwith addressing our people's very real fear of violent crime.\n  There are those of my colleagues who would argue that this amendment \ncreating a crime loophole in this constitutional amendment is a \nresponsible thing to do. They would have the rest of us, as well as the \nAmerican people, believe that this loophole would not be abused. But I \nhave to disagree. Let me just give an illustration here.\n  When the violent crime reduction trust fund provision passed the \nSenate as a part of H.R. 3355 on November 19, 1993, it authorized that \n$22.268 billion, the anticipated savings from reductions in the Federal \nwork force, be placed in a segregated trust fund over 5 years. This \nmoney was to be used only for crime fighting programs authorized in the \ncrime bill. Moreover, discretionary spending cap reductions were \nincluded to ensure that the creation of this trust fund would not \nincrease the budget deficit.\n  Now, let me take a minute to remind my colleagues what happened to \nthe trust fund provision before it returned to the Senate as a part of \nthe conference report on the crime bill.\n  This chart shows it. ``The Crime Bill Trust Fund Social Spending \nSpigot'' is what this particular chart is called. It shows the \nadditions to the crime bill, as originally passed, both by the Senate \nand as enacted. When we got through with the Senate, we had added the \nOunce of Prevention Council, $75 million; community schools, $400 \nmillion; National Community Economic Partnership, $40 million; local \ncrime prevention block grants $391 million; $300 million for drug \ntreatment in State prisons; $900 million more for drug treatment, which \nsome of our colleagues were not all that enthusiastic about but we \nagreed to. By the time it got through the House and through the \nconference committee, look at how that increased. It jumped from $2.186 \nbillion in social spending to $5.390 billion, and we had things in \nthere like the FACES Program; the Local Partnership Act, which is just \na gift to the cities without any restraints whatsoever; the model \nintensive grants program.\n  I could go through each one of those and explain how hardly any of \nthe money would go to fight crime. Look at the assistance for at-risk \nyouth; $3 million for urban recreation and at-risk youth, community-\nbased justice grants, drug treatment of Federal prison and police \nrecruitment grants.\n  Look at how everything else jumped, too. These add-ons in the Senate \nall jumped again, this time immeasurably, like this one from $75 \nmillion jumped; this one for community schools, $400 million to $566 \nmillion; National Community Economic Partnership from $40 million to \n$271 million. Local crime prevention block grants actually went down. I \nhave to give credit for that. And then the others, of course, we have a \nnumber of programs that were not even in the mix.\n  This is precisely why we need a balanced budget amendment. Somewhere \nbetween the Senate and the House of Representatives we went from $2.168 \nbillion in add-ons, to $5.390 billion in what was really characterized \nas absolute pork barrel spending.\n  Really, the Local Partnership Act was a provision--this right here, \nthe Local Partnership Act--$1.622 billion was a thinly disguised \nretread of the \n[[Page S3020]] President's failed economic stimulus bill from the \nprevious years. Proponents threw in the catchy phrase ``to prevent \ncrime'' a few times, and, thus, managed to expropriate $1.6 billion in \ncrime control funding for education, substance abuse treatment, jobs \nprograms to ``prevent crime.''\n  The Model Intensive Grant Program, right here, for $625 million was \nto be directed by the Attorney General to fund up to 15 model programs \nfor crime prevention in chronic, high-intensive crime areas.\n  The criteria for the programs were very general, allowing recipients \nto spend money on virtually anything, so long as the applicant for the \nfunds claims the spending is linked to crime control, no matter how \ntenuous the link. This includes spending on ``deterioration or lack of \npublic facilities,'' inadequate public facilities such as public \ntransportation, as well as unemployment services and drug treatment.\n  I could go through all of the rest. There are some perfect examples \nhere of how much we jumped the bill from $2.186 billion to $5.390 \nbillion. These are excesses that we pointed out, that I think made a \ndifference in the last election.\n  My point is this: I know that the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is sincere. I know that he is well-intentioned here. If we \ncreate a loophole like this in the name of trying to solve violent \ncrime, we are not doing any better than we were before. We have shown \nyou that, frankly, Congress is not serious about keeping spending under \ncontrol. We are going to spend our country right directly into \nbankruptcy. To jump $2.186 billion, after both Senator Biden, the \nleading Democrat in the Senate, and I put our names on that bill--that \nbill would have passed overwhelmingly through both bodies. Then, by the \ntime it went to the House it was larded up like never before. That is \nthe reason to have a balanced budget amendment.\n  The violent crime reduction trust fund created an irresponsible \nincentive to redefine programs with no clear relationship to crime \nfighting as anticrime measures in order to secure funding for them \nunder this trust fund.\n  By my count, the violent crime reduction trust fund became a magnet \nfor at least 16 social spending programs, as shown by this chart. \nIndeed, this understates the record, because some of the worst \nboondoggles were collapsed into the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant \nProgram. And as the chart also shows, an additional $3.2 billion was \nauthorized to be spent out of the trust fund to pay for these programs \nin addition to the $5.390 billion.\n  How much more tempting is it going to be for Congress to convert \npopular spending programs into anticrime measures when such a \ndefinition is the only way in which to avoid the tough choices required \nby the balanced budget amendment? This exemption will create a \nconstitutional shell game.\n  The example of the violent crime reduction trust fund amply \ndemonstrates that when Congress is given an easy loophole to pass \npopular-sounding programs, it takes it. This is not a partisan \naccusation; it is an unfortunate fact of congressional life. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this loophole for spending under the guise of law \nenforcement, and the reduction and prevention of violent crime. This \namendment is not about crime control, and the American people deserve \nbetter.\n  We talk about law enforcement. We talk about civil law enforcement as \nwell as criminal law enforcement. Those terms are not defined in the \namendment. The ``reduction and prevention of violent crime.'' What does \nthat mean? When is there a violent crime? We all know one when we see \none. But on the other hand there are a number of other things that are \ncalled violent crime that we may think are not so violent. There are a \nlot of issues that are really not addressed by this loophole that would \nbe created here.\n  What does my colleague intend to bring within the definition of ``law \nenforcement''? Does he include spending for enforcement of our civil \nlaws? If he says yes, then every Federal agency which has civil \njurisdiction could be exempt; HHS, Education, et cetera. If he says no \nto it, then perhaps my colleague should have drafted the amendment to \nbe a little more specific.\n  What does my colleague from West Virginia intend to include within \nthe definition of ``the reduction and prevention of violent crime''? \nDoes he mean to include the programs contained in the 1994 crime bill? \nThese programs right here? These are just some of them. Does he mean \nall of these or does he mean a whole raft of others? If so, then I \nassume he means to include the job training programs. There are 163 of \nthose. Will they all be exempt from the balanced budget amendment? \nThere are 163 actually currently administered by 15 departments at a \ncost of $20 billion annually; almost $25 billion, if the truth is \nknown. Is that all going to be exempt from a balanced budget amendment?\n  What does my colleague mean when he proposes to place in the \nConstitution a special carve-out for spending on the ``prevention of \nviolent crime''? Does this include the amount spent to restore civil \norder to Haiti? Does DOD spending on interdiction fall within this \nexception? If it does, then all of these are loopholes through which \nthey could drive anything.\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will vote down this \namendment. I know my colleague means well. But we are talking about the \nConstitution and we cannot afford to do this. So I hope that we can \nvote this down.\n  I know the time is up.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope that Senators will reject the tabling \nmotion. This amendment will exempt spending for law enforcement and for \nreducing and preventing violent crimes from the requirements of this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, this amendment is a substitute \namendment. Essentially, it is the balanced budget amendment as \npresented with Social Security excluded using the exact language of the \nReid amendment. It is word for word the original balanced budget \namendment excluding Social Security.\n  It is cosponsored by Senators Ford, Hollings, McCain, Bumpers, \nMikulski, Harkin, Kohl, Daschle, Reid, and Dorgan.\n  Mr. President, I believe this substitute amendment plays a pivotal \nrole as a vehicle to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  We hope to debate it further and take the vote on this on Tuesday.\n  Let me just point out that as it currently stands, the balanced \nbudget amendment essentially would utilize about $705 billion of FICA \ntax revenues--those are taxes paid for retirement--for purposes of \nmasking the debt and balancing the budget. Many of us do not believe \nthis is right. We do not believe it is morally right, and we do not \nbelieve it is ethically right.\n  The only way to protect Social Security, to keep it out of the \nbalanced budget amendment, is by exempting it through this substitute \nconstitutional amendment. As I previously stated, the exact words of \nthe Reid amendment are included and incorporated within this substitute \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  We will be speaking and arguing further for it, I hope, on Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the \namendment is temporarily set aside and the Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 291\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 291.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 8, after ``principal.'' insert ``The \n     receipts and outlays of the Tennessee Valley Authority shall \n     not be counted as receipts or outlays for purposes of this \n     article.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is fairly \nstraightforward.\n  Last week, Mr. President, we had a debate and a vote on a motion I \nproposed which would have had the effect of nullifying the provisions \nof the committee report to the Judiciary Committee which created a \nspecial exemption for the Tennessee Valley Authority Power Program. The \nTVA was the only Federal program mentioned in the entire committee \nreport that was given this kind of special treatment.\n  Although we did not prevail, my motion received bipartisan support. \nSince that time, a number of Members have come up to me and told me \nthat it was right to pursue what I like to call this constitutional \npork. Members who were both for and against the balanced budget \namendment appear to have been taken aback at the audacity of the TVA \nsupporters to insert this kind of provision into the actual legislative \nhistory of the constitutional amendment.\n  A number of organizations supporting the balanced budget amendment, \nsuch as the National Taxpayers Union, the Concord Coalition, and the \nCitizens Against Government Waste have also indicated that they did not \nagree with the idea of placing this language in the committee report \nfor only one special program. Some said it was just plain wrong to do \nit.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, I recognize that the proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment are determined that no amendments or motions, \nwith the exception of the Dole second-degree amendment with respect to \nSocial Security and the right-to-know amendment, would be adopted. That \nhas been an open goal that has been achieved thus far.\n  Mr. President, what I propose to do is to offer this amendment which \ntracks the language that was placed in the committee report that \nexempted TVA from the balanced budget amendment and then urge that my \namendment be rejected. In other words, this is an opportunity for the \nSenate now to go on record to oppose this special treatment provided \nfor the TVA in the committee report and, at the same time, in no way \nwould disturb the balanced budget amendment itself. The Senate would \nsimply go on record showing that we do not want this kind of protection \nguaranteed for one program and not others.\n  By offering this amendment and asking that it be rejected, the entire \nSenate would have the opportunity to reject the committee language and \ntherefore nullify its impact as legislative history when the courts get \naround to interpreting the balanced budget amendment and, for that \nmatter, when this Congress or future Congresses get around to balancing \nthe budget.\n  So, Mr. President, our action to reject this amendment does not \nanswer the question of whether TVA should have any of its subsidies cut \nwhen the Congress gets around to try to achieve a balanced budget \namendment. What it does say, and all it says, is that the TVA should be \non the table just like every other Federal program, including Social \nSecurity, which, at this point, is still on the table.\n  If Congress decides, as some TVA proponents claim and as is stated in \nthe language of the committee report, that the electric Power Program \nis paid for entirely by the ratepayers, then Congress can act \naccordingly at that time. If they win that argument, so be it.\n  If, however, Congress decides that the appropriations to TVA for its \nstewardship program is subsidizing its Power Program, or if Congress \ndecides that the TVA ought to pay for the overhead cost of selling its \ndebt obligation and low-interest loans, or if Congress decides there is \nsome other inappropriate subsidy, then it will be free to make those \ndecisions.\n  The point is, these are issues that Congress needs to decide, not as \na part of the process of proposing a balanced budget amendment, but as \na part of the process of making the tough choices. These options should \nnot be curtailed or limited because the TVA proponents have been \nsuccessful in slipping favorable language into the committee report at \nan earlier stage.\n  Mr. President, yesterday morning, as we went into session, I had a \nchance to hear Chairman Hatch resume the debate on the balanced budget \namendment. This is what the chairman said the principal justification \nfor the balanced budget would be. He said, ``The balanced budget \namendment would introduce an element of competition into the spending \nprocess;'' that every program would have to compete. He said programs \nwill not be allowed to simply show that they by themselves are \nmeritorious, but they are going to have to show they are meritorious in \nthe context of the whole budget picture. He said it will not be enough \nfor a program just to show that it is worthy, but that it has to be \nworthy compared in the context of the whole; that it actually is a \npriority item.\n  It was this very rhetoric, Mr. President, that encouraged me to \nreturn to this subject and to make sure that the Senate as a whole is \nclear about its intent on this matter and not just let it be decided by \nsome committee language which the courts would feel constrained to \nrespect.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there may be some on the other side \nof this issue who will argue that the Senate's rejection of this \namendment should not be interpreted as rejecting the committee report \nlanguage, but rather simply an expression of the view that the language \nreferring to the TVA should not be in the Constitution itself.\n   [[Page S3023]] Mr. President, just so the legislative history is \nclear on the issue, I am the author of this amendment and the intent of \nthe author of the amendment is crystal clear. The TVA should not have a \nspecial status carved out for it under the balanced budget amendment. I \nam seeking to have the Senate reject this amendment so the full Senate \ncan go on record as saying that TVA, like other programs, is going to \nbe on the table when Congress starts cutting Federal subsidies to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  Notwithstanding what other statements the proponents of the language \ninserted in the committee report may make, the author of the amendment \nintends the vote to serve as a repudiation of the notion that the TVA \nhas some special protected status. And I trust that those who seek to \nuse legislative history as a guide in interpreting the amendment, \nshould it be ratified, will give due weight to the author of the \namendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur in relation to the amendment No. 274 on Tuesday, February 28, at \n2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nvote occur in relation to amendment No. 291 on Tuesday, February 28, in \nthe stacked sequence to begin at 2:15 p.m., and that the pending motion \nto table be vitiated and Senator Dorgan be recognized to move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President it is my intention to move to table \namendment 291.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, with his motion to \ntable, is his intent the same as my intent on the previous motion to \ntable, which is to make it clear that the Senate does not seek to \nexempt the Tennessee Valley Authority from the balanced budget \namendment and to override the committee language to that effect?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator states it correctly; that is exactly the \nintent of my motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur on Tuesday under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the parliamentary procedure is that there is \ntime for debate or discussion of the amendment just moved to be tabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore time has expired, so debate can be \non any topic at this particular time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask recognition then, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is to be \ncommended for his efforts on this issue. He cares about it deeply, and \nI understand that. Furthermore, he has used a unique parliamentary \nsituation in an attempt to achieve the outcome that he desires. \nUnfortunately for him and fortunately for me and for the other \nsupporters of the TVA exemption, he has come close but has not \nsucceeded in his quest. For reasons that I will go into in a minute, \nhis amendment simply will not work.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has proposed through four different \namendments to change the legislative history on this particular matter. \nBecause he is reasonably confident that the supporters of the balanced \nbudget amendment will vote down the motion that he proposes, the Senate \nwill have gone on record as being opposed to excluding TVA or like \nagencies from the balanced budget amendment.\n  He has gone on record as saying he will vote to table his own \namendment, from which he now has backed up and had a neutral Senator, \nso-called neutral Senator, come in and move to table.\n  For an answer to why he would do such a thing, let us look at the \namendments he proposes. Each amendment would add the following sentence \nto the end of section 7 which otherwise describes House Joint \nResolution 1 as covering all receipts and all outlays of the United \nStates except borrowings. Amendments 291 and 292 are identical and they \nsay:\n\n       The receipts and outlays of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     shall not be counted as receipts and outlays for the purpose \n     of this article.\n\n  Amendments 293 and 294 are identical, and I quote:\n\n       The receipts and outlays of all quasi-Federal agencies \n     created under authority of Acts of Congress shall not be \n     counted as receipts and outlays for the purposes of this \n     article.\n\n  Each amendment would have the effect of creating an exemption to the \ngeneral coverage language of House Joint Resolution 1. Nos. 291 and 292 \nwould exempt all receipts and outlays of TVA; 293 and 294 would exempt \nall receipts and outlays of quasi-Federal agencies.\n  All of the Feingold amendments are broader than the scope of the \nlegislative history contained in the Judiciary Committee's report.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me repeat that. We are talking about \ndeveloping legislative history here. All of the Feingold amendments are \nbroader--broader--than the scope of the legislative history contained \nin the Judiciary Committee's report and extend its exemption to funds \nfor which no exemption justification has been provided. That is the \nfact.\n  Amendments numbered 291 and 292 would exempt all funds of TVA.\n   TVA operates with two distinctly different kinds of funds. Let me \nrepeat that. TVA operates with two distinctly different kinds of funds. \nIt receives appropriations from Congress to cover its nonpower \nprograms. These are like funds received by all other Federal agencies \nand there is no reason why they should be specifically exempted. The \nfunds of TVA's electric power program are an entirely different matter \nand it was only these funds to which the committee's legislative \nhistory was directed. The legislative history of the committee was \ndirected only at the electric power program.\n\n  You can hear all you want to hear and you can say all you want to \nsay, but the committee legislative history is very, very narrow. \nAmendments Nos. 293 and 294 would expand the exemption to all funds. \nThat is the Senator's amendment, now, of quasi-Federal agencies. First \nthe term quasi-Federal agency has no meaning, absolutely no meaning. It \nis only a phrase, loosely used to refer to agencies which in some way \nor another may not fit the speaker's view of what is an ordinary \nFederal agency. Moreover, the term does not address the more important \nissue of how the agency is financed. Even an agency which might be \nregarded as quasi-Federal may have certain funds \n[[Page S3024]]  which should not be exempted from the balanced budget \namendment. As noted above, TVA itself is an example of two separate \nfunds, one from the utility, the ratepayers, and the other one that is \nappropriated by the Congress.\n  Do any of the amendments have merit? Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 \nwould have merit if their inserted sentence were modified to read as \nfollows: The receipts and outlays of the electric power program of the \nTennessee Valley Authority shall not be counted as receipts and outlays \nfor the purpose of this article.\n  As so modified, they would expressly state the intent of the language \ncontained in the Judiciary Committee's report.\n  The Feingold amendments as currently written could be defeated while \nstill reaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the \ncommittee report. The Feingold amendments can be defeated while still \nreaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the committee \nreport.\n  I do not know how many judges are going to be looking at the \nlegislative history and see the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, \ndid not move and was not allowed to move to table these amendments. I \nhope I have that much authority that, boy, they will see whether \nSenator Ford moved to table or not. But, boy, that is great. You have a \nlot of influence, want to influence the court--legislative decisions in \nthe future. It is right interesting procedure.\n  The Feingold amendments as currently written could be defeated while \nstill reaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the \ncommittee report.\n  Amendments Nos. 293 and 294 certainly should not be adopted. The term \nquasi-Federal agency has no clear meaning. I want to reinforce that. \nThese amendments would make open-ended exemptions for an uncertain \ngroup of Federal agencies--an uncertain group--regardless of their \nbudget impact on the taxpayers.\n  Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 also should not be adopted since they \nwould exempt all TVA programs, not just the one program, the power \nprogram, for which an exemption makes sense. Indeed, the amendments \nappear to be a somewhat disingenuous attempt to get supporters of the \nbalanced budget amendment to back an exemption for ordinary \nappropriations-funded programs. In contrast, the language of the \nJudiciary Committee makes it very, very clear--a clear distinction \nbetween those two entirely different kinds of programs.\n  Let us look at why the TVA power program should be exempted. The TVA \npower program is financially independent from the rest of Government. \nJust take that one sentence. The TVA power program is financially \nindependent from the rest of Government. It survives only on the \nrevenues it receives from sales of electric power. Those revenues \nsupply the funds to pay its expenses. Those revenues are also the only \nsecurity for power program borrowing. Take those two things and look at \nthem very closely and think about them very closely. It survives only \non revenue it receives, and the revenue it receives pays its expenses \nand is the only security for the funds it borrows.\n  Power bonds are, by law, neither obligations of nor guaranteed by the \nU.S. Government. Power bonds are, by law, neither obligations of nor \nguaranteed by the U.S. Government. Taxpayer funds are not used for the \npower program. Even capital and operating expenses for TVA's \nmultipurpose dams are allocated to power and nonpower, and the power \nprogram pays its share.\n  TVA power program activity is not driven by Presidential or \ncongressional policy decisions. It is driven only by the needs of the 8 \nmillion persons and businesses who rely on it as their sole source of \nelectric power. Its annual receipts and its expenditures are governed \nonly by what is necessary to meet their electric power needs, both \ntoday and in the future. Although the power program's annual budget is \nincluded in the President's and the congressional budgets, its \ninclusion is for information purposes only. It does not require \ncongressional approval or congressional action. In other words, the TVA \npower program budget is a budget estimate. It is not a budget request.\n  Another way of looking at why the TVA power program should be exempt \nis to examine what could happen if it were not exempt. A low tax \ncollection year or one in which entitlements or appropriations were \nlarge could result in TVA's being unable to borrow the funds necessary \nto build or maintain generating plants to ensure a continued supply of \nelectric power to a large area of this country, in spite of the fact \nthat taxpayers are not responsible for paying off these bonds.\n  Finally, as Congress seeks to reduce Federal mandates, should it add \na new mandate for persons in one region of the country who happen to \nreceive their electric power without a taxpayer subsidy from TVA? It \nmakes as much sense for Congress to control Wisconsin Electric's annual \nbudget as it does to control that of the TVA power program.\n  Let us look at the difference now between this proposal and Social \nSecurity. The level of Social Security receipts is determined by a \nCongress-approved tax rate. The level of Social Security outlays are a \nfunction of a Congress-approved benefits scheme. In contrast, TVA's \npower program budget is provided to Congress each year for \ninformational purposes only. It does not require congressional approval \nor action.\n  So, in conclusion, I and other supporters of the TVA exemption are \nvoting to table this amendment, not because it would reaffirm the \nreport language, but because this amendment goes too far. It goes way \nbeyond the scope of the Judiciary Committee statement about TVA. Some \nparts of TVA are like all other Federal agencies and should be included \nin the budget just as any other, and we do not object to that. However, \nas I have stated previously, the funds of TVA's electric power program \nare an entirely different matter, and it was only those funds to which \nthe committee's statement was directed and that is the committee \nlegislative language.\n  For these reasons, and these reasons alone, I am voting to table the \namendment by my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think at the outset it is appropriate \nto state that what we are dealing with here is a straw man. An attempt \nis being made to make it appear that a Government spending program is \nbeing exempted from the balanced budget amendment. Of course, everyone \nunderstands that--with the statute that we are dealing with and with \nthe language that they are dealing with--that is not the case. Now we \nare arguing among ourselves as to who gets to beat up the straw man \nfirst and who gets to put the first wound on him and the straw man that \nwe all know is going to be defeated. That is the process that we are \ninvolving ourselves here in this historic moment when we are trying to \naddress the real issues concerning a balanced budget amendment. It is \nunfortunate but true.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from Wisconsin has now \noffered an amendment which he wants to have defeated. I am happy to \nlend my assistance. I believe we have now reached an illogical \nextension of this debate by some of those who oppose the balanced \nbudget amendment. In an attempt to defeat the balanced budget \namendment, amendments are now being offered that even their sponsors \nwant defeated.\n  After failing a few days ago to exclude language from the committee \nreport, the Senator from Wisconsin now proposes to include the language \nin the Constitution of the United States with yet another amendment. I \nfind this strange even by Washington, DC standards. If as much effort \nhad gone into balancing the budget over the last few years as has gone \ninto this exercise, we would not need the balanced budget amendment.\n  In the lowest courts of record of this Nation, involving the most \ninsignificant boundary line dispute or intersection fender bender, one \nwho submits a pleading attests that it is made in good faith and that \nthere is reason to believe that there is merit in the matter that is \nbeing asserted. Apparently, that rule does not apply when it comes to \noffering an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  [[Page S3025]] We are debating and will soon be voting on one of the \nmost important matters to ever come before this Congress, and \namendments such as these trivialize this process. While there is no \nlogic to this maneuvering, the purpose is clear--to hamstring and \ndefeat the last clear chance we have in this country to develop some \nfiscal responsibility in our governing process. The purpose of such \namendments is first and last to defeat the balanced budget amendment. \nSuch amendments are not designed to ensure that spending projects are \ncovered by the balanced budget amendment. Rather they are designed to \nensure that no spending program whatsoever is restrained by a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  As I understand it, what brought about this momentous issue was \nlanguage in the Senate Judiciary Committee report which stated:\n\n       Among the federal programs that would not be covered by \n     S.J. Res. 1 is the Electric Power Program of the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority.\n\n  Of course, what has not been publicized very much is the following \nlanguage; the next sentence in that report, as a matter of fact. It \npoints out that since 1959 the financing of that program has been the \nsole responsibility of its own electric ratepayers, not the U.S. \nTreasury and the Nation's taxpayers. Consequently, the receipts and \noutlays of that program are not a part of the problem that Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is directed to solving.\n  This language, of course, states the obvious. The financing of the \nTVA power program is done by the electric ratepayers. There is no \noutlay of Federal funds with regard to this program. If the TVA power \nprogram runs short, the TVA ratepayers must make up the difference. The \nTVA does not operate like Amtrak or the Postal Corporation where \nFederal taxpayers pay the difference between receipts and outlays. The \nJudiciary Committee report language does not make the Federal taxpayer \nresponsible for the TVA power program. It simply restates what has been \ntrue since 1959 when the TVA power program became exclusively \nresponsible for its own receipts and outlays.\n  Now as I understand it, the Feingold amendment tracks the committee \nreport language to an extent. The Senator from Wisconsin is apparently \nunder the impression that by offering his language and having it voted \ndown, it will in some way negate this legislative history. Of course, \nit will not.\n  In the first place, the Senator's language covers receipts and \noutlays of all TVA activities, including its nonpower activities. These \nhave always been on budget and are covered by the balanced budget \namendment, as they should be. Therefore, the Senator's language is much \nbroader then the committee report language. And voting down the \nSenator's language which includes TVA's nonpower activities will in no \nway affect the legislative history that pertains only to the power \nprogram.\n  However, even if the proposed amendment tracked the committee report \nlanguage exactly, it would still be of no effect because, again, the \nreport language simply states the fact that there are no Federal \noutlays with regard to the TVA power program. Thus it along with some \nother programs, is not covered by the constitutional amendment. If the \nSenator is under the impression that a decision by this body not to \nmake such a clearly inappropriate matter a part of the Constitution of \nthe United States of America in some way changes the facts contained in \nthe language, then I submit that he is again sadly mistaken. By the \nsame token, if someone proposed an amendment enshrining the law of \ngravity into the Constitution and it were voted down as inappropriate, \nobjects would still fall to the floor when dropped.\n  Therefore, since the adoption of the Feingold amendment would have \nthe effect of taking the TVA nonpower program off budget, and since the \ndefeat of the Feingold amendment would have none of the significance \nits sponsor wants to attribute to it, I join the Senator from Wisconsin \nin urging the defeat of his own amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me express my pleasure to the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Tennessee for supporting in \neffect my motion to table and the motion to table of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. That is exactly what I had hoped they would indicate. I \nbelieve that the only reason we are having this discussion at this \npoint is quite simply that somebody pulled a fast one here in the \ncommittee and now we are out on the floor actually discussing it.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. For a question.\n  Mr. FORD. Is the Senator aware that every amendment to the \nConstitution--this is not an accident--that TVA power was included; \nthat the same statement has been in every committee report that the \nJudiciary Committee has issued on a balanced budget amendment in the \nlast 10 years?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be happy to yield for the question.\n  Mr. FORD. That is the question. Was he aware of the fact?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am aware of the fact, and I told the Senator from \nKentucky that I just got here 2 years ago. And, yes, I confess I did \nnot discover this language until this year. I did not find this little \ncaper in there until now.\n  Mr. FORD. It is no caper.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Had I been here 10 years ago, maybe it would have taken \nme 3 or 4 years to find it. But there it is. I wish I had found it last \nyear. But fortunately I have had an opportunity to join the Judiciary \nCommittee now, and my staff had more of a chance to find these things. \nWe found it. It is time to get rid of it.\n  Mr. President, there was an effort here to try to undo the real \nintent of the balanced budget amendment. There is an attempt, a classic \nattempt, to abrogate, to say you are for the balanced budget amendment, \nbut say, of course, that it does not apply to my State, to my program. \nI think there is not a reasonable person who would not agree that this \nis part of the problem. It is always easy to support cuts if it does \nnot affect your own home State.\n  However, this notion of actually putting the exemption into the \nConstitution, which my opponents on this are being very candid about \nnow--they are saying that is exactly what you are trying to do--is \nsomething new. The other side is trying to exempt TVA. It is not just \nidle talk. The purpose of the committee language is to exempt it. That \nis why they are trying to make this distinction between my motion to \ntable and committee language.\n  But it is not working because everyone knows what the intent is of \nthe people who put it in there. And everybody knows what my intent is. \nIt is laid on the record. In fact, Mr. President, today in the \nWashington Post, there is an editorial entitled ``Constitutional \nPork.'' It is all about this problem, this committee language.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Washington Post, \ndated February 23, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 1995]\n\n                          Constitutional Pork\n\n       Tucked away in the Senate committee report on the balanced \n     budget amendment are three sentences about the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority, the most important of which reads: ``Among \n     the Federal programs that would not be covered by S.J. Res. 1 \n     is the electric power program of the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority.''\n       What that means is that assuming the courts follow \n     legislative intent, the Tennessee Valley Authority--which \n     provides power to the people of the south-central states--\n     would have the distinction of being the one agency excluded \n     from the impact of the balanced budget amendment. The \n     rationale for this, offered by Sens. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) \n     and Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), is that, as Mr. Thompson put it, \n     ``the financing of the TVA power program has been the sole \n     responsibility of its electric rate payers, not the U.S. \n     Treasury and the nation's taxpayers.''\n       Not exactly, says Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who is \n     trying to eliminate the TVA protection. Mr. Feingold notes a \n     1994 Congressional Budget Office study which estimated that \n     raising the rates paid by TVA users to cover various costs \n     associated with land and water management in its system could \n     cut federal outlays by as much as $70 million annually. ``TVA \n     supporters know that TVA is on the short list of most deficit \n     reduction advocates,'' Mr. Feingold declares, ``and that is \n     why they want to provide it with special protection that no \n     other program of any kind in the federal government is \n     getting.''\n       [[Page S3026]] Mr. Feingold surely has the better of this \n     argument. If TVA is in no way either part of the deficit \n     problem or potentially part of the solution, why do Sens. \n     Heflin and Thompson need to insist on special language \n     protecting the program? And if TVA is indeed a drain, then \n     the two senators and their colleagues in the region should \n     not be given free passes to tell their constituents that they \n     voted for a balanced budget amendment and protected the TVA. \n     If they really think the balanced budget amendment is such a \n     good idea, they should be willing to vote for it without this \n     provision, which Mr. Feingold refers to as ``constitutional \n     pork.''\n       Mr. Feingold lost a vote last week on a motion to strip the \n     language in the committee report protecting TVA, though he \n     won significant Republican support. Now he plans to try to \n     call the bluff of his opponents by proposing to add specific \n     language to the amendment protecting the TVA. His hope is \n     that most senators will be too embarrassed to do directly in \n     the text of a constitutional amendment what they tried to do \n     in slippery fashion in the committee report. If the Senate \n     refused to include the TVA protection in the amendment, this \n     would create a different ``legislative history'' and \n     discourage courts forced to deal with the budget amendment in \n     the future from giving TVA priority over other programs.\n       The entire episode, as Mr. Feingold notes, underscores the \n     folly of trying to deal with budget issues through a \n     constitutional amendment. A balanced budget amendment could \n     move the most basic of legislative questions (such as the \n     future of the TVA) out of the legislative process and into \n     the judiciary, which is exactly where they don't belong. The \n     Senate should surely give no special protections to the TVA. \n     Just as surely, it should vote the balanced budget amendment \n     down.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, fortunately this editorial lays out \nexactly the intent, my intent, the intent of the Senator from North \nDakota, and that is to undo, explicitly undo, what was done in the \ncommittee; to say that the Senate as a whole would table such language \nthat would have the effect of exempting either all or part of the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky indicated that I had put \nfour amendments in for possible introduction as amendments, and that is \ncorrect. But I have chosen one amendment and that amendment is this \none. It is the one that, by its rejection, overrides the language of \nthe committee report. It would have the effect of overriding the \ncommittee report by tabling the very language from the committee \nreport. That is the purpose of amendment No. 291.\n  It is not a disingenuous attempt. It is the only way I could think of \nto override the effect of this committee report which the members did \nnot explicitly consider.\n  Everybody should understand there was not a point in the process of \nthe consideration of the balanced budget amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee where we all said, ``OK, let's decide if the TVA should be \nexempt or not.'' The whole process was done and the committee report \nwas written, and then it was thrown in there, presumably at the staff \nlevel. That is how it was done. And I guess that is the way it is done \nwhen it is business as usual, when you are trying to protect your own \npork but at the same time you are saying you are for a balanced budget. \nIt is a lot better to do it in a quiet staff room than it is to do it \nout on the floor of the Senate or even in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is what was done here.\n  I assure everyone who is looking at this what was done here was \nsomething people did not want us to know about.\n  My intent is not something any judge is ever going to have to wonder \nabout. The Senator from Kentucky says they are going to have to be able \nto read it and limit it some way. But I laid my intent right on the \nrecord. The purpose of the motion to table is to override the committee \nlanguage that seeks to exempt the TVA. Whether it seeks to exempt part \nof the TVA or all of the TVA or something in between, the intent of the \nmotion to table, as explicitly stated by the two Senators who have \nmoved to table, is to override the committee language. Now, I wonder \nhow a court will have any trouble figuring that out. Clearly, they know \nthe difference.\n  In fact, this is a very interesting proposition in terms of \nlegislative history. What is being suggested here is that, even if the \nU.S. Senate as a body explicitly votes to table certain language, the \ncourts are going to find the committee report to be more persuasive \nthan the rollcall vote of the Members of the U.S. Senate. I doubt it. I \nwould not bet the farm on that interpretation of legislative history. I \nthink you will find you will come up wanting with that approach.\n  So let us be clear. My intent and the whole purpose of this is to not \nallow a committee report to find its way into constitutional \ninterpretation or to exempt some or all of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority.\n  Let us get back to the real issue here. The real issue is: Why do I \nhave to even be out here at all? Only because something was attempted \nwhich no one would try to do out here on the floor, to exempt one \nparticular program from one particular area while everybody else has to \ncompete fairly.\n  So I am very happy about the way the record stands now. And I am a \nlot happier than I was when I did not have these two Senators \nsupporting me on the record to override the intent of the committee.\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few words about the other issue that \nhas been raised about this notion that somehow the TVA has nothing to \ndo with the Federal budget. That is what they are saying. This is a \ngreat deal, they say. We are making money on it, they say. It is a good \nthing for the Federal Government, which it may well be.\n  But the point is, there are an awful lot of people that think it is a \nloser or it is time to phase it out. It was a wonderful thing when \nFranklin Roosevelt brought this forth, and it really helped that area \nof the country during the Depression, but it is not open and shut at \nall that this program is a moneymaker for our country. In fact, an \nawful lot of people think it should be one of the top items for cuts. \nThat is what the National Taxpayers Union has said. That is what the \nCongressional Budget Office has said. That is what a number of pieces \nof legislation already introduced this session by Members of both \nparties and both Houses have said.\n  Let me read briefly from the ``CBO Reducing the Deficit: Spending and \nRevenue Options,'' March 1994.\n\n       Because many of TVA's stewardship activities are necessary \n     to maintain its power system, their costs would more \n     appropriately be borne by users of the power. . . Direct \n     costs to the Federal Government could be reduced by about $70 \n     million annually if the TVA were to increase power rates or \n     fees to cover costs of all stewardship activities. . .\n\n  A very different view than this view has been offered out here that \nsays it has nothing to do with Federal dollars.\n  Let me cite from the ``Department of Energy Federal Energy Subsidies: \nDirect and Indirect Interventions in Energy Markets,'' November 1992.\n\n       When compared with interest rates paid by investor-owned \n     utilities, the TVA is estimated to have benefited from a \n     subsidy of $231 million in FY 1990.\n\n  A few pages later, the report says:\n\n       Historically, TVA was granted subsidies in the form of low-\n     interest loans, debt forgiveness, and lower payments in lieu \n     of taxation.\n\n  In fiscal year 1988, TVA received a subsidy--a subsidy, Mr. \nPresident--of $661.9 million in the form of lower payments in lieu of \ntaxes, and that $661.9 million ``* * * can be counted as revenue losses \nto all levels of government.''\n  This is real money. It is almost up to the point where, as the former \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Dirksen, said, we are talking about real \nmoney from the Federal Government transferred away from our ability to \nbalance our budget.\n  The report also says, TVA\n\n       . . . Sells a large portion of its debt to the Federal \n     Financing Bank (FFB). . . . TVA's ability to access FFB acts \n     as a subsidy in two ways. First, TVA does not incur any \n     expenses to underwriters or marketing expense when it goes to \n     the FFB. Second, it obtains financing at lower interest rates \n     through the FFB.\n\n  So I will concede this to my friends on this issue, this is \ndebatable. Yes, it is debatable whether or not the Federal Government \nhas to pay out directly or indirectly to the TVA. But there is one \nthing that is clear and it is that at a very minimum it is debatable \nand that we cannot resolve it here today and that this is not the place \nto be resolving it.\n  Why are we resolving it today? Because certain Senators decided that \nthey should not have to go through that same scrutiny that all the rest \nof us do, which is that later on, whether we pass the balanced budget \namendment or not, we have to all get out here and fight and fight hard \nfor our own programs and our own home States.\n   [[Page S3027]] I see the Chair is from a dairy State. I am from a \ndairy State. Would it not be nice to have a constitutional exemption \nfor the dairy program? But that is not the way this process should \nwork, and we all know it. It is not fair. It is just not fair to exempt \none program and let everyone else in this country have to fight like \nheck to protect the hard-working people in their home States, all of \nwhom, I assure you, in every one of these 50 States, have arguments \njust as worthy.\n  So this attempt to enshrine this in the Constitution is one that is a \nbit of an embarrassment, it seems to me.\n  All I am trying to do here--and apparently we will prevail on this \nnow--is to just get rid of it. A mistake was made by trying to do this \nin the Judiciary Committee. We all make mistakes, and it is \nunderstandable, certainly not the most horrible thing that was ever \ndone around this place. But when you make a mistake, it is time to \nclean it up and correct it. Our motion to table cleans up the mistake \nand returns to a notion of fair play, whether the balanced budget \namendment passes or not.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess I am going to have to leave it to the \nfuture. We have to see if the balanced budget amendment passes. We have \nto see if it gets ratified. But some day maybe somebody will take a \nlook at this record, and I guess they are going to have to decide which \nside was playing games, which side was trying to pull a fast one, and \nwhich side was just trying to put everybody on the same playing field.\n  I am absolutely confident that when the courts look at this, when the \nCongress looks at this and, most importantly, when the American people \nlook at this, they will all conclude that one side was trying to have \ntheir cake and eat it, too--to pose for the holy picture and say you \nare balancing a Federal budget but to still keep the pork in your own \nback yard. That is an outrageous example of trying to have your cake \nand eat it, too. All we are trying to do is clean it up.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n                  Amendments Nos. 259 and 298, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to call up two amendments, \nNos. 259 and 298.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are you calling them up en bloc?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am calling them up en bloc, and I am going to debate \nboth of those amendments. Then I will ask for a rollcall vote on each \nof those amendments in that sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. GRAHAM] proposes amendments \n     en bloc numbered 259 and 298.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 259\n\n       On page 2, line 8, strike ``held by the public''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 298\n\n       On page 2, line 8, after ``increased,'' insert ``except for \n     increases in the limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public to reflect net redemptions from the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Would it be \nappropriate at this time to ask for the yeas and nays on amendments \nnumbered 259 and 298?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are pending. It would be appropriate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second at this \npoint. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the Senator called up his amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have called up the amendments 259 and 298. I have asked \nthey be voted on in sequence. I am now asking that that vote be by \nrecorded vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may, Mr. President, as I understand it, all \namendments will be voted on after 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table both amendments, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I asked for a rollcall on the yeas and \nnays on this, with the intention of then presenting a discussion on \nthese amendments.\n  I ask, if the Senator is going to ask for a tabling motion, that he \nwithhold until after we have had an opportunity to debate the two \namendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. I leave the motion to table there and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator be given more time if he needs to debate the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Are the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not understand what the Senator from \nUtah said. A motion to table normally shuts off all debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that we move to table both \namendments, and that debate continue after the motion to table, after \nreceiving the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is there agreement for time on this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I anticipate my presentation will take \napproximately 15 to 20 minutes, and I know the Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, wanted to ask some questions of my amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Finally, Mr. President, if I may ask the distinguished \nSenator from Utah how long are we planning to go tonight?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not much longer, as far as I am concerned. I think after \nthese two amendments, I will be happy to see if we could start to wind \ndown. I understand that there may be a Kennedy amendment that will be \noffered afterwards, and a Nunn amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wanted to offer an amendment following \nthe Senator from Florida with the idea that we could debate it for \nawhile, until we wanted to go out, and have it begin in the morning \nfirst thing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, that will be fine. I understand that \nSenator Kennedy has an amendment, and also Senator Nunn may have an \namendment. Any way we can work it out, I am happy. I am amenable to \nanything the Senator from Arkansas and his colleagues would like to do.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have no objection. We will discuss this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the two \nmotions to table the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry. Have motions to table--with the \nyeas and nays--been ordered on each of the amendments, all up to date?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered on the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment, as well.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Florida yield for a moment for a \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to offer \na motion for an amendment at the desk immediately following conclusion \nof the debate on the Graham amendment.\n  [[Page S3028]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There being \nno objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. We have ordered the \nyeas and nays on these two amendments, on motions to table amendments \nnumbered 259 and 298; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                       Amendments No. 259 and 298\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am offering these two amendments, both \nof which relate to section 2 of the proposed constitutional amendment, \nwhich is one of the most important, and I suggest, least understood \nprovisions in this constitutional amendment.\n  If I could, I would like to read the language of section 2. The very \nfact that it is the second section of this amendment, coming \nimmediately after the section which states the basic principle that the \nFederal Government shall balance its revenues and expenditures, is \nindicative of the importance which the authors of the amendment attach \nto section 2. I will discuss that further in a moment.\n  Section 2 reads as follows:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Within those words, constituting one sentence of the balanced budget \namendment, are a number of important policy considerations.\n  My amendments focus on one of those policy implications which \nconstitute just four words in the section. Those are the words ``held \nby the public.'' The requirement of a three-fifths vote of the whole \nnumber of each House is applied to raising the debt ceiling as it \nrelates to that debt held by the public.\n  I was curious as to what the rationale behind this provision of the \nsection was, so I sought as one source of clarification the book which \nhas been distributed to all Members of the Senate by the Congressional \nLeaders United For A Balanced Budget Amendment.\n  In that description, the following information is given relative to \nsection 2, and particularly the language ``held by the public.'' It \nstates that:\n\n       Because borrowing and increases in any limits on cumulative \n     borrowing must be enacted by law, section 2 makes the \n     amendment effectively self-enforcing.\n\n  So this is a very important section because it makes the rest of the \nbalanced budget amendment self-enforcing, self-enforcing by requiring a \nthree-fifths vote to raise the limit set by law for debt held by the \npublic.\n  The statement by the Congressional Leaders United for the Balanced \nBudget goes on to state that by lowering ``the blackmail threshold'' \nassociated with passage of the regular debt limit bill from 50 percent \nplus 1 in either body to 40 percent plus 1, section 2 increases the \nmotivation of the administration and the leadership, including the \nchairs of the relevant committees, to do whatever is necessary \nlegislatively and cooperatively, even to the point of balancing the \nbudget to avoid facing such a difficult debt vote.\n  So the purpose of this provision is to enforce the balanced budget \namendment and, two, to create a blackmail threshold at 40 percent plus \n1; that is, if 41 Senators refuse to go along with a proposal to raise \nthe limit on debt held by the public, that would be such an enforcement \nfigure that collectively we will do all that we can to avoid having to \nbe placed into that position. That is the rationale for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, as we commence this process of possibly placing this \nlanguage into the Constitution of the United States, let me provide, \nand I hope this is not excessively tedious, a little background \nregarding this statement of debt held by the public\n  The projection of the Congressional Budget Office is that the end of \nthis fiscal year, which will be September 30, 1995, the gross Federal \ndebt--all debt owed by the Federal Government--will be $4.942 trillion, \na shade less than $5 trillion. That debt can be divided in a number of \nways, but this amendment calls for it to be divided into two sectors.\n  One sector is debt held by the public, and these are some of the \nentities which constitute the public which holds the debt of the \nFederal Government: State and local governments happen to be the \nlargest public holder of the Federal debt. They hold $641 billion. \nForeign governments and private sources, $601 billion, and so forth \nthroughout this analysis.\n  The second sector of the national debt is debt held by Government \naccounts. These are the accounts that are not part of the debt held by \nthe public. These are primarily the trust funds of the Federal \nGovernment whose surpluses must be invested in Federal Treasury \nobligations.\n  The largest of those, of course, is Social Security, which has $488 \nbillion of debt of the Federal Government. We are going to talk \nextensively about that Social Security indebtedness.\n  All the other Federal Government accounts, which include primarily \nthose that are analogous to Social Security in that they are accounts \ndesigned to provide for the retirement of persons, for instance, Civil \nService is $346 billion; military retirement, $105 billion; and then \nothers of significance are Medicare, $150 billion, the Department of \nTransportation has $30 billion in its account, the unemployment \ncompensation account has $40 billion. Cumulative of all these other \naccounts, excluding Social Security, is $837 billion, or a total of \n$1.325 trillion are debts of the Federal Government which are not held \nby the public, but rather by one of these Government accounts.\n  With this background, I would like to talk about some of the policy \nimplications of restricting to a three-fifths vote only this portion of \nthe national debt. Under this amendment, it will take a three-fifths \nvote of the whole number of the Members of both Houses of Congress to \nraise the debt held by the public. The debt held by Government accounts \ncan be raised by the legislative majority which we currently utilize.\n  The last time we voted on increasing the national debt, which was in \nPublic Law 103-66 on August 10, 1993, we voted--and this is the \nlanguage in the statute, Mr. President--``to increase the public debt \nlimit,'' not debt held by the public, but the public debt limit. And we \nincreased it to $4.900 trillion. One fact that obviously creates is \nthat before the end of this fiscal year, we are going to have to raise \nthe debt limit because we are going to break the $4.900 trillion level \nprior to the end of this fiscal year.\n  As I turn to some of the policy implications of this section 2, I \nwould like to state a couple of assumptions that I am going to make so \nthat if anyone would like to engage in further discussion, they would \ndo so with those assumptions in mind and might wish to discuss them \nfurther.\n  The first is primarily because we do not have projections through the \nyear 2025 and beyond for these other Government accounts and, second, \nbecause although they are very significant, $837 billion, relative to \nthe scale of the policy issues we are going to be dealing with, they \nwill not substantially affect the policy considerations. To the degree \nthey do affect the policy considerations, as I will explain, they make \nthe concerns I am going to express even more serious. I am not focusing \non this component, the Federal debt structure. My comments are focused \non the Social Security borrowing.\n  And second, as the statement of the Congressional Leaders United for \na Balanced Budget indicates, I am assuming that the purpose of this \nthree-fifths vote is to make it very difficult to raise the amount of \ndebt held by the public; that the purpose of this is to create a \npolitical hydraulics that is going to make it difficult to raise debt \nheld by the public and make it relatively easier to raise debt held by \nGovernment accounts. That is clearly the purpose of the distinction \nthat has been made in this amendment.\n  So let us turn to what is going to be the implication of adopting a \nbalanced budget amendment with section 2 as it is currently written.\n  Where are we today? As this chart demonstrates, at the end of this \nfiscal year we will have a total debt of $4.942 trillion. Of that \namount, $488 billion is in the red zone, which is the Social Security \ntrust fund. Everything else, which is the debt held by the public, plus \nthe debt held by Government accounts other than Social Security, is in \nthe blue zone. That amount is $4.452 trillion.\n   [[Page S3029]] The constitutional amendment calls for us reaching a \ncritical date in the year 2002 when we are to come into balance. The \nprojection is that between now and the year 2002, we will increase the \nFederal debt by approximately $1 trillion. So, that when we reach the \nyear 2002, we will have a total national debt of $6 trillion. Of that \namount, the Social Security trust fund surpluses will be $1.40 trillion \nin the year 2002. Social Security will represent that much of the \nindebtedness. Everything else, including the debt held by the public, \nplus the non-Social Security Government accounts will be $4.96 \ntrillion.\n  If the purpose of this is to make it very difficult to raise the debt \nheld by the public, the debt held by the public will assumedly, \nessentially, stay at the same $4.96 trillion level from the year 2002. \nWe have gone out to year 2028.\n But since there is no restraint in this supermajority on borrowing \nfrom trust funds, and particularly from Social Security, which is the \ntrust fund that is going to be, of course, the one rising dramatically, \nwe are going to see the debt rise to $7.098 trillion by the year 2018. \nThis will occur when the surplus in the Social Security fund reaches \nits apex. We will be adding to the national debt under this amendment \nby a majority vote, an additional $2 trillion. I do not think that is \nwhat the public believes they are getting with this amendment, that \nthey are going to get an additional $1 trillion between now and 2002 \nand then $2 trillion between 2002 and 2018.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have been listening to the statement of the Senator from \nFlorida--and I have stated in the Chamber publicly on other occasions \nhow much I appreciate the Senator's excellent work on an amendment that \nwas offered regarding Social Security, but I have listened to the \nstatement the Senator has made today, and it seems to me--and this is a \nquestion I ask the Senator from Florida--would not a reasonable person \nassume that if Congress passes a balanced budget amendment, the \nnational debt would remain constant, at least not rise, because we \nwould assume the budget would be in balance?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, that is the difference between passing a cliche and \npassing an actual constitutional amendment. This constitutional \namendment I think virtually assures that we are going to have a \nnational debt of approximately $3 trillion over the next 20-plus years \nabove the national debt that we have today.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator further, would that be the difference \nbetween the amount of Social Security surplus and the normal debt, so-\ncalled normal debt?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely correct. This is the chart that \nshows what that Social Security surplus is going to be in each year \nfrom 1995 to the year 2029, when the Social Security trust fund is \nexhausted and is at zero.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend a further question. Let us assume in 2018, \nwhen the Social Security trust fund reserves begin to diminish--and \nthat is about the date I think the Senator has on the chart--what will \nbe the Government's options for meeting the contractual obligations it \nhas with the Social Security beneficiaries?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator asked a very salient question. I might say \nbefore answering, it is one of the reasons we should have adopted the \namendment the Senator offered last week because it would have \nsegregated Social Security and allowed us to focus on its problems, \nwhich are serious, without having it commingled with the rest of the \nFederal budget. But the amendment, unfortunately, was defeated so we \nare now locked into a situation in which we are going to continue to do \nwhat we are doing now, which is to use the Social Security surplus to \nmask the extent of our real deficit. We are going to be taking the \nsurplus of Social Security, not investing it in stocks, bonds, or other \nsecurities as would a traditional pension plan, including pension plans \nof State and local governments; we are going to be investing it in the \nFederal Government to finance our national debt.\n  As this chart indicates, by the year 2018 our national debt will be \n$7.098 trillion and Social Security will hold $3 trillion. Three-\neighths of our total national debt will be held by the Social Security \nsystem. The question is, what are we going to do when we get to the \npoint that Social Security begins to draw down that surplus? What we \nare going to do is either have to, first, dramatically cut spending for \nSocial Security benefits or other Federal programs in order to generate \nthe cash to pay for the Social Security redemptions; second, \ndramatically increase taxes to pay for the Social Security redemptions; \nthird, some combination; or, fourth, continue with borrowing, but now \nwe will have to be borrowing from debt held by the public because there \nwill not be a Social Security alternative to draw from.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend one further question. The Senator has \nstated on this floor on a previous occasion that the surpluses that \nwill be developed in the Social Security trust fund during the next 20-\nplus years is on purpose. Is that not right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The building of the surpluses, as the Senator from Nevada \ncorrectly states, is not as an aberration. We are doing this because \nthis more or less tracks the demographics of the U.S. population. \nDuring the period from now until about the year 2018 or 2019, when the \nnumber of people going into the Social Security system as a percentage \nof the total population is relatively low--I do not know what year the \nSenator was born in Searchlight, NV. Could he inform us of that?\n  Mr. REID. December 1939.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was born almost 3 years prior to the Senator from \nNevada. We were both born during a period of national depression. There \nwere not very many people being born in either Pennsuco, FL, or \nSearchlight, NV, in those years of the 1930's. So there are not a lot \nof Americans who have birth dates in the years in which we were born.\n  Conversely, I know the Senator has children who were born probably in \nthe 1960's. I have four of those children. There were large numbers of \npeople born in the period after World War II, in the 1940's, 1950's, \nand 1960's. Those folks are going to start retiring in about the year \n2019, and so instead of having a surplus, we are going to start to \nspend down the Social Security system and do it dramatically. In 10 \nyears, we will go from over $3 trillion of surplus to zero surplus in \nthe Social Security system. And we are going to have the challenge--not \nus individually, but our successors here and the citizens of this \ncountry--to calculate how to meet that enormous obligation under this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend an additional question. Why would an \namendment to balance the budget be placed in the Constitution while \nallowing the limit on the public debt to rise to the portions \nillustrated in the Senator's previous chart? That I do not understand.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And it runs exactly counter--the answer is I cannot \nanswer the question. I hope maybe some of those who are the authors \ncould explain why they have done this.\n  In the material that was distributed, it states, ``The purpose of \nthis section is to motivate an avoidance of deficits.'' That is a \ndirect quote from the materials distributed by Congressional Leadership \nUnited for a Balanced Budget.\n  The reality is that the opposite occurs. The national debt goes from \n$5 trillion today to $6 trillion. This is going to happen in almost any \nevent. But this is what is not necessary, and that is this dramatic \nincrease in the national debt from $6 trillion to $8 trillion that will \noccur roughly between the year 2002 and 2018, and which is virtually \nmandated by the structure of this balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. REID. So, if I understand the Senator correctly, the Senator, \nhaving been Governor of one of the largest States in the Union, having \nhandled billion-dollar budgets there, and having had the experience he \nhas had here--including being a member of the Finance Committee--the \nSenator cannot explain to me why the balanced budget amendment is \nwritten the way it is?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I cannot. And there is a way to solve this problem. This \nis not a conflict which is beyond our ability to resolve.\n  I suggest that the resolution is found in the amendment which is \ncurrently pending and that is the simple step of \n[[Page S3030]]  eliminating the phrase ``held by the public'' from the \nconstitutional amendment, so that the amendment will now read:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States shall not be \n     increased, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each \n     House shall provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall \n     vote.\n\n  What that will require is that there will be a three-fifths vote \nrequired to increase the national debt, whether it comes from debt held \nby the public or debt held by the Social Security trust fund.\n  With that approach you get a dramatically different structure of our \nNation's fiscal future. Going back to the assumptions that I started \nwith, which is that the whole purpose of the three-fifths vote, as \nstated by its authors, is to create a blackmail threshold that will \nmake it virtually impossible to raise the national debt, that would \nindicate we will move to the $6 trillion level between now and the year \n2002 when the constitutional amendment becomes operative. Then there \nwill be no increase in the national debt from the year 2002 into the \nindefinite future. We will plateau at $6 trillion.\n  The consequence is going to be that we will see the Social Security \ntrust fund continuing to generate substantial surpluses between now and \nthe year 2018, which will become a larger share of our total debt. But \nat the same time we will be buying down the debt held by the public. We \nwill be substituting Social Security indebtedness for debt held by the \npublic. We will be doing what I think the sponsors of this amendment \nwant to do. We will be releasing capital back into the country for \nproductive investment.\n  We will be making the Social Security system sound because we will \nnot be adding an enormous amount of debt, we will be stabilizing our \ndebt and placing us in a position after the year 2018 to do a graceful \nshift from Social Security back to debt held by the public and be able, \nby this borrowing from debt held by the public, to meet our Social \nSecurity obligations without the enormous tax or spending cuts that \nwill be required if we do not adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my friend yielding for the questions. He has \nbeen very lucid and straightforward in his answer.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will make these questions constructive, \nas I hope they will be, because I helped craft this amendment over the \nlast 5 to 6 years. We were faced with how do we deal with trust funds, \nbecause they are inside the budget, unique to Social Security. The law \nthat created the Social Security system does not allow the trust funds \nto be invested outside Government. That is the law of the land today. \nOf course I do not think--certainly not this Senator, possibly the \nSenator from Florida--does not believe the trust funds of Social \nSecurity should be put at risk out in the private marketplace.\n  What happens if you invest in stocks and bonds and they bottom out? \nWho comes back in and picks the system back up? That is a legitimate \nconcern. I think those who were here in the 1930's when the Social \nSecurity system was crafted had that in mind. That was their concern.\n  So here we were, faced with the situation of these revenues coming in \nas a result of the 1983 fix on Social Security, and having to deal with \nthem. The Senator and I are on the Board of Trustees of the Social \nSecurity system. There are no others. It is the Congress of the United \nStates that is pledged to keep this system solvent and secure for its \nrecipients. But in come the revenues and we borrow them. We are doing \nit today and even under the Senator's amendment we will do it tomorrow.\n  As a result of that understanding, as we crafted this amendment it \nwas our concern, knowing that, that we cut down on the other debt that \nis out there and accumulating, recognizing this was a debt owed--it was \na note owed so that is a debt, certainly--back to the trust funds of \nthe system. But at the same time, this Government is caught in the \ndilemma that they must use those moneys. Obviously that system cannot \nearn money if the money is not borrowed from it. So we just do not \ncollect it and set it off to the side and create a nonearning \nenvironment. We borrow it and pay back the going rate on the Treasury \nnote. That is a responsibility that we have. That is what this \namendment has in mind and why it was worded the way it was worded.\n  I must say, while I find the argument of the Senator from Florida \nintriguing, we ran this through the system a good many times over the \nlast 5 years to try to solve that problem, believing we have, and I am \nconvinced we have. So I am curious. I mean it in all good faith, how do \nyou deal with what the Senator is proposing? Obviously we are going to \nuse those moneys inside Government and they will be needed, they will \nbe owed at some time back to the trust fund.\n  I am the baby boomer in this debate right now, whereas our colleague \nfrom Searchlight was not. I am one of those people who was born in 1945 \nand I am in that group that is going to be in that peak. The Federal \nGovernment, by its commitment through the Social Security system--not \nSocial Security, the Federal Government--is going to guarantee that \nbecause they are taking the notes out at this moment and they must pay \nthem back. That is the way the system is structured under the law.\n  I find it confusing in this regard. Would we not have to change the \nlaw of Social Security that drives the system today to get to where we \nwant to get, or to where the Senator wants to get with his amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, absolutely not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Please help me there, then.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My amendment calls for the Social Security surpluses to \ncontinue to be invested in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to review a little of the history of how we \ngot to where we are and why I think that history makes this chart the \nlikely consequence of adopting the amendment in its current form. The \ndifference is that my amendment will call for a stabilization of total \nFederal debt because it will require a three-fifths vote to raise total \ndebt, not just the debt held by the public. And it will, therefore, \nforce public debt to be displaced by the growing amount of Social \nSecurity.\n  When Social Security was adopted, it utilized a pay-as-you-go \nfinancing mechanism. We took in an amount of money each year sufficient \nto meet that year's obligation. We did not have a surplus. This was a \nnonissue.\n  In the late 1970's people began to recognize that we had these \nterrific demographic shifts that were going to be occurring over the \nnext 30, 40 years because of the dramatically different birth rates in \ndifferent periods of American history. So one of the key changes made \nin the 1983 reforms was to go to a surplus structure for Social \nSecurity, thus producing this curve.\n  There was an implicit assumption in this surplus Social Security and \nthat was that we were going to be operating a balanced Federal budget \nfor the rest of our expenditures. The way we would be securing this \nsurplus money was we would be using it to reduce the amount of public \nindebtedness. This is the chart that the 1983 Social Security reform \nwas predicated upon, a balance and a cap on the total national debt and \na substitution of public debt for Social Security debt.\n  Then, beginning in the year 2018, without having added any debt in \nthis period, we would be in a position to go back to the public and \nsay: OK, now we have all these IOU's that the Social Security \nAdministration is holding. We need to cash them in order to get the \nrevenue to pay off the Social Security obligations to folks like our \nfriend, the Senator from Idaho. And, we will do so without putting any \nadditional strain on the Federal Government because we will not be \nincreasing the amount of debt service. We will just be shifting it from \nthe Social Security fund to debt held by non-Social Security entities.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. When you shift the debt from, in other words, that held by \nthe Social Security trust fund to the public, where do you get the \nmoney to cause the shift because you have money outgoing to the \nrecipient at that point? And we know that in this baby boomer scenario \nthat becomes a very rapid demand level on the trust fund system.\n   [[Page S3031]] Mr. GRAHAM. The way we intended to manage it, based \non the 1983 structure, was to go to the general public with Federal \nborrowings.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In other words, borrowing the money.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, in order to replace the money that we had previously \nborrowed from the Social Security fund. What worries me is in the \npurpose of this amendment, by putting a cap on debt held by the public \nwith a three-fifths vote, is to preclude that substitution. Then we are \ngoing to have a situation in which with no additional borrowing, \ncombined with a drawdown of the Social Security surplus from almost $3 \ntrillion to zero over a period of 10 years, the only way we can fill \nthis gap is by taxation or dramatic spending cuts.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the year 2020 to 2035 when that $3 trillion worth of \nliability, if you will, of those trust fund comes due. You are talking \nabout either raising taxes by $3 trillion or borrowing and raising debt \nby $3 trillion dollar.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. I am saying I think the amendment is intended to \npreclude the borrowing option because it says you would have to have--\n--\n  Mr. CRAIG. Except by a three-fifths?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. That corresponds to the debt ceiling argument which \nwould allow borrowing under those circumstances.\n  My second amendment is going to make it easier to do that. But if the \ntheory of the three-fifths vote is that essentially that is a statement \nthat we are making that it should not be done--that is what the \nlanguage of the congressional leadership stated--then that is in fact \nadhered to. When we have this drawdown of the Social Security surplus, \nno additional borrowing from the general public is permitted because it \nis capped at this level by the three-fifths margin. When we reach that \npoint, and try to finance a $3 trillion indebtedness in a 10-year \nperiod with reliance on taxation or spending cuts or some combination, \nthe consequence is going to be this train wreck, a wreck in the scale \nof which we have never quite seen before.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That $3 trillion indebtedness is going to be out there in \nany scenario. Will it not be easier for the Federal Government to be \nable to deal with it if it does not have extra hundreds of millions or \ntrillions of dollars that it has borrowed from the public? In other \nwords, if you will turn your chart that causes you problems upside \ndown, it is the same chart as the one you are showing me. The reality \nis based on the law of Social Security. The Federal Government is going \nto borrow the reserves of the trust fund and it must pay them back \nstarting dramatically in the year 2020 through the year 2035. Under \neither scenario, that is reality because it is not this amendment that \nis causing it. It is the law of the Social Security System that is \ndoing it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I beg to disagree.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then where is the money going at this point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the structure of the balanced budget amendment. \nSection 1 says that we will have an integrated Federal budget in which \nSocial Security and all trust funds will be commingled with the rest of \nthe Federal Government. That is the definition of income and \nexpenditure as provided in section 7. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am sorry?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Section 1 as defined by section 7 will constitutionally \nrequire an integrated or a consolidated Federal budget; that is, all \nsources of income, all sources of expenditures will be amalgamated for \npurposes of determining whether we have a balanced budget or not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All sources of expenditures and income. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we are constitutionally requiring a consolidated \nFederal budget. That is a correct premise. I believe that is what \nsection 7 says. Then with the structure of the Social Security system \nthat we have, each year from now until 2019, we will have a balanced \nbudget by having our regular accounts out of balance to the extent that \nwe have a Social Security surplus; that is, if this amendment were to \nbe operative in the year 2002 when we have a Social Security surplus of \napproximately $110 billion, every other account in the Federal \nGovernment can be out of balance by $110 billion and the surplus from \nSocial Security will bring the total into balance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Because of the general fund, because the law of Social \nSecurity requires the Federal Government to borrow the money, and that \nusually is invested in the general fund account.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But we have another choice; that is, what I think we \nought to be doing is we ought to be balancing our general revenue \naccounts and using the surplus of Social Security not to mask our \nspending but rather using the surplus of Social Security as a real \nsurplus including a real surplus that will be buying down an amount of \npublic debt so that when we get to the point where we have run through \nthe happy days of big Social Security surplus and face the very tough \ndays of having to pay off all of that surplus, we will not have added \n$12 trillion to the national debt. If you really want to have a \nconservative balanced budget amendment, it ought to be an amendment \nthat says we will put a three-fifths requirement on the law to increase \nthe borrowing from whatever source, Social Security, other Federal \ntrust funds, or the general public. That is an amendment that would be \ntruly conservative. That would be an amendment which our grandchildren \nand the Senator from Idaho would very much appreciate. That would be an \namendment that would give them the greatest assurance that their Social \nSecurity benefits are going to be real when they reach the age of \neligibility.\n  All of what I have said relates to the first amendment that I have \noffered, which has the simple objective of striking the four words \n``held by the public'' and requires the three-fifths vote to apply to \nall of Federal increases in the debt limit.\n  If we do not adopt that amendment----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield before he goes to the second \namendment for a couple of questions?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have followed the presentation both here and back in my \noffice. It is a very significant and important presentation. How much \non the average would the annual deficit be permitted to be during that \nperiod of the peak without it appearing as though there were a deficit \nat all? In other words, I believe the Senator said it is a $2 trillion \npeak over about a 12-year period, something like that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does that mean basically, unless his amendment is adopted, \nthat under the current wording of the balanced budget amendment that we \ncould average a deficit of about $200 billion a year and mask it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the year 2002, which is the year that the \nconstitutional amendment kicks in, Social Security will have a surplus \nof $1.04 trillion; we will say $1 trillion. During the next 16 years, \nit grows to $3.02 trillion, or roughly $2 trillion. So $2 trillion \ndivided by 16.\n  Mr. LEVIN. About $120 billion a year, perhaps.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not have my calculator, but it would be significant.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So in terms of the annual average deficit, which will be \nmasked in the absence of the amendment of the Senator from Florida, \nduring that period there could be a $120 billion deficit per year on \nthe average, which would not, in effect, violate the current wording of \nthe constitutional amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is right. And this could take place with a majority \nvote. This does not require a supermajority of the Congress in order to \nachieve this unexpected result.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senator from Florida is pointing out something \nwhich is extraordinarily significant. I hope that those who support \nthis amendment understand that, without the adoption either of the \namendment of the Senator from Florida or the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California, this outcome will result.\n  My second question relates to the substitute of the Senator from \nCalifornia. The Senator from Florida mentioned that Senator Reid of \nNevada had offered an amendment the other day which was defeated, and \nthat had it passed, I believe the Senator from Florida said, this \nproblem would have been solved; is that correct?\n  [[Page S3032]] Mr. GRAHAM. The answer is yes. Because the Reid \namendment, now incorporated in the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia, would have not required a consolidated Federal budget but \nrather would have separated Social Security from it. It would have had \nto balance our budget in general accounts without being able to use \nSocial Security surpluses as a mask and thus we would have avoided the \ntrain wreck which we are setting up for our grandchildren.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And, if the Senator would further yield for a question, if \nthe substitute of the Senator from California is adopted, will that \nthen resolve this issue?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the substitute of the Senator from California is \nadopted and if, as I understand it, it is the essence of the Reid \namendment, then I would suggest that my amendments could be withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, if the Senator would yield for an additional \nquestion. The Senator has made reference to questions and answers from \nthe Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget. I have seen \nthat same group referred to. I am wondering whether or not the Senator \ncan tell us what the membership of that is and, perhaps, if he cannot, \nthe Senator from Idaho can, because in documents which have been placed \nin the Record by the Senator from Idaho I have seen the reference to \nthat group, but I do not know who is in it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I received this document from the Congressional Leaders \nUnited for a Balanced Budget. I do not believe it indicates who the \nmembers are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Idaho has put in the Record documents \nwhich I have also referred to and plan on referring to tomorrow. He put \nthe document in on March 1.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since the Senator from \nFlorida has the floor, whether or not I might ask the Senator from \nIdaho a question without the Senator from Florida losing his right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Idaho could tell us who the \nindividuals are that make up the Congressional Leaders United for a \nBalanced Budget, because a number of us keep referring to those \ndocuments that are in the Congressional Record that my friend put in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator's inquiry and he honors me by \nthat inquiry. Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget was \noriginally formed by both Senators and Representatives in the early \n1980's. I chaired it in the House and the former Senator from \nCalifornia, now Gov. Pete Wilson, chaired it here in the Senate. We \nbrought our staffs together and through that, along with experts we \nbrought in overtime to testify on this, accumulated a base of knowledge \nand understanding of the issue.\n  So the best and cleanest and appropriate answer is that it is an ad \nhoc group of both Senators today and House Members who work under \nCongressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget for the purposes of \npromoting this legislation that we have before us.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed, would the Senator from Idaho be able or willing to provide for \nthe record the membership of the group? The reason is that Congressman \nSchaefer has put into the Congressional Record the same questions and \nanswers basically, and he is the prime sponsor of the constitutional \namendment in the House of Representatives. It is basically the same \nquestions and answers which he has put in as his. I think that is a \npretty strong statement coming from the prime sponsor.\n  Would the Senator from Idaho be willing to put in the Record the \nmembership of the group?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to. There is nothing nefarious about it \nat all. Senators come together, as do House Members, for the purpose of \ndiscussion and they find organizational titles. I would be happy to do \nso.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I quickly add, I did not mean to suggest anything the \nleast bit untoward or nefarious at all. We have ad hoc commissions all \nthe time. I know very well I will know the members and admire many of \nthem, indeed all of them. I did not mean to suggest anything unusual or \nuntoward.\n  But we are all making reference to a group and it seems to me we \nwould like to know who the members of this group are, so we can get a \nfeel whether they include both sponsors and opponents of the \nconstitutional amendment as to who it is that are members of the group. \nI would appreciate that list for the record.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida. I want to commend him on pointing \nout some very, very significant material for all the reasons which he \nhas identified. We will be masking a deficit unless we adopt either the \nFeinstein substitute or the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank my friend from Michigan for his \ncomments. I would say, in all honesty, that the adoption of the \namendment as offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nCalifornia, of which I was proud to be a cosponsor, would actually be \nthe superior way to deal with this issue because it would solve the \nproblem of no longer requiring that Social Security be commingled with \nthe rest of the Federal budget as well as effectively rendering \ndenuding the potential danger contained in section 2.\n  So let me just summarize the first amendment. It is a very simple \namendment. It strikes the phrase ``debt held by the public,'' would \nrequire that the three-fifths vote be applied to all increases in debt \nfrom whatever source, would have as its objective to avoid the addition \nof $2 trillion of debt between the year 2002 and 2018 and almost an \nassured fiscal crisis thereafter, and substitute in lieu thereof a cap \non Federal debt after the year 2002, a substitution of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses for debt held by the public during the \nperiod from 2002 to 2018, and then a reversal of that as the Social \nSecurity system has to redeem the IOU's that it holds from the Treasury \nin order to be able to meet its obligations.\n  That is amendment No. 1, which, in our sequencing, is Amendment No. \n259.\n  My amendment No. 2, unfortunately, is a much wordier amendment. Let \nme read that amendment. It would take the language of section 2 which \nsays, ``The limit on the debt of the United States held by the public \nshall not be increased,'' and it inserts this phrase, ``except for \nincreases in the limit on the debt of the United States held by the \npublic to reflect net redemptions from the Federal Old Age and \nSurvivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \nTrust Fund.''\n  In essence what we would be saying is that by a majority vote, not a \nthree-fifths vote, the Federal Government would be able to borrow \nfunds--and this would occur based on current projections after the year \n2018--the Federal Government would be able to raise the limit of debt \nof the public by a majority rather than a three-fifths vote for the \npurpose of redeeming the IOU's the Social Security trust fund will have \naccumulated and substituting debt that would be held by the public.\n  It will, in my opinion, be necessary in order to maintain this \nalternative as a means of financing the enormous transition that will \noccur in Social Security after the year 2018, without punishing \nspending cuts, tax increases, or some combination of those.\n  Madam President, I hope that this body will not just take the \nposition that no amendments are to be considered, that regardless of \nmerit we will mindlessly mow down all proposed changes.\n  I am a supporter of the balanced budget amendment. I have voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment in the past. I hope to vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment in 1995. I want to vote for a responsible \nbalanced budget amendment. I do not want to leave to our children and \ngrandchildren an enormous debt based on our failure to exercise the \ndiscipline which is the purpose of the balanced budget amendment.\n  That is why I have been supporting it. I also do not want to leave to \nour children and grandchildren the train wreck which is going to occur \nif we have a provision that requires a three-fifths vote to raise money \nfrom the general public to substitute and be able \n[[Page S3033]]  to redeem the enormous borrowing that we are going to \nbe making from Social Security over the next 20-plus years.\n  I believe this is a dramatically more conservative approach than the \none that is contained in the balanced budget amendment as currently \nsubmitted. It is the difference between having a ceiling of $6 trillion \nof national debt to one that would have national debt rising to the \nlevel of almost $8 trillion. If you are a conservative, if you are \nconcerned about the kind of America that we will leave to the next \ngeneration, if you have been appalled at what we have done in the last \n15 years where the debt went from less than $1 trillion to now almost \n$5 trillion in a period of 15 years, you ought to be equally appalled \nby the prospect of a debt growing from $5 trillion to $8 trillion in \nthe next 20-plus years.\n  Madam President, we do not have to condemn ourselves to this future. \nWe have an alternative. The alternative is either adopting the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and now reoffered by the \nSenator from California, or as a first fallback, adopting the amendment \nwhich I have offered that would require a three-fifths vote for any \nincrease of the national debt, thus forcing a readjustment of Social \nSecurity debt, for public debt, in the next period and after the year \n2018, allowing a readjustment to finance the Social Security obligation \nthat we will have.\n  If we do not do either of those, at least we ought to not require a \nthree-fifths vote to fund this enormous debt that we are going to be \nencouraging by consolidated Federal budget using the mask of Social \nSecurity to balloon the national debt by an unnecessary $2 trillion, \nand then leave it to our grandchildren through taxation or spending \ncuts to finance this Social Security obligation.\n  Madam President, I feel emotional about this in part because I am the \nfather of four children who were born as baby boomers and will be in \nthe first line of those affected by this amendment. I am the \ngrandfather of four children, soon to be eight grandchildren as a \nresult of births that are en route, and I do not want to have my \nchildren and my grandchildren turn to me 20 years from now and say \n``Granddaddy, why did you do this to me when you did not have to do \nso?''\n  I believe we have the opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment \nthat will allow Members to say to our children and our grandchildren: \nWe stopped this profligate Federal spending. We required Members to do \nas most other individuals, families, businesses, and governments in \nAmerica have to do. That is, balance their books on a more or less \nyearly basis. And we did it in an intelligent way that did not require \ncitizens to pay an enormous sacrifice in their generation because we \nwere living off the mask of this Social Security surplus during the \nlast years of our generation's life. That is what is at stake.\n  As I say, Madam President, I know there is a tremendous momentum to \nsay, ``Let's not accept any amendments. That is perfection. This is \nwhat we must adopt.'' I urge that over the next few days--and this will \nbe voted on Tuesday afternoon--that there will be some serious \nconsideration of the implications of this issue.\n  I say to our Presiding Officer and to my colleagues that I am anxious \nto meet with any Member of this body, to meet with any group which is \nconcerned about this issue, to discuss its implications, to try to \ncollectively learn what it is we are doing and to determine what would \nbe the most prompt path.\n  These are an important 4 days that we have between now and Tuesday. I \nhope we use those days wisely.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am about to propose a unanimous \nconsent.\n  I will be more than happy to meet with the Senator from Florida and \nrespond to those questions. I know he is sincere in his effort and I \nwill make every effort to accommodate him.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the votes occur in relation to the \npending amendments numbered 259 and numbered 298 on Tuesday, February \n28, in the stacked sequence to begin at 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, and I will not do so, will \nthe vote on the amendments occur after the vote on the amendment as \noffered by the Senator from California?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that that is the stacked sequence; \nis it not? I believe that is the correct answer, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it would come after the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But would the amendment of the Senator from California \noccur prior to this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I indicated, should the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia be adopted, I am prepared to withdraw my amendments, because \nthey would have been solved in a larger and, I think, more effective \nmanner.\n  If the amendment by the Senator from California is not adopted, I \nthink it becomes urgent that one, and preferably the first of the two \namendments that I am offering, be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for not to exceed 3 \nminutes, following which the senior Senator from Virginia be recognized \nfor not to exceed 3 minutes, following which the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts be recognized for 2 minutes for the purpose of laying \ndown an amendment, so that the amendment would qualify for a vote on \nTuesday, and that immediately following the laying down of the \namendment by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, I be recognized \nagain for the purpose of calling up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask my colleague if he might extend a \nlittle more latitude to the two Senators.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Of course. I was told by the Senator from Rhode Island \nthat he thought 3 minutes each would do it. I will be happy to yield \nfor a longer period. What would the Senator suggest?\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps not to exceed a total of 12 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and I wish to address the commemorative to Iwo Jima.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I modify my unanimous-consent request to yield 12 \nminutes to the two Senators equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I have a 15-second \nrequest. Could I ask the Senator be permitted----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I amend the unanimous consent request to allow the \nSenator from Massachusetts to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 267\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the balanced budget constitutional amendment \ndoes not authorize the President to impound lawfully appropriated funds \n                   or impose taxes, duties, or fees)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 267, which was previously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Johnston, proposes an amendment numbered 267.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``Section 8. Nothing in this article shall authorize the \n     President to impound funds appropriated by Congress by law, \n     or to impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is my understanding that the vote in \nrelation to my amendment will occur in the sequence on Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, my amendment would simply make it \n[[Page S3034]]  clear that nothing in the proposed constitutional \namendment would authorize the President to impound funds appropriated \nby Congress by law or to impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a discussion of this issue set forth in \n``Minority Views'' contained in the report of the Committee on the \nJudiciary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   B. The amendment would give the President broad powers to impound \n                           appropriated funds\n\n       That the balanced budget constitutional amendment would \n     authorize the President to impound funds appropriated by \n     Congress is clear from the text of the Constitution and the \n     proposed amendment. Article II, section 3, obligates the \n     President to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully \n     executed,'' and article II, section 7, requires the President \n     to take an oath to ``preserve, protect and defend the \n     Constitution.''\n       Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment provides \n     that ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \n     total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \n     rollcall vote.'' The amendment thus would forbid outlays from \n     exceeding revenues by more than the amount specifically \n     authorized by a three-fifths supermajority of each House of \n     Congress. In any fiscal year in which it is clear that in the \n     absence of congressional action, ``total outlays'' will \n     exceed ``total receipts'' by a greater-than-authorized \n     amount, the President is bound by the Constitution and the \n     oath of office it prescribes to prevent the unauthorized \n     deficit.\n       The powers and obligations conferred upon the President by \n     the Constitution and the proposed constitutional amendment \n     would clearly be read by the courts to include the power to \n     impound appropriated funds where the expenditure of those \n     funds would cause total outlays to exceed total receipts by \n     an amount greater than that authorized by the requisite \n     congressional supermajorities.\n       This commonsense reading of the proposed constitutional \n     amendment is shared by a broad range of highly regarded legal \n     scholars. Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, who as \n     head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \n     Justice is responsible for advising the President and the \n     Attorney General regarding the scope and limits on \n     presidential authority, testified before the Judiciary \n     Committee that the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     authorize the President to impound funds to insure that \n     outlays do not exceed receipts. Similarly, Harvard University \n     Law School Professor Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor \n     General during the Reagan Administration, testified that in a \n     year when actual revenues fell below projections and bigger-\n     than-authorized deficit occurred, section 1 ``would offer a \n     President ample warrant to impound appropriated funds.'' \n     Others who share this view include former Attorney General \n     Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Stanford University Law School \n     Professor Kathleen Sullivan, Yale University Law School \n     Professor Burke Marshall, and Harvard University Law School \n     Professor Laurence H. Tribe.\n       The fact that the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     confer impoundment authority on the President is confirmed by \n     the actions of the Judiciary Committee this year. Supporters \n     of the amendment opposed and defeated an amendment offered by \n     Senator Kennedy before the Judiciary Committee that would \n     have added the following section to the proposed amendment:\n       ``Section   . Nothing in this article shall authorize the \n     President to impound funds appropriated by Congress by law, \n     or to impose taxes, duties or fees.''\n       If the supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment \n     do not intend to give impoundment authority to the President, \n     there is no legitimate explanation of their failure to \n     include the text of the Kennedy amendment in the proposed \n     article.\n       The impoundment power that would be conferred on the \n     President by the proposed constitutional amendment is far \n     broader than any proposed presidential line-item veto \n     authority now under consideration by the Congress. The line-\n     item veto proposals would allow a President to refrain from \n     spending funds proposed to be spent by a particular item of \n     appropriation in a particular appropriations bill presented \n     to the President. As Assistant Attorney General Dellinger \n     testified, the impoundment authority conferred upon the \n     President by the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     allow a President to order across-the-board cuts in all \n     Federal programs, target specific programs for abolition, or \n     target expenditures intended for particular States or regions \n     for impoundment.\n       The Committee majority makes two arguments to support its \n     assertion that the balanced budget constitutional amendment \n     does not give the President impoundment authority. Both are \n     wrong.\n       The first is the suggestion that ``up to the end of the \n     fiscal year, the President has nothing to impound because \n     Congress in the amendment has the power to ratify or to \n     specify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that \n     fiscal year.'' In essence, the majority asserts that there \n     will never be an unauthorized, and therefore \n     unconstitutional, deficit, because Congress will always step \n     in at the end of the year and ratify whatever deficit has \n     occurred. If true, then the balanced budget is a complete \n     sham, because it would impose no fiscal discipline \n     whatsoever.\n       But if the majority is wrong in its prediction--that is, if \n     a Congress failed to act before the end of a fiscal year to \n     ratify a previously unauthorized deficit, all of the \n     expenditures undertaken by the Federal government throughout \n     the fiscal year would be unconstitutional and open to \n     challenge in the state and Federal courts (see part I.A, \n     supra). It is inconceivable that the President, sworn to \n     preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, would be found \n     to be powerless to prevent such a result.\n       Second, the majority argues that ``under section 6 of the \n     amendment, Congress can specify exactly what type of \n     enforcement mechanism it wants and the President, as Chief \n     Executive, is duty bound to enforce that particular \n     congressional scheme to the exclusion of impoundment.'' The \n     fact that Congress is required by section 6 of the proposed \n     amendment to enact enforcement legislation certainly does not \n     suggest that the amendment itself would not grant the \n     president authority to impound appropriated funds. Nothing in \n     the proposed article stipulates that the enforcement \n     legislation must be effective to prevent violations of the \n     amendment. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that no \n     enforcement legislation could prevent violations for \n     occurring.\n       The President's obligation to faithfully execute the laws \n     is independent of Congress's. That duty is not ``limited to \n     the enforcement of acts of Congress * * * according to their \n     express terms, * * * it include[s] the rights, duties and \n     obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, * * * and \n     all the protection implied by the nature of the government \n     under the Constitution[.]'' In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 64 \n     (1890). If an unconstitutional deficit were occurring, \n     Congress could not constitutionally stop the President from \n     seeking to prevent it.\n\n\n   c. the proposed amendment many also confer upon the president the \n               authority to impose taxes, duties and fees\n\n       As discussed above, when a greater-than-authorized deficit \n     occurs, the balanced budget constitutional amendment would \n     impose upon the President an obligation to stop it. While \n     greater attention has been paid to the prospect that the \n     amendment would grant the President authority to impound \n     appropriated funds, the amendment would enable future \n     Presidents to assert that they have the power unilaterally to \n     raise taxes, duties or fees in order to generate additional \n     revenue to avoid an unauthorized deficit. See Testimony of \n     Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, 1995 Judiciary \n     Committee Hearings at 102.\n       This outcome would turn on its head the allocation of \n     powers envisioned by the Framers. No longer would ``the \n     legislative department alone ha[ve] access to the pockets of \n     the people'' as Madison promised in The Federalist No. 48. \n     Instead, intermixing of legislative and executive power in \n     the President's hands would constitute the ``source of \n     danger'' against which Madison warned.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2995-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2995-S3034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know that my colleague, Senator \nKerrey from Nebraska, has come to the floor to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, after he speaks, it then be in order to \ncall up a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this debate is about amending the U.S. \nConstitution. If we approve the proposal as offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and others--as the House already has--\nit will be up to the States of this country to ratify or reject what \nwould become the 28th constitutional change in 206 years.\n  The Constitution of the United States represents the greatest \ndemocratic achievement in the history of human civilization. It--and \nthe self-evident truths which are its bases--has guided the decisions \nand the heroic sacrifices of Americans for two centuries. Its precepts \nare the guiding light and have been a shining beacon of hope for \nmillions across the globe who hunger for the freedoms that democracy \nguarantees. It has served not only us, it has served the world, as \nwell.\n  It is not, Mr. President, a document, therefore, to be amended \nlightly. Indeed, my strongest objection to this proposal is that it \ndoes not belong in our Constitution; it belongs in our law.\n  In addition to this argument, I also intend to suggest that the \npolitical will to enact changes in law to balance our budget--which was \nmissing from many previous Congresses--now appears to be here.\n  In fact, I wish the time taken to debate this change in our \nConstitution was instead spent debating the changes needed in the \nstatutes that dictate current and future spending. This does not mean, \nMr. President, I agree with those who have complained about the length \nof time we have spent on this proposal. This complaint is without \nmerit.\n  This great document should not be amended in a rush of passion. It is \nevident from the Constitution itself that its authors intended the \nprocess of amendment to be slow, difficult, and laborious. So difficult \nthat it has been attempted with success only 17 times since the Bill of \nRights. This document is not meant to be tampered with in a trivial \nfashion.\n  As I said, the proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution is \nintended to affect the behavior of America's congressional \nrepresentatives. In that regard, it is unique. Except for the 25th \namendment, which addresses the issue of transfer of power, other \namendments affecting the behavior of all Americans by limiting the \npower of Government, protecting public freedoms, prohibiting the \nmajority from encroaching on the rights of the minority or regulating \nthe behavior of the States.\n  This would be the only amendment aimed at regulating the behavior of \n535 Americans, who the amendment assumes are incapable of making the \ndifficult decisions without the guidance of the Constitution's hand. \nThat theory is grounded in the assumption that Congress and the public \nlack the political will to balance the budget.\n  Specifically, the proposal contains 294 words. It would raise from a \nsimple majority to three-fifths the vote necessary in Congress for \ndeficit spending. It would set a goal of balancing our budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  The amendment empowers Congress to pass legislation detailing how to \nenforce that goal, but does not itself specify enforcement measures. \nThe only answer to the question of what will happen if Congress and the \nPresident fail to balance the budget is that nobody knows. The only \nmechanism our country has for enforcing the Constitution is the courts. \nSo the amendment's ambiguity prevents the serious possibility of \nprotracted court battles which give unelected judiciary unwarranted \ncontrol over budget policy.\n  The proponents of this amendment sincerely believe our Constitution \nneeds to be changed in order to force Members of Congress to change \ntheir behavior, which supporters argue they will not do because they \nare afraid of offending the citizens who have sent them here in the \nfirst place. On that basis there is a long list of constitutional \nchange they should propose, including campaign finance reform, lobbying \nreform, and term limits, just to name a few.\n  Mr. President, I support the goal of a balanced budget, and have \nfought and am fighting and will continue to fight to achieve it. \nHowever, desirability of a goal cannot become the only standard to \nwhich we hold constitutional amendments. Constitutional amendments must \nmeet a higher standard.\n  The Constitution and its 27 amendments express broadly our values as \na Nation. The Constitution does not dictate specific policies, fiscal \nor otherwise. We attempted to use the Constitution for that purpose \nonce, banning alcohol in the 18th amendment, and it proved to be a \ncolossal failure. Fundamentally, we should amend the Constitution to \nmake broad statements of national principle. And most importantly, Mr. \nPresident, we should amend the Constitution as an act of last resort \nwhen no other means are adequate to reach our goals.\n  We do so out of reverence for a document we have believed for two \ncenturies should not be changed except in the most extraordinary \ncircumstances. We have used constitutional amendments to express our \npreference as a Nation for the principles of free speech, the right to \nvote and the right of each individual to live free.\n  The question before Members today is whether the need for a balanced \nbudget belongs in such distinguished company. While I oppose this \namendment, Mr. President, I understand the arguments for it. I have had \nthe privilege of serving here for 6 years and I am entering my seventh \nbudget cycle as a consequence. Every time the President of either \nparty, since I have been here, has sent a budget to this body it has \nbeen greeted with speeches and promises and rhetoric about the need to \nbalance the budget. And each time, those speeches and promises and \nrhetoric have been greeted with votes in the opposite direction.\n  Many of those whose judgment I most respect in this body support this \namendment, including the senior Senator from Nebraska, whose reputation \nas a budget cutter needs no expounding by me. I am sympathetic. Clearly \nsomething is wrong with a system which so consistently produces \ndeficits so large.\n  The question for me is not whether something is wrong, but precisely, \nwhat is wrong? Do we run a massive deficit because something in the \nConstitution is broken? Were the Founding Fathers mistaken in assigning \nthe elected representatives of the people the task of setting fiscal \nand budget policy? And is a constitutional amendment, as opposed to a \nstatute requiring a balanced budget, the only workable solution? If the \nanswers to these questions were yes, then a constitutional amendment in \nmy judgment would be appropriate. But my answer in all three of these \nquestions, is a resounding no.\n  If, on the other hand, the problem lies in the behavior of the 535 \nindividuals whose actions produce the deficit, as opposed to the \ndocument that governs it, then a constitutional amendment is both an \ninappropriate and ineffective means for balancing the budget. If a \nsimple statute rather than an \n[[Page S2996]] amendment will work, we should leave the Constitution \nalone.\n  Supporters of the amendment note we tried statute in 1985 in the form \nof the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law and that law failed miserably. \nTherefore, the argument goes, a more powerful tool than ordinary \nstatute--in other words, constitutional amendment--is necessary. The \nassumption, apparently is that a constitutional amendment mandate would \nprovide the legal and the political cover needed to cast the tough \nvotes in a climate in which the political will for doing so does not \nexist.\n  But the fact is, Mr. President, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings failed not \nbecause it was a statute as opposed to an amendment, but because the \npolitical will to balance the budget did not exist in 1985. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings set deficit targets to set up on a glidepath, a term we \nare hearing again today, to achieve zero deficits by 1991.\n  The deficit target for 1986 was $172 billion. We end up $222 billion \nin the hole. President Reagan's budgets did not even meet the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings targets in that year, much less a balanced budget. And \neven though Gramm-Rudman-Hollings provided the legal and political \ncover for deficit reduction, neither Congress nor the President has the \nstomach for it. Now we are attempting to find in the Constitution what \nwe could not find in ourselves.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that 1995 and 1985 are two very different \ntimes. I have heard the American people say loud and clear in this last \nNovember election that not only does the will to balance the budget \nexist, it thrives. We all know that the political will to balance the \nbudget exists today to a much larger degree than it did in 1985. In \nfact, there is much more enthusiasm than existed even in 1994. The \npolitical dynamic has changed in this Congress. I believe the political \nwill now exists to make the tough choices.\n  To illustrate this change, consider our attitude toward spending cuts \ntoday. A year ago when a bipartisan coalition of Senators offered and \nfought for an amendment which would have cut $94 billion in spending \nover 5 years, the administration argued against it, saying our economy \nwould enter a recession. But since the election, Mr. President, the \nsame administration opponents are scrambling to propose cuts that are \nlarger than the ones that they opposed just a little over a year ago.\n  There are far more Senators and Representatives today who are \nprepared to vote for spending cuts than there were last year. And there \nis evidence of a willingness to form bipartisan coalitions in the \nbeginning to tackle the problem, including our most politically charged \nproblem, Federal entitlements.\n  So I say that after the rhetoric for and against this amendment is \nover, let Senators get to work to show Americans we have the courage \nthis amendment presumes that we lack. While it is true that the \nPresident's recently submitted budget does little to reduce the \ndeficit, the stomach for the tough choices does exist in this body. If \nthe appeal of a balanced budget amendment is simply the legal or \npolitical cover it provides for the tough choice, a statutory change \nwould provide the same cover. If the presumption behind the amendment \nis that the political will to balance the budget does not exist, then \nmake no mistake, those who lack that political will can find a way to \ncircumvent this amendment.\n  An amendment to the Constitution of the United States is a powerful \nweapon, not one to be taken lightly. This weapon can be disarmed with \n60 votes in the Senate, only 9 more than it takes for deficit spending \ntoday.\n  And beyond all the legal maneuvers, there is no cover for tough \ndecisions but the courage to make them. So I simply am not convinced a \nbalanced budget amendment is necessary. It assumes a structural flaw in \nour Constitution that prevents the 535 Members of Congress from \nbalancing the budget. In fact, there is no such flaw in the \nConstitution. To the extent such a flaw exists, it is in the 535 \nMembers of Congress themselves, not the document that governs us.\n  The fact is, we can balance the budget this year if we wanted to, and \nwe can by statute direct the Congress to balance the budget by 2002, \n2003, or any other date that we choose.\n  Furthermore, I believe this debate is misdirected. The balanced \nbudget amendment tells us what to do over the next 7 years but ignores \nthe following 20, the years which ought to command our attention.\n  A balanced budget by the year 2002 still ignores the most important \nfiscal challenge we face: The rapid growth in entitlement spending over \nthe next 30 years. The year on which we ought to be focused is not \n2002, but 2012 when the baby boomer generation begins to retire and \nplaces a severe strain on the Federal budget.\n  Our biggest fiscal challenge is demographic, not constitutional, and \nthe amendment before us does not and cannot address it. Unfortunately \nand conveniently, this demographic challenge is kept from our view, not \nby an incomplete Constitution, but by a budgeting process that \ndiscourages long-term planning.\n  The budget the President sent us tells us what to do for the next 5 \nyears--5 years, Mr. President. The balanced budget amendment tells us \nwhat happens over 7 years. Five- and seven-year spans are completely \ninadequate when the most difficult budget decisions we need to make \ndeal with problems we will face 20, 25 and 30 years down the road, when \nthe aging of our population propels entitlement spending out of \ncontrol.\n  The most important recommendation of the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform is that we began to look at the impact of \nthe budget over 30 years, rather than just 5 or 7. The reason that our \ncountry looks very different and our current budgets look very \ndifferent viewed over that span is, as I said, not one of our \nConstitution, not, indeed, even one of our statute, but one of \ndemographics.\n  We can see the trend in the short-term. The big four entitlement \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement--\nwill consume 44 percent of the budget this year. Mandatory spending \nwill consume 65 percent. By 2000, it will be 70 percent. By 2005, the \nnumber is 78 percent. Those numbers, Mr. President, are straight from \nCBO. If we project further, we see that by 2012, mandatory spending \nplus interest on the national debt will consume every dollar we collect \nin taxes. By 2013, we will be forced to begin dipping into the surplus \nof the Social Security trust funds to cover benefit payments, a \npractice that will go on for no more than 16 years before the trust \nfund goes bankrupt in the year 2029.\n  These trends have nothing to do with the Constitution, political will \nor pork barrel politics. They have to do with the simple fact that our \npopulation is getting older while the work force gets smaller. My \ngeneration did not have as many children as our parents expected and, \nas a consequence, the system under which each generation of workers \nsupports the preceding generation of retirees simply will not hold up \nmuch longer.\n  Indeed, long-term entitlement reform, coupled with a reasonable \nreduction in discretionary spending, including defense, would reduce \ninterest rates dramatically and achieve the goal of this amendment \nwithout tampering with the Constitution.\n  In this context, I need to address the role of Social Security in \nthis debate. I have heard speaker after speaker come to the floor on \nboth sides of the issue and announce their support for this program. I \nagree with them all. Social Security is one of the most, if not the \nmost, important and successful Government programs we operate. Social \nSecurity should not and, indeed, does not need to be used to balance \nthe budget. However, we cannot ignore the fact that Social Security \nwill start running a deficit in 2013, due, as I mentioned earlier, to \nthe retirement of the baby boomer generation and the fact that more \nretirees will be drawing from the trust funds while fewer workers \ncontribute to it.\n  The general fund currently borrows against the surplus, and when \nSocial Security begins running a deficit, the decisionmaking capacity \nof future Congresses will be limited, because large amounts of the \ngeneral fund will have to be used to repay the money we are borrowing \nfrom the trust fund today. That situation will tempt future Congresses \nto run Social Security in deficit if it is exempted from deficit \ncalculations. That development would, of \n[[Page S2997]] course, only further jeopardize the program.\n  Even today, our decisionmaking capacity is already limited by the \ngrowth of entitlement spending. In 1963, a little more than 30 years \nago, spending on entitlements and interest on the national debt \nconsumed 30 percent of our Federal budget. This year, entitlements and \nnet interest will devour 65 percent. The present budget assumes 66 \npercent for next year and by 2000, the number will be 70 percent.\n  Mr. President, that is the problem that we face. That is why we are \nforced year after year after year to come and cut domestic \ndiscretionary programs, whether it is defense or nondefense. The \npressure is coming from entitlement programs that are consuming a \nlarger and larger percent of our budget inexorably by the year 2013, it \nwill be 100 percent, converting the Federal Government into an ATM \nmachine.\n  The result is a question of fairness between generations. Today there \nare roughly five workers paying taxes to support the taxes of each \nretiree. When my generation retires, there will be fewer than three \nworkers per retiree. Unless we take action now, the choice forced upon \nour children will be excruciating. Continue to fund benefits at current \nlevels by radically raising taxes on the working population or slash \nbenefits dramatically.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as we debate this amendment, I hope we keep \nour eyes on a larger prize in blind reference to the idea of a balanced \nbudget. Our goals should, in my view, be economic prosperity. I support \ndeficit reduction as a means to that end. Deficit reduction is \nimportant not as an abstract ideal but as an economic comparative. I \nbelieve in balancing the budget because it is the surest and most \npowerful way to increase national savings. And increased national \nsavings will lead to increased national productivity which in turn will \nlead to higher standards of living for the American family.\n  There is no short cut to savings and no substitute that will get \nresults. Increased national savings mean lower long-term interest rates \nand increased job growth in the private sector. The balanced budget \namendment assumes that a balanced budget is always the best economic \npolicy. A balanced budget, Mr. President, is usually the best economic \nstrategy, but it is by no means always the best strategy for this \ncountry. Downward turns in the economy complicate the picture. Downward \nturns will result in lower revenues and higher spending so there will \nbe times, although very few of them, when a strict requirement for \nbalancing the budget harms the economy by requiring the collection of \nmore and more taxes to cover more and more spending in an economic \nenvironment which makes revenue collection more difficult in the first \nplace.\n  As I say, I believe those times are few and far between. But the \nConstitution is too blunt an instrument to distinguish between good \ntimes and bad. The American people hired us to do that job, not to cede \nit to a legal document that cannot assess the evolving needs of our \neconomy.\n  The bottom line for me as we debate this amendment is whether it \nmoves us toward achieving the correct goals and whether, if it does, we \nneed to amend the Constitution to get there.\n  My answer to the first question is mixed. I believe a balanced budget \nis an important goal, but only as a component of an overall economic \nstrategy which recognizes that skyrocketing entitlement spending is the \nmost serious fiscal challenge we face.\n  My answer to the second question is more certain. I believe that once \nwe set those goals, we can achieve them by statute or, more \nimportantly, by changing our own behavior rather than changing the \nConstitution. My respect for this document precludes me from voting to \ntamper with it when I am not convinced that we must. This proposal for \na 28th amendment does not command for me the same reverence in which I \nhold the 1st amendment or the 13th or the 19th and, therefore, Mr. \nPresident, while I will continue to fight for its admirable goal, I \nwill vote no on the balanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to call up motion No. 3 at the desk and that it be \nconsidered as one of my relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I might, it \nis my understanding that there are two unanimous consent requests which \ndeal with two amendments of the Senator from Minnesota. I wonder if I \nmight make those requests and see if they are suitable to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, and we can proceed in that manner.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that will be fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be recognized to call up his motion dealing with homeless \nchildren; and that time prior to a motion to table be limited to the \nfollowing: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone; 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Hatch; and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the majority leader, or his \ndesignee, be recognized to table the Wellstone motion; and that that \nvote occur at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the Wellstone motion dealing with homeless \nchildren, Senator Wellstone be recognized to call up his filed motion \nNo. 2, and that time prior to a motion to table be limited to the \nfollowing: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone, 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Hatch, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time the majority leader or his designee \nbe recognized to make a motion to table the Wellstone motion, and that \nvote occur in the stacked sequence to begin at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                            Motion to refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nArizona and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me for my colleagues----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for just a moment \nwhile the clerk states the motion, please.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] moves to refer \n     House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee with \n     instructions to report back forthwith House Joint Resolution \n     1 in status quo and at the earliest date possible, to issue a \n     report, the text of which shall be as follows:\n       ``It is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     Congress should take no action which would increase the \n     number of hungry or homeless children.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. The motion is self-\nexplanatory, it is very reasonable, and it is very important.\n  What this motion says is not that we should delay the vote on the \nbalanced budget amendment. We will have that vote. This is not a part \nof that constitutional amendment at all. This is just simply a motion \nwhich says we will go on record through the Senate Budget Committee \nthat in whatever ways we move forward to balance the budget, whether \nthis constitutional amendment is passed or not --there is really no \nlinkage here--we will go on record, and I would like to again now go \nthrough the operative language, it is the sense of the Senate to the \nBudget Committee:\n\n       That in enacting the policy changes necessary to achieve \n     the more than $1 trillion in deficit reduction necessary to \n     achieve a balanced budget, Congress should take no action \n     which would increase the number of hungry or homeless \n     children.\n\n  [[Page S2998]] That is what this motion says. One more time, it is \nnot an amendment to this constitutional amendment. It does not put off \nthe date that we vote on this amendment. I simply ask that the Senate \ngo on record through the Budget Committee that if this amendment passes \nor even if this amendment does not pass, we will take no action which \nwould increase the number of hungry or homeless children.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Chamber from the beginning of this \nsession with just this amendment which has received, I think, 43 votes. \nI do not understand why the Senate is not willing to go on record on \nthis question.\n  Mr. President, this motion is essentially a statement by the Senate; \nit is a request to colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, that we \nspeak boldly and we speak directly, as we understand children are the \nmost vulnerable citizens in this country.\n  Every time I hear one of my colleagues talk about how we have to \nreduce the deficit--and by the way, sometimes people get confused \nbetween annual deficit and this huge debt we have built up--and that we \ncannot put this deficit on the shoulders of our children and our \ngrandchildren, the best thing we can do for the children of our Nation \nis to balance the budget, I say to myself, fine, I agree. I am a \nfather. I am a grandfather. But what about the vulnerable children in \nthe United States of America today?\n  Why cannot the Senate go on record--it is a sense of the Senate--that \nwe certainly understand as we go forward with deficit reduction we will \nnot do anything which would increase hunger or homelessness among \nchildren in our Nation. Is that too much to ask? What possibly could be \nthe reason for voting no?\n  Senators are talking about how we have to balance the budget for the \nsake of the children of the future. How about the lives of children \nliving now? How about children right now who happen to be among the \nmost vulnerable group in this Nation?\n  The context is important. The Food Research and Action Center in 1991 \nestimated that 5.5 million children under 12 years of age are hungry at \nleast one day a month in the United States of America. Second Harvest \nestimated that, in 1993, emergency food programs served 10,798,375 \nchildren. The U.S. Council of Mayors found that, in 1994, 64 percent of \nthe persons receiving food assistance were from families with children. \nCarnegie Foundation, late 1980's--68 percent of public schoolteachers \nreported that undernourished children and youth are a problem in \nschool. By the way, I talk to teachers in Minnesota who tell me the \nsame thing.\n  Children are among the homeless in this country and indeed families \nwith children are a substantial segment of the homeless population. The \nU.S. Council of Mayors estimates that, in 1994, 26 percent of the \nhomeless were children, based upon requests from emergency shelters. \nThat is a pretty large percentage of the homeless population. And, in \n1988, the Institute of Medicine estimated that 100,000 children are \nhomeless each day.\n  Mr. President, what does it mean that children are hungry? In \ncomparison to nonhungry children, hungry children are more than three \ntimes likely to suffer from unwanted weight loss, more than four times \nas likely to suffer from fatigue, almost three times as likely to \nsuffer from irritability, and more than 12 times as likely to report \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, let me discuss the context one more time. I have been \nin this Chamber from the beginning of this session with this basic \nproposition, either in amendment form, or now, in the most reasonable \nform possible; as just a motion, a sense of the Senate that would go to \nthe Budget Committee. It is not a part of the constitutional amendment. \nThis motion merely has us going on record that as we move toward a \nbalanced budget, which we are all for as well as deficit reduction, we \nare not going to take any action that would increase the number of \nhungry or homeless children in America. Will the Senate not go on \nrecord supporting this?\n  I hear Senators say that they are going to make these cuts; that is \nthe best thing they can do for our children and our grandchildren. What \nabout these children? One out of every four children in America is \npoor.\n  Children's Defense Fund came out with a study last year--this data is \naccurate and I wish it was not. I wish this was not the reality. One \nday in the life of American children, three children die from child \nabuse. One day in the life of American children, nine children are \nmurdered. One day in the life of American children, 13 children die \nfrom guns. One day in the life of American children, 27 children, a \nclassroomful, die from poverty. One day in the life of American \nchildren, 63 babies die before they are 1 month old. One day in the \nlife of American children, 101 babies die before their first birthday. \nOne day in the life of American children, 145 babies are born at very \nlow birthweight, less than 5.5 pounds--yet the House of Representatives \nyesterday voted to block grant and cut Women, Infants and Children \nprograms. Cut nutrition programs--that was the vote in the House \nyesterday.\n  One day in the life of American children, 636 babies are born to \nwomen who had late or no prenatal care. One day in the life of American \nchildren, 1,234 children run away from home.\n One day in the life of American children, 2,868 babies are born into \npoverty. One day in the life of American children, 7,945 children are \nreported abused or neglected. One day in the life of American children, \n100,000 children are homeless.\n\n  I hope my colleagues are not bored by these statistics. These are \nreal people. These are children in the United States of America. These \nchildren, all of these children, are our children.\n  Moments in America for children? Every 35 seconds a child drops out \nof school in America. Every 30 seconds, a child is born into poverty, \nevery 30 seconds a child is born into poverty. Every 2 minutes a child \nis born low birth weight. Every 2 minutes a child is born to a woman \nwho had no prenatal care. Every 4 minutes a child is arrested for \nalcohol-related crime. Every 7 minutes a child is arrested for drug-\nrelated crime. I have given this figure before: Every 2 hours a child \nis murdered and every 4 hours a child takes his or her life in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, I received a letter from Ona. I do not use last names \nbecause I never know whether citizens want to have their names used or \nnot. Ona is 8.\n\n       My name is Ona and I go to public school and I'm 8. My \n     class has 26 kids in it and only three of them, Iman, Jasmin, \n     and me bring lunches to school. Twenty-three kids in my class \n     depend on the school lunch and now you want to cut those \n     programs. Which do you think is more important, cutting the \n     debt or having poor helpless children having nothing to eat? \n     Senator, that's not right because almost my entire class \n     depends on school breakfast and school lunch, and if you cut \n     these programs they will starve. How do they explain to a \n     starving child, oh, we are cutting the debt. It will be good \n     for you.\n\n  She is 8 years old. How come my colleagues do not get this?\n\n       How do they explain to a starving child, oh, we are cutting \n     the debt. It will be good for you. Life is already hard \n     enough for us with pollution, crime and disease. I hope you \n     change your mind.\n\n  Ona, you do not have to ask me to change my mind. And she is so \nright.\n  Some of my colleagues say this is just a scare tactic. Prove me \nwrong. I will give you a chance at 3 o'clock today to prove me wrong. \n``This is just a scare tactic.'' Who is kidding whom? Look at the \nheadlines:\n  ``House Panels Vote Social Funding Cuts.''\n  ``Republicans Trim Nutrition, Housing.''\n  Washington Post, front page story:\n\n       House Republicans, wielding their budget-cutting axes more \n     forcefully than at any time since taking power, yesterday \n     proposed slashing some $5.2 billion of spending approved by \n     previous Democratic Congresses * * *.\n       Included in the lengthy list of cuts voted out by five \n     appropriations subcommittees during a hectic day of meetings \n     were rural housing loans, nutrition programs for children and \n     pregnant women * * *.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       * * * nutrition programs for children and pregnant women, \n     spending on urban parks, and assistance to the poor and \n     elderly for protecting their homes against the cold.\n\n  That is right. They want to eliminate LIHEAP, Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. I have spent time with families in Minnesota--it is \na cold weather State--who depend on \n[[Page S2999]] LIHEAP. You are going to cut their energy assistance so \nthey have a choice between heat or eat?\n  It is time to get a little bit more real with people in this country \nabout what this agenda translates into. Another headline, ``House Panel \nMoves To Cut Federal Child Care, School Lunch Funds.'' Washington Post, \nThursday, February 23, 1995.\n  I have been saying that this would happen from the beginning of the \nsession and I have had people on the other side of the aisle say we are \nnot going to do that. ``We care as much about children as you do.'' \nProve me wrong. You get a chance to vote on this today.\n  The article reads:\n\n       After a full day of beating back Democratic amendments to \n     restore the programs or soften their impact on welfare \n     recipients, Chairman William Goodling said his committee will \n     complete work today on a bill that will abolish the school \n     breakfast, lunch and other nutrition programs for women and \n     children and replace them with a block grant to the States.\n       The Republican measure would freeze the amount of money \n     given to States for child care at $1.94 billion a year, the \n     current level. Representative George Miller [who is right] \n     charged that because the number of needy children is expected \n     to increase, the freeze would cut off child payments for more \n     than 377,000 children in the year 2000.\n       By contrast, funding for the school lunch and nutrition \n     programs would be allowed to grow by $1.87 billion over 5 \n     years. But committee Democrats said this was grossly \n     inadequate and would fall $5 to $7 billion short of what is \n     needed.\n\n  It is block granted but it is bait and switch. It is block granted \nwith cuts and, in addition, it is no longer an entitlement. So during \nmore difficult times such as recession, if there are additional \nchildren who now need the assistance, those who are receiving \nassistance will have their assistance cut or some will be cut off the \nsupport. It is simple.\n  ``House Moves To Cut Federal Child Care, School Lunch Funds.''\n  ``House Panels Vote Social Funding Cuts, Republicans Trim Nutrition, \nHousing.''\n  Including the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  I have had some colleagues say to me this is just a scare tactic. But \nit is not. Because this is precisely where the cuts are taking place.\n  Mr. President, may I have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend until the Sergeant at \nArms has restored order in the galleries, please.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish that I did not have to come to the floor with \nthis motion.\n  I wish that this was not real. But the evidence is crystal clear. All \nyou have to do is look at the state of children in America today. They \nare the most vulnerable citizens, the most poor. I am just saying to my \ncolleague, can we not go on record that we are not going to pass any \nlegislation or make any cuts that will increase hunger among children?\n  Then I look at what has happened on the House side. They are cutting \nnutrition programs--cutting nutrition programs--the very thing that my \ncolleagues over here said we will not do. And what people now say is do \nnot worry about the House. The U.S. Senate is a different body, and it \nis. We are more deliberative. We do not ram things through. We are more \ncareful. But now what I have to say to some of my colleagues is two or \nthree times I have come to this floor and asked you to please go on \nrecord that we will not do anything that would increase hunger or \nhomelessness among children. And each time, you voted no.\n  Mr. President, The Children's Defense Fund that reported on where \nthis balanced budget amendment will take us--I do not have the chart I \nusually have with me. But, roughly speaking, if you include in this \npackage the baseline CBO projections plus tax cuts, which do not make a \nlot of sense when you are trying to do deficit reduction, broad-based \ntax cuts, plus increases in the Pentagon budget, it is about $1.3 \ntrillion that needs to be cut between now and the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, if Social Security is off the table--and it should \nbe--if you are going to have to pay the interest on the debt and if \nmilitary spending is going up, then it is pretty clear what is left. \nWhen you look at what has been taken off the table and what has been \nleft on the table, it is crystal clear that you are going to have to \nhave, about 30-percent cuts across the board. It may be that veterans \nprograms will not be cut 30 percent. I hope not. But you basically have \nhigher education; you have Medicare and Medicaid; you have veterans; \nand you have these low-income children's programs.\n  Yesterday in the House, they are talking about cutting the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, and the school lunch program. They are \ntalking about eliminating the low-income energy assistance program. \nThat is for low-income people in cold-weather States like Minnesota. I \nvisited with those families. These issues are real to them.\n  But when Senator Feingold and I came out on the floor of the Senate \nlast week, and we had a very reasonable motion, that the Senate would \ngo on record through the Budget Committee that we will consider $425 \nbillion of tax expenditures, many of them loopholes, deductions and \noutright dodges for the largest corporations and financial institutions \nin America, they voted it down.\n  So I understand what the Children's Defense Fund understands, that on \npresent legislative course, this is where we are heading: By year 2002, \n7.5 million children lose federally subsidized lunches, 6.6 million \nchildren lose their health care through Medicaid, 3 million children \nlose food stamps, and 2 million young children and mothers lose \nnutritional assistance through the WIC program. This is a very \ndestructive way to ensure that our children are not burdened by debt.\n  May I repeat that? This is a very destructive way of assuring that \nour children will not be burdened by debt, to cut into the very \nnutrition programs that benefit children right now who are so \nvulnerable in the United States of America, all for the sake of making \nsure that our children in the future are not burdened by debt.\n  I wish my colleagues were as concerned about the children right now \nas they are about the children in the future.\n  Mr. President, I might ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has approximately \n20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah is interested in responding, \nthen I will yield the floor for a moment and reserve the rest of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be \nrecognized to call up his amendment No. 301 following the remarks of \nSenator Hollings today, and that time prior to a motion to table be \nlimited to the following: 45 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd, \n30 minutes under the control of Senator Hatch, and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time, the majority leader or his \ndesignee be recognized to make a motion to table the Byrd amendment, \nand that vote occur in the stacked sequence beginning at 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, we are now--let me take a few minutes--in our 25th day \nsince this amendment was brought to the floor. Twenty-five days have \nexpired since we started debating the balanced budget amendment. As you \ncan see, I have added one more day, the 25th. This red line all the way \nfrom there over to here happens to be the baseline of $4.8 trillion, \nwhich is our national debt. It is $18,500 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America, plus it is going up every day. Each day that we have \ndebated this balanced budget amendment, I just want the American people \nto understand that our national debt has gone up $829 billion. We are \nnow in the 25th day, and our national debt has been increased since we \nbegan this debate $2.736 billion.\n  I do not care who you are. You have to draw the analogy between Rome \n[[Page S3000]] under Nero, as he fiddled while Rome burned. \nFortunately, we do have a vote next Tuesday. We will decide this one \nway or the other, whether we are going to put a mechanism into the \nConstitution that will force Members of Congress to at least look at \nthese details and do something about it. We will make it more difficult \nfor them to spend more and to take more. It does not stop them, but it \ncertainly makes it more difficult.\n  What I have to say is that predicted opponents of the balanced budget \namendment are trotting out a series of sympathetic Government \nbeneficiaries and attempting either to exempt them from the balanced \nbudget amendment or use them to argue against not just the amendment \nbut indeed against balancing the budget at all.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator understands that this is a motion. It is \nnot an amendment to the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nThis has no linkage. This is simply a sense-of-the-Senate to the Budget \nCommittee that when it comes to balancing the budget, we will go on \nrecord that we will not increase the number of hungry and homeless \nchildren. That is all this motion says.\n  The Senator speaks to that, and that is why I asked the question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. This motion, in my opinion, is just another \nin a parade of exemptions which the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment have tried to tack on. I know the Senator is sincere. I have \nworked with him ever since he has been here. He has a great deal of \nsincerity with regard to the people who are in difficulty and have \ndifficulty, and especially the homeless. But I think, in that sense, it \nis just as inappropriate as the other motions that have been brought to \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, does the Senator understand that this \nis not an amendment to the constitutional amendment and, in that sense, \nit is not an exemption? It just simply asks us to go on record, through \nthe Budget Committee, that we will not do anything that would increase \nmore hunger or homelessness among children. Does the Senator understand \nthat?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is all I am asking.\n  Could the Senator tell me, does the Senator know, during this period \nof time, how many more hungry or homeless children there have been in \nthe United States of America?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think anybody fully knows.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But is it not interesting that we do not know what we \ndo not want to know. Why do we not know?\n  Mr. HATCH. I disagree with the Senator that I do not want to know. I \nthink the Senator knows my whole career has been spent helping those \nwho are less fortunate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator does. I certainly do understand that. That \nis why I asked the Senator from Utah, who is probably one of the \nSenators I consider to be a really good friend.\n  Let me ask the Senator, why is this an unreasonable proposition, \ngiven the headline ``Republicans Trim Nutrition, Housing,'' what is \ngoing on on the House side right now, and given the fear of so many of \nthe people that are working down in the trenches with children, that we \nboth admire, about where these cuts are going to take place?\n  This is not an amendment to the constitutional amendment. This is \njust a sense of the Senate. Why is it so unreasonable, since we will \nhave the vote on Tuesday--no more delay--why is it so unreasonable for \nme to ask the Senate to go on record that we will not make any cuts \nthat will increase hunger or homelessness among children? Why does the \nSenator from Utah not support this, since he cares about this certainly \nas much as I do, and others?\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me try to answer the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Founders gave Congress the power to spend money. \nThey did not go on record as being opposed to action which would \nincrease the number of homeless children or any other budget policy \nissue. They understood that the Constitution establishes the processes \nand the procedures under which our Government operates or would operate \nfrom that point on. Which policy choices may be made under those \nprocedures do not belong in the discussion of the great principles of \nour Constitution.\n  We are talking about a constitutional amendment that could save our \ncountry, because our country, as we can easily see, is going more and \nmore into debt to the point where interest against the national debt is \nnow consuming 50 percent of all personal income taxes paid every year.\n  Now, I know my colleague is concerned about the homeless--so am I--\nand so many others, from child care right on through to people with \nAIDS.\n  I testified yesterday in favor of the Kennedy-Hatch Ryan White bill, \nwhich, of course, provides money for the cities with hardcore AIDS \nproblems. So I feel very deeply about these issues.\n  But I feel very deeply that those moneys are not going to be there if \nwe keep running this country into bankruptcy. And if we think we have \nhomeless people now, wait until you see what happens as that interest \nkeeps going to the point where it consumes all of our personal income \ntaxes. It is now consuming half of the personal income taxes paid in \nAmerica today. We are going up, as this balanced budget amendment debt \ntracker shows, as this debate continues. We are already up to $20 \nbillion, almost $21 billion, in the 25 days that we have debated this \namendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am concerned about it. Of course, we will do \nwhat we think is best for the children of America and for the homeless \nof America. But the least thing we can do for them is to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment so they have a future, so that Members of \nCongress, most of whom are altruistic and want to do good for people, \nhave to live within certain means, have to live within the means of \nthis country.\n  You know, if you think about it, if we pass the balanced budget \namendment, then I think we will have an answer to the question why a \nchild born today will pay an extra $100,000 in taxes over his or her \nlifetime for the debt that is being projected to accumulate in just the \nfirst 18 years of that child's life. And there will be another $5,000 \nin taxes for every additional $200 billion deficit.\n  Mr. President, our President has sent us a budget that for the next \n12 years projects $200 billion deficits a year. That is billion, with a \n``b.'' Every year that happens, these children's taxes will go up \n$5,000 more. They will become more tax debt owing, $5,000 more for each \nyear there is a $200 billion deficit. So if it is 12 years, that is \n$60,000 more on top of the current $100,000 they are going to be \nsaddled with because of the way we have been handling situations.\n  Mr. President, most Government programs have beneficiaries with some \npolitical popularity or power or attractiveness. And that is why they \nreceive benefits in the first place. But this kind of thinking, that we \nshould spend for these worthy beneficiaries whether we have the money \nor not, is precisely why we have the colossal national debt that we do.\n  And I am just pointing to the balanced budget amendment debt tracker, \nwhich just shows the 25 days of increased debt, $21 billion so far.\n  The power of the tax spenders has always been built on appealing to \nan attractive, narrow interest and that power has always outweighed the \nmore diffused interest of the taxpayers and of our children, who cannot \nyet vote whose moneys we are spending in advance.\n  Mr. President, this is business as usual, and it is what the balanced \nbudget amendment is designed to end. The purpose of the balanced budget \namendment is to ensure that Congress takes into account increased \ntaxes, stagnant wages, higher interest rates, and the insurmountable \ndebt that we will leave to our children if we keep spending the money \nthat we do not have.\n  [[Page S3001]] The parade of special interest groups embodied by so \nmany of the amendments which have been offered against this balanced \nbudget amendment, including this one, is to take the focus off our \nchildren's future and put it on the short-term interest of another, \nperhaps worthy, special interest group. There are thousands of special \ninterest groups in our country. I wish we had enough money to take care \nof all of them and to do it in a way that would give them dignity and \nwould help them to find their own way, would empower them to be able to \nmake something of their lives. There is no question that all of us want \nto do that.\n  But we are never going to do it--we are going to have more homeless, \nwe are going to have more children bereft of what they need, we are \ngoing to have less of a future for them--if we do not pass this \nbalanced budget amendment and get this spending under control.\n  Make no mistake, those who keep bringing up these amendments for \nspecial interest groups, who are needy and whom we all want to help, in \norder to kill this amendment by 1,000 cuts, I think their efforts ought \nto be rejected. And that does not mean that they are not sincere or \nthey are not good people or they are not trying to do their best.\n  I find no fault with my friend from Minnesota in worrying about those \nwho are homeless. I do, too. But if we are really worried about them, \nthen let us get this country's spending practices under control so that \nthis country's economy is strong so we can help them. I am willing to \ndo that, and I have a reputation around here for trying.\n  I think the Senate should get on with its business of weighing each \nof the interests presented to make choices among all the worthy \nprograms within the constraints of the revenues we are willing to \nraise, like reasonable economic actors.\n  Our problem today is, because we do not have a balanced budget \namendment, people do not care how much they spend of the future of our \nchildren. They can feel very good towards themselves that they are \ncompassionate and considerate of those who need help. But what they do \nnot tell is the other side of that coin--that all of us are going to \nneed help in the future if this country's economy becomes less than \nwhat it is, and it has no other way to go if we do not start getting \nour spending under control.\n  So I suggest that, in spite of the sincerity of my friend from \nMinnesota, we vote down this amendment, as we have had to do, in order \nto preserve this concept of a balanced budget in the Constitution.\n  This is our last chance. This is the first time in history, the first \ntime in history, that the House of Representatives has had the guts, as \na collective body, to get a two-thirds vote--which is very, very \ndifficult to do--to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  The reason they have is because of the budget-courageous Democrats \nand Republicans who decided the country is more important than any \nspecial interest. And that we have to get the country under control and \nspending practices under control if we are really going to help the \nspecial interests, many of whom are worthy interests.\n  On the one hand, I commend the distinguished Senator for his \ncompassion and his desire to help people. On the other hand, I have \ndifficulties with those who have brought up these amendments because \nevery one of these amendments would make the balanced budget amendment \nless important.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I find the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Utah to be very important. I want to come back to a couple of \nbasic points because I really believe that the vote on this motion is a \nreal moment of truth here.\n  First of all, Mr. President, this is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. That is not what they \nare voting on.\n  This motion just says that we go on record we will not take any \naction which will increase the number of hungry or homeless children. \nIt is that simple. I did not say we should balance the budget. I did \nnot say we should not have serious deficit reduction. We have to make \nchoices. It is a question of whether there is a standard of fairness. I \nwant the Senate to go on record.\n  Second of all, Mr. President, my colleague from Utah talked all about \nthe Constitution, and therefore this is no place for a discussion of \nhunger and homelessness among children, because it is a different order \nof question. I might remind my colleague that the Preamble of the \nConstitution says: ``We, the people of the United States, in Order to \nform a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \nTranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general \nWelfare.'' I would think that children are a part of how we promote the \ngeneral welfare. Do not tell me that being on the floor of the Senate \nand talking about children does not have anything to do with the \nfounding documents of our Nation. We talk about promoting the general \nwelfare, I assume that includes children.\n  The third point, Mr. President, I heard my colleague use the words \n``special interest'' more than once. Children are special interests. We \nare all for the future, and we are all talking about we want to make \nsure that our children and grandchildren do not have to carry this \ndebt. How about the children now?\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not have such a fancy chart but the facts \nremain. Every 5 seconds a student drops out of school; every 30 \nseconds, a baby is born into poverty; every 2 minutes a baby is born at \nlow birthweight; every 2 minutes a baby is born to a mother who had no \nprenatal care; every 4 minutes a child is arrested for an alcohol-\nrelated crime; every 5 minutes a child is arrested for a violent crime; \nevery 7 minutes a child is arrested for a drug crime; every 2 hours a \nchild is murdered; every 4 hours a child commits suicide.\n  I spoke about 100,000 homeless and 5 million hungry children earlier.\n  I hear my colleague talking about our generosity. We cannot talk \nabout our generosity. We have abandoned many children in the United \nStates of America. I might add we devalued the work of many adults that \nwork with those children. That is what these statistics say. And now, \nrather than investing more in our children, we are cutting programs.\n  Three children die from child abuse; 1 day, 9 children are murdered; \n1 day, 63 babies die before they are one month old; 1 day, 101 babies \ndie before their first birthday; 1 day, 145 babies are born at very low \nbirthweight. And I can go on and on.\n  Mr. President, why do we not juxtapose these figures, these \nstatistics about children in America today, with the headlines in the \nWashington Post, ``House Panels Vote Special Funding Cuts, Republicans \nTrim Nutrition, Housing''; ``House Panel Moves To Cut Federal Child \nCare, School Lunch Funds.'' I do not really think my colleagues can \nhave it both ways.\n  Let me get right down to the essence of this motion. We have these \nfigures. We have the Children's Defense Fund which has been the \norganization most down in the trenches with children. I have State-by-\nState variations. I could read from every State--Idaho, Minnesota, \nUtah--about the projected cuts, because we know there will be cuts in \nthese programs. We have to cut somewhere.\n  Now, I came on to the floor of the Senate during the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and I had an amendment that came from Minnesota \nthat essentially said before we send the balanced budget amendment to \nthe States, let Senators lay out where we will be making the cuts. It \nwas voted down. The minority leader, Senator Daschle, had a similar \namendment. It was voted down.\n  My colleagues will not specify where they will make the cuts, but \nwhen Senator Feingold and I said how about oil company subsidies, \npharmaceutical subsidies, or $425 billion in tax holes, loopholes, \ndeductions, and sometimes outright dodges, would we consider that in \nhow we would balance the budget? No. That was the vote.\n   My colleague from Utah says we have to make difficult choices. That \nis true. I am for cutting the Pentagon budget. I do not think military \ncontractors are in a position where they cannot afford to tighten their \nbelt. They are not being asked to tighten their belt. Nor \n[[Page S3002]] are we going after tax dodges and loopholes and \ndeductions, and we have a bidding war on tax cuts. So there we have \n$1.3 trillion. We will not specify where we make the cuts, but we know \nwhat is left.\n  I am saying to my colleagues, we cannot have it both ways. Do not, \none more time on the floor of the U.S. Senate, say to me or say to \nchildren in this country, that this is just a scare tactic. I wish it \nwere just a scare tactic. Or this is just a political strategy to get \npeople on record.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues is, is it too much to ask that we \ngo on record saying to our Budget Committee, as we go forward with \ndeficit reduction and as we go forward to balancing the budget which we \nare all for one way or the other, we go on record, we are not going to \ndo anything that will increase hunger, homelessness among children? \nKnow why my colleagues will not vote for this Mr. President? Because \nthat is what we are going to do.\n  The reason my colleagues will not vote for this is because that is \nprecisely what we are going to do.\n  I do not understand for the life of me why I cannot get the U.S. \nSenate on record on this very fundamental basic question. We cannot go \nforward with deficit reduction. I do not want to let colleagues say he \nis just doing this motion because he is not in favor of deficit \nreduction. That is not true. I voted for huge deficit reduction. I want \nto see all sorts of cuts. I would like to see the oil companies tighten \ntheir belt. I do not hear anything about that. But, no, I do not want \nto see the most vulnerable citizens being hurt.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a couple of colleagues talk about the \nlast election.\n And the people voted for change. People voted for change, but not this \nkind of change. There is too much goodness in the United States of \nAmerica to cut nutrition programs and school lunch programs and child \ncare programs, all in the name of deficit reduction. That is not where \npeople in the United States of America want to see the cuts. My \ncolleagues need to understand that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I come out here determined because I have a real \nsense of trepidation. I know what is going to happen with these \nprograms. I know the majority leader was out on the floor saying we \ncare as much about children as the Senator from Minnesota. I know my \ncolleague from Utah says that.\n  I now say prove me wrong. Prove now this afternoon that this is just \na scare tactic. I want to be wrong. Prove this afternoon that this is \njust some political strategy. Let us go on record, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that we are serious about deficit reduction, we are \nserious about balancing the budget, because I think we all are. And \nwhat we are going to do is go on record this afternoon, not with an \namendment to this constitutional amendment--that is not what this is. \nThis is just simply a motion to go on record that when we make these \ncuts, we are not going to do anything to increase hunger or \nhomelessness among children. I do not understand why I cannot get 100 \nvotes for it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah is finished \nwith his remarks, I will be pleased to yield him some of my time if he \nneeds it, or I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to agree to that, to yield back time on \nboth sides. And then the votes are to be stacked, as I understand it, \nbeginning at 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled to occur at 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to table and ask \nfor the yeas and nays with the understanding that the vote not occur \nuntil 3, or should we just wait until then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First we must announce the result of the \nrequest for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays, with the understanding that it will not be voted \nupon until 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur beginning at 3 o'clock \ntoday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For a few moments, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next \namendment, let me just say a few words about the impact of the deficit \non the average American.\n  We need to stop talking and start working on getting our fiscal house \nin order by passing the balanced budget amendment and working together \nto balance the budget.\n  The American people want and need us to do this. Our large national \ndebts and the yearly deficits that help it grow hurt real people, \naverage working people all over the country--everybody. Continuing down \nthe path we are on will only make matters worse for all of us and all \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  Recently, the Washington Post ran an article by James Glassman, who I \nbelieve did an excellent job of stating in an understandable way how \nand why the deficit hurts the average working American. He called his \ndiscussion the ``Plain English Guide to the Federal Budget,'' and it \nbegan with the sage assertion that ``big deficits can make you poor.''\n  That is it in a nutshell, Mr. President. For all of those of you who \nare listening to the debate, you should know this and tell your \nSenators that you want them to pass the balanced budget amendment to \nstop making you poor. ``Big deficits can make you poor.'' Mr. Glassman \nexplained, ``they tend to retard the growth of the private sector, \nraise interest rates, and weaken our economy.''\n  That is exactly why we need the balanced budget amendment, because \nCongress' fiscal madness is destroying the ability of the working \nAmerican to make enough money to survive.\n  Every year, hard-working Americans pay the price for our profligacy. \nThe tax foundation has calculated that in 1994, the average American \nworked from January 1 to May 5 just to pay his or her taxes. They did \nnot get to keep 1 cent of the money they earned until May 6. Put \nanother way, in an 8-hour work day, the average American works the \nfirst 2 hours 45 minutes just to pay his or her taxes. This is bad \nenough but that is not the end of the story.\n  The increasing Federal debt will force us to raise taxes to \nastronomical rates just to keep the country solvent. The National \nTaxpayers Union has estimated that a child born today will pay on \naverage $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or her lifetime \njust to pay for the interest on the national debt which accumulates \nduring the first 18 years of that child's life. Just think, by the time \na child becomes old enough to vote, there will already be a $100,000 \ntax bill looming on his or her horizon if we do not get it under \ncontrol, and that is only to pay the interest on the debt accumulated \nin that child's first 18 years.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has also determined that for every year \nwe endure another $200 billion deficit, it costs the average child over \n$5,000 in additional taxes over his or her lifetime--every year we do \nthat.\n Mr. President, the budget submitted by President Clinton, as I have \nsaid earlier, projects $200 billion deficits for each of the next 5 \nyears, actually each of the next 12 years. By conceding defeat on \ndeficit reduction, President Clinton is condemning every child in \nAmerica just over the next 5 years to an additional $25,000 in extra \ntaxes--in that child's next 5 years.\n\n  When a child born this year is 10 years old, in fiscal year 2005, the \nCBO's conservative projections show that the \n[[Page S3003]] deficit will top $400 billion, more than twice today's \nlevels. That year alone, this child will be socked with a $10,000 tax \nbill just to pay interest on the deficit--that year alone. The debt \nwill reach nearly $6.8 trillion or 58 percent of our GDP. Now, that is \nthe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, Economic and Budget Outlook \nfor fiscal year 1996 to the year 2000.\n  But the bad news about the debt does not end there either. The \nCompetitiveness Policy Council has shown that the rising budget \ndeficits have led to a 15 percent decline in real wages in the last 15 \nyears, and the National Taxpayers Union has further calculated that in \nthe next 45 years, unless we get our spending under control, after-tax \nincomes will rise over the total 45 years by a cumulative meager $125. \nThat is all we will gain over 45 years is another $125.\n  Mr. President, these deficits are strangling middle-class Americans \nthroughout our country. How can people be expected to bear the burden \nof stagnating wages and higher tax bills and rates? We simply cannot \ncontinue blindly down this road to economic oblivion.\n  Why act now? Why? Because so much is riding on our vote. Next \nTuesday, this is going to be the most important vote in the eyes of \nmany in this century.\n  If we do not act, just think of the fate we are leaving to our future \ngenerations. As Senator Daschle said last Congress when he voted in \nfavor of the balanced budget amendment, ``We are leaving a legacy of \ndebt for our children and grandchildren.''\n  Every child born in America today comes into this world, as I have \nsaid, over $18,500 in debt. That is what they are born with, and that \nis growing.\n  In President Clinton's fiscal year 1995 budget, it was estimated that \nfor children born in 1993, the lifetime net tax rate will be 82 \npercent. The net tax rate is the estimate of taxes paid to the \nGovernment less transfers received, if the Government's total spending \nis not reduced from its projected path and if we do not pay more than \nprojected. The 82-percent figure for our children stands in stark \ncontrast to the 29 percent net tax rate for the generations of \nAmericans born in the 1920's and the 34.4-percent net tax rate for the \ngeneration born in the 1960's. Now, that comes right out of the Clinton \nadministration 1995 budget generational forecasting. That is this \nadministration.\n  It took our Nation 205 years, from 1776 to 1981, to reach a $1 \ntrillion national debt. It took only 11 years to quadruple that figure. \nToday, the national debt stands at more than $4.8 trillion. Citizens of \nother nations, like Argentina, Canada and Italy, have faced stagnant \nand lower living standards when their governments ran up huge debts. \nOur future generations face higher interest rates, less affordable \nhousing, fewer jobs, lower wages, and a loss of economic sovereignty.\n  Now, we must get Government spending under control. The only way to \ndo that is to change the way Congress does business with a permanent \nunavoidable rule. That rule will be the balanced budget amendment that \nwe are debating here--bipartisan consensus, Democrat-Republican \namendment. It will force Congress to consider the costs as well as the \nbenefits of every program in the Federal Government. We will lower the \nunbelievable amount of Government spending and bring the deficit under \ncontrol.\n  All other attempts to balance the budget have failed and failed \nmiserably. We went through all of the statutes that we have tried to \nuse. Every one of them has failed. Every year the debt grows \nrelentlessly, sapping the life out of the American economy as it does. \nUnder the President's latest plan, the debt will grow another $1 \ntrillion in the next 5 years. This is not an attempt to reduce the \ndeficit. It is a recognition that unless we change the budget process \nto eliminate Congress' spending bias, it is impossible to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, we now have the opportunity to make a historic change. \nWe can pass the balanced budget amendment and preserve the future for \nour children, our grandchildren, and this country. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the balanced budget amendment so that we and our \nchildren will have a prosperous tomorrow. As we have said, every day \nwhile we talk about the debt, we leave our children and our \ngrandchildren in debt a shocking amount, $829 million each day. This \nmust end and it must end soon.\n  Mr. President, let us stop talking and start acting to bring this \ncountry to fiscal sanity. Let us pass the balanced budget amendment and \nsend it to the States for ratification and get along on this business \nof balancing the budget.\n  In just the 25 days we have been debating this amendment, our \nnational debt has gone up almost $21 billion, and it is going up every \nday right on through February 28. I am hoping there will be a \nliberation day February 28 when this balanced budget amendment passes, \nand it will be the beginning of liberation and freedom, more freedom \nthan ever before because it will mean that Congress will have to get \nspending under control and live within its means over a period of time. \nThis balanced budget amendment will be the mechanism by which we will \nget Congress to do that which it should have been doing all of these \nyears.\n  We have only balanced the budget once in the last 36 years, and I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that this is our time to really strike out and \ndo what is right and liberate Americans from the crushing burden of \nnational debt and these deficits that occur every year.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Minnesota is prepared to go \nahead, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will shortly call up my motion. I, \nfirst of all, just want, in the debate time we have, to respond to some \nof the words of my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. President, as far as liberating the people of this country, we \nhave, roughly speaking, a CBO baseline of $1 trillion plus we have to \ncut to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. Then for reasons that \nescape me, there have been proposals to raise the military budget by \nsome $82 billion over 5 years plus--not cut, increase. Then in \naddition--all of it has to do with, I guess, political popularity--\nthere has been a bidding war on tax cuts. So what we are saying to \npeople is we are going to balance the budget by 2002, but we are going \nto increase the Pentagon budget and, by the way, one of the ways we can \nbalance the budget is by cutting your taxes more.\n  That is pretty amazing. But, by the way, Mr. President, this is a \nfoolproof formula for political success in the very short term. That is \nto say, we can say to people in the country, ``We call on you to \nsacrifice. What we would like for you to sacrifice by way of deficit \nreduction is to let us cut your taxes further.'' It is not surprising \npeople say we would be pleased to make that sacrifice. Of course it \ndoes not work out that way. That adds to the deficit.\n  So when I hear my colleague talk about liberating people, I want to \nbe clear. This is the credibility gap. We have heard on the other side \nof the aisle, roughly speaking, about $277 billion of budget cuts, to \nreach $1.481 trillion worth of cuts. That is a pretty huge credibility \ngap. Over and over again some of us have tried to get everybody to be \nhonest and straightforward about where these cuts are going to take \nplace. For a while at least a good many of us talked about how our \nState legislatures should know what cuts are going to be made. I was on \nthe floor with a resolution that came from my State. The State wanted \nto know how these cuts would impact Minnesota. We talked about: \nLegislatures should know, people in the country should know. But we do \nnot know. We are voting for this balanced budget amendment without our \nown Budget Committee laying out any kind of projections.\n  The reason I mention all this is that people may agree in the \nabstract but not in the specifics. For example, we have no separation \nof capital budget from operating budget. My family does not cash flow \nour mortgage. We do not cash flow the car we buy. Families separate \ncapital budgets from operating budgets. Over 40 legislatures do but we \ndo not.\n  Then in addition we were not willing to specify where the cuts would \ntake place. We were not willing to take Social Security off the table \nin terms of what might be considered deficit reduction. And we are \ngoing to raise the \n[[Page S3004]] Pentagon budget. And we are going to have tax cuts. And \nwe do not want to touch any of the subsidies that go to large oil \ncompanies or all the rest.\n  We will see whether people feel liberated. I guess the way we are \ngoing to get from $277 billion to $1.481 trillion is to cut Federal \nchild care, school lunch programs, and to cut child nutrition programs. \nBy the way, that is not what people in the country are for. There are a \nwhole lot of other choices we can make instead. So I just want to \nremind my colleagues I think it is not so simple as it seems.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I now call up my motion No. 2, which \nhas been previously filed and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone]\n        moves to refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \n     Committee with instructions to report back forthwith House \n     Joint Resolution 1 in status quo and at the earliest date \n     possible, to issue a report, the text of which shall be as \n     follows:\n       ``It is the sense of the Committee that in enacting the \n     policy changes necessary to achieve the more than $1 trillion \n     in deficit reduction necessary to achieve a balanced budget, \n     Congress should take no action which would result in \n     significant reductions in assistance to students who want an \n     opportunity to attend college.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment. This has nothing to do with the vote Tuesday. \nIt is not linked to this constitutional amendment, but it does make it \nclear that the Senate should go on record that we will take no action \nthat will result in significant reductions in assistance to students \nwho want the opportunity to attend college.\n  Just yesterday the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor-HHS \nslashed a student aid grant program, an education program for dropouts \nand homeless people, and the vocational education grant program. Please \nremember all those who signed the Contract With America have signed a \ndocument that says they intend to support cuts in student aid.\n  This motion really comes from my own background as a college teacher. \nSo many of us talk about the importance of doing a good job of \nrepresenting the middle class. My prior amendment dealt with hungry and \nhomeless children. I think they are a very special interest. They do \nnot have a lot of people lobbying for them here. But now I really am \ntalking about the middle class. I would just like to say to my \ncolleagues, there really is nothing more important that we could do to \ndo well for the people we represent, including middle-class people, \nthan to make sure, through good public policy, that higher education is \naffordable.\n  What this amendment says is we go on record we are not going to take \nany action that will result in reductions in assistance to students who \nwant an opportunity to attend college. I do not think that is too much \nto ask.\n  I was a college teacher for 20 years and I had an opportunity \nteaching--I guess you could say 5 generations of students. You know, \nyou count them 4 years at a time. I had an opportunity to see how a \nspark of learning, if ignited, can take a student from any background \nto a life of creativity and accomplishment. The worst thing we could do \nwould be to pour cold water on that spark.\n  We always talk about higher education as key to a successful economy, \nto a literate, high morale, trained work force. That is true. I also \nthink John Dewey, the great educational philosopher, was right that \nhigher education, for that matter K-12 education, is critical to \nrepresentative democracy because we have to have men and women who can \nthink on their own two feet, who have conceptual tools that they can \nuse to understand the world that they live in and who understand the \ncourses of action that are available to them to contribute to our \ncountry and to their communities.\n  But if you talk to families in Idaho or Minnesota or Utah or Wyoming, \nI know that listed among their top three concerns is how are we going \nto be able to send our sons and daughters on to college? I want to be \nvery clear. I spend a lot of time on campuses and all too often I will \nmeet students who sell their plasma at the beginning of the semester to \nbuy a textbook. Let me repeat that. All too often I meet students who \nsell plasma at the beginning of the semester to buy their textbooks. \nAll too often I meet students who are working 40 hours a week while \ngoing to school--that is not uncommon. That is why it takes many \nstudents 6 years to complete their undergraduate work rather than 4 \nyears.\n  I think the nontraditional students have become the traditional \nstudents. Students are no longer out of the ``Brady Bunch.'' They are \nno longer 19 years of age and living in the dorm. I think almost the \nmajority of students are older, they have gone back to school, many of \nthem are single parents, many of them have children. It is terribly \nimportant that we go on record that we will not take any action that \ncould result in significant reduction to assistance to students who \nwant an opportunity to attend college.\n  I do not think that is too much to ask.\n  I remember a gathering at Moorhead State, Moorhead, MN. A student \nsaid to me, in front of everyone, ``You know, my mother and father, \nthey told me that the college years would be the best years of my \nlife.''\n  Then he looked at a really crowded forum. He looked at everybody, and \nhe hesitated, and he said, ``These are not the best years of my life. I \nam working three minimum-wage jobs, 40 hours a week, and trying to go \nto school. These don't feel like the best years of my life.'' This \nwhole question of how we make higher education affordable is key to \nwhat our Nation is all about, which is a nation of opportunity for \nevery person from every background.\n  The total cost of attending a 4-year public institution averages \nabout $7,600 a year. The average cost to go to a 4-year private \ninstitution is around $16,000 a year. Tuition alone has increased more \nthan 120 percent over the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, today I am going to be formally requesting of the \nGeneral Accounting Office that they do a study of the increase in \ntuition costs, the magnitude of it, and the way it affects our young \npeople, or not so young people.\n  At this cost, higher education is out of reach for many middle-class \nfamilies. For the 1993-94 academic year, students borrowed a record \namount, $23 billion, from federally guaranteed loan programs, and the \naverage loan exceeded $2,700 annually. By the way, understand that \nbecause the whole ratio of grants to loans has shifted to the loans, \nstudents graduate in enormous debt when they are getting ready to start \nout their life.\n  I feel very, very lucky. It was just a matter of accident of when I \nwas born that I was able to go to the University of North Carolina. \nAbove and beyond wrestling, and I think I had some academic \nscholarship, I was able to receive a National Defense Act low-interest \nloan because I was going to go into education. I did not graduate \nsaddled with that kind of debt. But that is not the case today.\n  Krista--I will not use her last name--is a sophomore who will be \ngraduating from community college and going to Mankato State University \nto get a B.A. She is 24 years old and married. She writes:\n\n       I do not receive State or Federal grants, nor do I receive \n     any scholarships. In order to pay for my 2 years at a \n     community college, I had to take out over $5,000 in student \n     loans. Last year, I was receiving help through the State \n     Work-Study Program. When that was cut, I suffered again. I \n     realize that part of education is receiving some debt and \n     that it should not be a free ride. But neither should it be a \n     weight tied around my neck. So I ask that whatever decision \n     you make, you consider that many students like myself are \n     choking with this weight.\n\n  Congress should go on record. We will not do anything that will \nresult in significant reductions to students who want an opportunity to \nattend college. Is that too much to ask; that we go on record on this \nbasic question that affects a huge, broad section of the population?\n  As I said earlier, the typical student these days is not the Brady \nBunch kid who graduates from high school and goes straight on to \ncollege: 45 percent of the student bodies these days are over 25 years \nof age; 45 percent of the students are over 25 years old. In fact, \nnearly 20 percent of all students are \n[[Page S3005]] older than 35, and many of them are single parents.\n  Mr. President, many of them are students of color. And by the way, we \nwant to talk about, with welfare reform, single parents being able to \nbe on their own and going to school.\n  It has to be affordable. We cannot be cutting these grant programs \nand low-interest loan programs. But we are going to. You bet we are \ngoing to, because there is no other way we can get to $1.481 trillion \nby 2002. We know it. I hear discussion about we want to take this debt \nburden off the shoulders of the young. What are we doing to the young \nright now?\n  Denise, from a suburb of Minneapolis, writes:\n\n       I am a 29-year-old single parent, currently enrolled as a \n     junior at the University of Minnesota. Because of the \n     excellent support of financial aid and other programs, I have \n     been successfully maintaining a 3.76 GPA.\n\n  That is pretty good. That is out of 4.0.\n\n       Before returning to school, from the time my son was 6 \n     weeks old, I worked as a medical assistant making $9 an hour. \n     Without the needed assistance, the rug would be pulled out \n     from under me. I cannot make it otherwise. Don't cut grant \n     and loan assistance that would deny me my opportunity to \n     pursue my higher education and my dream in life, Senators.\n\n  That is what Denise writes.\n  Sandra, from St. Louis Park, another suburb:\n\n       I am devastated at the idea of any financial aid cuts. Not \n     only would I need to drop out of college--I am a sophomore--\n     but it would leave me with only two options. First, I could \n     obtain an entry-level position; second, I could remain a \n     public assistance recipient for awhile. At any rate, the best \n     I could do for myself and my son in society is to maintain at \n     the below-poverty level.\n       I faced these obstacles after a miserable divorce, which \n     left me without home or money or even credit to plan for the \n     future. I have goals not only for myself, but to be allowed \n     to contribute and replace whatever I have used. By the time I \n     graduate in 1997, I will be financially independent. \n     Likewise, I am setting an example for my son to achieve \n     independence and pride, which are invaluable to our society.\n\n  Sandra is saying to us: Senators, please, when you do your deficit \nreduction, and I want you to, and you go to balance the budget, whether \nthis amendment is passed, please do not make any significant reductions \nin higher education programs that would deny me my opportunity to \nattend college.\n  Our Federal commitment to higher education should be strengthened, \nnot cut. But we are going to cut it. In 1990, about 5 million students \nreceived Federal student aid under one or more Federal programs. In the \n1993-94 academic year, about 3.8 million students received Pell grants, \n4.5 million received Stafford loans, 991,000 received supplementary \neducation opportunity grants, 697,000 received Perkins loans, 713,000 \nreceived Federal work-study awards, and 650,000 received State student \nincentive grants.\n  Most of this financial aid is based upon need. Pell grants are \ntargeted to the neediest students and the campus State programs give \nfinancial aid offices the flexibility to respond to unique student \nneeds. And they are needed. These programs help low-income and middle-\nincome families. Of the Pell grants awarded to dependent students, \nthose who are financially dependent on their parents, 41 percent go to \nstudents with families with incomes less than $12,000 a year and 91 \npercent go to students with families of incomes below $30,000. This is \na critical lifeline program. Among Pell recipients who were financially \nindependent, 73 percent have incomes below $12,000 a year.\n  I could go on and on. Let me just assure you that all the low-\ninterest loans and on campus work-study programs are all targeted \ntoward students that come from low- and moderate-income families.\n  Mr. President, we say that we are for the young and we are for \nopportunity. We cannot give lie to that commitment. We have to be \nwilling to make some investment. I just have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, the most shortsighted thing we could do would be to now cut \nin these very programs.\n  By the way, there is a huge difference in the future of those who go \nto college and those who do not. I could go through the statistics. But \nI do not think I will because I think we all know. If you graduate from \ncollege, you have a much better chance than if you graduate from high \nschool, a much better chance to be able to do well economically for \nyourself and for your family.\n  Mr. President, if there is anything to the American dream--I can say \nthis as a son of a Jewish immigrant from Russia who loved books and \nideas--the biggest thing in our family was that children go on to \nhigher education; they could do better than their parents; they could \nhave a rewarding life.\n  But let us be clear about it. We are going to have to cut $1.4 \ntrillion from the budget. We have to pay the interest on the debt. I \nthink there is a commitment to not touch Social Security, as there \nshould be. We are going to increase the Pentagon budget. We are going \nto do the tax cuts. So where else is there to cut?\n  If you just take what is left on the table, you would have to cut 30 \npercent across the board from domestic discretionary spending. I do not \nknow whether that is going to be Medicare or veterans' benefits. It \nlooks from the House for sure that it is going to be nutrition programs \nand child care programs.\n  I do not know whether it is going to be Pell grants, Stafford loans, \nwhat loan programs, but it is going to happen--30 percent across the \nboard, maybe more in some, maybe less in others.\n  So let us talk a little bit about what this means.\n  Pell grants would be slashed by one-third, from a maximum of $2,230 \nto $1,560. Alternatively, if we did not do that, we could just slash \nthe number of students receiving Pell grants. So some 1.1 million \nstudents would not receive Federal aid at all to attend college.\n  Mr. President, there are proposals to no longer exempt the interest \nthat students accumulate--I believe Chairman Kasich of the House Budget \nCommittee said--while they are at college or university. Find out how \nthe students in Idaho or Minnesota like that. Interest that accumulates \non their loans while in school will no longer be forgiven, and then \nthat gets added on. I think for a typical family that ends up to over \n$3,000 more in interest.\n  Mr. President, the campus-based programs also would include \nsupplementary education opportunity grant programs. And the contract \ntalks about the termination of some of these programs. That is $583 \nmillion. The work study program, that is $616 million; and the Perkins \nLoan Program, that is $176 million. If these programs are cut, that is \na $1.4 billion cut in financial aid.\n  So, Mr. President, let me go back to this motion. Let us be \nstraightforward. Are we going to, in balancing this budget, put into \neffect deep cuts in a Pell Grant Program which right now is hugely \ninadequate in relation to those students that need this grant \nassistance? Are we going to put into effect deep cuts, 30 percent or \nmore, in needs-based, work-study or low-interest loan programs? Is that \nwhat we are going to do?\n  Well, Mr. President, my motion just simply says that we go on record, \na sense of the Senate that we will take no action that would result in \nsignificant reductions in assistance to students who want the \nopportunity to attend college. That is what this motion says.\n  Mr. President, might I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 25 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are other Senators here. I do not \nknow whether they want to speak on this or not. I have more to say on \nthis.\n  I think the Senator from Wyoming wants to respond.\n  Let me just reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate that from my friend \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I have listened with great interest. I yield myself 11 minutes of the \nremaining time of the floor manager and would share with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota that I had not intended to come by, but I was moved by \nhis comments. His remarks were very heartfelt. They were very sincere. \nI have no doubt that he speaks from the heart \n[[Page S3006]] when he expresses these concerns about the Nation's \nchildren, and that has been the subject of the morning's activity.\n  The reason I came here, Mr. President, is that all of us share these \npassions, all of us share these pent-up feelings. And yet those \npassions and feelings led me to almost precisely the opposite \nconclusion reached by my friend from Minnesota.\n  I look at our Nation, I look at our Federal budget, and I see the \ninjustice done to America's children. I see a Federal Government that \nspends 11 times as much per capita on the elderly as we do on the \nchildren. I see a Government unresponsive to the needs of children. We \nsee these poverty rates for children surpassing poverty rates for any \nother group. I am completely in agreement with the Senator from \nMinnesota when he decries the diversion of national resources from the \nchildren.\n  But I will tell you what is happening to children in this country. \nWhat is happening is we have gone from a society that used to channel \nits resources toward the young into one which channels resources away \nfrom them. If you want to know why we do not devote the proper share of \nresources to our children, it is very simple. It is because of \nexploding spending in other parts of the Federal budget is paralyzing \nour ability to make proper choices.\n  Here is a statistic, and I shared it the other day: In the year \n2013--and this scenario was agreed to by 30 of the 32 of us on the \nEntitlements Commission--due to the growth in entitlements, every penny \nof Federal revenue under current law will only be sufficient to fund \nentitlements and interest on the debt.\n  That is not a dry statistic. It means something. It means this \ncountry is depriving itself of the ability to make decisions how to \nprovide for transportation, education, and child nutrition.\n  All of this leads to one issue. What are we going to do with Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement? This is not about \ndefense or spending on highways or education. It is about writing \nchecks from one generation to another.\n  Some powerful statistics have been shared by the Senator from \nMinnesota. May I share just a few of my own. Here is one: The national \ndebt is 48,000 bucks per taxpayer. Assuming 100 million taxpayers, that \nwill soon be 50,000 bucks a taxpayer, with a national debt of $5 \ntrillion.\n  Children now come into life owing that when they are born. That is \nthe burden we place on them. We pay more than $200 billion a year to \nfinance the debt. What could that do for child nutrition, for \nvaccination, for education? It is not there. It is gone. Went out the \nwindow. An interest payment.\n  Also, I do not find the argument compelling that we should simply \ngive up on a balanced budget amendment and continue to add to that \nburden. And we will always give up, because we will come to this floor \nand vote for everything our constituents ask us to bring home. We are \nlike pack horses. They just load us with requests for funding, and we \ncome out here and we load the money home.\n  Here is another statistic for you. The elderly make up 12 percent of \nthe Nation's population. What percent of the Federal entitlement \nspending do they receive? The answer is 60 percent. Not 60 percent to \nthe most needy population group--children--but 60 percent going to this \nother relatively smaller group, the 12 percent of our country who are \nsenior citizens.\n  And here is one for you. If you are a millionaire, a millionaire over \nthe age of 65, these are the various Federal entitlements you can \nreceive. You can get Social Security, Medicare, an extra tax deduction, \nsenior nutrition programs, and other subsidies under the Older \nAmericans Act. That is if you are a millionaire--and those keep coming \nafter you receive your entire lifetime contributions in Social Security \nback, plus interest.\n  We act around here as if there are no consequences to what we do. I \nwish I had not served on the Entitlements Commission, and yet I am very \npleased I did. I admire Senator Kerrey and Senator Danforth so very \nmuch.\n  So the reaction from everybody I talk to is, ``Well, OK, I do have \nsome ideas. Where are they? Why don't we means test part B premiums so \nthat a millionaire pays as much for the benefit as the working class \ntaxpayer?''\n  On, no, we could not do that.\n  What are we going to do when two people are paying in and one person \nis taking out of the Social Security system? How long do you think \npeople are going to stand still for that?\n  So the inevitable result of shoveling so much of our Nation's \nresources in the direction of one politically organized, powerful voter \ngroup--the seniors--is precisely why we are here in this situation.\n  It is a situation where there is nothing left for the children. That \nis precisely why we must stand up to the endless pressure to lavish \nentitlement benefits even on wealthy seniors. I am not talking about \nneedy seniors portrayed as foraging out of garbage cans in alleys, but \nwhether upper income beneficiaries should receive those ever-increasing \nGovernment benefits.\n  I implore the body to free itself from illusions about our Federal \nbudget situation. We cannot hold entitlement benefits for the wealthy \nsacrosanct on one day--when they now make up the majority of the \nbudget--and come on hard the next to decry the lack of help for our \nchildren. That simply does not add up.\n  In the year 2040 what fraction of the national payroll taxes will be \nneeded simply to support two programs, Social Security and Medicare \nunder current law? The answer is 38 to 53 percent before we collect a \npenny of income tax.\n  Anyone truly concerned about the welfare of the children should come \nhere and explain why we should fail to means test Medicare part B, why \nwe should give full Social Security COLA's to millionaires--when COLA's \nwere never part of the original contract. Remember these are the \nprograms sucking it up. So, explain that to our children, why we should \ncontinue to do this to them.\n  When I am joined by Senators who are ready to do this kind of work, I \nwill feel more heartened in the cause. Then I guess there is another \nthing. I heard the letters read, and they are poignant.\n  Let me tell you one from real life. My wife's father worked on the \nrailroad in Greybull, WY. He died when she was 16. Her mother and the \ntwo other children had only their home. So their mother went to \nLaramie, the home of the University of Wyoming, and became a house \nmother at the Kappa Sig house. My wife Ann and her twin sister Nan \nworked their way all the way through college. So did their brother Rob. \nThe sisters worked as waitresses, and they worked as cabin girls at \ndude ranches. She bought all of her own clothes and necessities, worked \nfor everything she obtained, and earned all of her own money, and never \nthought of herself as a victim. It is called going to work to achieve \nsomething you can achieve.\n  Now we have an entire country waiting for the Federal Government to \nmake them whole. And we can all read stories like those shared. It is \nnow a nation of victims. The greatest victims are the children, and the \ngreatest reason for that is because there is not one on the floor who \nwill take on the senior citizens of America who--regardless of their \nnet worth or their income--are pulling the temple down.\n  I have no further remarks at this time. I reserve the remainder of \nthe time for Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Part of the reason I have so much respect for the Senator is because \nof his directness. I must say to my colleague, at the moment I find \nmyself in profound disagreement with his remarks.\n  First of all, given what the Senator from Wyoming has said, he ought \nto support both of these motions. It sounds like we are in agreement on \nat least one part of the equation. I really appreciate the fact that he \nhas come out here and said that there is a huge disconnect between our \nrhetoric and the speeches we give and our support of young people.\n  I think the Senator from Wyoming has been clear about that. In a \nsense I think he would be supportive especially of the first motion--\nthat is No. 1--which makes it clear when we sort out these priorities \nand make the tough decisions, the most vulnerable citizens are the \nhomeless and hungry children. There is nothing the Senator from Wyoming \nsaid that would prevent him \n[[Page S3007]] from supporting that motion. Everything he said, I \nthink, would make him want to support that.\n  Second of all, my own view about these deficits and this debt that we \nhave built up, is that I at least can say that when we went back to the \nearly 1980's and decided that we would go forward with what President \nBush once called voodoo economics, what was called euphemistically, the \nEconomic Recovery Act, huge tax cuts for the wealthiest, dramatic \nincreases in the Pentagon budget. And remember, all of that was going \nto lead to productivity and jobs--this was the Laffer curve--and it \nwould reduce deficits.\n  It did not work out that way, did it? We really got ourselves into a \nmess. I was not here during that time. We have to work ourselves out of \nthat mess. I must say I think the 2002, I think that the direction we \nare going in right now does not add up.\n  Now, Mr. President, getting back to the issue here. I appreciate my \ncolleague's concern about children because before I was told that I was \nout here for the special interests. I think children are a very special \ninterest. I disagree that our only choice is between older people, \nelderly citizens and the children.\n  My colleague said this way, now we get to the stereotype of the \ngreedy geezers that are out there in the golf courses living high on \nthe hog.\n  Mr. President, I believe--and it is off the top of my head--that the \naverage income of a man 65 years of age and over is $15,000 a year. For \na woman, it is $8,000 a year. Now, Mr. President, that is hardly the \nprofile of these older people, that they are the problem.\n  I was at a gathering in Rosedale, Fairview Senior Center, the other \nday. I think it was a very interesting gathering. I asked the people \nthere--and of every gathering of senior citizens--what are the top \nthree issues you care about. They always put children at the top. We \nare talking about the children and the grandchildren of the elderly in \nthis country.\n  It is not true that the elderly are so wealthy and have such high \nincomes. I would say to my colleague here that if we want to talk about \nwhy there should be a subsidy on part B Medicare for older people \nmaking incomes of $100,000 a year and over, I agree. The problem is \nthere are not very many older people that make $100,000 a year and \nover. It just is not true.\n  Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota said the test of a society and \na government is the way we treat people in the dawn of life, children; \nthe way we treat people in the twilight of their lives, the elderly; \nand the way we treat people in the shadow of their lives, those \nstruggling with an illness or a disability and those who are needy or \npoor. I believe that.\n  The choices are not between our going on record that we will not do \nanything that will increase hunger or homelessness among children, or \ngoing on record to do anything that would cut programs that enable \npeople to be able to go on and afford higher education, versus we have \nto cut benefits for the elderly across the board.\n  Mr. President, there are other options. We did not need to get into \nthis bidding war on tax cuts. But we have. And the projections on \nthat--and again I am speaking off the top of my head--I believe it was \n$500 billion, up to 2002 and then another $700 billion beyond. Going in \nthe opposite direction of deficit reduction.\n  I would say to my colleagues, if you are so concerned about deficit \nreduction, why are you talking about these broad-based tax cuts? Mr. \nPresident, there are other choices. It is not children versus the \nelderly. I do not accept this tradeoff. I do not believe a rigorous \nanalysis supports this tradeoff. We do not have to be increasing the \nPentagon budget. We could be cutting it.\n  I cosponsored a bill with Senators Bumpers and Bradley that dealt \nwith about $30 billion in military cuts over 5 years based on some GAO \nstudies of some wasteful weaponry. Weapons and programs that make no \nsense. But the military contractors are not being asked to tighten \ntheir belts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just say two other things. First, \nSenator Feingold and I have examined a book from the Joint Tax \nCommittee, I say to the Senator from South Carolina, it must have been \nthis thick on tax expenditures, some of which go back before 1950, some \nof which are necessary, but many of which are just outright tax dodges \nfor corporations in America, and the U.S. Senate would not vote for a \nmotion that said we should at least consider some of these subsidies.\n  And, second, even though we do not need to get into the debate today \nabout single payer, which the General Accounting Office and \nCongressional Budget Office said would save over $100 billion in \nexpenses every year with universal coverage, I must remind my \ncolleagues that the big entitlement programs that are skyrocketing are \nhealth care programs, but the insurance companies did not like that. I \nintroduced a bill that dealt with the Medicare entitlement program, but \nrather than cut it, it was a way of really being able to afford these \nprograms.\n  So let us not have some false choice in dichotomy out here on the \nfloor that a Senator from Minnesota can only come out here fighting for \nchildren and fighting for affordable higher education if that Senator \nfrom Minnesota is willing to say, ``We've got to have deep, drastic \ncuts in programs that support elderly citizens in this Nation.''\n  No. 1, it is not true that they have such high income and wealth, and \nthey are all greedy geezers out on the golf course. That is a cultural \nstereotype and, two, those are not the only choices. I just outlined \nfour other options, none of which are being considered.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me make one other point and then I \nwill yield the floor to the Senator from Montana, reserving, after \nthat, the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, let me one more time focus attention on these two \nmotions. The first motion is a motion to refer to the Budget Committee \na sense of the Senate that when we do deficit reduction and balance the \nbudget that we are not going to do anything to increase the number of \nhomeless and hungry children. This is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget at all. It does not say \nthe vote on the amendment is put off. It is separate. It just says when \nwe do the deficit reduction and move forward to balancing the budget--\nall of us are in favor of doing that; not all are in favor of this \nconstitutional amendment --that we go on record that we are not going \nto do anything to increase hunger and homelessness. I say to my friend \nfrom South Carolina, part of reason I do this are these headlines: \n``House Panel Moves to Cut Child School Lunch Program,'' ``House Panel \nTrims Nutrition Programs and Housing Programs,'' the WIC Program.\n  The second motion is very similar. It is not an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is just a sense of \nthe Senate that we go on record ``that we take no action that would \nresult in significant reductions in assistance to students who want an \nopportunity to attend college.''\n  My colleague from Wyoming talked about how he heard me read some \nletters from students in Minnesota and he thought too many students \nwere viewing themselves as victims. I do not think that is what the \nstudents are saying.\n  The alarm clock has gone off, students and young people in the \ncountry; it is time to get engaged because you need to understand there \nare going to be deep cuts on the present course in Pell grants and low-\ninterest loans, not in a lot of other areas that I mentioned. The only \nway you are going to be able to do something about it is to get \ninvolved in politics.\n  We need to have an education day all across this Nation, within the \nnext month, where all congressional delegations are called back home--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike--and meet with younger people, college \nstudents, high school students, teachers, parents in which we need to \ngo on record as to whether or not we are or are not going to support \naffordable higher education.\n  They are not feeling like victims, I say to my colleague from \nWyoming, Mr. President. That was not the point of those letters. What \nthose letters were saying is, we want you to do a good job of \nrepresenting us, and we believe that one of the most important \n[[Page S3008]] issues for us--and I hear it from the parents as well--\nis to make sure higher education is affordable. Of course, we are \nwilling to contribute; of course, we do, but we feel like that is some \nthing that is a part of what this country is about: Affordable \neducation. That is all that meant. That is all this motion is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Montana, after \nwhich I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if I can have 6 minutes of the \ntime of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for the purpose of introduction of a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 465 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair, and I deeply thank my good friend from \nMinnesota for so graciously yielding the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Montana for his fine work.\n  Mr. President, I wonder whether or not the Senator from Utah might \nwant to respond. We will wait for just a moment.\n  I do not think, Mr. President, there is any reason to repeat \narguments, but I wish to wait for my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again, I understand what my colleague is \ntrying to do, but I just have to say, well, here we go again, another \nexemption. We have already seen various proposals to exempt veterans, \nSocial Security, homeless children, capital expenditures, and here is \nanother one, college tuition. When will it end? I suppose next Tuesday \nit will end.\n  Mr. President, these are all very important groups. I feel very \ndeeply about all of them collectively myself. But all these proposed \nexemptions demonstrate exactly what the problem is. We cannot reduce \nthe deficit because there is no incentive to do it. Every time we try, \nsomebody brings up another exemption that they want to take care of or \nanother special interest group, all of which have merit, all of which \nhave meaning. But that is why we need a balanced budget amendment--free \nfrom special interest exemptions and loopholes--to get this country's \nfiscal house in order.\n  The balanced budget amendment that we propose here is a bipartisan \nconsensus, Democrat-Republican amendment that we have worked on for \ndecades. We have brought a vast majority of people in both Houses \ntogether on it. For the first time in history, the House of \nRepresentatives has passed it by the requisite two-thirds vote. It has \nnot been easy. Everybody knows that. But what it does is it sets rules \nwithin which we will have to set priorities.\n  This debate about priorities, it seems to me, should wait until after \nthe balanced budget amendment passes. Then we will get serious about \nthe priorities that have to be made. No one wants to harm anyone who \nrelies on governmental assistance--nobody, least of all this Senator. \nNone of us does. But we must make choices among priorities, and we must \nmake these choices among priorities within the constraints of our \nresources. We no longer can afford to just throw money at everything. \nPriorities are going to change from year to year. So every year after \nwe pass this amendment, every year we will debate priorities. Some are \ngoing to fare very well, as you know--in fact, most all of them will. \nBut the fact of the matter is we will have to debate them, and we will \nhave to set fiscal constraints for the first time since I have been \nhere, and to me that is pretty important. I think it is to anybody who \nlooks at it.\n  However, that debate will only come after we pass this balanced \nbudget amendment. It is the only way. I think almost everybody knows \nthat here.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator, for whom I have great feeling as a \nperson, as a compassionate individual, is arguing for some pretty good \ninterest groups here. He is arguing for some good exemptions. On the \nother hand, no exemption is good if it takes away from somebody else, \nif it makes it more difficult to help others who may be just as needy, \nif not more so.\n  The best way to handle this is with a balanced budget amendment that \nsets a mechanism in place, that shows us how to do it and has a rule to \nit and reason to it that makes us make priority choices. It is the fair \nway to do it. It is the only way to do it, and that is what this \nbalanced budget amendment does. So I hope our colleagues will vote for \nthe balanced budget amendment next Tuesday. I do hope we will vote down \nthese two motions to defer because I think they just point out more \nthan anything else, or at least as much as the other amendments why we \nneed a balanced budget amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I might respond, I must say that the Senator's last \nremark makes me extremely nervous, when he states these motions--again, \nthese are not amendments to the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--these motions really make the case for why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  The Senator said a little earlier that no one wants to hurt the most \nvulnerable citizens, so I do not know why a motion that we go on record \nas we move to balancing the budget we are not going to do anything to \nincrease hunger or homelessness among children makes the case for a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  My colleague from Utah keeps talking about these exemptions, and I \njust would say to my colleague, if the proponents of this amendment \nwould have provided some detailed analysis as to where we are going to \nmake the cuts, then I would not have to be in the Chamber saying let us \nat least go on record we are not going to do this to children or we are \ngoing to make sure that higher education is not affordable, let us make \nsure of that. If there was a detailed analysis, there would be no \nreason for any of us to come out to the floor to make these motions.\n  There is no detailed analysis. We have tried over and over again to \nget Senators to step up to the plate. They have been unwilling to do \nso. The credibility gap is huge--so far I have heard $277 billion of \nbudget cuts outlined by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nThat takes us a little bit toward $1.481 trillion, not very far.\n  Mr. President, I have to say one more time the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey] said it well. We can go forward every single year with \nmore deficit reduction. I voted for I think the largest deficit \nreduction we have had probably in the last decade and a half. I stepped \nup to the plate and we can do much more on deficit reduction and we can \nbalance the budget. I do not know that it can be done in 2002. I think \nthat is an unrealistic date. I think it is a political date. But we \nabsolutely have to do it.\n  Mr. President, you do not need to have a balanced budget amendment in \nthe constitution, locking us into all these cuts without telling \nanybody in the country what we are going to do in order for us to step \nup to the plate every single year and do the necessary deficit \nreduction.\n  I might add, there is another deficit.\n   There is an investment deficit, especially in education and children \nand young people. We can do that now.\n\n  Finally, I do not understand this discussion about special interests. \nMy view is that, yes, children and young people are very special \ninterests. But, I say to my colleague, it simply is not the case--I \nhope he is not arguing: Look, the reason we cannot vote for these \nmotions is we know we are going to make cuts in this area because we \nhave to make cuts in this area if we are going to balance the budget.\n  That is not true. We do not have to make cuts in these areas if we \nare going to balance the budget. Mr. President, $420 billion of tax \nexpenditures--we do not have to raise the Pentagon budget, we do not \nhave to do all the tax \n[[Page S3009]] cuts. There are lots of other ways to balance the budget \nas opposed to focusing on the young, focusing on education, or focusing \non the most vulnerable citizens.\n  My final point. The reason I have been so insistent today on the \nfloor of the Senate about these motions--and I am going to wear my \npolitical science hat for a moment; I am a political scientist--is my \nsad but true judgment that all too often the actual deficit reduction \nand cuts are made based upon the path of least political resistance. \nThose citizens who do not have a lobbyist, do not make the large \ncontributions, are not the heavy hitters, are not the big players, are \nthe very citizens who are asked to tighten their belts. The very \ncitizens we ask to tighten their belts are the very citizens that \ncannot.\n  I have been out here saying we ought to consider cutting subsidies \nfor oil companies, subsidies for pharmaceutical companies, all sorts of \nother subsidies for large corporations and financial institutions and \nthe silence on the other side of the aisle has been deafening. It has \nbeen voted down.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator makes a good point, but it is a good \npoint for the balanced budget amendment, that if there are subsidies to \nlarge corporate America and other entities that he disagrees with, we \nwill have to look at those. That is why I think, to be honest with you, \nwe need the balanced budget amendment.\n  Is my colleague prepared to yield back his remaining time? I am, too.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have about 15 seconds left.\n  Let me be clear. Neither of these motions say anything about voting \nfor or against the balanced budget amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me on the question if the choices we have to make are we are \nnot going to take any action which would increase the number of hungry \nor homeless children and we are not going to make higher education not \naffordable for young people who want to go on to colleges and \nuniversities. That is all it says. It is a sense of the Senate. We \nought to be able to vote for that right now, advocates for the balanced \nbudget amendment and those who are opposed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time if I have any time to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and I move \nto table the amendment and will ask for the yeas and nays with the \nunderstanding that the vote will be at another time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me acknowledge my respect and \nfriendship for the distinguished Senator from Utah. He has worked hard \non this issue, but I rise today to speak out against the particular \nlanguage in section 7 of the amendment that includes Social Security \nrevenues in its definition of receipts.\n  I have supported and would continue to support a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution if we did not have to breach the contract \nof 1935 with respect to Social Security.\n  Taking Social Security out of deficit calculations is not just \nanother attempt to carve out exemptions. There are no special taxes for \neducation. There is no special tax for women, infants and children \nfeeding. There are no special taxes for law enforcement. However, the \nSocial Security tax is exclusively levied for the benefit of future \nrecipients.\n  So the matter of excluding Social Security funds from deficit \ncalculations should not be confused or distorted. In 1983 we received \nthe Greenspan Commission report and increased FICA taxes on middle \nAmerica. If we had come at that time and said: These taxes will be used \nto pay for defense or welfare or foreign aid, that legislation would \nhave been killed immediately. If you said these taxes were going to be \nused for the deficit, people would have said: ``Wait a minute. We are \ntalking about the Social Security deficit. We are not talking about the \noverall Government deficit.''\n  Mr. President, I voted three times for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution and have worked as hard as anyone to get the bills \npaid. It has not always been easy, but I am quite willing to stand on \nmy record. In the 104th Congress, the very first bill passed was \ndesigned to put the Government under the same rules and regulations \nthat the average citizen has to abide by.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, many of the laws that we enact here in \nWashington require Americans to tell the truth. As part of the statutes \nof the United States, we have the Truth in Fabrics Act, the Truth in \nFurs Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Lending Simplification \nand Reform Act, the Truth in Mileage Act of 1986, the Truth in \nNegotiations Act for Military Procurement, the Truth in Savings Act, \nthe Truth in Securities Act, and others as well. But, much to my \nchagrin, the fact of the matter is that we do not have a Truth in \nBudgeting Act.\n  Like Fred Astaire, we tap dance all around a particular issue with \nfancy dance steps until we are left like an octopus that is cornered--\nwith nothing left to do but to squirt out the dark ink of confusion and \nescape to the next election.\n  I graduated from truth in budgeting and I know the issue. As a young \nGovernor elected back in 1958. I was only 36 years of age, and we were \nthe second lowest per-capita income State. I realized at that \nparticular time that no one was going to invest in Podunk. To attract \ninvestment and create jobs, we had not only to pay our bills but we had \nto guarantee they would stay paid. To do it, we raised taxes. I could \nhear all of the arguments bandied about: It falls on the middle class; \nit is the regressive; we have a poor State, and shouldn't be raising \ntaxes.\n  But I was not granted the luxury of choice. I had to raise taxes and \nsuffer the consequences. That in part led to my defeat in 1962 when I \nran for the Senate. But in public life, I think you ought to lose a \ngood election like that. It is the most instructive lesson you can \nlearn. I remember that election better than the six times since that I \nhave been elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  But as Governor of South Carolina, I had a little provision that \nintrigued the folks at Standard & Poors and Moody's. We had put in a \nrule that required the comptroller to issue a certificate to the \nGovernor for each quarter that the expenditures were within the \nrevenues. If the books were not in balance, the Governor was required \nby law to cut spending straight across the board. The bond agencies \nsaid, ``We had not heard of that.'' They called me a few weeks later \nand said that South Carolina would qualify for a AAA credit rating.\n  While some may think that a constitutional amendment is an iron-clad \nguarantee, I know from hard experience that such is not the case. We \nhave an amendment to the South Carolina Constitution that was enacted \nin 1895 that says, in effect, ``The budget shall be balanced.'' It was \na constitutional provision quite similar to what we are debating, but \nit was honored more by violation than by conformance.\n  Specifically, with respect to truth in budgeting, there is an old \nlegal maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity. He who comes in \nthe court of equity must come with clean hands. I have asked my \ncolleagues to show me their plan to balance the budget. But in seeking \nthis equity, I have also done equity. I have put in my own so-called \nbudget, which I proposed in January. I have put it in the Record \nseveral times and would now ask unanimous consent that it again printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       [[Page S3010]] Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on \n     the budget on Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 95 (using trust funds).             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

Total...............................................  36.942  58.407\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, the 49er's did not go to the Super Bowl in Miami last \nmonth, take their seats in the grandstand there in the Joe Robbie \nStadium, and start shouting, ``We want a touchdown, we want a \ntouchdown.'' They got down on the field and they scored the touchdown.\n  Similarly, we are the Government, and now it is our duty, our \nresponsibility to act.\n  When we tried to move the ball downfield 2 years ago with the largest \ndeficit reduction package in our history, we could not get a single \nvote on the other side of the aisle in the House and in the Senate.\n  Likewise, when those on the other side of the aisle start to \ncriticize the President by saying--``Where's his courage? He's waving \nthe white flag,'' it is truly the pot calling the kettle black.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is high time we had some truth in \nbudgeting.\n  Look at the record that I have made here of some 110 proposed \nspending cuts, eliminations, or retrenchments of different programs. \nYou will see the savings that it gives in 1996 and 1997.\n  I struggled, taking some of the CBO cuts, the Concord Coalition cuts, \nthe Kasich spending cuts and others. And you will see there are 110 of \nthem here, amounting only to $37 billion in the first year and $58 \nbillion in the second year. This 2-year projection is important because \nit underscores the fact that the Congress will have to have further \ncuts next year and each year thereafter to stay on the glide path. \nThus, the reality is that you are not going to balance the budget from \nspending cuts and growth alone.\n  Aversion to higher taxes is usually a necessary, healthy impulse in a \npolitical democracy. But when the alternative becomes self-evidently \nthreadbare and groundless, as has the growth argument, we are no longer \ndealing with legitimate skepticism, but with what amounts to, in the \nwords of David Stockman, ``a demagogic fetish.''\n  We will have to do the best we can on spending cuts. We will have to \nfreeze spending. That is what President Clinton had in his budget along \nwith spending cuts of $144 billion.\n  We will have to close tax loopholes and prevent the transitional rule \ncrowd from putting in $200 million for airlines out in St. Louis. That \nprovision was part of GATT but had nothing to do with international \ntrade. We have to curb such practices and tell the American people the \ntruth.\n  I once took a lie detector test, but the after first question--I \nflunked. They asked a question, and I started my answer, ``Well, in my \nhumble opinion,'' and the needle just went right off the chart. \nLuckily, the fellow gave me a second chance and after 2 hours I passed.\n  Well, here we go with the truth. We have to have taxes. This \npredicament did not develop overnight. President Bush was a good man \nbut he was misled on the critical need to bring the deficit under \ncontrol. I made my own efforts appearing before the Finance Committee \nand introducing a value-added tax for the deficit and debt.\n  Today, with a 5-percent value-added consumption tax and $1.2 trillion \nin spending cuts over 7 years, we can put Government back into the \nblack by the year 1999 and start paying off our $4.8 trillion debt. You \ndo not have to wait for the year 2002.\n  I have just been informed that the proponents of the constitutional \n[[Page S3011]] amendment have the votes. Assuming that to be true, \npeople tell me, why don't you go along now and save your record? Mr. \nPresident, I want to save my record. That is why I am talking. We have \na record of a contract started in 1935. We have a record of a trust. I \nwant to save that record.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not believe they have the votes yet. \nThey may have them in the final analysis but I do not believe they have \nthem yet.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will try to move along so the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia can be heard here.\n  Mr. President, we need truth in budgeting. We should tell the \nAmerican people that the big lie in the land is the slogan ``I'm \nagainst taxes'' because the simple fact is that we are raising taxes $1 \nbillion a day through interest payments on the gross Federal debt.\n  When the Simon amendment came up in 1993, I was not an original \ncosponsor, but I had supported the amendment in 1986. I voted for the \nSimon amendment believing at the time that the Hollings amendment \npassed in 1990 which took the Social Security trust fund off-budget \nexcluded these funds from deficit calculations. When my amendment \npassed the Senate by a vote of 98 to 2, I believed, as similarly \nasserted by the distinguished majority whip, Senator Lott, that: \n``Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, moderate, is \neven thinking about using Social Security to balance the budget.''\n  But Mr. President, unbeknownst to me, just 13 days before the vote, \nSenator Gramm of Texas, who has been a leader on budget matters, \nintroduced a bill to balance the budget. Later on in the year, I had my \nstaff scrutinize it; they found this particular provision which I wish \nthe Senator from Utah would listen to this:\n\n       Exclusion from budget, section 13-301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990 is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following: ``This subsection shall apply to \n     fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2001.''\n\n  I found this provision particularly interesting because back on July \n10, 1990, Senator Gramm had been the lone dissenting vote when I \nintroduced the Hollings amendment to take Social Security off-budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this particular time that rollcall vote in \nthe Budget Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  1990 Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay:\n       Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     and Mr. Bond.\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Having voted against my amendment in the Budget \nCommittee, having proposed to amend section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act, I said, ``Heavens above, I better start checking this \nthing.'' I soon recognized that the Constitution preempts statutory \nlaw, and that the amendment to take the Social Security Trust fund off-\nbudget would be constitutionally repealed by the language of this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  John Mitchell, the famous Attorney General of the United States under \nPresident Nixon, said, ``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' And what \ndo they do? When I argue about these things, I go right to the author \nof that particular Simon balanced budget amendment. I refer to the \nMonday, February 20, roll call, by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois and I quote:\n\n       One paradox is that some Democrats during the Senate debate \n     that is now underway are offering amendments that would \n     imperil both the balanced budget amendment and Social \n     Security by taking Social Security off the budget. These \n     waivers are being offered in the name of protecting--\n\n  That is a true statement, they are offered to protect Social \nSecurity.\n\n       * * * Sponsors of these amendments have an argument that is \n     superficially popular.\n  We are not trying to make it popular; we are trying to make it law.\n       Opening a Social Security loophole in the balanced budget \n     amendment also invites abuse by future Congresses undermining \n     confidence in the integrity of Social Security.\n\n  Now, my dear colleagues, who is opening a Social Security loophole? \nIt is open right now. It is right there. What section 7 does is create \nthe loophole. Whoever votes for this language is opening the loophole. \n``Invites abuse by future Congresses.'' Mr. President, I am not talking \nabout future Congresses. I am talking about this present Congress that \nis willing to abuse the Social Security trust now. I have told them \ntime and time again, you have Hollings' vote if you put in the Social \nSecurity trust fund exemption.\n  That is clear as a bell. They know it. But they think they have the \nvotes. My distinguished colleague from West Virginia thinks otherwise. \nI hope he is right.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici of \nNew Mexico, and the former Senator of New Hampshire, Warren Rudman, of \nthe Concord Coalition, are both on the Strengthening of America \nCommission and have put out a proposal to balance the budget. Remember \nJohn Mitchell. ``Watch what they do, not what they say.'' Here is what \nthey say in their plan. I quote:\n\n       The goal of the plan is to balance the unified budget \n     without using the Social Security surplus by the year 2002. \n     America would then be saving its Social Security surplus, \n     helping to avoid a fiscal train wreck 25 years from now when \n     the general fund must begin repaying the Social Security \n     trust fund. Continuing to divert Social Security surplus to \n     fund current spending instead of building up reserves for the \n     future is bad fiscal policy and bad social policy.\n\n  Mr. President, when the same gentleman took to the floor here last \nweek and, he instead talked about including supplementary security \nincome under the rubric of Social Security. He noted that under the \nlaw, SSI is administered by the Social Security group. True. However, \nhe further claimed future Congresses might include SSI outlays as part \nof the Social Security trust fund.\n  Now, we live in the real world. Any Senator who is fool enough to try \nand finance welfare with Social Security trust funds would make a quick \nexit from the political scene. They will not need a term limitation \nbill to be passed. He would be run off the floor of the Senate or House \nof Representatives. I do not believe he could get a single cosponsor or \nSenator to support him. But even if he did, he would have to get 60 of \nthem because a 60-vote point of order would lie against such a change.\n  I read here where the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire--and I \nread here from a release. It is reported about their particular news \nconference last week, talking about Senator Tsongas, former Senator \nTsongas, and former Senator Rudman, and I am just reading the report. I \nwill give you the quote.\n\n       Both former Senators emphasized the need for Social \n     Security to remain on the table in the budget cutting \n     process.\n\n  Now, that is the report. And here is the quote from Senator Rudman.\n\n       ``To try to fool the American people by setting Social \n     Security aside is delaying the inevitable,'' said Rudman, who \n     added that protecting entitlement spending from cuts would \n     result in the need for ``unworkable'' cuts in the nondefense \n     discretionary spending and aid to state and local \n     governments.\n\n  Here again they raise the straw man. We are not talking about fooling \nanybody about the inevitable. We are talking about the fraud that is \nbeing exacted on the people of America, and particularly people paying \ninto Social Security this minute. The young woman who is paying in now, \nher money will be spent under Section 7. Then when she gets eligible in \nthe year 2020, 2025, they will have to tax her a second time.\n  I quoted earlier from Senator Rudman. Let me now quote from the other \nco-founder of the Concord Coalition, Paul Tsongas, who was even \nharsher. And I quote:\n\n       ``Those who vote to exempt Social Security are voting to \n     kill the balanced budget amendment,'' said Tsongas, co-\n     founder of the Concord Coalition and anti-deficit Group. \n     ``They are putting their own reelection ahead of the future \n     of their children and grandchildren.''\n\n  [[Page S3012]] Who is putting their future ahead of the children and \ngrandchildren? Anybody who votes for section 7 of the present balanced \nbudget amendment joint resolution proposal, that's who. they are the \nones, ``putting their own reelection ahead of the future of their \nchildren and grandchildren.''\n   I have worked in the vineyards for a long time trying to restore the \ndiscipline of a balanced budget in the U.S. Government. I obtained it \nat the State level. I voted for it in 1968-69 when we called over to \nMarvin Watson and we cut $5 billion more. Do you know the entire budget \nin 1968-69, for the Great Society, for the war in Vietnam, was $178 \nbillion? Now we are up to $1.6 trillion. But we gave Richard Milhous \nNixon not only a balanced budget but a $3.2 billion surplus.\n  I got together with Senator Harry Byrd in 1978. We put into law the \nByrd amendment which was later amended by the Reagan crowd. We took \nSocial Security off-budget under President Bush, and now they are \nasking me to repeal that law by voting for section 7 of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  No way. The Social Security surplus is now almost $500 billion. By \nthe year 2002 we are supposed to have a $1 trillion surplus. But \ninstead, we keep spending it for foreign aid, for welfare, for all \nthese other things that you can possibly think of in the budget except \nSocial Security.\n  Here is Robert M. Ball. I ask unanimous consent that this entire \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Robert M. Ball,\n                                  Alexandria, VA, January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Last month the Entitlement \n     Commission, appointed jointly by the President and the \n     Congress, held its final meeting without coming to agreement, \n     but with many Commissioners issuing statements of their \n     individual views. I have been and remain greatly concerned \n     about the misinformation about Social Security that has \n     accompanied discussion of this last meeting and which \n     persistently accompanies so many discussions of Social \n     Security financing. Since most of my career has been devoted \n     to Social Security policy and administration, I feel \n     obligated to do what I can to set the record straight.\n       First, a word about my experience. I was U.S. Commissioner \n     of Social Security under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and \n     Nixon, and after leaving government I have continued to give \n     advice on Social Security to both the Congress and the \n     Executive Branch. I was a member of the statutory Advisory \n     Councils in 1979 and 1991 and am a member of the current \n     Advisory Council that is now studying the program and that \n     will report its findings and recommendations later this year. \n     I was also a member of the small negotiating group from the \n     Greenspan Commission which worked out the agreement with the \n     White House that led to the 1983 Amendments.\n       The Entitlement Commission looked at many programs in \n     addition to Social Security, and frequently in its \n     presentations lumped everything together, but it also, \n     correctly, made separate proposals and separate cost \n     estimates for Social Security. There was a consensus that \n     Social Security was adequately financed for a long time, but \n     not for the full 75 years for which the estimates are \n     traditionally made. What the Commission did not say, however, \n     is equally important.\n       The Commission did not find that Social Security benefits \n     would have to be drastically cut or contribution rates \n     greatly increased to bring the program into long-run balance. \n     True, some Commission members talked this way, one referring \n     to Social Security as ``unsustainable,'' and\n      the plan proposed by Chairman Kerrey and Vice-Chairman \n     Danforth would, over time, have resulted in benefit cuts \n     of over 40 percent for workers earning the average wage \n     (partly offset by a compulsory government saving plan, \n     also included in their recommendation). Such drastic cuts \n     were necessary in their plan because they nearly doubled \n     Social Security's estimated shortfall by cutting the \n     employee contribution, and then, in addition, greatly \n     over-financed the program, using the surplus to show a \n     smaller deficit in the rest of the budget.\n       But at the same time that Senators Kerrey and Danforth \n     submitted their preferred plan, they demonstrated that Social \n     Security could be brought into long-range balance with much \n     more moderate changes. The alternative they presented to the \n     Commission avoided any contribution increases and brought the \n     program into balance entirely by benefit cuts. Over the long \n     run, cuts for the average worker would have reached 15 \n     percent. Had they depended partly on contribution rate \n     increases (which would not have been necessary until some 25 \n     years from now), the benefit reductions, of course, could \n     have been cut in half, or reduced even more.\n       Four points about Social Security financing are critical \n     for an informed debate about Social Security's future:\n       First, Social Security is adequately financed for the next \n     20 to 25 years and consequently, as has been indicated by the \n     President and the Congressional leadership, no changes in \n     Social Security are needed for the next few years. However, \n     it would be desirable soon thereafter to balance estimated \n     income and outgo over the whole 75 years for which the \n     estimates are made.\n       The Trustees of the Social Security funds estimate that the \n     funding provided under present law will produce a continued \n     build-up in the Social Security Trust Funds until about 2020 \n     when the official estimates start to show a decline in the \n     funds and later on a shortfall. Although there is plenty of \n     time to await studied consideration of the best course of \n     action (including the recommendations to be made by the \n     current Advisory Council), it would bolster public confidence \n     in the program to put in the law soon changes to be effective \n     later that would eliminate the estimated long-run deficit.\n       Second, there are many ways of bringing Social Security \n     into long-range balance within the principles of the program \n     and avoiding most of the 15 percent benefit cut in the \n     Commission Chairman's ``modest'' alternative.\n       One way to produce balance, at least theoretically, would \n     be to: (a) accept the Commission staff's estimate of the \n     saving to Social Security of an expected Labor Department \n     correction of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (This alone \n     reduces the long range deficit by a third); (b) credit Social \n     Security with the proceeds of the 1993 tax increase on Social \n     Security benefits, just as the earlier taxing provisions \n     credited the proceeds to Social Security. (Adding this saving \n     to the CPI correction cuts the deficit in half.) In the 1993 \n     change, the proceeds\n      went to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund because the Budget \n     rules would have required 60 votes in the Senate to \n     increase income for Social Security; and, (c) schedule a \n     contribution rate increase in 2020 of one percent of \n     covered earnings each for employers and employees. (This \n     change would eliminate the other half of the deficit.) \n     Such a rate increase is not trivial, but is easily \n     supportable--offsetting only about 9 percent of the growth \n     in earnings projection between now and then.\n       Because the effect of the change in the CPI is uncertain, \n     and the saving in the staff estimate so large, I have \n     attached an illustration showing another way the program \n     could be brought into long-range balance with modest changes \n     and without relying on savings from the CPI revision. Of \n     course, there are many ways of combining more benefit cuts \n     with lower contribution rate increases than in the \n     illustration, including raising the first age at which full \n     retirement benefits are paid from the presently scheduled 67 \n     to, say, 68. The point here is simply that the alarmist \n     rhetoric used by some Entitlement Commission members about \n     the need for major cutbacks in Social Security is completely \n     unjustified.\n       Third, the estimates of long-range Social Security costs \n     and of the proposals for change take full account of the \n     retirement of the baby boomers.\n       It is now commonplace among journalists to assume that the \n     decline in the number of contributors per beneficiary, which \n     begins about 2010, will cause enormous problems for Social \n     Security as future workers face an ``impossibly large burden \n     of support for retirees.'' But this new rate does not come as \n     a surprise, and its effect has been included in the Trustees' \n     Social Security cost estimates and in the estimates for the \n     Social Security changes discussed here.\n       Stepping back from considering Social Security financing \n     alone, and looking instead at the basic economic question of \n     the burden of support of dependents, we find no problem at \n     all. In estimating the ability of a workforce to support \n     dependents, what counts is the ratio of all non-workers, old \n     and young, to the active workers producing the goods and \n     services on which all must depend. As the following numbers \n     indicate, the total dependency burden will never be as high \n     as it was in 1965 when the baby boomers were children.\nDependents--both those 65 and over and those under 20--per 1,000 active \n                                workers\n\nYear:\n  1965..............................................................946\n  1990..............................................................700\n  2010..............................................................652\n  2040..............................................................791\n  2070..............................................................828\n         \n       As economist Frank Ackerman has observed, ``If we could \n     afford to live through the childhood of the baby-boom \n     generation, we can afford to live through their retirement.''\n       (4) The widespread belief that Social Security is \n     contributing to the current budget deficit and has caused \n     part of the rise in the national debt is just wrong.\n       Since 1937, when Social Security first collected earmarked \n     contributions from employers and employees, $4.3 trillion has \n     been paid in and $3.9 trillion has been paid out, including \n     administrative expenses (now running at one cent for each \n     dollar of benefits). This leaves a balance of about $400 \n     billion, just about right today for a contingency reserve.\n       Social Security is a contributory program supported by \n     deductions from workers' earning, matched by employers (and \n     to a small \n     [[Page S3013]] extent by taxation of Social Security \n     benefits). As part of Social Security's financing plan, the \n     contribution rates are now producing surpluses and will for \n     many years. However, it would be bad policy if in order to \n     reduce the general deficit, Social Security were called on to \n     build greater surpluses than needed to finance the program. \n     Flat-rate earmarked deductions from workers' earnings are \n     justified as a way of paying for specified social insurance \n     benefits, but not as a substitute for the general taxes \n     needed to pay for other government services. Cutting Social \n     Security benefits to help meet the budget deficit while \n     imposing higher contribution rates than needed for Social \n     Security financing would be unfair and would certainly lack \n     public support. As the Commission concluded in its Interim \n     Report, any savings from Social Security changes ``should be \n     used to restore the long-term soundness of the Social \n     Security Trust Fund.''\n       The Social Security program deserves the bipartisan backing \n     it has enjoyed in recent years, not just because it is \n     popular, but because it works. It is our biggest anti-poverty \n     program, and, at the same time, it is a universal retirement, \n     disability, and life insurance system, important to just \n     about everyone. Social Security is keeping 15 million people \n     out of poverty and many millions more from near poverty. \n     Today the poverty rate for senior households is about 13 \n     percent, approximately the same as for the population as a \n     whole, but without Social Security, it would be about 50 \n     percent, and public assistance paid for by the general \n     taxpayer would be much, much larger. Social Security requires \n     all of us--provident and improvident alike--to join with our \n     employers in paying directly toward our own future security, \n     and thus holds down the need for public assistance.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  ILLUSTRATIVE PLAN TO BRING SOCIAL SECURITY INTO LONG RANGE BALANCE\\1\\ \n            [Figures shown are a percent of taxable payrolls]           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent estimate of long-range deficit................  .......     2.13\nExtend Social Security to the one-third of State and                    \n local employees not now covered (new hires only as                     \n was done when Federal employees were covered)\\2\\.....     0.23  .......\nCredit Social Security with the proceeds from the 1993                  \n tax increase on Social Security benefits\\3\\..........     0.36  .......\nCompute benefits over 38 years instead of 35 years as                   \n in present law.......................................     0.30  .......\nTax Social Security benefits for those who have                         \n incomes above $25,000 if single; and $32,000 if joint                  \n income tax filers, in the same way government career                   \n pensions and private pensions are taxed (that is, to                   \n the extent benefits exceed what the worker has paid                    \n in, computed individually)...........................     0.14  .......\nIncrease the contribution rate one percentage point                     \n each, for employees and employers, beginning in 2020.     1.12  .......\n                                                       -----------------\n      Total...........................................     2.15  .......\n                                                       =================\nInteraction among the various proposals...............     -.02  .......\nReduction in deficit..................................  .......     2.13\nDeficit after changes.................................  .......        0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Many other plans are easily developed, some reducing benefits more-- \n  for example, by raising the age of first eligibility for full benefits\n  to 68 instead of the presently scheduled age 67--other raising        \n  contributions more--for example, by moving the effective date of a    \n  rate increase from 2020 to 2010.

Time is of the \nessence here. We have to move along. Robert Ball has worked under \nPresident Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon and, after \nleaving there he has been the chief adviser to the Social Security \nAdministration and to the executive branch--total credibility.\n  I have another item. I ask unanimous consent this article in Business \nWeek dated February 20 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, Feb. 20, 1995]\n\n            Social Security: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Tinker\n\n                          (By Robert Kuttner)\n\n       Social Security is supposedly in long-term demographic \n     crisis--too many retirees living longer, not enough wage \n     earners to pay the freight. As a result, there have been \n     calls for reduced Social Security payouts, deferred \n     retirements, perhaps even means-testing. But a closer look at \n     the economic assumptions behind the Social Security Trustees' \n     Report reveals a very different sort of crisis--one that \n     calls for different solutions.\n       Social Security is financed by payroll taxes. Unless we \n     raise tax rates, growth in payroll-tax receipts will depend \n     on growth in taxable wages. The trustees project likely \n     annual real wage growth of just 1% per year over the next 75 \n     years. By contrast, during the past 75 years, annual real \n     wage growth was about 1.7%. Because of compounding, this \n     seemingly small difference puts the economy on a wholly \n     divergent growth trajectory. With 1% real annual wage growth, \n     Social Security will be hundreds of billions in the red. With \n     1.7% growth, the system will be in the black forever.\n       Why the trustees' pessimism? Wage growth has indeed been \n     dismal during the past two decades. From 1953 to 1973, annual \n     productivity grew by 2.3%, and wages grew annually at 2%. But \n     in the slow-growth decades from 1973 to 1993, while annual \n     productivity grew at just 0.9%, real wages actually \n     declined--an average of 0.2% per year.\n\n\n                              productivity\n\n       The key question is whether coming decades will resemble \n     the fat years or the lean ones. Here perhaps is some good \n     news. First, 1973-93 had unusual demographic trends unlikely \n     to be repeated. Baby boomers and women flooded into the \n     workforce, leaving less wage per worker. Baby boomers, male \n     and female, are now more experienced and presumably more \n     productive workers. Women workers are now being paid wages \n     closer to their male counterparts. On both counts, the one-\n     time depression in wages should be reversed.\n       A second source of lower wages has been the galloping \n     increase in the cost of fringe benefits. Wages are subject to \n     Social Security taxes; benefits are not. Here again, the \n     recent past does not predict the future. One way or another, \n     via market forces or government regulation, the escalation in \n     health premiums will level off. The other major fringe \n     benefit, pensions, is already declining as a share of total \n     compensation.\n       Third, many economists expect the boom in information \n     technology to translate, at last, into higher productivity. \n     Economic history suggests long lags between the introduction \n     of new, productivity-enhancing technology and its broad \n     economic diffusion. In addition, as Massachusetts Institute \n     of Technology economist Frank S. Levy notes, the productivity \n     gains of the 1950s showed up almost immediately in higher \n     purchasing power because they were concentrated in consumer \n     goods. The productivity improvements of the 1980s and '90s, \n     in contrast, have been in producer technologies. However, as \n     computers proliferate and information technology produces \n     productivity gains in everything from banking and retailing \n     to telephone service, these gains will likely yield gains in \n     real wages, too.\n\n\n                                Moronic\n\n       Offseting this optimism, however, are two other factors. \n     First, income distribution has become increasingly unequal. \n     If that trend continues, too few of the productivity gains \n     will show up in pay packets subject to payroll taxation. \n     Moreover, despite the new competitiveness and resulting low \n     inflation, the Federal Reserve seems determined not to let \n     the economy reach its full growth potential. But here the \n     solution is not to wreck Social Security. It is rather to \n     pursue policies that reverse the growing income inequality \n     and permit greater economic expansion.\n       Nobody, of course, can predict the rate of wage increases \n     75 years into the future. As one expert working on the Social \n     Security actuarial assumptions confesses, on deepest \n     background: ``The whole exercise, really, is moronic.'' \n     During the past 75 years, we experienced one entirely \n     unanticipated wage collapse, the Great Depression; an equally \n     unexpected stimulus to wage growth, World War II; and a third \n     unpredicted slowdown after 1973.\n       In truth, even under pessimistic assumptions, Social \n     Security will remain nicely in balance for at least the next \n     20 years. Whether the system goes into the red after that \n     depends on trends nobody can forecast with certainty. Rather \n     than hack away at Social Security, Congress should legislate \n     standby adjustments to take effect only if the doomsayers \n     prove right. We should continue to pursue economic expansion \n     and rising wages--both for Social Security and for their own \n     sakes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will just read one sentence there, by the \ndistinguished economist Robert Kuttner.\n\n       In truth, even under pessimistic assumptions, Social \n     Security will remain nicely in balance for at least the next \n     20 years.\n\n  We have the authorities. We know what is happening. But they have \nused this argument that Social Security is insolvent as the dark ink of \nthe octopus in order to confuse people.\n  [[Page S3014]] We face two arguments. One concerns discipline: \nCongress is never going to do it unless you put it in the Constitution. \nFalse. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nthat I wrote last year entitled, ``From Tragedy to Farce'' which \naddresses this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Mar. 1, 1994]\n\n  From Tragedy to Farce--If History Repeats Itself, a Balanced-Budget \n    Amendment Won't Force Congress To Be Disciplined--Just Creative\n\n                          (By Ernest Hollings)\n\n       Here's a terrific, no-pain solution to Washington's budget \n     deficit mess. Instead of cutting spending, raising taxes and \n     angering voters in an election year, why not zap the deficits \n     by simply declaring them unconstitutional? Why not a \n     balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution?\n       Mind you, I support the balanced-budget amendment, knowing \n     full-well it alone won't balance the budget. What I oppose is \n     the cynical selling of this amendment by politicians who have \n     no intention of following through with the nasty, wrist-\n     slashing work of actually balancing the federal budget.\n       Recall that Congress has passed a balanced-budget amendment \n     once before. It was called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Like \n     today's balanced-budget amendment, the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings amendment boldly promised a balanced budget in five \n     years' time. It, too, was embraced by big, bipartisan \n     congressional majorities and enjoyed public support. Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings cut the deficit to a low-water mark of $150 \n     billion, but was later gutted by a succession of budget \n     summits. The deficits exploded once again.\n                         lessons of a crack-up\n\n       A wise man once observed that history repeats itself, the \n     first time as tragedy and the second time as farce. The \n     balanced budget amendment could prove to be the ultimate \n     farce unless we learn from the mistake of the past. As a \n     veteran of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings crack-up of 1990, I \n     offer the following lessons.\n       Follow the money. The deficit this fiscal year, $223 \n     billion, is nearly the same as when we began the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings exercise in 1985. The difference is that, \n     after eight years of steady economizing, we have already \n     strip-mined the easy budget cuts. What's more, Congress last \n     year took the unprecedented step of imposing a hard freeze on \n     discretionary spending for the next five years. A balanced-\n     budget amendment on top of this will require cuts of nearly \n     $600 billion between 1995 and 1999.\n       Using the Congressional Budget Office's most recent \n     projections, to balance the budget by 1999 without new taxes \n     we would have to cut all federal spending (except mandatory \n     spending for judges' pay and interest on the debt) by $26 \n     billion in 1995, $73 billion in 1996, $119 billion in 1997, \n     $162 billion in 1998, and $205 billion in 1999. This includes \n     cutting Social Security by $130 billion by 1999.\n       Of course, Congress wouldn't dare cut Social Security by \n     one dollar. So exempt Social Security from cuts: now the \n     required across-the-board cuts rise from 10.7% to 14.2% in \n     1999.\n       Inevitably, other programs--including veterans' benefits, \n     military pay, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition \n     program--would also be sheltered from cuts. As the burden of \n     $600 billion in cuts falls on a smaller and smaller share of \n     the total budget, reductions of 20% and up would be required \n     in unprotected areas such as law enforcement, education and \n     environmental protection.\n       Beware of political chickens posing as budget hawks. Sixty-\n     one senators and 271 representatives hitched a ride on the \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bandwagon in 1985. But later, when \n     those same politicians were asked to cast tough votes to \n     actually cut the deficit, they lit out for the tall grass. \n     For example, in 1990 in the Senate Budget Committee, I \n     proposed a strict spending freeze to meet that year's Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction target; the most zealous \n     supporters of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings joined forces to kill the \n     freeze.\n       Face it, most members of Congress view a ``yea'' on the \n     balanced-budget amendment as a free vote. They get to preen \n     their deficit-hawk feathers in an election year, comfortable \n     in their belief that doomsday won't arrive until 1999.\n       The rule in Washington's budget battles is: ``Fight until \n     you see the whites of their eyes.'' The theory of the \n     balanced-budget amendment is identical to that of Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings: if you put a gun to Congress' head, Congress \n     will get discipline. The reality, however, is that when you \n     put a gun to Congress' head, Congress gets creative.\n       Bear in mind that both Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the \n     balanced-budget amendment are strictly process-oriented \n     mechanisms. Process can always be defeated by 3ore process. \n     The process of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was defeated by the \n     counter-process of the ``budget summits.''\n       History now repeats itself with the balanced-budget \n     amendment. Already the cloakroom conspirators are talking \n     about ``process reforms'' that will assist in ``balancing'' \n     the budget: moving more programs ``off budget'' and creating \n     a separate ``capital budget'' to finance ``investments'' with \n     deficit spending. What's more, the balanced-budget amendment \n     expressly allows Social Security Trust Fund surpluses to be \n     siphoned off to help ``balance'' the budget; in 1999 alone, \n     we will be robbing $100 billion from Social Security. \n     ``Balanced budget,'' indeed.\n\n\n                         avoid the gamesmanship\n\n       So let us debate, pass and ratify the balanced-budget \n     amendment. But let's avoid the gamesmanship that betrayed \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. If you're not for massive cuts in \n     federal spending, or for making up the difference with new \n     taxes, then hold the hypocrisy; vote no on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That was almost a year ago. I said at that time: Watch \nwhat they do, not what they say. Congress gets very creative.\n  Point: Right this minute, section 7 gives them creatively $636 \nbillion that they will not have to find in order to comply with the \nliteral wording of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Thus, in the year 2002, the budget will not be balanced. There will \nbe trillions of dollars worth of IOU's in the Social Security trust \nfund. But they will say, ``we have complied literally with the \nwording.'' That is one particular creativity that you see going on now \nthrough the violation of the Hollings amendment--a reason for calling \nthis a fraud.\n   I have made the tough votes. Just yesterday I voted to table Senator \nRockefeller's amendment to exempt veteran's programs from deficit \ncalculations. I helped coauthor the WIC Program, education programs, \nbut I would likewise vote against amendments to exempt them from \ndeficit calculations. Those programs do not have trust funds; we do \nunder Social Security.\n  There are other ideas of creativity around this town. Mr. Greenspan \nhas given cover to those who want to redefine CPI. Reducing it by 1 \npoint would forgo the need for an additional $150 billion in spending \ncuts over 5 years.\n  Similarly, there's a move not to continue with the pay-as-you-go \nprovisions requiring legislation outside the budget resolution to be \ndeficit neutral over 10 years. When President Clinton wanted a 5-year \nrule so he did not require the 60-vote margin on GATT, I held fast. I \nsaid, ``We have to maintain the discipline.''\n  When I offered an amendment to make the 10-year rule part of the \nCongressional Budget Act last week before the Budget Committee, \nRepublicans said, ``No, no, not now, maybe a later time would be \nbetter.'' They are going to get it a later time, that you can be sure \nof.\n  So there it is. You can see what is on course. The distinguished \nSpeaker of the House said earlier this year at a town meeting in \nKennesaw, GA:\n\n       We have a handful of bureaucrats who all professional \n     economists agree have an error in their calculations. If they \n     cannot get it right in the next 30 days or so, we will zero \n     them out. We will transfer the responsibility to either the \n     Federal Reserve or the Treasury or tell them to get it right.\n\n  That is what they are going to do. They are going to do away with the \nSecretary of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics because, if they \ndo not do it the way we want, we will get a different referee.\n  It is my hope that we will amend section 7 excluding Social Security \nso that we will pass this balanced budget amendment. They think they \ncan pressure old Hollings. But I stood for the truth in public service \nall my life. I found out it paid off. Let us sober up in this town, \nspeak the truth, and come under the auspices of the first thing we \npassed last month which puts Congress under the same rules as the \npeople outside this beltway. Let's have truth in budgeting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to call up an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S3015]] Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have been waiting here for 4 hours to bring up an amendment, which \nI am sure the other side would only take 10 minutes to bring up and we \ncould probably move to a vote.\n  The Senator who is about to speak, the Senator from West Virginia, \nhas been courteous enough to not object to that procedure. \nUnfortunately, the other side has objected.\n  But this is an item that is timely and I think should be disposed of \ntoday, so I will seek unanimous consent again later on today or seek \nthe floor again for that purpose. I regret that this has not been \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have a vote scheduled at 3 o'clock and time is \nallocated that would put us past that time. Could I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator yield back 7\\1/2\\ minutes and our side would \nyield back 7\\1/2\\ minutes and, therefore, we would come within the hour \nof debate?\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator wait a little while and let me see how I \nam going to come out? Perhaps we could work it out.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, not a day goes by that we are not shocked by \na violent crime described on the nightly news or in the newspaper. We \nlive in a world, in a country, in cities and towns, in which violent \ncrimes--murders, robberies, and rapes--have become commonplace. Within \nthis body, one Senator's wife was held at gunpoint in front of her \nhome, and another Senator's aid was murdered just a few blocks from \nthis Chamber.\n  The statistics are overwhelming. In 1993, the most recent year for \nwhich data are available, there were over 1.9 million violent crimes \ncommitted in this country. There were 24,530 murders. There were \n104,810 reported--Reported--forcible rapes. There were 659,760 \nrobberies. There were 1.135 million aggravated assaults. Clearly crime \nis a serious national problem which must be addressed.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a violent crime \noccurs in America once every 16 seconds.\n  And the stopwatch is set, as you can see, at 16. It represents one \nviolent crime every 16 seconds.\n  Someone is murdered every 21 minutes. A woman is raped every 5 \nminutes.\n  A robbery is committed every 48 seconds. One burglary is committed \nevery 11 seconds. One motor vehicle is stolen every 20 seconds. One \nproperty crime is committed every 3 seconds.\n  Today, Mr. President, Americans are over four times more likely to be \nthe victim of a violent crime than they were 30 years ago. This \nincrease has occurred during almost the same time period that I have \nserved as a Member of the Senate. In the past three decades, the rate \nof violent crimes has increased 364 percent--eight times faster than \nthe population of this country has grown.\n  This crime plague is no longer confined to urban areas and large \ncities. Administrator Thomas A. Constantine, of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, said it best when he recently testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       And this epidemic of violent crime is no longer confined to \n     big cities like New York or Los Angeles or Miami. It has \n     reached deep into our heartland. Last year, for example, \n     Indianapolis, Indiana, a city known more for its Midwestern \n     hospitality than its violence, recorded a homicide increase \n     of over 60 percent * * *. Homicides in Buffalo, New York, \n     increased by almost 20 percent from 1993 to 1994. And, in \n     Richmond, Virginia, homicides increased over 30 percent from \n     1983 to 1994.\n\n  My own State of West Virginia has prided itself for many years for \nhaving the lowest overall crime rate in the Nation. In West Virginia, \nunlocked doors and evening strolls have long been the way of life, but \nthat is changing, and it is a crying shame. Crime in West Virginia has \nincreased threefold since the 1960's. Over the past 5 years, the rate \nof violent crime in West Virginia has risen by 11 percent, a rise \ngreater than the national average. The numbers of murders, rapes, and \nassaults are climbing, and, paralleling the national pattern. Even the \nnumber of juvenile crimes in West Virginia is skyrocketing.\n  Now in West Virginia's small, rural communities, drugs are being \npeddled, children are shooting children, women are being attacked on \nthe streets in front of their homes, and families are connecting alarms \nto their bedroom windows.\n  Like so many other States, West Virginia has recognized the crucial \nneed to respond to rising crime rates by putting more police on the \nstreets, building more prisons, and providing better resources to law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. President, I have several charts that indicate the level of this \ncrime epidemic and how it is breaking out among the youth in this \nNation.\n  The first chart shows that the record level of all violent crime has \nrisen over the past decade. In 1985, approximately 1.3 million \nAmericans were victims of violent crime. In 1993, that number had risen \nto over 1.9 million Americans. That is a 45-percent increase in just \neight years!\n  The next chart shows the number of murders committed. In 1985, there \nwere 18,980, murders in the United States. In this same 8-year period \n(1985-1993), the number of murders per year had risen to 24,530. That \nis an increase of 29 percent!\n  The next chart is the most alarming. For in spite of all of our law \nenforcement efforts at the Sttate and national levels, press reports \nshow that juvenile crime is increasing at a breathtaking rate. From \n1984 to 1993, the juvenile arrest rate\n for murder has risen from 1,305 to 3,788. In other words, it almost \ntripled.\n\n  Mr. President, many of the advocates of this balanced budget \namendment have stated their intentions that defense and Social Security \nshould be spared from any of the cuts that will occur under this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget if it is, indeed, \nadopted by the Congress and ratified by the record number of States. I \nsay that again: The advocates of this ill-advised amendment have stated \ntheir intentions that defense and Social Security should be spared. But \nit does not make any difference what their intentions may be. It is \nwhat that constitutional amendment says. That is where the courts would \nultimately look. They will look within the four corners of the document \nitself, the amendment itself.\n  It does not make any difference what the advocates say. It is not \ntheir intention to do this. It is not their intention to do that. It is \nnot their intention to include defense. It is going to be exempted. It \nis not their intention to include Social Security. It does not make any \ndifference what their intention is. It does not say that in the \nconstitutional amendment itself. It does not say that defense will be \nexempted. It does not say the Social Security will be exempted. That is \nwhere one has to look to see what the amendment says and what it will \ndo.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yes, I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the Senator's study of this \namendment, about what the amendment does do and does not do, during the \ncourse of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, we had the testimony \nof Mr. Dellinger that was similar to the kind of testimony that was had \nduring the course of your own hearings about what the responsibility of \nthe Chief Executive might be if this were to go into effect.\n  There was very substantial constitutional opinion that a President, \nhaving sworn to uphold the Constitution, would therefore be required to \nactually impound the expenditures if the receipts and expenditures did \nnot balance.\n  This has not, really, been debated or discussed very much. I had \nhoped at some time to have an amendment to try to make sure that the \nSenate as an institution was going to have an opportunity to address \nthat issue. I understand that given our situation we may have to defer \nthe vote on that until Tuesday next.\n  I am interested in the Senator's concern about that particular issue; \nto \n[[Page S3016]] wit, that a President, should the balanced budget \namendment actually be ratified, would be put in a position that, having \nsworn to uphold the Constitution, that he may be compelled, himself, to \ngo ahead and impound the resources or funds or appropriations, and that \nthis would be something that would be a far reach from whatever had \nbeen thought of by our Founding Fathers or considered during the \nConstitutional Convention, which I know the Senator has talked about \nduring the earlier discussion and debate.\n  I just wonder whether the Senator from West Virginia, as one who \nchaired those hearings, had heard a considerable amount of debate and \ndiscussion about this issue, whether he had formed any opinion or \nwhether he himself was concerned about the ambiguity. The reason I \nbring this up, as the Senator was just pointing out to the Members that \nthere is so much that is left unsaid and so much left unstated and so \nmuch left up in the air, this, too, might be something that at least, \nas far as the Senator from West Virginia is concerned, would be left up \nin the air prior to consideration or prior to the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nquestion. It goes right to the heart of the matter. During the hearings \nthat were conducted last year by the Appropriations Committee in 1993, \nthe year before last, during those hearings several constitutional \nscholars were invited to appear before that committee. I was then the \nchairman.\n  All of those constitutional scholars who appeared before that \ncommittee had a great concern with respect to this constitutional \namendment. As precisely as I recall, the same amendment--I do not think \nany changes had been made in it since those hearings were held. I \nbelieve that it is, word for word, as it was then.\n  Most all of them, if not all, were concerned about the very \npossibilities that the Senator has stated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield, Mr. President, on this point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have the hearings here, the excerpts. \nHere Archibald Cox, in his statement, talks about impounding funds \nunder some appropriations, while continuing spending under others. \n``Probably this would be the sensible course; but it means that the \nproposed amendment would enlarge the power of the President, vis-a-vis \nthe Congress.''\n  That is Archibald Cox who indicated that that power would be with the \nPresident. And Walter Dellinger, who is a distinguished constitutional \nscholar, was asked, ``Would the amendment authorize the President to \nimpound funds?''\n  Mr. Dellinger said, ``Yes, I think it would.''\n  And Charles Fried, who was a distinguished Solicitor General during \nthe Reagan period, when asked during the course of hearings, he said \nthat ``total outlays shall not exceed total revenues.''\n\n       If in the course of a budget year earlier projections prove \n     false, this provision would offer a President ample warrant \n     to impound appropriated funds. In the past such impoundments \n     were based on claims of the President's inherent powers.\n\n  Coming close to the point of voting on the Senator's amendment--and \nthe Senator was talking about the ambiguity of this amendment, about \nwhat was included and what was not--at an appropriate time, I will \noffer an amendment that will make it clear, that opportunity for the \nSenate to go on record that we do not believe we should give that kind \nof a power, the power of general impoundment, to a president, if this \nwere to go into effect.\n  The principal reason I asked the Senator from West Virginia is \nwhether he feels that this is an issue that ought to be addressed as \nwell, in the course of the debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do.\n  I think there is very much a likelihood that power would be shifted \nfrom the legislative branch to the executive and to the courts. I can \nimagine easily the situation in which the Congress failed to enforce \nthe amendment by appropriate legislation.\n  By the way, the President can veto that ``appropriate legislation'' \nif he does not agree with it. I can see a situation in which the \nCongress failed to enforce and implement the article, in which case the \ncounsel to the President would advise the President: Mr. President, \nthis budget is out of balance. People on Capitol Hill, just like they \nwere back there when they adopted the amendment with flying colors, if \nit is so adopted, they still do not have the spine that that amendment \nwas supposed to implant in their frail bodies. And, consequently, Mr. \nPresident, it is up to you to see that this is done. We recommend that \nyou impound moneys.\n  The President would say: Naturally, well, I cannot do that, because \nof the 1974 Budget Impoundment and Control Act, I cannot do that.\n That would be against the law.''\n\n  The council would say, ``Well, Mr. President, there is now a higher \nlaw. It has been written into the organic law of this country; \ntherefore, you are bound, upholding your oath of office, to balance \nthis budget.'' And the President would impound moneys.\n  Of course, then matters would get into courts because some of the \npeople, some of the citizens who are entitled under the laws to receive \ncertain funds, certain payments from certain programs would say, \n``Well, look, the book says I'm entitled to'' thus and so. They go into \nthe courts and the courts will be brought into the action. There is \nnothing in here that forbids courts to enforce this amendment, nothing \nin here that requires them to enforce it. Those constitutional \nscholars, many of those professors, as the Senator has pointed out, who \nappeared before the Appropriations Committee, so stated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, in the Senator's review of those debates \non the power of the executive and legislative branches that took place \nat the Constitutional Convention, does not the Senator feel that this \nis really standing the whole Constitution on its head in terms of how \nour Founding Fathers view the delegate powers to the executive and to \nthe legislative branches? Does this not really effectively corrupt the \nwhole separation of powers, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, as \nto the taxing authority and the executive authority?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has asked a very timely and decisive question. \nIf Congress does not enforce this amendment, once it is in the \nConstitution, if it were not enforced, then that would be the other \nnightmare. One can speak of all the nightmares that would occur during \nthe enforcement of this amendment.\n  If it is not enforced, on the other hand, that constitutes another \nnightmare in that the faith and confidence of the American people in \nthe Constitution of the United States will be damaged, and the \nConstitution will suffer thereby.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I be correct in concluding, when Senator Johnston \nand I have an opportunity to offer an amendment that would just state, \n``Nothing in this article shall authorize the President to impound \nfunds appropriated by Congress by law or to impose taxes, duties or \nfees,'' that the Senator would support that amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to read the language, but I am certainly \nsupportive of the concept and would, in all likelihood, support the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for yielding for those questions. I \nhope to have an opportunity to submit that amendment and to speak to \nthe amendment and have an opportunity to vote on it. I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  John Marshall said that this Constitution is intended to endure for \nages to come and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of \nhuman affairs. I think we are going very much against what John \nMarshall said and we will, in my judgment, be committing a horrible and \nunforgivable blunder if we adopt this amendment.\n Furthermore, as Senators are aware, the so-called ``Contract With \nAmerica'' contains a massive tax cut. If we exempt defense and Social \nSecurity from budget cuts and if we adopt the tax cuts called for by \nthose who signed onto the so-called ``Contract With America,'' and if \nwe pay for the interest on the national debt, then every other program \nin the budget would have to be cut by 30 percent across-the-board in \norder to achieve budget balance by the year 2002.\n  [[Page S3017]] It is clear, then, that a balanced budget amendment \nwould have a catastrophic impact on Federal law enforcement and our \nefforts to combat violent crime in America. In the words of the \nAssistant Attorney General, Sheila F. Anthony:\n\n       * * * Congress should be keenly aware of the impact that \n     such an amendment could have on the essential operations of \n     the federal government in general, and of the Department of \n     Justice in particular. In a word, the impact could be \n     devastating!\n\n  It would significantly setback any progress that this Nation has made \nin combatting violent crime, the importation of illegal drugs, and \nillegal immigration. Instead of bolstering and enhancing our law \nenforcement programs as proposed in the FY 1996 budget, we will be \ndismantling and disarming our side in the war against violent crime, \nand retreating in our efforts to control our Nation's borders.\n  I think it is important to take a brief look at what has happened to \nlaw enforcement funding during the past few years in response to the \nrising tidal wave of crime. When I assumed the chairmanship of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee in January 1989, the Department of \nJustice budget stood at $5.4 billion. The budget for Treasury law \nenforcement bureaus was $2.083 billion. The Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund did not even exist. That was just 6 years ago. And during \nthat period of very tight limitations on discretionary spending--with \nthe help of our subcommittee chairmen, Senator Hollings and Senator \nDeConcini, and the leadership of our authorizing committee\n chairman, Senator Biden, and the support of members on the other side \nof the aisle, such as former Senator Rudman, Senator Domenici, Senator \nBond, Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, and, of course, Senator \nHatfield--we put forth aggressive efforts to fight the war on violent \ncrime.\n\n  Last August, we sent an appropriations bill to the President that \nprovided the Department of Justice with budgetary resources totalling \n$13.7 billion--a funding increase of over 250 percent in just six \nyears. For the Department of Treasury law enforcement programs, fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriations totaled $2.8 billion, or a 36-percent increase \nsince 1989. And, we provided $38 million to the Departments of Health \nand Human Services and Education, for crime prevention programs that \ndid not exist in 1989. We aggressively attacked the crime problem \nbecause the people were demanding that the issue be addressed. And they \nwere right to demand it because their demand got results. This \nincreased spending has been well worthwhile. It is providing a big bang \nfor the buck, but not big enough.\n  For example, look at our Federal Bureau of Prisons. In 1989, our \nFederal Prison System housed 54,000 inmates and had an operational \nbudget of $1.2 billion. We made resources available to build additional \nprisons and have continued to provide increased funding for prison \nguards and support personnel to activate those prisons. The Federal \nPrison System's annual budget has doubled since 1989 to $2.6 billion. \nIn 1995, our Federal Prison System will house over 102,000 inmates. In \njust six years we have doubled the number of criminals who have been \nput away under lock and key and taken off the streets so that they can \nno longer terrorize law-abiding citizens.\n  But, the greatest growth in Department of Justice appropriations has \nbeen in Federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. \nIn 1989, the Congress provided $229 million in such assistance. In \n1995, the Justice Department will make available almost $2.4 billion \nfor state and local law enforcement assistance programs. Much of this \nincrease was provided through appropriations which funded the new \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly called \n``the crime bill.''\n  Appropriations were also increased for the main investigative and \nprosecutorial divisions of the Department of Justice--the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshal, \nand U.S. Attorneys. Total funding for these bureaus has been increased \nfrom $2.5 billion in 1989, to $4.5 billion this year.\n  For FY 1996, the President's budget proposes to continue large \nincreases for the Department of Justice and Federal law enforcement. \nThe budget proposes to increase the Department's budget from its \ncurrent level of $13.7 billion to $16.5 billion. That is an increase of \n$2.8 billion in just 1 year,\n for the activation of prisons and the construction of new prisons in \nTexas, California and Hawaii. In the next 5 years, as prisons under \nconstruction are activated and brought on line, we will be adding \n30,000 new prison beds to the Federal system. The 5-year budget \nprojections for the Federal Prison System call for the agency's \noperating budget to rise from its current level of $2.3 billion to over \n$3.5 billion. Please note, this increased requirement will occur during \nthe same period that the balanced budget amendment calls for the budget \nto be balanced.\n\n  For the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the President's \nbudget request proposes an increase of $442 million or 21 percent. It \nwould provide for 700 new Border Patrol agents, 680 new inspectors for \nborder crossings, and 165 support staff so agents can patrol the border \nand not spend their time performing paperwork. And the budget proposes \nto increase by $170 million payments to States for the cost of housing \nincarcerated illegal aliens in State prisons.\n  With respect to total law enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernments, this is again the area of the largest increases in the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget. For the Justice Department, the \nbudget would increase such assistance by almost $1.6 billion or 66 \npercent. The budget contains $3.965 billion for programs such as, Byrne \nformula grants, community policing, juvenile justice programs, violence \nagainst women, and prison grants. Again, much of this assistance--\n$3.456 billion or 87 percent--would come through appropriations \npursuant to the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established in the \n1994 crime bill.\n  The President's budget has proposed that violent crime prevention \nprograms operated by the Departments of Education and Health and Human \nServices be increased. In fiscal year 1996, it proposes $175 million \nfor prevention programs financed through the new Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund, an increase of $137 million above current levels. \nThese programs will help local communities strengthen their prevention \nefforts through economic partnerships, before and after school \nprograms, rape education and prevention programs, shelter grants for \nbattered women, and demonstration grants.\n\n\n    impact of balanced budget amendment on law enforcement programs\n\n  Mr. President, with a balanced budget amendment in force we will \nlikely not be seeing that continued enhancement of law enforcement the \nPresident has described in his budget proposal. Unless we exempt \nFederal law enforcement and violent crime programs, we will destroy \neverything that has been achieved since 1989. We will be sounding the \nretreat in our war against crime and backpeddling on our hard won \nefforts to protect law-abiding citizens.\n  If the Federal law enforcement and violent crime reduction and \nprevention programs receive their fair share of reductions required by \nthe balanced budget amendment, then the following types of impacts \nwould occur:\n  For example, the Federal Prison System will not be bringing new \nprison beds on-line this year. It will not be adding another 30,000 \nbeds and new prisons in the next 5 years as prisons are delivered by \ncontractors and come out of the pipeline. We will not provide for the \nnew staffing and operational requirements to operate these facilities. \nNo, instead the Bureau of Prisons would have to close 37 of the 79 \nexisting Federal prison facilities. We would either have to let \nprisoners go, or crowd over 100,000 Federal inmates into the remaining \nfacilities. Overcrowding would be at over 250 percent. Let me say that \nagain. Overcrowding would be at over 250 percent.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in local newspapers about \novercrowding and violence at the District of Columbia's Lorton prison \nfacilities just 20 miles south of here. That is what the future holds \nfor our Federal prisons under a balanced budget amendment, with the \nbalancing done on the back of non-defense discretionary programs.\n  Secondly, a balanced budget amendment would severely set back, if not \ntotally destroy, our efforts to combat \n[[Page S3018]] illegal immigration and control our borders. At the very \ntime the Mexican peso is being devalued and the economic attraction of \nthe United States is greatest, we would be letting down our guard.\n  We would not be providing the increased numbers of Border Patrol \nagents and inspectors proposed in the fiscal year 1996 budget. We would \ninstead be laying off or ``RIF'ing'' agents that we added during the \npast 2 years, and would go well below the staffing levels in effect \nwhen I took over as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The \nBorder Patrol would be reduced by approximately 1,600 agent and support \npositions. INS inspectors would be cut by approximately 400 positions. \nThe INS detention and deportation program would be reduced by over 500 \npositions.\n  The impact of reductions of this magnitude cannot be overstated. The \nlack of patrols will allow more illegal aliens to cross the border and \nreach the United States. Patrols in critical choke points such as San \nDiego, California, and El Paso, Texas, would have to be cut back. The \nstaffing reductions at ports of entry would cause horrendous traffic \njams at the border, and would have a negative impact on commercial and \nnoncommercial traffic to and from Mexico and Canada. The number of \naliens who could be detained and the number of removals which could be \naccomplished annually will drop. This would facilitate efforts by \naliens to abscond and remain in the country illegally.\n  Moreover, a balanced budget amendment would also have a debilitating \nimpact on our Federal investigative and prosecutorial agencies.\n  The U.S. Attorney offices across the country would have to \nsignificantly reduce the number and experience level of Assistant U.S. \nAttorneys. The Federal Government would have to decline to prosecute \ncases where there is shared jurisdiction with State and local laws. At \na time when violent crime is the foremost concern of American citizens, \nthe U.S. Attorneys would not have the resources necessary to prosecute \nviolent offenders in a timely manner.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration are personnel intensive and would be severely impacted \nby reductions necessitated by a balanced budget amendment. The FBI \nwould lose over 4,100 agents and over 5,000 support positions. The DEA \nwould have to cut 2,000 positions, including almost 900 agents. Both \nthe FBI and DEA would have to discontinue hiring and training of new \nagents. Both agencies would have to reduce investigative operations and \nfocus solely on crimes that are Federal in nature. The FBI and DEA's \nsupport to State and local task forces, such as Safe Streets, would \nhave to be disbanded. Finally, both agencies would have to close small \nrural offices across the country.\n  Additionally, with respect to State and local assistance for law \nenforcement and prevention of violent crime, the balanced budget \namendment would undo much of the progress made in last year's crime \nbill. We would have to make severe reductions to a number of programs, \nincluding community policing, grants to construct prisons, programs to \nprevent violence against women, Byrne formula grants, and crime \nprevention programs. Valuable prevention programs, like the Community \nSchools Program and the National Domestic Hotline run by the Department \nof Health and Human Services, would have to be reduced significantly. \nNew prevention programs authorized from the Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund, such as community programs on domestic violence, grants for \nbattered women's shelters, education to prevent and reduce sexual abuse \nof runaway children--would never get off the ground.\n  This would have a staggering impact on programs designed to prevent \ndomestic violence and rape. For example, failing to fund the Crime \nTrust Fund programs on rape prevention would deny services to 700,000 \nwomen in fiscal year 1996. Eliminating the domestic violence \ndemonstration program would deny critical education services designed \nto prevent domestic violence to nearly 2 million Americans.\n  A balanced budget amendment would also force significant reductions \nin the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms at the Department of the \nTreasury. ATF would be reduced by some $116 million, or one-quarter of \nits size and personnel. Investigations of armed career felons using \nfirearms to commit crimes would be substantially curtailed. This would \nresult in more illegal firearms on the streets being used for illegal \nactivities. The National Tracing Center, which aids in tracing weapons \nused in crimes, would be virtually inoperable. Recent gun legislation, \nsuch as Brady and the assault weapons ban, could not be effectively \nimplemented. The balanced budget amendment would essentially undo \neverything the Congress has done in this area in the past 10 years.\n In addition thereto, even the U.S. Secret Service, with its very \nessential mission of Presidential protection, would likely be cut under \na balanced budget amendment.\n\n\n           exempting law enforcement and prevention programs\n\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It provides Federal \nlaw enforcement, and violent crime reduction and prevention programs \nwith the same protection as we assume would be accorded the Department \nof Defense and Social Security. These crime control programs, in fact, \nare defense and security programs. They are domestic defense programs \ndesigned to protect Americans against threats to their security and \nsafety.\n  Without my amendment, the balanced budget measure likely would \ndebilitate Federal law enforcement and violent crime reduction and \nprevention programs. It would largely nullify the crime bill.\n  My amendment protects the Senate's commitment to the war on violent \ncrime, and our efforts to combat illegal immigration. It sends the \nright signal to organized crime, to drug smugglers, to those who commit \nviolent crimes. And, it sends the right signal to the man and women \nserving our Nation--to FBI agents, to DEA agents, ATF and Customs \nagents, to U.S. prosecutors and Border Patrol agents out on the line. \nAnd, it sends the right signal to the American public that we are not \ngoing to undo the progress that we have made.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the past 6 years \nand as a Member of this body, I have worked very, very hard to provide \nthese law enforcement programs with the resources necessary to fight \ncrime.\n  As I said earlier I was joined in this by the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, former distinguished Senator, Mr. \nDeConcini, from Arizona, and Senator Hatfield, the then-ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee, now the chairman, and the subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees to which I have \nalready alluded.\n  Look at the record. As I have stated, enhancements in Justice and \nTreasury law enforcement programs to combat violent crime was carried \nout on a bipartisan basis. I would hope that we could continue to \naccord these law enforcement and violent crime reduction and prevention \nprograms with protection on a bipartisan basis now.\n  This Senator is surely not going to let this progress be undone if he \ncan help it. I am not sure that I can. That would be my desire and \nhope. If it is the will of this Senate to balance the budget on the \nback of law enforcement, then we must ensure that the funding for these \nprograms is protected.\n  We have talked a great deal about the Constitution in this debate but \nlet me take a moment here and read from another great document which \nhas also been an inspiration to generations of Americans, The \nDeclaration of Independence.\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these \n     Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever \n     any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it \n     is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to \n     institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such \n     Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to \n     them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and \n     Happiness.\n\n  Note the words ``Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n  There is one murder every 21 minutes in this country. Are we \nguaranteeing \n[[Page S3019]] the unalienable right of life? There is one forcible \nrape every 5 minutes in America and one violent crime every 16 seconds \nin the United States. What about the unalienable rights of life and \nliberty in light of those chilling statistics? There is one burglary \nevery 11 seconds and one property crime every 3 seconds. Have we done \nour job in protecting the pursuit of happiness? These are dismal, \ndismal numbers and they rob our people daily of their lives, their \nliberties, and their happiness.\n  This balanced budget amendment and the cuts it will most assuredly \nimpose upon funding that is designed to protect the life, liberty, and \nthe safety of our citizens in their homes and on their streets will \nlessen our ability to provide our people with what to me is a basic \nright--namely freedom from the terror of violent crime.\n  Unless we continue our strong commitment to keep the criminals off \nour streets, track them down, lock them up, and reclaim this violent, \nviolent country, we will be failing in our duty to provide our people \nwith their basic right to safety.\n  Our children are increasingly under the influence of drug dealers. \nOur schools, in many communities, are hotbeds of crime and drug use. \nLife, limb, and personal property are daily at peril in America, and we \nowe our law-abiding citizens every effort we can muster to control the \nawful scourge of violent crime in America. The enemy within can be \nevery bit as dangerous as the enemy from without. The rampant plague of \ncrime threatens the very fiber of American life, and government must \nnot turn away from its duty and commitment to make America's streets \nsafe once again.\n  It is a priority. It takes money to fight crime, money to lock up \ncriminals, money to stop the drug dealers. And unless we protect our \nlaw enforcement effort from the deep chop of the balanced budget knife, \nthat money will not flow to the cities and towns of America and the \nthugs and the criminals will win.\n  Arguments rage about what government ought and ought not to be doing \nin this land, but I believe that there can be little disagreement about \ngovernment's role with regard to battling crime and protecting law-\nabiding citizens at risk from thugs and drug dealers. We must protect \nthe effort we have begun. We must insulate our law enforcement efforts \nfrom the slash of the budget ax. The crime clock is ticking. Let us \ntake this step to slow the bloody whirl of its hands.\n  Mr. President, there was a time agreement on this amendment. Whatever \ntime I have used, I will be happy to charge it against the time that \nwas on the amendment or I will be happy to cut down on the time, if the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah wishes to do so. I apologize for taking \nthis amount of time. I hope I am not cutting out the time for my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 301\n\n   (Purpose: To protect Federal outlays for law enforcement and the \n               reduction and prevention of violent crime)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 301, which is at the \ndesk, and which is on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 301.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 8, strike ``principal.'' and insert \n     ``principal and those for law enforcement and the reduction \n     and prevention of violent crime.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, can I inquire how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the present agreement the time is \ncharged to the amendment as offered and it is the opinion of the Chair \nthat the Senator began to speak at 2 o'clock, the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time I have \ntaken making my statement be charged against the time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is my understanding there was a desire to start voting \nat 3 o'clock?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague. \nAs usual, he is always very gracious. I understand the time for the \nvoting will begin at 3, so this will be the third vote.\n  If I could just say a few words about the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe my record on fighting for crime control \nlegislation is equal to that of any other Member in this body. Violent \ncrime is rampant in our society. The distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has made that case, and the American people have demanded that \nwe respond to this crisis as well.\n  Indeed, the issue is far too important for our Nation to be used as a \npolitical football, and I do not accuse the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia of doing that. But I do believe that it deserves effort \nother than on the balanced budget amendment. His amendment to exclude \nspending for law enforcement and the reduction and prevention of \nviolent crime in the constraints of the balanced budget amendment is in \nreality, in my opinion, a spending loophole that has very little to do \nwith addressing our people's very real fear of violent crime.\n  There are those of my colleagues who would argue that this amendment \ncreating a crime loophole in this constitutional amendment is a \nresponsible thing to do. They would have the rest of us, as well as the \nAmerican people, believe that this loophole would not be abused. But I \nhave to disagree. Let me just give an illustration here.\n  When the violent crime reduction trust fund provision passed the \nSenate as a part of H.R. 3355 on November 19, 1993, it authorized that \n$22.268 billion, the anticipated savings from reductions in the Federal \nwork force, be placed in a segregated trust fund over 5 years. This \nmoney was to be used only for crime fighting programs authorized in the \ncrime bill. Moreover, discretionary spending cap reductions were \nincluded to ensure that the creation of this trust fund would not \nincrease the budget deficit.\n  Now, let me take a minute to remind my colleagues what happened to \nthe trust fund provision before it returned to the Senate as a part of \nthe conference report on the crime bill.\n  This chart shows it. ``The Crime Bill Trust Fund Social Spending \nSpigot'' is what this particular chart is called. It shows the \nadditions to the crime bill, as originally passed, both by the Senate \nand as enacted. When we got through with the Senate, we had added the \nOunce of Prevention Council, $75 million; community schools, $400 \nmillion; National Community Economic Partnership, $40 million; local \ncrime prevention block grants $391 million; $300 million for drug \ntreatment in State prisons; $900 million more for drug treatment, which \nsome of our colleagues were not all that enthusiastic about but we \nagreed to. By the time it got through the House and through the \nconference committee, look at how that increased. It jumped from $2.186 \nbillion in social spending to $5.390 billion, and we had things in \nthere like the FACES Program; the Local Partnership Act, which is just \na gift to the cities without any restraints whatsoever; the model \nintensive grants program.\n  I could go through each one of those and explain how hardly any of \nthe money would go to fight crime. Look at the assistance for at-risk \nyouth; $3 million for urban recreation and at-risk youth, community-\nbased justice grants, drug treatment of Federal prison and police \nrecruitment grants.\n  Look at how everything else jumped, too. These add-ons in the Senate \nall jumped again, this time immeasurably, like this one from $75 \nmillion jumped; this one for community schools, $400 million to $566 \nmillion; National Community Economic Partnership from $40 million to \n$271 million. Local crime prevention block grants actually went down. I \nhave to give credit for that. And then the others, of course, we have a \nnumber of programs that were not even in the mix.\n  This is precisely why we need a balanced budget amendment. Somewhere \nbetween the Senate and the House of Representatives we went from $2.168 \nbillion in add-ons, to $5.390 billion in what was really characterized \nas absolute pork barrel spending.\n  Really, the Local Partnership Act was a provision--this right here, \nthe Local Partnership Act--$1.622 billion was a thinly disguised \nretread of the \n[[Page S3020]] President's failed economic stimulus bill from the \nprevious years. Proponents threw in the catchy phrase ``to prevent \ncrime'' a few times, and, thus, managed to expropriate $1.6 billion in \ncrime control funding for education, substance abuse treatment, jobs \nprograms to ``prevent crime.''\n  The Model Intensive Grant Program, right here, for $625 million was \nto be directed by the Attorney General to fund up to 15 model programs \nfor crime prevention in chronic, high-intensive crime areas.\n  The criteria for the programs were very general, allowing recipients \nto spend money on virtually anything, so long as the applicant for the \nfunds claims the spending is linked to crime control, no matter how \ntenuous the link. This includes spending on ``deterioration or lack of \npublic facilities,'' inadequate public facilities such as public \ntransportation, as well as unemployment services and drug treatment.\n  I could go through all of the rest. There are some perfect examples \nhere of how much we jumped the bill from $2.186 billion to $5.390 \nbillion. These are excesses that we pointed out, that I think made a \ndifference in the last election.\n  My point is this: I know that the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is sincere. I know that he is well-intentioned here. If we \ncreate a loophole like this in the name of trying to solve violent \ncrime, we are not doing any better than we were before. We have shown \nyou that, frankly, Congress is not serious about keeping spending under \ncontrol. We are going to spend our country right directly into \nbankruptcy. To jump $2.186 billion, after both Senator Biden, the \nleading Democrat in the Senate, and I put our names on that bill--that \nbill would have passed overwhelmingly through both bodies. Then, by the \ntime it went to the House it was larded up like never before. That is \nthe reason to have a balanced budget amendment.\n  The violent crime reduction trust fund created an irresponsible \nincentive to redefine programs with no clear relationship to crime \nfighting as anticrime measures in order to secure funding for them \nunder this trust fund.\n  By my count, the violent crime reduction trust fund became a magnet \nfor at least 16 social spending programs, as shown by this chart. \nIndeed, this understates the record, because some of the worst \nboondoggles were collapsed into the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant \nProgram. And as the chart also shows, an additional $3.2 billion was \nauthorized to be spent out of the trust fund to pay for these programs \nin addition to the $5.390 billion.\n  How much more tempting is it going to be for Congress to convert \npopular spending programs into anticrime measures when such a \ndefinition is the only way in which to avoid the tough choices required \nby the balanced budget amendment? This exemption will create a \nconstitutional shell game.\n  The example of the violent crime reduction trust fund amply \ndemonstrates that when Congress is given an easy loophole to pass \npopular-sounding programs, it takes it. This is not a partisan \naccusation; it is an unfortunate fact of congressional life. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this loophole for spending under the guise of law \nenforcement, and the reduction and prevention of violent crime. This \namendment is not about crime control, and the American people deserve \nbetter.\n  We talk about law enforcement. We talk about civil law enforcement as \nwell as criminal law enforcement. Those terms are not defined in the \namendment. The ``reduction and prevention of violent crime.'' What does \nthat mean? When is there a violent crime? We all know one when we see \none. But on the other hand there are a number of other things that are \ncalled violent crime that we may think are not so violent. There are a \nlot of issues that are really not addressed by this loophole that would \nbe created here.\n  What does my colleague intend to bring within the definition of ``law \nenforcement''? Does he include spending for enforcement of our civil \nlaws? If he says yes, then every Federal agency which has civil \njurisdiction could be exempt; HHS, Education, et cetera. If he says no \nto it, then perhaps my colleague should have drafted the amendment to \nbe a little more specific.\n  What does my colleague from West Virginia intend to include within \nthe definition of ``the reduction and prevention of violent crime''? \nDoes he mean to include the programs contained in the 1994 crime bill? \nThese programs right here? These are just some of them. Does he mean \nall of these or does he mean a whole raft of others? If so, then I \nassume he means to include the job training programs. There are 163 of \nthose. Will they all be exempt from the balanced budget amendment? \nThere are 163 actually currently administered by 15 departments at a \ncost of $20 billion annually; almost $25 billion, if the truth is \nknown. Is that all going to be exempt from a balanced budget amendment?\n  What does my colleague mean when he proposes to place in the \nConstitution a special carve-out for spending on the ``prevention of \nviolent crime''? Does this include the amount spent to restore civil \norder to Haiti? Does DOD spending on interdiction fall within this \nexception? If it does, then all of these are loopholes through which \nthey could drive anything.\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will vote down this \namendment. I know my colleague means well. But we are talking about the \nConstitution and we cannot afford to do this. So I hope that we can \nvote this down.\n  I know the time is up.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope that Senators will reject the tabling \nmotion. This amendment will exempt spending for law enforcement and for \nreducing and preventing violent crimes from the requirements of this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I call up my amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for herself, \n     Mr. Ford, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bumpers, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, and \n     Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 274.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following: ``That the following article is proposed as an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States which \n     shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the \n     Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-\n     fourths of the several States within seven years after the \n     date of its submission to the States for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1.

Mr. President, this amendment is a substitute \namendment. Essentially, it is the balanced budget amendment as \npresented with Social Security excluded using the exact language of the \nReid amendment. It is word for word the original balanced budget \namendment excluding Social Security.\n  It is cosponsored by Senators Ford, Hollings, McCain, Bumpers, \nMikulski, Harkin, Kohl, Daschle, Reid, and Dorgan.\n  Mr. President, I believe this substitute amendment plays a pivotal \nrole as a vehicle to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  We hope to debate it further and take the vote on this on Tuesday.\n  Let me just point out that as it currently stands, the balanced \nbudget amendment essentially would utilize about $705 billion of FICA \ntax revenues--those are taxes paid for retirement--for purposes of \nmasking the debt and balancing the budget. Many of us do not believe \nthis is right. We do not believe it is morally right, and we do not \nbelieve it is ethically right.\n  The only way to protect Social Security, to keep it out of the \nbalanced budget amendment, is by exempting it through this substitute \nconstitutional amendment. As I previously stated, the exact words of \nthe Reid amendment are included and incorporated within this substitute \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  We will be speaking and arguing further for it, I hope, on Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the \namendment is temporarily set aside and the Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 291\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 291.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 8, after ``principal.'' insert ``The \n     receipts and outlays of the Tennessee Valley Authority shall \n     not be counted as receipts or outlays for purposes of this \n     article.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is fairly \nstraightforward.\n  Last week, Mr. President, we had a debate and a vote on a motion I \nproposed which would have had the effect of nullifying the provisions \nof the committee report to the Judiciary Committee which created a \nspecial exemption for the Tennessee Valley Authority Power Program. The \nTVA was the only Federal program mentioned in the entire committee \nreport that was given this kind of special treatment.\n  Although we did not prevail, my motion received bipartisan support. \nSince that time, a number of Members have come up to me and told me \nthat it was right to pursue what I like to call this constitutional \npork. Members who were both for and against the balanced budget \namendment appear to have been taken aback at the audacity of the TVA \nsupporters to insert this kind of provision into the actual legislative \nhistory of the constitutional amendment.\n  A number of organizations supporting the balanced budget amendment, \nsuch as the National Taxpayers Union, the Concord Coalition, and the \nCitizens Against Government Waste have also indicated that they did not \nagree with the idea of placing this language in the committee report \nfor only one special program. Some said it was just plain wrong to do \nit.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, I recognize that the proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment are determined that no amendments or motions, \nwith the exception of the Dole second-degree amendment with respect to \nSocial Security and the right-to-know amendment, would be adopted. That \nhas been an open goal that has been achieved thus far.\n  Mr. President, what I propose to do is to offer this amendment which \ntracks the language that was placed in the committee report that \nexempted TVA from the balanced budget amendment and then urge that my \namendment be rejected. In other words, this is an opportunity for the \nSenate now to go on record to oppose this special treatment provided \nfor the TVA in the committee report and, at the same time, in no way \nwould disturb the balanced budget amendment itself. The Senate would \nsimply go on record showing that we do not want this kind of protection \nguaranteed for one program and not others.\n  By offering this amendment and asking that it be rejected, the entire \nSenate would have the opportunity to reject the committee language and \ntherefore nullify its impact as legislative history when the courts get \naround to interpreting the balanced budget amendment and, for that \nmatter, when this Congress or future Congresses get around to balancing \nthe budget.\n  So, Mr. President, our action to reject this amendment does not \nanswer the question of whether TVA should have any of its subsidies cut \nwhen the Congress gets around to try to achieve a balanced budget \namendment. What it does say, and all it says, is that the TVA should be \non the table just like every other Federal program, including Social \nSecurity, which, at this point, is still on the table.\n  If Congress decides, as some TVA proponents claim and as is stated in \nthe language of the committee report, that the electric Power Program \nis paid for entirely by the ratepayers, then Congress can act \naccordingly at that time. If they win that argument, so be it.\n  If, however, Congress decides that the appropriations to TVA for its \nstewardship program is subsidizing its Power Program, or if Congress \ndecides that the TVA ought to pay for the overhead cost of selling its \ndebt obligation and low-interest loans, or if Congress decides there is \nsome other inappropriate subsidy, then it will be free to make those \ndecisions.\n  The point is, these are issues that Congress needs to decide, not as \na part of the process of proposing a balanced budget amendment, but as \na part of the process of making the tough choices. These options should \nnot be curtailed or limited because the TVA proponents have been \nsuccessful in slipping favorable language into the committee report at \nan earlier stage.\n  Mr. President, yesterday morning, as we went into session, I had a \nchance to hear Chairman Hatch resume the debate on the balanced budget \namendment. This is what the chairman said the principal justification \nfor the balanced budget would be. He said, ``The balanced budget \namendment would introduce an element of competition into the spending \nprocess;'' that every program would have to compete. He said programs \nwill not be allowed to simply show that they by themselves are \nmeritorious, but they are going to have to show they are meritorious in \nthe context of the whole budget picture. He said it will not be enough \nfor a program just to show that it is worthy, but that it has to be \nworthy compared in the context of the whole; that it actually is a \npriority item.\n  It was this very rhetoric, Mr. President, that encouraged me to \nreturn to this subject and to make sure that the Senate as a whole is \nclear about its intent on this matter and not just let it be decided by \nsome committee language which the courts would feel constrained to \nrespect.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there may be some on the other side \nof this issue who will argue that the Senate's rejection of this \namendment should not be interpreted as rejecting the committee report \nlanguage, but rather simply an expression of the view that the language \nreferring to the TVA should not be in the Constitution itself.\n   [[Page S3023]] Mr. President, just so the legislative history is \nclear on the issue, I am the author of this amendment and the intent of \nthe author of the amendment is crystal clear. The TVA should not have a \nspecial status carved out for it under the balanced budget amendment. I \nam seeking to have the Senate reject this amendment so the full Senate \ncan go on record as saying that TVA, like other programs, is going to \nbe on the table when Congress starts cutting Federal subsidies to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  Notwithstanding what other statements the proponents of the language \ninserted in the committee report may make, the author of the amendment \nintends the vote to serve as a repudiation of the notion that the TVA \nhas some special protected status. And I trust that those who seek to \nuse legislative history as a guide in interpreting the amendment, \nshould it be ratified, will give due weight to the author of the \namendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur in relation to the amendment No. 274 on Tuesday, February 28, at \n2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nvote occur in relation to amendment No. 291 on Tuesday, February 28, in \nthe stacked sequence to begin at 2:15 p.m., and that the pending motion \nto table be vitiated and Senator Dorgan be recognized to move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President it is my intention to move to table \namendment 291.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, with his motion to \ntable, is his intent the same as my intent on the previous motion to \ntable, which is to make it clear that the Senate does not seek to \nexempt the Tennessee Valley Authority from the balanced budget \namendment and to override the committee language to that effect?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator states it correctly; that is exactly the \nintent of my motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur on Tuesday under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the parliamentary procedure is that there is \ntime for debate or discussion of the amendment just moved to be tabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore time has expired, so debate can be \non any topic at this particular time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask recognition then, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is to be \ncommended for his efforts on this issue. He cares about it deeply, and \nI understand that. Furthermore, he has used a unique parliamentary \nsituation in an attempt to achieve the outcome that he desires. \nUnfortunately for him and fortunately for me and for the other \nsupporters of the TVA exemption, he has come close but has not \nsucceeded in his quest. For reasons that I will go into in a minute, \nhis amendment simply will not work.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has proposed through four different \namendments to change the legislative history on this particular matter. \nBecause he is reasonably confident that the supporters of the balanced \nbudget amendment will vote down the motion that he proposes, the Senate \nwill have gone on record as being opposed to excluding TVA or like \nagencies from the balanced budget amendment.\n  He has gone on record as saying he will vote to table his own \namendment, from which he now has backed up and had a neutral Senator, \nso-called neutral Senator, come in and move to table.\n  For an answer to why he would do such a thing, let us look at the \namendments he proposes. Each amendment would add the following sentence \nto the end of section 7 which otherwise describes House Joint \nResolution 1 as covering all receipts and all outlays of the United \nStates except borrowings. Amendments 291 and 292 are identical and they \nsay:\n\n       The receipts and outlays of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     shall not be counted as receipts and outlays for the purpose \n     of this article.\n\n  Amendments 293 and 294 are identical, and I quote:\n\n       The receipts and outlays of all quasi-Federal agencies \n     created under authority of Acts of Congress shall not be \n     counted as receipts and outlays for the purposes of this \n     article.\n\n  Each amendment would have the effect of creating an exemption to the \ngeneral coverage language of House Joint Resolution 1. Nos. 291 and 292 \nwould exempt all receipts and outlays of TVA; 293 and 294 would exempt \nall receipts and outlays of quasi-Federal agencies.\n  All of the Feingold amendments are broader than the scope of the \nlegislative history contained in the Judiciary Committee's report.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me repeat that. We are talking about \ndeveloping legislative history here. All of the Feingold amendments are \nbroader--broader--than the scope of the legislative history contained \nin the Judiciary Committee's report and extend its exemption to funds \nfor which no exemption justification has been provided. That is the \nfact.\n  Amendments numbered 291 and 292 would exempt all funds of TVA.\n   TVA operates with two distinctly different kinds of funds. Let me \nrepeat that. TVA operates with two distinctly different kinds of funds. \nIt receives appropriations from Congress to cover its nonpower \nprograms. These are like funds received by all other Federal agencies \nand there is no reason why they should be specifically exempted. The \nfunds of TVA's electric power program are an entirely different matter \nand it was only these funds to which the committee's legislative \nhistory was directed. The legislative history of the committee was \ndirected only at the electric power program.\n\n  You can hear all you want to hear and you can say all you want to \nsay, but the committee legislative history is very, very narrow. \nAmendments Nos. 293 and 294 would expand the exemption to all funds. \nThat is the Senator's amendment, now, of quasi-Federal agencies. First \nthe term quasi-Federal agency has no meaning, absolutely no meaning. It \nis only a phrase, loosely used to refer to agencies which in some way \nor another may not fit the speaker's view of what is an ordinary \nFederal agency. Moreover, the term does not address the more important \nissue of how the agency is financed. Even an agency which might be \nregarded as quasi-Federal may have certain funds \n[[Page S3024]]  which should not be exempted from the balanced budget \namendment. As noted above, TVA itself is an example of two separate \nfunds, one from the utility, the ratepayers, and the other one that is \nappropriated by the Congress.\n  Do any of the amendments have merit? Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 \nwould have merit if their inserted sentence were modified to read as \nfollows: The receipts and outlays of the electric power program of the \nTennessee Valley Authority shall not be counted as receipts and outlays \nfor the purpose of this article.\n  As so modified, they would expressly state the intent of the language \ncontained in the Judiciary Committee's report.\n  The Feingold amendments as currently written could be defeated while \nstill reaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the \ncommittee report. The Feingold amendments can be defeated while still \nreaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the committee \nreport.\n  I do not know how many judges are going to be looking at the \nlegislative history and see the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, \ndid not move and was not allowed to move to table these amendments. I \nhope I have that much authority that, boy, they will see whether \nSenator Ford moved to table or not. But, boy, that is great. You have a \nlot of influence, want to influence the court--legislative decisions in \nthe future. It is right interesting procedure.\n  The Feingold amendments as currently written could be defeated while \nstill reaffirming the meaning of the legislative history in the \ncommittee report.\n  Amendments Nos. 293 and 294 certainly should not be adopted. The term \nquasi-Federal agency has no clear meaning. I want to reinforce that. \nThese amendments would make open-ended exemptions for an uncertain \ngroup of Federal agencies--an uncertain group--regardless of their \nbudget impact on the taxpayers.\n  Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 also should not be adopted since they \nwould exempt all TVA programs, not just the one program, the power \nprogram, for which an exemption makes sense. Indeed, the amendments \nappear to be a somewhat disingenuous attempt to get supporters of the \nbalanced budget amendment to back an exemption for ordinary \nappropriations-funded programs. In contrast, the language of the \nJudiciary Committee makes it very, very clear--a clear distinction \nbetween those two entirely different kinds of programs.\n  Let us look at why the TVA power program should be exempted. The TVA \npower program is financially independent from the rest of Government. \nJust take that one sentence. The TVA power program is financially \nindependent from the rest of Government. It survives only on the \nrevenues it receives from sales of electric power. Those revenues \nsupply the funds to pay its expenses. Those revenues are also the only \nsecurity for power program borrowing. Take those two things and look at \nthem very closely and think about them very closely. It survives only \non revenue it receives, and the revenue it receives pays its expenses \nand is the only security for the funds it borrows.\n  Power bonds are, by law, neither obligations of nor guaranteed by the \nU.S. Government. Power bonds are, by law, neither obligations of nor \nguaranteed by the U.S. Government. Taxpayer funds are not used for the \npower program. Even capital and operating expenses for TVA's \nmultipurpose dams are allocated to power and nonpower, and the power \nprogram pays its share.\n  TVA power program activity is not driven by Presidential or \ncongressional policy decisions. It is driven only by the needs of the 8 \nmillion persons and businesses who rely on it as their sole source of \nelectric power. Its annual receipts and its expenditures are governed \nonly by what is necessary to meet their electric power needs, both \ntoday and in the future. Although the power program's annual budget is \nincluded in the President's and the congressional budgets, its \ninclusion is for information purposes only. It does not require \ncongressional approval or congressional action. In other words, the TVA \npower program budget is a budget estimate. It is not a budget request.\n  Another way of looking at why the TVA power program should be exempt \nis to examine what could happen if it were not exempt. A low tax \ncollection year or one in which entitlements or appropriations were \nlarge could result in TVA's being unable to borrow the funds necessary \nto build or maintain generating plants to ensure a continued supply of \nelectric power to a large area of this country, in spite of the fact \nthat taxpayers are not responsible for paying off these bonds.\n  Finally, as Congress seeks to reduce Federal mandates, should it add \na new mandate for persons in one region of the country who happen to \nreceive their electric power without a taxpayer subsidy from TVA? It \nmakes as much sense for Congress to control Wisconsin Electric's annual \nbudget as it does to control that of the TVA power program.\n  Let us look at the difference now between this proposal and Social \nSecurity. The level of Social Security receipts is determined by a \nCongress-approved tax rate. The level of Social Security outlays are a \nfunction of a Congress-approved benefits scheme. In contrast, TVA's \npower program budget is provided to Congress each year for \ninformational purposes only. It does not require congressional approval \nor action.\n  So, in conclusion, I and other supporters of the TVA exemption are \nvoting to table this amendment, not because it would reaffirm the \nreport language, but because this amendment goes too far. It goes way \nbeyond the scope of the Judiciary Committee statement about TVA. Some \nparts of TVA are like all other Federal agencies and should be included \nin the budget just as any other, and we do not object to that. However, \nas I have stated previously, the funds of TVA's electric power program \nare an entirely different matter, and it was only those funds to which \nthe committee's statement was directed and that is the committee \nlegislative language.\n  For these reasons, and these reasons alone, I am voting to table the \namendment by my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think at the outset it is appropriate \nto state that what we are dealing with here is a straw man. An attempt \nis being made to make it appear that a Government spending program is \nbeing exempted from the balanced budget amendment. Of course, everyone \nunderstands that--with the statute that we are dealing with and with \nthe language that they are dealing with--that is not the case. Now we \nare arguing among ourselves as to who gets to beat up the straw man \nfirst and who gets to put the first wound on him and the straw man that \nwe all know is going to be defeated. That is the process that we are \ninvolving ourselves here in this historic moment when we are trying to \naddress the real issues concerning a balanced budget amendment. It is \nunfortunate but true.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from Wisconsin has now \noffered an amendment which he wants to have defeated. I am happy to \nlend my assistance. I believe we have now reached an illogical \nextension of this debate by some of those who oppose the balanced \nbudget amendment. In an attempt to defeat the balanced budget \namendment, amendments are now being offered that even their sponsors \nwant defeated.\n  After failing a few days ago to exclude language from the committee \nreport, the Senator from Wisconsin now proposes to include the language \nin the Constitution of the United States with yet another amendment. I \nfind this strange even by Washington, DC standards. If as much effort \nhad gone into balancing the budget over the last few years as has gone \ninto this exercise, we would not need the balanced budget amendment.\n  In the lowest courts of record of this Nation, involving the most \ninsignificant boundary line dispute or intersection fender bender, one \nwho submits a pleading attests that it is made in good faith and that \nthere is reason to believe that there is merit in the matter that is \nbeing asserted. Apparently, that rule does not apply when it comes to \noffering an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  [[Page S3025]] We are debating and will soon be voting on one of the \nmost important matters to ever come before this Congress, and \namendments such as these trivialize this process. While there is no \nlogic to this maneuvering, the purpose is clear--to hamstring and \ndefeat the last clear chance we have in this country to develop some \nfiscal responsibility in our governing process. The purpose of such \namendments is first and last to defeat the balanced budget amendment. \nSuch amendments are not designed to ensure that spending projects are \ncovered by the balanced budget amendment. Rather they are designed to \nensure that no spending program whatsoever is restrained by a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  As I understand it, what brought about this momentous issue was \nlanguage in the Senate Judiciary Committee report which stated:\n\n       Among the federal programs that would not be covered by \n     S.J. Res. 1 is the Electric Power Program of the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority.\n\n  Of course, what has not been publicized very much is the following \nlanguage; the next sentence in that report, as a matter of fact. It \npoints out that since 1959 the financing of that program has been the \nsole responsibility of its own electric ratepayers, not the U.S. \nTreasury and the Nation's taxpayers. Consequently, the receipts and \noutlays of that program are not a part of the problem that Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is directed to solving.\n  This language, of course, states the obvious. The financing of the \nTVA power program is done by the electric ratepayers. There is no \noutlay of Federal funds with regard to this program. If the TVA power \nprogram runs short, the TVA ratepayers must make up the difference. The \nTVA does not operate like Amtrak or the Postal Corporation where \nFederal taxpayers pay the difference between receipts and outlays. The \nJudiciary Committee report language does not make the Federal taxpayer \nresponsible for the TVA power program. It simply restates what has been \ntrue since 1959 when the TVA power program became exclusively \nresponsible for its own receipts and outlays.\n  Now as I understand it, the Feingold amendment tracks the committee \nreport language to an extent. The Senator from Wisconsin is apparently \nunder the impression that by offering his language and having it voted \ndown, it will in some way negate this legislative history. Of course, \nit will not.\n  In the first place, the Senator's language covers receipts and \noutlays of all TVA activities, including its nonpower activities. These \nhave always been on budget and are covered by the balanced budget \namendment, as they should be. Therefore, the Senator's language is much \nbroader then the committee report language. And voting down the \nSenator's language which includes TVA's nonpower activities will in no \nway affect the legislative history that pertains only to the power \nprogram.\n  However, even if the proposed amendment tracked the committee report \nlanguage exactly, it would still be of no effect because, again, the \nreport language simply states the fact that there are no Federal \noutlays with regard to the TVA power program. Thus it along with some \nother programs, is not covered by the constitutional amendment. If the \nSenator is under the impression that a decision by this body not to \nmake such a clearly inappropriate matter a part of the Constitution of \nthe United States of America in some way changes the facts contained in \nthe language, then I submit that he is again sadly mistaken. By the \nsame token, if someone proposed an amendment enshrining the law of \ngravity into the Constitution and it were voted down as inappropriate, \nobjects would still fall to the floor when dropped.\n  Therefore, since the adoption of the Feingold amendment would have \nthe effect of taking the TVA nonpower program off budget, and since the \ndefeat of the Feingold amendment would have none of the significance \nits sponsor wants to attribute to it, I join the Senator from Wisconsin \nin urging the defeat of his own amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me express my pleasure to the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Tennessee for supporting in \neffect my motion to table and the motion to table of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. That is exactly what I had hoped they would indicate. I \nbelieve that the only reason we are having this discussion at this \npoint is quite simply that somebody pulled a fast one here in the \ncommittee and now we are out on the floor actually discussing it.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. For a question.\n  Mr. FORD. Is the Senator aware that every amendment to the \nConstitution--this is not an accident--that TVA power was included; \nthat the same statement has been in every committee report that the \nJudiciary Committee has issued on a balanced budget amendment in the \nlast 10 years?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be happy to yield for the question.\n  Mr. FORD. That is the question. Was he aware of the fact?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am aware of the fact, and I told the Senator from \nKentucky that I just got here 2 years ago. And, yes, I confess I did \nnot discover this language until this year. I did not find this little \ncaper in there until now.\n  Mr. FORD. It is no caper.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Had I been here 10 years ago, maybe it would have taken \nme 3 or 4 years to find it. But there it is. I wish I had found it last \nyear. But fortunately I have had an opportunity to join the Judiciary \nCommittee now, and my staff had more of a chance to find these things. \nWe found it. It is time to get rid of it.\n  Mr. President, there was an effort here to try to undo the real \nintent of the balanced budget amendment. There is an attempt, a classic \nattempt, to abrogate, to say you are for the balanced budget amendment, \nbut say, of course, that it does not apply to my State, to my program. \nI think there is not a reasonable person who would not agree that this \nis part of the problem. It is always easy to support cuts if it does \nnot affect your own home State.\n  However, this notion of actually putting the exemption into the \nConstitution, which my opponents on this are being very candid about \nnow--they are saying that is exactly what you are trying to do--is \nsomething new. The other side is trying to exempt TVA. It is not just \nidle talk. The purpose of the committee language is to exempt it. That \nis why they are trying to make this distinction between my motion to \ntable and committee language.\n  But it is not working because everyone knows what the intent is of \nthe people who put it in there. And everybody knows what my intent is. \nIt is laid on the record. In fact, Mr. President, today in the \nWashington Post, there is an editorial entitled ``Constitutional \nPork.'' It is all about this problem, this committee language.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Washington Post, \ndated February 23, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 1995]\n\n                          Constitutional Pork\n\n       Tucked away in the Senate committee report on the balanced \n     budget amendment are three sentences about the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority, the most important of which reads: ``Among \n     the Federal programs that would not be covered by S.J. Res. 1 \n     is the electric power program of the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority.''\n       What that means is that assuming the courts follow \n     legislative intent, the Tennessee Valley Authority--which \n     provides power to the people of the south-central states--\n     would have the distinction of being the one agency excluded \n     from the impact of the balanced budget amendment. The \n     rationale for this, offered by Sens. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) \n     and Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), is that, as Mr. Thompson put it, \n     ``the financing of the TVA power program has been the sole \n     responsibility of its electric rate payers, not the U.S. \n     Treasury and the nation's taxpayers.''\n       Not exactly, says Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who is \n     trying to eliminate the TVA protection. Mr. Feingold notes a \n     1994 Congressional Budget Office study which estimated that \n     raising the rates paid by TVA users to cover various costs \n     associated with land and water management in its system could \n     cut federal outlays by as much as $70 million annually. ``TVA \n     supporters know that TVA is on the short list of most deficit \n     reduction advocates,'' Mr. Feingold declares, ``and that is \n     why they want to provide it with special protection that no \n     other program of any kind in the federal government is \n     getting.''\n       [[Page S3026]] Mr. Feingold surely has the better of this \n     argument. If TVA is in no way either part of the deficit \n     problem or potentially part of the solution, why do Sens. \n     Heflin and Thompson need to insist on special language \n     protecting the program? And if TVA is indeed a drain, then \n     the two senators and their colleagues in the region should \n     not be given free passes to tell their constituents that they \n     voted for a balanced budget amendment and protected the TVA. \n     If they really think the balanced budget amendment is such a \n     good idea, they should be willing to vote for it without this \n     provision, which Mr. Feingold refers to as ``constitutional \n     pork.''\n       Mr. Feingold lost a vote last week on a motion to strip the \n     language in the committee report protecting TVA, though he \n     won significant Republican support. Now he plans to try to \n     call the bluff of his opponents by proposing to add specific \n     language to the amendment protecting the TVA. His hope is \n     that most senators will be too embarrassed to do directly in \n     the text of a constitutional amendment what they tried to do \n     in slippery fashion in the committee report. If the Senate \n     refused to include the TVA protection in the amendment, this \n     would create a different ``legislative history'' and \n     discourage courts forced to deal with the budget amendment in \n     the future from giving TVA priority over other programs.\n       The entire episode, as Mr. Feingold notes, underscores the \n     folly of trying to deal with budget issues through a \n     constitutional amendment. A balanced budget amendment could \n     move the most basic of legislative questions (such as the \n     future of the TVA) out of the legislative process and into \n     the judiciary, which is exactly where they don't belong. The \n     Senate should surely give no special protections to the TVA. \n     Just as surely, it should vote the balanced budget amendment \n     down.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, fortunately this editorial lays out \nexactly the intent, my intent, the intent of the Senator from North \nDakota, and that is to undo, explicitly undo, what was done in the \ncommittee; to say that the Senate as a whole would table such language \nthat would have the effect of exempting either all or part of the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky indicated that I had put \nfour amendments in for possible introduction as amendments, and that is \ncorrect. But I have chosen one amendment and that amendment is this \none. It is the one that, by its rejection, overrides the language of \nthe committee report. It would have the effect of overriding the \ncommittee report by tabling the very language from the committee \nreport. That is the purpose of amendment No. 291.\n  It is not a disingenuous attempt. It is the only way I could think of \nto override the effect of this committee report which the members did \nnot explicitly consider.\n  Everybody should understand there was not a point in the process of \nthe consideration of the balanced budget amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee where we all said, ``OK, let's decide if the TVA should be \nexempt or not.'' The whole process was done and the committee report \nwas written, and then it was thrown in there, presumably at the staff \nlevel. That is how it was done. And I guess that is the way it is done \nwhen it is business as usual, when you are trying to protect your own \npork but at the same time you are saying you are for a balanced budget. \nIt is a lot better to do it in a quiet staff room than it is to do it \nout on the floor of the Senate or even in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is what was done here.\n  I assure everyone who is looking at this what was done here was \nsomething people did not want us to know about.\n  My intent is not something any judge is ever going to have to wonder \nabout. The Senator from Kentucky says they are going to have to be able \nto read it and limit it some way. But I laid my intent right on the \nrecord. The purpose of the motion to table is to override the committee \nlanguage that seeks to exempt the TVA. Whether it seeks to exempt part \nof the TVA or all of the TVA or something in between, the intent of the \nmotion to table, as explicitly stated by the two Senators who have \nmoved to table, is to override the committee language. Now, I wonder \nhow a court will have any trouble figuring that out. Clearly, they know \nthe difference.\n  In fact, this is a very interesting proposition in terms of \nlegislative history. What is being suggested here is that, even if the \nU.S. Senate as a body explicitly votes to table certain language, the \ncourts are going to find the committee report to be more persuasive \nthan the rollcall vote of the Members of the U.S. Senate. I doubt it. I \nwould not bet the farm on that interpretation of legislative history. I \nthink you will find you will come up wanting with that approach.\n  So let us be clear. My intent and the whole purpose of this is to not \nallow a committee report to find its way into constitutional \ninterpretation or to exempt some or all of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority.\n  Let us get back to the real issue here. The real issue is: Why do I \nhave to even be out here at all? Only because something was attempted \nwhich no one would try to do out here on the floor, to exempt one \nparticular program from one particular area while everybody else has to \ncompete fairly.\n  So I am very happy about the way the record stands now. And I am a \nlot happier than I was when I did not have these two Senators \nsupporting me on the record to override the intent of the committee.\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few words about the other issue that \nhas been raised about this notion that somehow the TVA has nothing to \ndo with the Federal budget. That is what they are saying. This is a \ngreat deal, they say. We are making money on it, they say. It is a good \nthing for the Federal Government, which it may well be.\n  But the point is, there are an awful lot of people that think it is a \nloser or it is time to phase it out. It was a wonderful thing when \nFranklin Roosevelt brought this forth, and it really helped that area \nof the country during the Depression, but it is not open and shut at \nall that this program is a moneymaker for our country. In fact, an \nawful lot of people think it should be one of the top items for cuts. \nThat is what the National Taxpayers Union has said. That is what the \nCongressional Budget Office has said. That is what a number of pieces \nof legislation already introduced this session by Members of both \nparties and both Houses have said.\n  Let me read briefly from the ``CBO Reducing the Deficit: Spending and \nRevenue Options,'' March 1994.\n\n       Because many of TVA's stewardship activities are necessary \n     to maintain its power system, their costs would more \n     appropriately be borne by users of the power. . . Direct \n     costs to the Federal Government could be reduced by about $70 \n     million annually if the TVA were to increase power rates or \n     fees to cover costs of all stewardship activities. . .\n\n  A very different view than this view has been offered out here that \nsays it has nothing to do with Federal dollars.\n  Let me cite from the ``Department of Energy Federal Energy Subsidies: \nDirect and Indirect Interventions in Energy Markets,'' November 1992.\n\n       When compared with interest rates paid by investor-owned \n     utilities, the TVA is estimated to have benefited from a \n     subsidy of $231 million in FY 1990.\n\n  A few pages later, the report says:\n\n       Historically, TVA was granted subsidies in the form of low-\n     interest loans, debt forgiveness, and lower payments in lieu \n     of taxation.\n\n  In fiscal year 1988, TVA received a subsidy--a subsidy, Mr. \nPresident--of $661.9 million in the form of lower payments in lieu of \ntaxes, and that $661.9 million ``* * * can be counted as revenue losses \nto all levels of government.''\n  This is real money. It is almost up to the point where, as the former \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Dirksen, said, we are talking about real \nmoney from the Federal Government transferred away from our ability to \nbalance our budget.\n  The report also says, TVA\n\n       . . . Sells a large portion of its debt to the Federal \n     Financing Bank (FFB). . . . TVA's ability to access FFB acts \n     as a subsidy in two ways. First, TVA does not incur any \n     expenses to underwriters or marketing expense when it goes to \n     the FFB. Second, it obtains financing at lower interest rates \n     through the FFB.\n\n  So I will concede this to my friends on this issue, this is \ndebatable. Yes, it is debatable whether or not the Federal Government \nhas to pay out directly or indirectly to the TVA. But there is one \nthing that is clear and it is that at a very minimum it is debatable \nand that we cannot resolve it here today and that this is not the place \nto be resolving it.\n  Why are we resolving it today? Because certain Senators decided that \nthey should not have to go through that same scrutiny that all the rest \nof us do, which is that later on, whether we pass the balanced budget \namendment or not, we have to all get out here and fight and fight hard \nfor our own programs and our own home States.\n   [[Page S3027]] I see the Chair is from a dairy State. I am from a \ndairy State. Would it not be nice to have a constitutional exemption \nfor the dairy program? But that is not the way this process should \nwork, and we all know it. It is not fair. It is just not fair to exempt \none program and let everyone else in this country have to fight like \nheck to protect the hard-working people in their home States, all of \nwhom, I assure you, in every one of these 50 States, have arguments \njust as worthy.\n  So this attempt to enshrine this in the Constitution is one that is a \nbit of an embarrassment, it seems to me.\n  All I am trying to do here--and apparently we will prevail on this \nnow--is to just get rid of it. A mistake was made by trying to do this \nin the Judiciary Committee. We all make mistakes, and it is \nunderstandable, certainly not the most horrible thing that was ever \ndone around this place. But when you make a mistake, it is time to \nclean it up and correct it. Our motion to table cleans up the mistake \nand returns to a notion of fair play, whether the balanced budget \namendment passes or not.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess I am going to have to leave it to the \nfuture. We have to see if the balanced budget amendment passes. We have \nto see if it gets ratified. But some day maybe somebody will take a \nlook at this record, and I guess they are going to have to decide which \nside was playing games, which side was trying to pull a fast one, and \nwhich side was just trying to put everybody on the same playing field.\n  I am absolutely confident that when the courts look at this, when the \nCongress looks at this and, most importantly, when the American people \nlook at this, they will all conclude that one side was trying to have \ntheir cake and eat it, too--to pose for the holy picture and say you \nare balancing a Federal budget but to still keep the pork in your own \nback yard. That is an outrageous example of trying to have your cake \nand eat it, too. All we are trying to do is clean it up.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n                  Amendments Nos. 259 and 298, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to call up two amendments, \nNos. 259 and 298.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are you calling them up en bloc?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am calling them up en bloc, and I am going to debate \nboth of those amendments. Then I will ask for a rollcall vote on each \nof those amendments in that sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. GRAHAM] proposes amendments \n     en bloc numbered 259 and 298.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 259\n\n       On page 2, line 8, strike ``held by the public''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 298\n\n       On page 2, line 8, after ``increased,'' insert ``except for \n     increases in the limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public to reflect net redemptions from the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Would it be \nappropriate at this time to ask for the yeas and nays on amendments \nnumbered 259 and 298?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are pending. It would be appropriate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second at this \npoint. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the Senator called up his amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have called up the amendments 259 and 298. I have asked \nthey be voted on in sequence. I am now asking that that vote be by \nrecorded vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may, Mr. President, as I understand it, all \namendments will be voted on after 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table both amendments, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I asked for a rollcall on the yeas and \nnays on this, with the intention of then presenting a discussion on \nthese amendments.\n  I ask, if the Senator is going to ask for a tabling motion, that he \nwithhold until after we have had an opportunity to debate the two \namendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. I leave the motion to table there and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator be given more time if he needs to debate the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Are the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not understand what the Senator from \nUtah said. A motion to table normally shuts off all debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that we move to table both \namendments, and that debate continue after the motion to table, after \nreceiving the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is there agreement for time on this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I anticipate my presentation will take \napproximately 15 to 20 minutes, and I know the Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, wanted to ask some questions of my amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Finally, Mr. President, if I may ask the distinguished \nSenator from Utah how long are we planning to go tonight?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not much longer, as far as I am concerned. I think after \nthese two amendments, I will be happy to see if we could start to wind \ndown. I understand that there may be a Kennedy amendment that will be \noffered afterwards, and a Nunn amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wanted to offer an amendment following \nthe Senator from Florida with the idea that we could debate it for \nawhile, until we wanted to go out, and have it begin in the morning \nfirst thing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, that will be fine. I understand that \nSenator Kennedy has an amendment, and also Senator Nunn may have an \namendment. Any way we can work it out, I am happy. I am amenable to \nanything the Senator from Arkansas and his colleagues would like to do.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have no objection. We will discuss this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the two \nmotions to table the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry. Have motions to table--with the \nyeas and nays--been ordered on each of the amendments, all up to date?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered on the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment, as well.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Florida yield for a moment for a \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to offer \na motion for an amendment at the desk immediately following conclusion \nof the debate on the Graham amendment.\n  [[Page S3028]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There being \nno objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. We have ordered the \nyeas and nays on these two amendments, on motions to table amendments \nnumbered 259 and 298; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                       Amendments No. 259 and 298\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am offering these two amendments, both \nof which relate to section 2 of the proposed constitutional amendment, \nwhich is one of the most important, and I suggest, least understood \nprovisions in this constitutional amendment.\n  If I could, I would like to read the language of section 2. The very \nfact that it is the second section of this amendment, coming \nimmediately after the section which states the basic principle that the \nFederal Government shall balance its revenues and expenditures, is \nindicative of the importance which the authors of the amendment attach \nto section 2. I will discuss that further in a moment.\n  Section 2 reads as follows:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Within those words, constituting one sentence of the balanced budget \namendment, are a number of important policy considerations.\n  My amendments focus on one of those policy implications which \nconstitute just four words in the section. Those are the words ``held \nby the public.'' The requirement of a three-fifths vote of the whole \nnumber of each House is applied to raising the debt ceiling as it \nrelates to that debt held by the public.\n  I was curious as to what the rationale behind this provision of the \nsection was, so I sought as one source of clarification the book which \nhas been distributed to all Members of the Senate by the Congressional \nLeaders United For A Balanced Budget Amendment.\n  In that description, the following information is given relative to \nsection 2, and particularly the language ``held by the public.'' It \nstates that:\n\n       Because borrowing and increases in any limits on cumulative \n     borrowing must be enacted by law, section 2 makes the \n     amendment effectively self-enforcing.\n\n  So this is a very important section because it makes the rest of the \nbalanced budget amendment self-enforcing, self-enforcing by requiring a \nthree-fifths vote to raise the limit set by law for debt held by the \npublic.\n  The statement by the Congressional Leaders United for the Balanced \nBudget goes on to state that by lowering ``the blackmail threshold'' \nassociated with passage of the regular debt limit bill from 50 percent \nplus 1 in either body to 40 percent plus 1, section 2 increases the \nmotivation of the administration and the leadership, including the \nchairs of the relevant committees, to do whatever is necessary \nlegislatively and cooperatively, even to the point of balancing the \nbudget to avoid facing such a difficult debt vote.\n  So the purpose of this provision is to enforce the balanced budget \namendment and, two, to create a blackmail threshold at 40 percent plus \n1; that is, if 41 Senators refuse to go along with a proposal to raise \nthe limit on debt held by the public, that would be such an enforcement \nfigure that collectively we will do all that we can to avoid having to \nbe placed into that position. That is the rationale for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, as we commence this process of possibly placing this \nlanguage into the Constitution of the United States, let me provide, \nand I hope this is not excessively tedious, a little background \nregarding this statement of debt held by the public\n  The projection of the Congressional Budget Office is that the end of \nthis fiscal year, which will be September 30, 1995, the gross Federal \ndebt--all debt owed by the Federal Government--will be $4.942 trillion, \na shade less than $5 trillion. That debt can be divided in a number of \nways, but this amendment calls for it to be divided into two sectors.\n  One sector is debt held by the public, and these are some of the \nentities which constitute the public which holds the debt of the \nFederal Government: State and local governments happen to be the \nlargest public holder of the Federal debt. They hold $641 billion. \nForeign governments and private sources, $601 billion, and so forth \nthroughout this analysis.\n  The second sector of the national debt is debt held by Government \naccounts. These are the accounts that are not part of the debt held by \nthe public. These are primarily the trust funds of the Federal \nGovernment whose surpluses must be invested in Federal Treasury \nobligations.\n  The largest of those, of course, is Social Security, which has $488 \nbillion of debt of the Federal Government. We are going to talk \nextensively about that Social Security indebtedness.\n  All the other Federal Government accounts, which include primarily \nthose that are analogous to Social Security in that they are accounts \ndesigned to provide for the retirement of persons, for instance, Civil \nService is $346 billion; military retirement, $105 billion; and then \nothers of significance are Medicare, $150 billion, the Department of \nTransportation has $30 billion in its account, the unemployment \ncompensation account has $40 billion. Cumulative of all these other \naccounts, excluding Social Security, is $837 billion, or a total of \n$1.325 trillion are debts of the Federal Government which are not held \nby the public, but rather by one of these Government accounts.\n  With this background, I would like to talk about some of the policy \nimplications of restricting to a three-fifths vote only this portion of \nthe national debt. Under this amendment, it will take a three-fifths \nvote of the whole number of the Members of both Houses of Congress to \nraise the debt held by the public. The debt held by Government accounts \ncan be raised by the legislative majority which we currently utilize.\n  The last time we voted on increasing the national debt, which was in \nPublic Law 103-66 on August 10, 1993, we voted--and this is the \nlanguage in the statute, Mr. President--``to increase the public debt \nlimit,'' not debt held by the public, but the public debt limit. And we \nincreased it to $4.900 trillion. One fact that obviously creates is \nthat before the end of this fiscal year, we are going to have to raise \nthe debt limit because we are going to break the $4.900 trillion level \nprior to the end of this fiscal year.\n  As I turn to some of the policy implications of this section 2, I \nwould like to state a couple of assumptions that I am going to make so \nthat if anyone would like to engage in further discussion, they would \ndo so with those assumptions in mind and might wish to discuss them \nfurther.\n  The first is primarily because we do not have projections through the \nyear 2025 and beyond for these other Government accounts and, second, \nbecause although they are very significant, $837 billion, relative to \nthe scale of the policy issues we are going to be dealing with, they \nwill not substantially affect the policy considerations. To the degree \nthey do affect the policy considerations, as I will explain, they make \nthe concerns I am going to express even more serious. I am not focusing \non this component, the Federal debt structure. My comments are focused \non the Social Security borrowing.\n  And second, as the statement of the Congressional Leaders United for \na Balanced Budget indicates, I am assuming that the purpose of this \nthree-fifths vote is to make it very difficult to raise the amount of \ndebt held by the public; that the purpose of this is to create a \npolitical hydraulics that is going to make it difficult to raise debt \nheld by the public and make it relatively easier to raise debt held by \nGovernment accounts. That is clearly the purpose of the distinction \nthat has been made in this amendment.\n  So let us turn to what is going to be the implication of adopting a \nbalanced budget amendment with section 2 as it is currently written.\n  Where are we today? As this chart demonstrates, at the end of this \nfiscal year we will have a total debt of $4.942 trillion. Of that \namount, $488 billion is in the red zone, which is the Social Security \ntrust fund. Everything else, which is the debt held by the public, plus \nthe debt held by Government accounts other than Social Security, is in \nthe blue zone. That amount is $4.452 trillion.\n   [[Page S3029]] The constitutional amendment calls for us reaching a \ncritical date in the year 2002 when we are to come into balance. The \nprojection is that between now and the year 2002, we will increase the \nFederal debt by approximately $1 trillion. So, that when we reach the \nyear 2002, we will have a total national debt of $6 trillion. Of that \namount, the Social Security trust fund surpluses will be $1.40 trillion \nin the year 2002. Social Security will represent that much of the \nindebtedness. Everything else, including the debt held by the public, \nplus the non-Social Security Government accounts will be $4.96 \ntrillion.\n  If the purpose of this is to make it very difficult to raise the debt \nheld by the public, the debt held by the public will assumedly, \nessentially, stay at the same $4.96 trillion level from the year 2002. \nWe have gone out to year 2028.\n But since there is no restraint in this supermajority on borrowing \nfrom trust funds, and particularly from Social Security, which is the \ntrust fund that is going to be, of course, the one rising dramatically, \nwe are going to see the debt rise to $7.098 trillion by the year 2018. \nThis will occur when the surplus in the Social Security fund reaches \nits apex. We will be adding to the national debt under this amendment \nby a majority vote, an additional $2 trillion. I do not think that is \nwhat the public believes they are getting with this amendment, that \nthey are going to get an additional $1 trillion between now and 2002 \nand then $2 trillion between 2002 and 2018.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have been listening to the statement of the Senator from \nFlorida--and I have stated in the Chamber publicly on other occasions \nhow much I appreciate the Senator's excellent work on an amendment that \nwas offered regarding Social Security, but I have listened to the \nstatement the Senator has made today, and it seems to me--and this is a \nquestion I ask the Senator from Florida--would not a reasonable person \nassume that if Congress passes a balanced budget amendment, the \nnational debt would remain constant, at least not rise, because we \nwould assume the budget would be in balance?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, that is the difference between passing a cliche and \npassing an actual constitutional amendment. This constitutional \namendment I think virtually assures that we are going to have a \nnational debt of approximately $3 trillion over the next 20-plus years \nabove the national debt that we have today.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator further, would that be the difference \nbetween the amount of Social Security surplus and the normal debt, so-\ncalled normal debt?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely correct. This is the chart that \nshows what that Social Security surplus is going to be in each year \nfrom 1995 to the year 2029, when the Social Security trust fund is \nexhausted and is at zero.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend a further question. Let us assume in 2018, \nwhen the Social Security trust fund reserves begin to diminish--and \nthat is about the date I think the Senator has on the chart--what will \nbe the Government's options for meeting the contractual obligations it \nhas with the Social Security beneficiaries?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator asked a very salient question. I might say \nbefore answering, it is one of the reasons we should have adopted the \namendment the Senator offered last week because it would have \nsegregated Social Security and allowed us to focus on its problems, \nwhich are serious, without having it commingled with the rest of the \nFederal budget. But the amendment, unfortunately, was defeated so we \nare now locked into a situation in which we are going to continue to do \nwhat we are doing now, which is to use the Social Security surplus to \nmask the extent of our real deficit. We are going to be taking the \nsurplus of Social Security, not investing it in stocks, bonds, or other \nsecurities as would a traditional pension plan, including pension plans \nof State and local governments; we are going to be investing it in the \nFederal Government to finance our national debt.\n  As this chart indicates, by the year 2018 our national debt will be \n$7.098 trillion and Social Security will hold $3 trillion. Three-\neighths of our total national debt will be held by the Social Security \nsystem. The question is, what are we going to do when we get to the \npoint that Social Security begins to draw down that surplus? What we \nare going to do is either have to, first, dramatically cut spending for \nSocial Security benefits or other Federal programs in order to generate \nthe cash to pay for the Social Security redemptions; second, \ndramatically increase taxes to pay for the Social Security redemptions; \nthird, some combination; or, fourth, continue with borrowing, but now \nwe will have to be borrowing from debt held by the public because there \nwill not be a Social Security alternative to draw from.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend one further question. The Senator has \nstated on this floor on a previous occasion that the surpluses that \nwill be developed in the Social Security trust fund during the next 20-\nplus years is on purpose. Is that not right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The building of the surpluses, as the Senator from Nevada \ncorrectly states, is not as an aberration. We are doing this because \nthis more or less tracks the demographics of the U.S. population. \nDuring the period from now until about the year 2018 or 2019, when the \nnumber of people going into the Social Security system as a percentage \nof the total population is relatively low--I do not know what year the \nSenator was born in Searchlight, NV. Could he inform us of that?\n  Mr. REID. December 1939.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was born almost 3 years prior to the Senator from \nNevada. We were both born during a period of national depression. There \nwere not very many people being born in either Pennsuco, FL, or \nSearchlight, NV, in those years of the 1930's. So there are not a lot \nof Americans who have birth dates in the years in which we were born.\n  Conversely, I know the Senator has children who were born probably in \nthe 1960's. I have four of those children. There were large numbers of \npeople born in the period after World War II, in the 1940's, 1950's, \nand 1960's. Those folks are going to start retiring in about the year \n2019, and so instead of having a surplus, we are going to start to \nspend down the Social Security system and do it dramatically. In 10 \nyears, we will go from over $3 trillion of surplus to zero surplus in \nthe Social Security system. And we are going to have the challenge--not \nus individually, but our successors here and the citizens of this \ncountry--to calculate how to meet that enormous obligation under this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend an additional question. Why would an \namendment to balance the budget be placed in the Constitution while \nallowing the limit on the public debt to rise to the portions \nillustrated in the Senator's previous chart? That I do not understand.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And it runs exactly counter--the answer is I cannot \nanswer the question. I hope maybe some of those who are the authors \ncould explain why they have done this.\n  In the material that was distributed, it states, ``The purpose of \nthis section is to motivate an avoidance of deficits.'' That is a \ndirect quote from the materials distributed by Congressional Leadership \nUnited for a Balanced Budget.\n  The reality is that the opposite occurs. The national debt goes from \n$5 trillion today to $6 trillion. This is going to happen in almost any \nevent. But this is what is not necessary, and that is this dramatic \nincrease in the national debt from $6 trillion to $8 trillion that will \noccur roughly between the year 2002 and 2018, and which is virtually \nmandated by the structure of this balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. REID. So, if I understand the Senator correctly, the Senator, \nhaving been Governor of one of the largest States in the Union, having \nhandled billion-dollar budgets there, and having had the experience he \nhas had here--including being a member of the Finance Committee--the \nSenator cannot explain to me why the balanced budget amendment is \nwritten the way it is?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I cannot. And there is a way to solve this problem. This \nis not a conflict which is beyond our ability to resolve.\n  I suggest that the resolution is found in the amendment which is \ncurrently pending and that is the simple step of \n[[Page S3030]]  eliminating the phrase ``held by the public'' from the \nconstitutional amendment, so that the amendment will now read:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States shall not be \n     increased, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each \n     House shall provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall \n     vote.\n\n  What that will require is that there will be a three-fifths vote \nrequired to increase the national debt, whether it comes from debt held \nby the public or debt held by the Social Security trust fund.\n  With that approach you get a dramatically different structure of our \nNation's fiscal future. Going back to the assumptions that I started \nwith, which is that the whole purpose of the three-fifths vote, as \nstated by its authors, is to create a blackmail threshold that will \nmake it virtually impossible to raise the national debt, that would \nindicate we will move to the $6 trillion level between now and the year \n2002 when the constitutional amendment becomes operative. Then there \nwill be no increase in the national debt from the year 2002 into the \nindefinite future. We will plateau at $6 trillion.\n  The consequence is going to be that we will see the Social Security \ntrust fund continuing to generate substantial surpluses between now and \nthe year 2018, which will become a larger share of our total debt. But \nat the same time we will be buying down the debt held by the public. We \nwill be substituting Social Security indebtedness for debt held by the \npublic. We will be doing what I think the sponsors of this amendment \nwant to do. We will be releasing capital back into the country for \nproductive investment.\n  We will be making the Social Security system sound because we will \nnot be adding an enormous amount of debt, we will be stabilizing our \ndebt and placing us in a position after the year 2018 to do a graceful \nshift from Social Security back to debt held by the public and be able, \nby this borrowing from debt held by the public, to meet our Social \nSecurity obligations without the enormous tax or spending cuts that \nwill be required if we do not adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my friend yielding for the questions. He has \nbeen very lucid and straightforward in his answer.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will make these questions constructive, \nas I hope they will be, because I helped craft this amendment over the \nlast 5 to 6 years. We were faced with how do we deal with trust funds, \nbecause they are inside the budget, unique to Social Security. The law \nthat created the Social Security system does not allow the trust funds \nto be invested outside Government. That is the law of the land today. \nOf course I do not think--certainly not this Senator, possibly the \nSenator from Florida--does not believe the trust funds of Social \nSecurity should be put at risk out in the private marketplace.\n  What happens if you invest in stocks and bonds and they bottom out? \nWho comes back in and picks the system back up? That is a legitimate \nconcern. I think those who were here in the 1930's when the Social \nSecurity system was crafted had that in mind. That was their concern.\n  So here we were, faced with the situation of these revenues coming in \nas a result of the 1983 fix on Social Security, and having to deal with \nthem. The Senator and I are on the Board of Trustees of the Social \nSecurity system. There are no others. It is the Congress of the United \nStates that is pledged to keep this system solvent and secure for its \nrecipients. But in come the revenues and we borrow them. We are doing \nit today and even under the Senator's amendment we will do it tomorrow.\n  As a result of that understanding, as we crafted this amendment it \nwas our concern, knowing that, that we cut down on the other debt that \nis out there and accumulating, recognizing this was a debt owed--it was \na note owed so that is a debt, certainly--back to the trust funds of \nthe system. But at the same time, this Government is caught in the \ndilemma that they must use those moneys. Obviously that system cannot \nearn money if the money is not borrowed from it. So we just do not \ncollect it and set it off to the side and create a nonearning \nenvironment. We borrow it and pay back the going rate on the Treasury \nnote. That is a responsibility that we have. That is what this \namendment has in mind and why it was worded the way it was worded.\n  I must say, while I find the argument of the Senator from Florida \nintriguing, we ran this through the system a good many times over the \nlast 5 years to try to solve that problem, believing we have, and I am \nconvinced we have. So I am curious. I mean it in all good faith, how do \nyou deal with what the Senator is proposing? Obviously we are going to \nuse those moneys inside Government and they will be needed, they will \nbe owed at some time back to the trust fund.\n  I am the baby boomer in this debate right now, whereas our colleague \nfrom Searchlight was not. I am one of those people who was born in 1945 \nand I am in that group that is going to be in that peak. The Federal \nGovernment, by its commitment through the Social Security system--not \nSocial Security, the Federal Government--is going to guarantee that \nbecause they are taking the notes out at this moment and they must pay \nthem back. That is the way the system is structured under the law.\n  I find it confusing in this regard. Would we not have to change the \nlaw of Social Security that drives the system today to get to where we \nwant to get, or to where the Senator wants to get with his amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, absolutely not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Please help me there, then.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My amendment calls for the Social Security surpluses to \ncontinue to be invested in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to review a little of the history of how we \ngot to where we are and why I think that history makes this chart the \nlikely consequence of adopting the amendment in its current form. The \ndifference is that my amendment will call for a stabilization of total \nFederal debt because it will require a three-fifths vote to raise total \ndebt, not just the debt held by the public. And it will, therefore, \nforce public debt to be displaced by the growing amount of Social \nSecurity.\n  When Social Security was adopted, it utilized a pay-as-you-go \nfinancing mechanism. We took in an amount of money each year sufficient \nto meet that year's obligation. We did not have a surplus. This was a \nnonissue.\n  In the late 1970's people began to recognize that we had these \nterrific demographic shifts that were going to be occurring over the \nnext 30, 40 years because of the dramatically different birth rates in \ndifferent periods of American history. So one of the key changes made \nin the 1983 reforms was to go to a surplus structure for Social \nSecurity, thus producing this curve.\n  There was an implicit assumption in this surplus Social Security and \nthat was that we were going to be operating a balanced Federal budget \nfor the rest of our expenditures. The way we would be securing this \nsurplus money was we would be using it to reduce the amount of public \nindebtedness. This is the chart that the 1983 Social Security reform \nwas predicated upon, a balance and a cap on the total national debt and \na substitution of public debt for Social Security debt.\n  Then, beginning in the year 2018, without having added any debt in \nthis period, we would be in a position to go back to the public and \nsay: OK, now we have all these IOU's that the Social Security \nAdministration is holding. We need to cash them in order to get the \nrevenue to pay off the Social Security obligations to folks like our \nfriend, the Senator from Idaho. And, we will do so without putting any \nadditional strain on the Federal Government because we will not be \nincreasing the amount of debt service. We will just be shifting it from \nthe Social Security fund to debt held by non-Social Security entities.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. When you shift the debt from, in other words, that held by \nthe Social Security trust fund to the public, where do you get the \nmoney to cause the shift because you have money outgoing to the \nrecipient at that point? And we know that in this baby boomer scenario \nthat becomes a very rapid demand level on the trust fund system.\n   [[Page S3031]] Mr. GRAHAM. The way we intended to manage it, based \non the 1983 structure, was to go to the general public with Federal \nborrowings.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In other words, borrowing the money.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, in order to replace the money that we had previously \nborrowed from the Social Security fund. What worries me is in the \npurpose of this amendment, by putting a cap on debt held by the public \nwith a three-fifths vote, is to preclude that substitution. Then we are \ngoing to have a situation in which with no additional borrowing, \ncombined with a drawdown of the Social Security surplus from almost $3 \ntrillion to zero over a period of 10 years, the only way we can fill \nthis gap is by taxation or dramatic spending cuts.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the year 2020 to 2035 when that $3 trillion worth of \nliability, if you will, of those trust fund comes due. You are talking \nabout either raising taxes by $3 trillion or borrowing and raising debt \nby $3 trillion dollar.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. I am saying I think the amendment is intended to \npreclude the borrowing option because it says you would have to have--\n--\n  Mr. CRAIG. Except by a three-fifths?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. That corresponds to the debt ceiling argument which \nwould allow borrowing under those circumstances.\n  My second amendment is going to make it easier to do that. But if the \ntheory of the three-fifths vote is that essentially that is a statement \nthat we are making that it should not be done--that is what the \nlanguage of the congressional leadership stated--then that is in fact \nadhered to. When we have this drawdown of the Social Security surplus, \nno additional borrowing from the general public is permitted because it \nis capped at this level by the three-fifths margin. When we reach that \npoint, and try to finance a $3 trillion indebtedness in a 10-year \nperiod with reliance on taxation or spending cuts or some combination, \nthe consequence is going to be this train wreck, a wreck in the scale \nof which we have never quite seen before.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That $3 trillion indebtedness is going to be out there in \nany scenario. Will it not be easier for the Federal Government to be \nable to deal with it if it does not have extra hundreds of millions or \ntrillions of dollars that it has borrowed from the public? In other \nwords, if you will turn your chart that causes you problems upside \ndown, it is the same chart as the one you are showing me. The reality \nis based on the law of Social Security. The Federal Government is going \nto borrow the reserves of the trust fund and it must pay them back \nstarting dramatically in the year 2020 through the year 2035. Under \neither scenario, that is reality because it is not this amendment that \nis causing it. It is the law of the Social Security System that is \ndoing it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I beg to disagree.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then where is the money going at this point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the structure of the balanced budget amendment. \nSection 1 says that we will have an integrated Federal budget in which \nSocial Security and all trust funds will be commingled with the rest of \nthe Federal Government. That is the definition of income and \nexpenditure as provided in section 7. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am sorry?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Section 1 as defined by section 7 will constitutionally \nrequire an integrated or a consolidated Federal budget; that is, all \nsources of income, all sources of expenditures will be amalgamated for \npurposes of determining whether we have a balanced budget or not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All sources of expenditures and income. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we are constitutionally requiring a consolidated \nFederal budget. That is a correct premise. I believe that is what \nsection 7 says. Then with the structure of the Social Security system \nthat we have, each year from now until 2019, we will have a balanced \nbudget by having our regular accounts out of balance to the extent that \nwe have a Social Security surplus; that is, if this amendment were to \nbe operative in the year 2002 when we have a Social Security surplus of \napproximately $110 billion, every other account in the Federal \nGovernment can be out of balance by $110 billion and the surplus from \nSocial Security will bring the total into balance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Because of the general fund, because the law of Social \nSecurity requires the Federal Government to borrow the money, and that \nusually is invested in the general fund account.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But we have another choice; that is, what I think we \nought to be doing is we ought to be balancing our general revenue \naccounts and using the surplus of Social Security not to mask our \nspending but rather using the surplus of Social Security as a real \nsurplus including a real surplus that will be buying down an amount of \npublic debt so that when we get to the point where we have run through \nthe happy days of big Social Security surplus and face the very tough \ndays of having to pay off all of that surplus, we will not have added \n$12 trillion to the national debt. If you really want to have a \nconservative balanced budget amendment, it ought to be an amendment \nthat says we will put a three-fifths requirement on the law to increase \nthe borrowing from whatever source, Social Security, other Federal \ntrust funds, or the general public. That is an amendment that would be \ntruly conservative. That would be an amendment which our grandchildren \nand the Senator from Idaho would very much appreciate. That would be an \namendment that would give them the greatest assurance that their Social \nSecurity benefits are going to be real when they reach the age of \neligibility.\n  All of what I have said relates to the first amendment that I have \noffered, which has the simple objective of striking the four words \n``held by the public'' and requires the three-fifths vote to apply to \nall of Federal increases in the debt limit.\n  If we do not adopt that amendment----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield before he goes to the second \namendment for a couple of questions?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have followed the presentation both here and back in my \noffice. It is a very significant and important presentation. How much \non the average would the annual deficit be permitted to be during that \nperiod of the peak without it appearing as though there were a deficit \nat all? In other words, I believe the Senator said it is a $2 trillion \npeak over about a 12-year period, something like that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does that mean basically, unless his amendment is adopted, \nthat under the current wording of the balanced budget amendment that we \ncould average a deficit of about $200 billion a year and mask it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the year 2002, which is the year that the \nconstitutional amendment kicks in, Social Security will have a surplus \nof $1.04 trillion; we will say $1 trillion. During the next 16 years, \nit grows to $3.02 trillion, or roughly $2 trillion. So $2 trillion \ndivided by 16.\n  Mr. LEVIN. About $120 billion a year, perhaps.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not have my calculator, but it would be significant.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So in terms of the annual average deficit, which will be \nmasked in the absence of the amendment of the Senator from Florida, \nduring that period there could be a $120 billion deficit per year on \nthe average, which would not, in effect, violate the current wording of \nthe constitutional amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is right. And this could take place with a majority \nvote. This does not require a supermajority of the Congress in order to \nachieve this unexpected result.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senator from Florida is pointing out something \nwhich is extraordinarily significant. I hope that those who support \nthis amendment understand that, without the adoption either of the \namendment of the Senator from Florida or the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California, this outcome will result.\n  My second question relates to the substitute of the Senator from \nCalifornia. The Senator from Florida mentioned that Senator Reid of \nNevada had offered an amendment the other day which was defeated, and \nthat had it passed, I believe the Senator from Florida said, this \nproblem would have been solved; is that correct?\n  [[Page S3032]] Mr. GRAHAM. The answer is yes. Because the Reid \namendment, now incorporated in the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia, would have not required a consolidated Federal budget but \nrather would have separated Social Security from it. It would have had \nto balance our budget in general accounts without being able to use \nSocial Security surpluses as a mask and thus we would have avoided the \ntrain wreck which we are setting up for our grandchildren.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And, if the Senator would further yield for a question, if \nthe substitute of the Senator from California is adopted, will that \nthen resolve this issue?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the substitute of the Senator from California is \nadopted and if, as I understand it, it is the essence of the Reid \namendment, then I would suggest that my amendments could be withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, if the Senator would yield for an additional \nquestion. The Senator has made reference to questions and answers from \nthe Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget. I have seen \nthat same group referred to. I am wondering whether or not the Senator \ncan tell us what the membership of that is and, perhaps, if he cannot, \nthe Senator from Idaho can, because in documents which have been placed \nin the Record by the Senator from Idaho I have seen the reference to \nthat group, but I do not know who is in it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I received this document from the Congressional Leaders \nUnited for a Balanced Budget. I do not believe it indicates who the \nmembers are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Idaho has put in the Record documents \nwhich I have also referred to and plan on referring to tomorrow. He put \nthe document in on March 1.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since the Senator from \nFlorida has the floor, whether or not I might ask the Senator from \nIdaho a question without the Senator from Florida losing his right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Idaho could tell us who the \nindividuals are that make up the Congressional Leaders United for a \nBalanced Budget, because a number of us keep referring to those \ndocuments that are in the Congressional Record that my friend put in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator's inquiry and he honors me by \nthat inquiry. Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget was \noriginally formed by both Senators and Representatives in the early \n1980's. I chaired it in the House and the former Senator from \nCalifornia, now Gov. Pete Wilson, chaired it here in the Senate. We \nbrought our staffs together and through that, along with experts we \nbrought in overtime to testify on this, accumulated a base of knowledge \nand understanding of the issue.\n  So the best and cleanest and appropriate answer is that it is an ad \nhoc group of both Senators today and House Members who work under \nCongressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget for the purposes of \npromoting this legislation that we have before us.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed, would the Senator from Idaho be able or willing to provide for \nthe record the membership of the group? The reason is that Congressman \nSchaefer has put into the Congressional Record the same questions and \nanswers basically, and he is the prime sponsor of the constitutional \namendment in the House of Representatives. It is basically the same \nquestions and answers which he has put in as his. I think that is a \npretty strong statement coming from the prime sponsor.\n  Would the Senator from Idaho be willing to put in the Record the \nmembership of the group?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to. There is nothing nefarious about it \nat all. Senators come together, as do House Members, for the purpose of \ndiscussion and they find organizational titles. I would be happy to do \nso.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I quickly add, I did not mean to suggest anything the \nleast bit untoward or nefarious at all. We have ad hoc commissions all \nthe time. I know very well I will know the members and admire many of \nthem, indeed all of them. I did not mean to suggest anything unusual or \nuntoward.\n  But we are all making reference to a group and it seems to me we \nwould like to know who the members of this group are, so we can get a \nfeel whether they include both sponsors and opponents of the \nconstitutional amendment as to who it is that are members of the group. \nI would appreciate that list for the record.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida. I want to commend him on pointing \nout some very, very significant material for all the reasons which he \nhas identified. We will be masking a deficit unless we adopt either the \nFeinstein substitute or the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank my friend from Michigan for his \ncomments. I would say, in all honesty, that the adoption of the \namendment as offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nCalifornia, of which I was proud to be a cosponsor, would actually be \nthe superior way to deal with this issue because it would solve the \nproblem of no longer requiring that Social Security be commingled with \nthe rest of the Federal budget as well as effectively rendering \ndenuding the potential danger contained in section 2.\n  So let me just summarize the first amendment. It is a very simple \namendment. It strikes the phrase ``debt held by the public,'' would \nrequire that the three-fifths vote be applied to all increases in debt \nfrom whatever source, would have as its objective to avoid the addition \nof $2 trillion of debt between the year 2002 and 2018 and almost an \nassured fiscal crisis thereafter, and substitute in lieu thereof a cap \non Federal debt after the year 2002, a substitution of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses for debt held by the public during the \nperiod from 2002 to 2018, and then a reversal of that as the Social \nSecurity system has to redeem the IOU's that it holds from the Treasury \nin order to be able to meet its obligations.\n  That is amendment No. 1, which, in our sequencing, is Amendment No. \n259.\n  My amendment No. 2, unfortunately, is a much wordier amendment. Let \nme read that amendment. It would take the language of section 2 which \nsays, ``The limit on the debt of the United States held by the public \nshall not be increased,'' and it inserts this phrase, ``except for \nincreases in the limit on the debt of the United States held by the \npublic to reflect net redemptions from the Federal Old Age and \nSurvivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \nTrust Fund.''\n  In essence what we would be saying is that by a majority vote, not a \nthree-fifths vote, the Federal Government would be able to borrow \nfunds--and this would occur based on current projections after the year \n2018--the Federal Government would be able to raise the limit of debt \nof the public by a majority rather than a three-fifths vote for the \npurpose of redeeming the IOU's the Social Security trust fund will have \naccumulated and substituting debt that would be held by the public.\n  It will, in my opinion, be necessary in order to maintain this \nalternative as a means of financing the enormous transition that will \noccur in Social Security after the year 2018, without punishing \nspending cuts, tax increases, or some combination of those.\n  Madam President, I hope that this body will not just take the \nposition that no amendments are to be considered, that regardless of \nmerit we will mindlessly mow down all proposed changes.\n  I am a supporter of the balanced budget amendment. I have voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment in the past. I hope to vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment in 1995. I want to vote for a responsible \nbalanced budget amendment. I do not want to leave to our children and \ngrandchildren an enormous debt based on our failure to exercise the \ndiscipline which is the purpose of the balanced budget amendment.\n  That is why I have been supporting it. I also do not want to leave to \nour children and grandchildren the train wreck which is going to occur \nif we have a provision that requires a three-fifths vote to raise money \nfrom the general public to substitute and be able \n[[Page S3033]]  to redeem the enormous borrowing that we are going to \nbe making from Social Security over the next 20-plus years.\n  I believe this is a dramatically more conservative approach than the \none that is contained in the balanced budget amendment as currently \nsubmitted. It is the difference between having a ceiling of $6 trillion \nof national debt to one that would have national debt rising to the \nlevel of almost $8 trillion. If you are a conservative, if you are \nconcerned about the kind of America that we will leave to the next \ngeneration, if you have been appalled at what we have done in the last \n15 years where the debt went from less than $1 trillion to now almost \n$5 trillion in a period of 15 years, you ought to be equally appalled \nby the prospect of a debt growing from $5 trillion to $8 trillion in \nthe next 20-plus years.\n  Madam President, we do not have to condemn ourselves to this future. \nWe have an alternative. The alternative is either adopting the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and now reoffered by the \nSenator from California, or as a first fallback, adopting the amendment \nwhich I have offered that would require a three-fifths vote for any \nincrease of the national debt, thus forcing a readjustment of Social \nSecurity debt, for public debt, in the next period and after the year \n2018, allowing a readjustment to finance the Social Security obligation \nthat we will have.\n  If we do not do either of those, at least we ought to not require a \nthree-fifths vote to fund this enormous debt that we are going to be \nencouraging by consolidated Federal budget using the mask of Social \nSecurity to balloon the national debt by an unnecessary $2 trillion, \nand then leave it to our grandchildren through taxation or spending \ncuts to finance this Social Security obligation.\n  Madam President, I feel emotional about this in part because I am the \nfather of four children who were born as baby boomers and will be in \nthe first line of those affected by this amendment. I am the \ngrandfather of four children, soon to be eight grandchildren as a \nresult of births that are en route, and I do not want to have my \nchildren and my grandchildren turn to me 20 years from now and say \n``Granddaddy, why did you do this to me when you did not have to do \nso?''\n  I believe we have the opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment \nthat will allow Members to say to our children and our grandchildren: \nWe stopped this profligate Federal spending. We required Members to do \nas most other individuals, families, businesses, and governments in \nAmerica have to do. That is, balance their books on a more or less \nyearly basis. And we did it in an intelligent way that did not require \ncitizens to pay an enormous sacrifice in their generation because we \nwere living off the mask of this Social Security surplus during the \nlast years of our generation's life. That is what is at stake.\n  As I say, Madam President, I know there is a tremendous momentum to \nsay, ``Let's not accept any amendments. That is perfection. This is \nwhat we must adopt.'' I urge that over the next few days--and this will \nbe voted on Tuesday afternoon--that there will be some serious \nconsideration of the implications of this issue.\n  I say to our Presiding Officer and to my colleagues that I am anxious \nto meet with any Member of this body, to meet with any group which is \nconcerned about this issue, to discuss its implications, to try to \ncollectively learn what it is we are doing and to determine what would \nbe the most prompt path.\n  These are an important 4 days that we have between now and Tuesday. I \nhope we use those days wisely.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am about to propose a unanimous \nconsent.\n  I will be more than happy to meet with the Senator from Florida and \nrespond to those questions. I know he is sincere in his effort and I \nwill make every effort to accommodate him.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the votes occur in relation to the \npending amendments numbered 259 and numbered 298 on Tuesday, February \n28, in the stacked sequence to begin at 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object, and I will not do so, will \nthe vote on the amendments occur after the vote on the amendment as \noffered by the Senator from California?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that that is the stacked sequence; \nis it not? I believe that is the correct answer, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it would come after the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But would the amendment of the Senator from California \noccur prior to this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As I indicated, should the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia be adopted, I am prepared to withdraw my amendments, because \nthey would have been solved in a larger and, I think, more effective \nmanner.\n  If the amendment by the Senator from California is not adopted, I \nthink it becomes urgent that one, and preferably the first of the two \namendments that I am offering, be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for not to exceed 3 \nminutes, following which the senior Senator from Virginia be recognized \nfor not to exceed 3 minutes, following which the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts be recognized for 2 minutes for the purpose of laying \ndown an amendment, so that the amendment would qualify for a vote on \nTuesday, and that immediately following the laying down of the \namendment by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, I be recognized \nagain for the purpose of calling up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask my colleague if he might extend a \nlittle more latitude to the two Senators.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Of course. I was told by the Senator from Rhode Island \nthat he thought 3 minutes each would do it. I will be happy to yield \nfor a longer period. What would the Senator suggest?\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps not to exceed a total of 12 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and I wish to address the commemorative to Iwo Jima.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I modify my unanimous-consent request to yield 12 \nminutes to the two Senators equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I have a 15-second \nrequest. Could I ask the Senator be permitted----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I amend the unanimous consent request to allow the \nSenator from Massachusetts to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 267\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the balanced budget constitutional amendment \ndoes not authorize the President to impound lawfully appropriated funds \n                   or impose taxes, duties, or fees)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 267, which was previously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Johnston, proposes an amendment numbered 267.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       ``Section 8. Nothing in this article shall authorize the \n     President to impound funds appropriated by Congress by law, \n     or to impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is my understanding that the vote in \nrelation to my amendment will occur in the sequence on Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, my amendment would simply make it \n[[Page S3034]]  clear that nothing in the proposed constitutional \namendment would authorize the President to impound funds appropriated \nby Congress by law or to impose taxes, duties, or fees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a discussion of this issue set forth in \n``Minority Views'' contained in the report of the Committee on the \nJudiciary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   B. The amendment would give the President broad powers to impound \n                           appropriated funds\n\n       That the balanced budget constitutional amendment would \n     authorize the President to impound funds appropriated by \n     Congress is clear from the text of the Constitution and the \n     proposed amendment. Article II, section 3, obligates the \n     President to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully \n     executed,'' and article II, section 7, requires the President \n     to take an oath to ``preserve, protect and defend the \n     Constitution.''\n       Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment provides \n     that ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \n     total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \n     rollcall vote.'' The amendment thus would forbid outlays from \n     exceeding revenues by more than the amount specifically \n     authorized by a three-fifths supermajority of each House of \n     Congress. In any fiscal year in which it is clear that in the \n     absence of congressional action, ``total outlays'' will \n     exceed ``total receipts'' by a greater-than-authorized \n     amount, the President is bound by the Constitution and the \n     oath of office it prescribes to prevent the unauthorized \n     deficit.\n       The powers and obligations conferred upon the President by \n     the Constitution and the proposed constitutional amendment \n     would clearly be read by the courts to include the power to \n     impound appropriated funds where the expenditure of those \n     funds would cause total outlays to exceed total receipts by \n     an amount greater than that authorized by the requisite \n     congressional supermajorities.\n       This commonsense reading of the proposed constitutional \n     amendment is shared by a broad range of highly regarded legal \n     scholars. Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, who as \n     head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \n     Justice is responsible for advising the President and the \n     Attorney General regarding the scope and limits on \n     presidential authority, testified before the Judiciary \n     Committee that the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     authorize the President to impound funds to insure that \n     outlays do not exceed receipts. Similarly, Harvard University \n     Law School Professor Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor \n     General during the Reagan Administration, testified that in a \n     year when actual revenues fell below projections and bigger-\n     than-authorized deficit occurred, section 1 ``would offer a \n     President ample warrant to impound appropriated funds.'' \n     Others who share this view include former Attorney General \n     Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Stanford University Law School \n     Professor Kathleen Sullivan, Yale University Law School \n     Professor Burke Marshall, and Harvard University Law School \n     Professor Laurence H. Tribe.\n       The fact that the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     confer impoundment authority on the President is confirmed by \n     the actions of the Judiciary Committee this year. Supporters \n     of the amendment opposed and defeated an amendment offered by \n     Senator Kennedy before the Judiciary Committee that would \n     have added the following section to the proposed amendment:\n       ``Section   . Nothing in this article shall authorize the \n     President to impound funds appropriated by Congress by law, \n     or to impose taxes, duties or fees.''\n       If the supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment \n     do not intend to give impoundment authority to the President, \n     there is no legitimate explanation of their failure to \n     include the text of the Kennedy amendment in the proposed \n     article.\n       The impoundment power that would be conferred on the \n     President by the proposed constitutional amendment is far \n     broader than any proposed presidential line-item veto \n     authority now under consideration by the Congress. The line-\n     item veto proposals would allow a President to refrain from \n     spending funds proposed to be spent by a particular item of \n     appropriation in a particular appropriations bill presented \n     to the President. As Assistant Attorney General Dellinger \n     testified, the impoundment authority conferred upon the \n     President by the proposed constitutional amendment would \n     allow a President to order across-the-board cuts in all \n     Federal programs, target specific programs for abolition, or \n     target expenditures intended for particular States or regions \n     for impoundment.\n       The Committee majority makes two arguments to support its \n     assertion that the balanced budget constitutional amendment \n     does not give the President impoundment authority. Both are \n     wrong.\n       The first is the suggestion that ``up to the end of the \n     fiscal year, the President has nothing to impound because \n     Congress in the amendment has the power to ratify or to \n     specify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that \n     fiscal year.'' In essence, the majority asserts that there \n     will never be an unauthorized, and therefore \n     unconstitutional, deficit, because Congress will always step \n     in at the end of the year and ratify whatever deficit has \n     occurred. If true, then the balanced budget is a complete \n     sham, because it would impose no fiscal discipline \n     whatsoever.\n       But if the majority is wrong in its prediction--that is, if \n     a Congress failed to act before the end of a fiscal year to \n     ratify a previously unauthorized deficit, all of the \n     expenditures undertaken by the Federal government throughout \n     the fiscal year would be unconstitutional and open to \n     challenge in the state and Federal courts (see part I.A, \n     supra). It is inconceivable that the President, sworn to \n     preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, would be found \n     to be powerless to prevent such a result.\n       Second, the majority argues that ``under section 6 of the \n     amendment, Congress can specify exactly what type of \n     enforcement mechanism it wants and the President, as Chief \n     Executive, is duty bound to enforce that particular \n     congressional scheme to the exclusion of impoundment.'' The \n     fact that Congress is required by section 6 of the proposed \n     amendment to enact enforcement legislation certainly does not \n     suggest that the amendment itself would not grant the \n     president authority to impound appropriated funds. Nothing in \n     the proposed article stipulates that the enforcement \n     legislation must be effective to prevent violations of the \n     amendment. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that no \n     enforcement legislation could prevent violations for \n     occurring.\n       The President's obligation to faithfully execute the laws \n     is independent of Congress's. That duty is not ``limited to \n     the enforcement of acts of Congress * * * according to their \n     express terms, * * * it include[s] the rights, duties and \n     obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, * * * and \n     all the protection implied by the nature of the government \n     under the Constitution[.]'' In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 64 \n     (1890). If an unconstitutional deficit were occurring, \n     Congress could not constitutionally stop the President from \n     seeking to prevent it.\n\n\n   c. the proposed amendment many also confer upon the president the \n               authority to impose taxes, duties and fees\n\n       As discussed above, when a greater-than-authorized deficit \n     occurs, the balanced budget constitutional amendment would \n     impose upon the President an obligation to stop it. While \n     greater attention has been paid to the prospect that the \n     amendment would grant the President authority to impound \n     appropriated funds, the amendment would enable future \n     Presidents to assert that they have the power unilaterally to \n     raise taxes, duties or fees in order to generate additional \n     revenue to avoid an unauthorized deficit. See Testimony of \n     Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, 1995 Judiciary \n     Committee Hearings at 102.\n       This outcome would turn on its head the allocation of \n     powers envisioned by the Framers. No longer would ``the \n     legislative department alone ha[ve] access to the pockets of \n     the people'' as Madison promised in The Federalist No. 48. \n     Instead, intermixing of legislative and executive power in \n     the President's hands would constitute the ``source of \n     danger'' against which Madison warned.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S2995-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3034-S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF IWO JIMA\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, first I want to thank the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Arkansas for letting us interrupt the sequence.\n  Last week, Madam President, following the inspiring remarks by that \nvery senior Senator from Arkansas, there were several very eloquent and \nmoving statements made on this floor regarding the battle for Iwo Jima \nand the 50th anniversary which we are commemorating currently.\n  Over the next several days, there will be additional statements \ndealing with that battle which many believe was the most ferocious of \nthe Pacific war. The actual invasion commenced on February 19, 1945, \nwith the battle lasting 35 days. On February 22, 50 years ago \nyesterday, D-day plus 3, marines from the 4th and 5th Divisions \ncontinued their relentless attack against entrenched enemy positions on \nIwo Jima. It was very difficult going.\n  The first 2 bloody days on the island netted gains at a high price in \nmarines killed and wounded--an indication of what was going to come in \nthe succeeding 32 additional days of combat.\n  The job of taking Mount Suribachi, the 556-foot high extinct volcano \nat the southern end of Iwo Jima, fell to the 28th Marine Regiment \ncommanded by Col. Harry E. Liversedge.\n  On the slopes of Mount Suribachi, the Japanese had constructed an \nexceedingly clever labyrinth of dug-in \n[[Page S3035]] gun positions for coast defense, artillery, mortars and \nmachine gun emplacements. These defensive positions were accompanied by \nan elaborate cave and tunnel system.\n  From the volcano's rim--that is the top of Mount Suribachi--\neverything that went on at both sets of the invasion beaches and, \nindeed, on most of the island, could be observed. Mount Suribachi was a \nposition that had to be taken by the marines.\n  The men of the 28th Marine Division were the ones that did it. Just \n50 years ago today, February 23, 1945, Mount Suribachi was captured by \nthose valiant marines, and so I think it is only fitting, Madam \nPresident, that we do take a few minutes to recall the heroism and the \nconstancy and valor of those marines who seized that position.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am particularly privileged to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Rhode Island. He is too humble to mention \nhe served on Guadalcanal as a rifleman.\n  During the Battle of Iwo Jima, he was back in the United States being \ntrained as an officer and later was deployed back to the Pacific as a \nplatoon commander in the Battle for Okinawa.\n  This Senator, I say humbly, had just joined the Navy at this point in \ntime, and I was awaiting my first assignment. I remember so well the \nsailors--all of us--gathering around the radio--for that was the only \ncommunication we had--listening to the reports from Iwo Jima, and later \nwe studied, of course, the films and read the detailed stories of this \ngreat battle.\n  History records that one-third of the casualties taken by the Marine \nCorps during the entire Pacific war occurred in this historic battle. \nBut I want to mention to my colleague, in furtherance, of Senator \nChafee's observation about the flag raising, that there were two flag \nraisings on Iwo Jima. The first flag raising spontaneously occurred \nabout 10:20 in the morning when a first lieutenant with a 40-man patrol \nfinally scaled the heights and lifted the first flag. Fortunately, that \nflag was observed by James Forrestal, aboard a ship offshore, Secretary \nof the Navy, a position which my distinguished colleague later occupied \nand I had the privilege of following him.\n  Secretary Forrestal is said to have observed to Gen. Holland Smith, \nthe commanding officer of all the marines in that operation, ``the \nraising of the flag means a Marine Corps for another 500 years.''\n  Later in the day, it was determined by senior officers that the first \nsmall flag could not be observed throughout the island. A second marine \ndetail, therefore, was set up scaling the same arduous terrain to raise \na larger flag, simply to allow our flag to be observed by a greater \nnumber of the marines locked in fierce combat.\n  The second flag was raised by Sgt.

The more visible Stars and Stripes \nwas the one that was captured by the famous photographer Rosenthal, and \nnow used as a model for the famous Marine Corps War Memorial near \nArlington Cemetery.\n  So I am privileged to join my distinguished colleague, but I would \nlike to add another point. Recently, we saw a very serious controversy \nabout the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atom bomb, being a part \nof the commemorative exhibit being planned by the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  There was, unfortunately, research done and initial reports written, \nwhich, in my judgment, and in the judgment of many, particularly those \nwho were privileged to serve in uniform in World War II, did not \nproperly reflect the facts of that war.\n  Fortunately, cooler heads and wiser minds have taken that situation \nnow and brought it more nearly into balance, primarily as a result of \nmany veterans organizations, particularly the American Legion and the \nAir Force Association.\n  But I point out that this battle portrays the extraordinary losses \nincurred in the Pacific conflict, and I hope those researchers who \nwrote the initial reports questioning the mission of the Enola Gay, \nhave followed the excellent coverage in remembrance of this battle and \nrecognized the mistakes they perpetrated in their earlier assessments \nof the war and why this country was involved.\n  My research shows that this is the last battle of World War II when \nPresident Roosevelt was Commander in Chief from beginning to end. He \ndied early in April during the course of the battle on Okinawa, which \nSenator Chafee was in, so this was President Roosevelt's last battle. I \nthink it is most appropriate that we join today with others in making \nthis remembrance.\n  After brief service as a sailor in World War II, I joined the Marines \nand served in Korea. I always feel that my Senate career is largely \nowing to my two opportunities to serve in the military. The military \nhelped me greatly to get an education and start a career. I shall \nalways be grateful.\n And I do not ever associate my career with the distinguished combat \nrecords of Senator Chafee, or many others in the Senate. I was simply a \nvolunteer during World War II and again for Korea. I shall be forever \ngrateful for the privilege of serving my country during those two \nperiods of our history and being with those who distinguished \nthemselves.\n\n  I thank my colleague and long time friend for joining me on the floor \nthis evening.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you, Senator Warner. In the succeeding days, I am \nsure that others will come forward with statements commemorating other \nevents that took place 50 years ago in Iwo Jima as the battle \nprogressed for those 35 plus days, and which, as I say, those who \nstudied the wars in the Pacific--many of them, not all--say that was \nthe most ferocious battle. I thank the senior Senator from Virginia and \nthe Chair. Also, I would like to thank the senior Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. I talked to retired Brigadier General Hittle who served \nas an Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Senator Chafee and myself, \nand who participated in the battle of Iwo Jima. On behalf of that \ndistinguished individual and dearly beloved friend, I would like to \ninclude a short statement of his recollections of that battle and \nparticularly the performance of one of his marines in that battle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement by General Hittle be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Statement by General Hittle\n\n       I first met Elmer Montgomery when he reported to my G-4 \n     Section of the 3rd Marine Division on Guam. He was the \n     replacement for the Section's stenographer. He was older than \n     most of the men in the Division and I noticed that when he \n     had some spare time, he would lean his chair back against the \n     side of the G-4 quanset hut, take a small white Bible out of \n     his pocket, and deliberately zip it open, read, and find \n     contentment. Elmer was not a loner. He liked his fellow \n     Marines, but he would silently wince when hearing some of his \n     fellow Marines use profanity.\n       In February 1945, we sailed for an island called Iwo Jima. \n     A few days after the landings of the 4th and 5th divisions, \n     the 3rd went ashore and was assigned to attack up the center \n     of the island. A couple of days later, when the front line \n     units had suffered heavy casualties, all Division Sections \n     had to send several men up to the front.\n       It's no easy task to pick men, knowing that they will go \n     into the ``meatgrinder.'' As I was finishing making the \n     selections, Colonel Beyeo (later a Brigadier General USMC \n     (ret)) popped into my dugout. He said that Sergeant \n     Montgomery wanted to see me. I went out and saw Elmer \n     standing a few feet away. I thought I would put his mind at \n     ease and said ``You weren't among those picked.'' For the \n     first time, he argued with me. He said ``I want to go up \n     front, I have a lot of hunting experience in the mountains, \n     and I want to look after these kids.'' He wouldn't take no \n     for an answer. Then I relented. I told him that he was old \n     enough (35 years) to know what he was doing, and only because \n     he was insisting, he could go forward. That's the last time I \n     saw Elmer. A few hours later he was second in command of an \n     attacking platoon. All the company officers were casualties.\n       As the platoon attacked, it was pinned down by machine-gun \n     fire in a saucer like depression, if any Marine stood up, he \n     was mowed down by machine-gun fire. The Japanese mortars were \n     beginning to zero in. Sensing the potential finality of the \n     platoon's position, he yelled to his men ``When I stand up, \n     move out of the depression.'' Elmer then stood up and began \n     firing from the hip and rushed the machine-gun positions.\n       The platoon was saved, but Elmer's body was never found. In \n     a few minutes, our artillery pounded that ground and the \n     Japanese \n     [[Page S3036]]  positions. Elmer and his white leather-\n     covered Bible became forever a part of the hallowed grounds \n     of Iwo Jima.\n       Elmer was awarded post-humously the Navy Cross.\n       When I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, I was \n     instrumental in having a new destroyer named in honor of \n     Sergeant Elmer Montgomery. I spoke at the keel laying, and \n     twenty years later, I spoke at the decommissioning of this \n     ship. And today, if anyone should ask me if I used my \n     position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to influence the \n     naming of the Sergeant Elmer Montgomery, I can look him \n     squarely in the eye, and in all truth, say ``I sure did.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have more to say on this amendment \nthan we have time for tonight. Besides that, the Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, wants to be recognized a little late to offer an \namendment, and I know the Senator from Idaho has been here a long time \nand he is tired.\n  Let me start off by making a few introductory comments about this \nwhole process and not just about my amendment. This afternoon, as I \nreflected on the talking thoughts on the amendment, I thought, what on \nEarth is going on when we have an amendment before this body that was \npassed by the House of Representatives to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States--we took it, and it is now House Joint Resolution 1, and \nwe have probably voted close to 30 times. We voted about 70 times since \nwe came in on January 3. We voted on amendments on this about 30 times \nand every single one of them, I believe, has been tabled. The \ndistinguished floor manager on the Republican side of the aisle has \nmoved to table every amendment and has prevailed almost on a straight \nparty line vote on every amendment.\n  Madam President, I think party discipline, at times, is a wonderful \nthing. That is what this Nation is all about. We have two parties. I \nhope we can keep it that way. I am not for third parties. I hear some \nsophistry about how that would work wonders for the country. I think we \nhave done reasonably well with two political parties and I believe in \nparty unity and discipline--to a point.\n  But I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to how really \nbizarre this is. Here we are talking about the organic law of the \nNation which has provided us with 205 years of unfettered freedom \nbecause of the brilliance of James Madison, John Jay, Alexander \nHamilton, George Washington, and all of the other Founders who crafted \nthat brilliant document. Can you imagine in Philadelphia in 1787 George \nWashington, presiding over the Constitutional Convention to craft that \ndocument, saying, James Madison and I have sat down and crafted this \namendment and we will broach no changes; and somebody says, Mr. \nChairman--or whatever his title was--I have an amendment that I think \nwould improve that, and James Madison says, Mr. President, I move to \ntable that. That is the end of that amendment. Alexander Hamilton, who \nbelieved in more central Government--and I did not particularly agree \nwith him, but he was a brilliant man--says, Mr. President, I have an \namendment to change three words here that I believe would improve \narticle and amend article IV on unlawful searches \n[[Page S3037]]  and seizures; and Madison says, I move to table that. \nVoted on and that is it.\n  Who here believes that the Constitution of the United States would be \nthe document it is today if at the Constitutional Convention the \nFounding Fathers had carried on in such a manner? There are 100 \nSenators--two from each State of the Nation--and we have a right to \noffer amendments, but they are not even being entertained. They are \njust being summarily dismissed because they say, if we change this \ndocument, House Joint Resolution 1, this amendment to the Constitution, \nif we change one jot or tittle, the House will not take it back.\n  Deliberative body? Well, that is laughable. We are not deliberating. \nSome people here are trying to actually improve it. Others, like me, \nare trying to kill it. But everybody gets the same treatment --they get \ntabled, harassment, and out of here.\n  Going back to the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the \nConstitution were submitted in 1789, the same time the Constitution was \nratified; and the first 10 amendments, which were the Bill of Rights, \nwere adopted at the same time the Constitution was. Since that time, \nMadam President, there have been 11,000 proposals offered in the U.S. \nCongress to tinker with that document--11,000. We have had almost one a \nday since we came back here January 3, 1995. The last time I checked, \n35 constitutional amendments had been proposed to the Constitution \nsince January 3. That is the reason the other day--I think I mentioned \nthis once before, but it is worth repeating. I went down to Wake Forest \nto speak at a convocation celebrating the 100th year of Wake Forest Law \nSchool. When they called me and said, ``What will your topic be?'' I \nsaid, ``I will call it `Trivializing the Constitution.''' That is what \nI spoke on, the trivializing the Constitution. There were 11,000 \nefforts to change a document that the most brilliant minds ever \nassembled under one roof put together, which has made this country what \nit is.\n  And so we come here with an amendment that is as unworkable as \nprohibition. You know, everybody in this country wanted to put a social \npolicy in the Constitution. They said we want to stop people from \ndrinking, so we put it in the Constitution. About 14 years later we \ntook it out. Do you know why? Because we found we had made a miserable \nmistake. Regardless of how you feel about drinking, that was not the \nissue. The issue was that we were setting social policy in the \nConstitution, and all we got out of it was organized crime--Al Capone, \nthe founder of rum-running in this country.\n  Organized crime is still firmly in place in this country. We were \ntinkering with the Constitution, and a misguided amendment caused it. \nThe figures on this thing are so staggering, people do not want to hear \nit. Senators do not want to hear it. People who watch C-SPAN do not \nwant to hear it. They do not relate to it. Think about it--promising \nthe American people they would balance the budget by 2002, but first we \nare going to spend $471 billion more in tax cuts and increase defense \nspending--\n If you took Social Security out of the equation, as the Republicans \nhave suggested, approximately $2 trillion in spending would have to be \ncut to balance the budget by 2002. How many people in this body do you \nthink, Madam President, believe we are going to cut $2 trillion in 7 \nyears? The answer is in the question.\n\n  Unhappily for all of us, the constitutional amendment is popular. A \nvote against House Joint Resolution 1 will not be the first unpopular \nvote I ever cast. But, as Woodrow Wilson said in his inaugural address, \nthe biggest question for every politician who is a public servant in \nthe mode of a statesman, the biggest question he always has to ask \nhimself, is what part of the public demand should be honored and what \npart should be rejected.\n  Politicians try to provide everything on the agenda for everybody. We \nhave a $4.5 trillion debt to prove that. But statesmen have to ask \nthemselves, does the proposal expand individual liberties? Does it \nprovide for domestic or international tranquility? Does it educate our \npeople? Does it provide for more health and general welfare? Or is it \nsomething to run for reelection on in 1996?\n  I do not intend to denigrate or debase my colleagues, but I daresay, \nMadam President, if this amendment were being voted on in secret and \nevery Senator knew that not one soul would ever know how he or she \nvoted, you might possibly muster 40 votes max.\n  But the reason the amendment is so popular is because the people of \nthis country think that if you put language in the Constitution, \nsomething magical happens. What they do not understand is that there is \na real possibility that nothing would happen. For example, Congress \nmight be able to ignore the constitutional requirement if the courts \nwere unwilling or unable to enforce it, as some proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment suggest.\n  On the other hand, Congress might blindly follow the provisions of \nthis amendment in a manner that causes economic ruin. For example, say \nwe are in the midst of a recession, headed for a depression. We need to \nunbalance the budget in order to spend money to create some jobs \nbecause the unemployment rate has skyrocketed, as occurred during the \nDepression when it was 25 percent. If you have 41 people in the Senate \nwho say, ``I am not voting to unbalance the budget under any \nconditions'', you could be faced with is an apocalypse. And I am \ntelling you, Madam President, that is not a farfetched idea. I have \nwatched, on this floor since I have been in the Senate, people vote to \nspend money on everything they could find and then when it came time to \nraise the debt ceiling they said,\n\n       No! I am not going to vote to raise the debt ceiling. I \n     just got through voting for $250 billion for a defense budget \n     and for the space station and everything else I could find to \n     spend money for, but I am not voting to raise the debt \n     ceiling. I am going to go back and tell my people what a \n     great fiscal conservative I am.\n\n  The people of this country, and indeed the Congress, in their \ninfinite wisdom have seen fit to tinker with the Constitution very, \nvery rarely. As Norman Ornstein said amending the Constitution should \nbe ``the fix of last resort''. This is a perfect description, ``the fix \nof last resort.''\n  To my friends who pride themselves on being conservatives, which I do \nwhen it comes to fiscal matters, do you know what Robert Goldwin at the \nconservative American Enterprise Institute said? ``True conservatives \ndo not muck with the Constitution.'' All you conservatives, let me \nrepeat it. This great man at the American Enterprise Institute said, \n``True conservatives do not muck with the Constitution.''\n  My motion would refer House Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget \nCommittee with instructions that the Committee report language which \nincludes the requirements of my proposed amendment. Now, Madam \nPresident, my proposed amendment is designed for those members who \nreally do not want to muck with the Constitution. I invite my \ncolleagues to look at these two charts which describes why my proposed \namendment is designed to do what needs to be done legislatively and, in \nmy opinion, has more force and effect than a constitutional amendment.\n  Can you believe that we are debating an amendment to balance the \nbudget, and at the same time people are saying, ``let's go on a \nspending spree until the year 2002 and pray to God that people have \nforgotten what we said in 1995''. Let us not deal with the deficit \nuntil the year 2002.\n  I say let us start right now. My proposed amendment, if enacted into \nlaw, would require that we will have a balanced budget by the year \n2002. The constitutional amendment calls for a balanced budget, but \ncontains no enforcement mechanism that would actually require a \nbalanced budget. If that is not a dramatic difference, I do not \nunderstand the mother tongue, English. My amendment requires a balanced \nbudget; the constitutional amendment calls for one. It does not demand \nit at all.\n  My proposed amendment says you can waive the balanced budget \nrequirement by a three-fifths vote. So does the constitutional \namendment. My proposed amendment says you waive it if there is a \ndeclaration of war. The constitutional amendment says the same thing. \nMy proposed amendment says if we are in a military conflict, a majority \nof each house can waive the requirement. The constitutional amendment \nincludes the same provision.\n   [[Page S3038]] My proposed amendment would require that each annual \nBudget Resolution passed by Congress between now and 2002 contain a \nglide path showing how we will get to a balanced budget by 2002. \nEverybody says we cannot balance the budget overnight. Everybody knows \nwe cannot do it overnight.\n  My proposed amendment is enforceable because a budget resolution \ncould not be passed if it did not balance the budget in 2002. If a \nbudget resolution is not passed, Congress is prohibited from enacting \nappropriations and tax bills. The constitutional amendment, on the \nother hand, may or may not be enforceable. Nobody knows for sure.\n  The most beautiful thing about my proposed amendment is it is more \nenforceable than the constitutional amendment and it does not touch the \nConstitution.\n  My proposed amendment also protects Social Security. The \nconstitutional amendment raids the Social Security system to the tune \nof $681 billion between now and the year 2002.\n  My proposed amendment says, ``Action now.'' Do you know what the \nconstitutional amendment that we are debating here says? ``No \nrequirement for action until the year 2002, at the earliest.''\n  That is right, America; 7 years before we even start on this whole \nthing and no requirement to do otherwise.\n  Madam President, I have some more things I want to say, but everybody \nwants to get out of here. My distinguished friend from Georgia has an \namendment he wants to lay down and discuss for a moment.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield to the \nSenator from Georgia for that purpose, that my motion be temporarily \nlaid aside, and that it become the pending business when we return to \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Arkansas. I \nappreciate his yielding at this point. I do have two amendments. I \nwould like to call up both amendments for the purpose of making sure \nthey are eligible to be voted on, and then I will talk about one \namendment tonight relating to judicial review.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 299\n\n    (Purpose: To permit waiver of the amendment during an economic \n                               emergency)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I would like to call up an amendment \nrelating to economic emergency, which is amendment No. 299, and ask it \nbe sequenced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. NUNN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 299.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 18 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 5. The provisions of this article shall not apply to \n     any fiscal year--\n       ``(1) if at any time during that fiscal year the United \n     States is in a state of war declared by the Congress pursuant \n     to section 8 of article I of this Constitution; or\n       ``(2) if, with respect to that fiscal year, the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives agree to a concurrent resolution \n     stating, in substance, that a national economic emergency \n     requires the suspension of the application of this article \n     for that fiscal year.\n\n     In exercising its power under paragraph (2) of this section, \n     the Senate and House of Representatives shall take into \n     consideration the extent and rate of industrial activity, \n     unemployment, and inflation, and such other factors as they \n     deem appropriate.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 300\n\n                  (Purpose: To limit judicial review)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nset aside and that I call up amendment No. 300 at this point in time. I \nask it be sequenced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 300.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 3, after the period insert ``The power of \n     any court to order relief pursuant to any case or controversy \n     arising under this article shall not extend to ordering any \n     remedies other than a declaratory judgment or such remedies \n     as are specifically authorized in implementing legislation \n     pursuant to this section.''.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, the amendment that is amendment No. 300 \nrelates to judicial review under the balanced budget amendment that is \nnow pending before the Senate. I intend to offer this amendment and \nhave it voted on on Tuesday, and I am very hopeful this body will agree \nto the amendment.\n  My amendment would provide that the power of any court to order \nrelief under the balanced budget amendment could not extend to any \nrelief other than a declaratory judgment or such remedies as may be \nspecifically authorized in legislation implementing the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Madam President, this amendment is identical to the Danforth \namendment that was agreed to last year as a part of the balanced budget \namendment which was voted on last year but not passed. I voted for that \namendment but I did so after the Danforth amendment was incorporated in \nthat amendment because I felt, and continue to feel, that this is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to pass a constitutional \namendment, if it is going to be ratified by the States, and if it is \ngoing to be able to function properly under our system of Government.\n  In my judgment, adoption of a balanced budget amendment without a \nlimitation of judicial review would radically alter the balance of \npowers among the three branches of Government that is fundamental to \nour democracy. As former Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach \nhas noted:\n\n       [T]o open up even the possibility that judges appointed for \n     life might end up making the most fundamental of all \n     political decision[s] is not only an unprecedented shift of \n     constitutional roles and responsibilities but one that should \n     be totally unacceptable in a democratic society.\n\n  Former Solicitor and Federal Judge Robert Bork has expressed his \ngrave concern that the balanced budget amendment:\n\n       * * * would likely [result in] hundreds, if not thousands \n     of lawsuits around the country, many of them on inconsistent \n     theories and providing inconsistent results.\n\n  Under the Constitution, the taxing and spending powers are vested in \nthe two policymaking branches of Government, the legislative and \nexecutive branches. These branches are elected by the people. The \npowers to tax, borrow, and pay debts are expressly vested in the \nCongress under article I, section 7, 8, and 9, under the 16th \namendment. The power to appropriate funds is expressly vested in the \nCongress under article I, section 9. The power to implement and execute \nthe laws made under the powers of Congress is vested in the President, \nunder article II, section 1.\n  The Founders of this Nation fought a revolution in opposition to \ntaxation without representation. They would have found it inconceivable \nthat the power to tax might be vested in the unelected, lifetime \ntenured members of the judicial branch of government.\n  As a general matter, the judiciary has treated questions involving \nthe power to tax and spend as political questions that should not be \naddressed by the judicial branch. Our constituents view the balanced \nbudget amendment as a means to address taxation and spending decisions \nover which they feel less and less control. They would be sorely \ndisappointed if not outraged if the result of the amendment is to \ntransfer the power to tax and spend from elected officials to unelected \nlife tenured judges.\n  Madam President, I have no doubt that a majority, a large majority of \nthe people I represent in the State of Georgia, are in favor of a \nbalanced budget. Many of those people, if not most, would favor the \nsort of last resort effort to balance that budget by constitutional \namendment, if that is the only way to do it, and that is what we are \ndebating now. I do not believe, however, very many constituents in the \nState of Georgia would want the Federal courts to make these crucial \ndecisions. I do not believe they would want any risk of that attendant \nto a \n[[Page S3039]]  constitutional amendment that we are voting on in the \nnext few days.\n  One of the arguments that has been offered against the judicial \nreview limitation--and of course we voted on a very similar amendment \nto my amendment, sponsored by the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nJohnston, last week. It was defeated by 47 votes for it, 51 votes \nagainst it. And one of the arguments that was offered against that \nJohnston amendment which I voted for, and was very disappointed when it \ndid not pass, is that it is unnecessary because the Supreme Court has \ntended to treat taxation and spending issues as political questions not \nappropriate for judicial review.\n  I do not agree with this argument against the Johnston amendment and \nagainst the Danforth amendment. There have been unfortunate \nencroachments on the political question doctrine which demonstrate the \npotential and the high risk for an activist judiciary to assert the \npower to tax.\n  In testimony on the balanced budget amendment, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Walter Dellinger has cited the case of Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 \nU.S. 33. That was a 1990 case in which the Supreme Court considered a \ndecision by a district court to order specific taxes in order to \nimplement the lower court's desegregation plans. Although the Supreme \nCourt in that case did not approve the district court's imposition of \nspecific taxes, the Supreme Court approved a decision by the court of \nappeals mandating taxation so long as the specific details were left to \nthe State.\n  In other words, to those who say this is not a danger, I say look at \nthe Missouri case, where the court, upheld by the Supreme Court, made \nit clear that the lower court's decision could hold, mandating taxation \nby the State.\n  If that precedent holds and somebody comes in under this \nconstitutional amendment and makes a case that has standing, they would \nvery likely find some Federal judge who would be willing to take this \ncase, the Missouri case, and act on it and perhaps even order taxation \nunder that theory.\n  If the Supreme Court can permit Federal courts to order the \nimposition of taxes to address nonbudgetary issues--that is what the \nMissouri case was--in my view, it is quite likely the court would \nconsider it appropriate to order taxation to meet the specific \nconstitutional objective of a balanced budget. It seems to me it is \nmore likely that they would order it in that case than it even was in \nthe Missouri case.\n  Madam President, an alternative argument against this amendment is, \nbecause there have been relatively few cases in which the Supreme Court \nhas stretched the political question doctrine, we can rely on \nlegislative history of this balanced budget amendment to discourage the \ncourt from asserting new powers over the budget.\n  Again, I do not agree. Legislative history has not been particularly \nhelpful. In fact, it may even be considered harmful. The discussion in \nthe committee report, for instance, on page 9, the committee report \nthat brings out this amendment, expressly declines to state that the \namendment precludes judicial review. Instead, the report states--this \nis the report before us by the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       By remaining silent about judicial review in the amendment \n     itself, its authors have refused to establish congressional \n     sanctions for the Federal courts to involve themselves in \n     fundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions while not \n     undermining their equally fundamental obligation to say what \n     the law is.\n\n  Madam President, there is a vast difference between actually \nprohibiting judicial review as opposed to merely refusing to establish \ncongressional sanction for judicial review. That is what this committee \nreport does.\n  An activist court--we have many Federal judges that are still in \nactivist category in a number of appeals courts--an activist court \nfaced with a lawsuit based upon the balanced budget amendment, in my \nview, will have no trouble pointing out that Congress consciously \ndecided not to prohibit judicial review. Legislative history of the \nbalanced budget amendment underscores the potential for such a ruling. \nLast year, the Senate adopted the Danforth amendment expressly \nrestricting judicial review. This year, the Senate rejected a similar \namendment offered by Senator Johnston. While the defeat of an amendment \ndoes not necessarily provide conclusive legislative intent of a desire \nto achieve the opposite result, it constitutes powerful evidence of \nintent when the issue is separation of powers and the Congress \nspecifically rejects a proposal to frame a constitutional amendment in \na manner that would protect the prerogatives of the legislative branch.\n  The legislative history in the House is even more of a problem. As \nSenator Levin noted, on February 15, Representative Schaefer, a lead \nsponsor of the House amendment, said--this is one of the lead sponsors \non the House side, Representative Schaefer:\n\n       A Member of Congress, or an appropriate administration \n     official, probably would have standing to file suit \n     challenging legislation that subverted the amendment.\n\n  He went on, the same Representative Schaefer, one of the prime \nauthors of this amendment on the House side, quoting him again:\n\n       The courts could invalidate an individual appropriation, or \n     attack that. They could rule as to whether a given act of \n     Congress, or action by the Executive, violated the \n     requirements of this amendment.\n\n  In other words, Madam President, one of the prime authors of this \namendment on the House side explicitly invites the court to get in the \nrulings on tax and spending decisions.\n  I find this very troubling. The statements by a lead sponsor in the \nHouse represents a wide open invitation for unelected life tenure \nmembers of the judicial branch to make fundamental policy decisions on \nbudgetary matters. I have the highest respect for the judiciary. I do \nnot believe, however, that making budget decisions is a role that would \nbe sought or welcomed by the American people in terms of Federal judges \ncarrying this out. In fact, I think a number of Federal judges, \nprobably a majority them, would not welcome this kind of responsibility \nor this kind of jurisdiction. It is certainly not a role that our \nconstituents would expect to be filled by unelected Federal officials. \nIf we start having unelected officials making tax and budgetary \ndecisions, we are basically going to be unraveling the Boston Tea Party \nin terms of the forefathers when they did not want taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  Madam President, another argument in opposition to a limitation on \njudicial review is that cases will be dismissed because plaintiffs lack \nstanding. As noted in the judiciary report, pages 9 and 10, the powers \nof the judiciary under article III of the Constitution traditionally \nhave been limited by the constitutional doctrine that a lawsuit cannot \nbe considered by the Federal courts unless a plaintiff can demonstrate \nthat he or she has standing to bring litigation. Under current Supreme \nCourt doctrine, the plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an \ninjury, in fact that the injury is traceable to the alleged unlawful \nconduct, and that the relief sought would redress the injury. The \nJudiciary Committee report asserts that it would be vastly improbable \nthat a litigant could meet these standards.\n  Again, I do not agree with that report. Assistant Attorney General \nWalter Dellinger provided the following examples of individuals who \nwould have standing.\n  If a crime bill authorizes forfeitures, it thereby increases Federal \nrevenue. A criminal defendant would have standing to challenge a \nforfeiture on the grounds that the bill was passed by voice vote rather \nthan by a rollcall vote as required by the balanced budget amendment.\n  Another example from Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger is \nthat if the President were to reduce Social Security benefits in order \nto address the balanced budget amendment, a Social Security recipient \nwould have standing to challenge the President's decision.\n  It is not too difficult to contemplate other scenarios. If welfare \nbenefits are cut by the President, a welfare recipient could challenge \nthe authority of the President to do so. At least that is the risk. If \nthe President declines to cut welfare benefits, a State could challenge \nthe President's failure to do so. If a State terminates a highway \nimprovement contract because the President cut Federal funds, it is \nlikely that both the State and the contractor would have standing to \nchallenge the President's actions.\n   [[Page S3040]] In each of these cases, the litigant, whether an \nindividual, a company or a State would have standing because the \nlitigant could meet all three elements of the test of standing: The \nentity suffered an injury in fact, No. 1; the injury was clearly \ntraceable to the action or inaction under the balanced budget \namendment, No. 2; and, No. 3, the relief sought, which would be \ninvalidating the action or mandating a tax or expenditure, would \nredress the injury.\n  As Senator Johnston noted on February 15, the experience of the \nStates with balanced budget amendments demonstrates the likelihood that \nthe court will find standing to institute lawsuits under the balanced \nbudget amendment as reflected in litigation that is taking place in \nLouisiana, Georgia, Wisconsin, and California. Some have suggested \nthat, because the States did not experience a flood of litigation, \nthere is nothing to worry about. Again, I do not agree.\n  As former Solicitor General and Harvard Law School Professor Charles \nFried noted, and quoting him:\n\n       The experience of State court adjudication under State \n     constitutional provisions that require balanced budgets and \n     impose debt limitation shows that courts can get intimately \n     involved in the budget process and that they almost certainly \n     will.\n\n  Madam President, it would only take one or two well-placed cases a \nyear to create budgetary chaos during the years that it would take from \nthe time the lawsuit was initiated to the time that it was resolved by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. It does not take but one case \nto put clouds over a whole issue, such as bond issues or Treasury \nnotes.\n  I do not think we are thinking through what we are doing here in not \nputting an amendment in here that makes this judicial review clear and \nmakes it clear where the limitations are.\n  Madam President, some have contended that a constitutional provision \ngoverning judicial review is not necessary because Congress can \nrestrict judicial review by statute in the future. Again, I dissent. I \ndo not agree.\n  In the first place, there is no guarantee that such limitations would \nbe placed in the implementing legislation. If we believe judicial \nreview should be restricted under this constitutional amendment, we \nneed to say that and we need to say it now before we pass it and before \nthe States vote on it.\n  Second, although the courts have sustained certain statutory \nlimitations on judicial review of statutory and common law rights, \nthere is no case in which the Supreme Court has held that Congress \ncould cut off all avenues of judicial review of a constitutional issue.\n  If there is, I want someone to show it to me. Where is the case by \nthe Supreme Court that says Congress can cut off the right of the \nSupreme Court to issue a ruling on the Constitution of the United \nStates? I have not seen that ruling.\n  As noted in the highly respected analysis of the Constitution \nprepared by the Congressional Research Service:\n\n       [T]hat the Congress may through the exercise of its powers \n     vitiate and overturn constitutional decisions and restrain \n     the right of constitutional rights is an assertion often made \n     but not sustained by any decision of the court.\n\n  Let me read that again. The Congressional Research Service says:\n\n       [T]hat Congress may through the exercise of its power \n     vitiate and overturn constitutional decisions and restrain \n     the exercise of constitutional rights is an assertion often \n     made but not sustained by any decision of the court.\n\n  Madam President, the only way to ensure the validity of legislation \nrestricting jurisdiction on a constitutional matter is to expressly \nrestrict judicial review in the text of the constitutional amendment. \nIf we do not do that, we are inviting litigation, we are inviting \njudicial chaos, and we are inviting at least a risk of the fundamental \noverturning of the balance of powers and the separation of powers \nbetween our branches of Government.\n  I do not believe a conservative body wants to do that. I just cannot \nbelieve we want to do that, particularly since we passed the same \namendment last year and we have rejected it this year, which is even \nmore of an invitation for the courts to construe that we really are \ninviting judicial review. It is inconceivable to me that we are not \ngoing to get 50 votes to make this clear. It is really literally \ninconceivable.\n  Some have asked, ``How can we have a balanced budget amendment and \nhow can it be enforced without judicial review?''\n  The first thing I would say on that, Madam President, is that we all \ntake an oath to abide by the Constitution. That is part of the oath \nthat we subscribe to when we come into this body. I do not believe that \nMembers of this body will intentionally violate that oath, nor do I \nbelieve they will risk the wrath of their constituents by violating the \nConstitution.\n  We may have 60 Senators who decide it is not a year for a balanced \nbudget under this amendment, but that is in keeping with the amendment. \nThat is not in defiance of it. It is permitted under the amendment.\n  If Congress finds that such judicial review is desirable, it can \ntailor a statute to meet particular requirements.\n  I have heard people say, ``You don't need to propose it in this \namendment because we can come back by statute and do this.'' It seems \nto me that that is simply not the case. I do not agree with that.\n  But I do believe that if we pass this amendment and then we decide \nthat we want some judicial review--I probably will not want it--but if \nsome people decide it, then there is no reason they cannot propose it, \nbecause this amendment permits the Congress to grant judicial review by \nstatute if the Congress decides to do so.\n  So we can tailor a statute to meet requirements in the future. We \nwill have all the flexibility we need to meet that.\n  Under my amendment, Congress can decide based on experience what \nremedies are best--whether judicial review should include only \ndeclaratory relief or whether it should include injunctions; whether it \nshould be directed only at spending or whether it should include taxes. \nOn the latter, I certainly will adamantly oppose any kind of judicial \nreview that gives the courts the power to set spending or to set taxes. \nThese are decisions Congress should make and it should be made based on \nexperience.\n  The amendment in its present form, I believe, is defective because it \nfails to address these issues. It leaves the whole situation ambiguous.\n  In fact, as I have said, it leaves it worse than ambiguous because we \nare now debating essentially the same constitutional amendment we had \nlast year. Last year, the Danforth amendment, which precluded this kind \nof judicial review without expressed statute, was passed. It was part \nof that amendment. This year, it has been expressly defeated on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. And I would submit that any Federal judge \nwould look at that that wants to get involved and they would say, \n``There is our invitation that Congress clearly could have precluded \nit. They consciously precluded it last year, 1994, and they did not \npreclude it in 1959.'' And some of the authors of the amendment on the \nHouse side even invited this kind of judicial review.\n  Madam President, I know that many of my colleagues have grave \nreservations about this overall balanced budget amendment because of \nits impact on congressional spending powers. I understand these \nconcerns, but, frankly, I think that we are down to the point where we \nhave about 40 years of experience and without a constitutional \namendment we have simply not come to grips with our fiscal problems.\n  It is my hope that I can vote for this constitutional amendment. But \nI will not be able to vote for it unless we make it clear that the \njudiciary of this country is not going to tax and spend and we are not \ngoing to change our form of Government back door by a constitutional \namendment that is ambiguous on this question.\n  I understand the concerns that people have, many concerns about what \nwill happen in various forms of spending under this constitutional \namendment. Those concerns are legitimate. Many of those concerns, \nhowever, go to the question of whether we are going to ever have a \nbalanced budget at all under any such kind of provision.\n  I also understand and have great identification with the view \nexpressed by those who supported the Reid amendment on the Social \nSecurity exclusion. Some people have described that, in my view, \ncertainly from my \n[[Page S3041]]  perspective, erroneously as being an amendment that \nsays we are not going to touch Social Security. Far from it. My view \nand my position on that is the Social Security system has to be dealt \nwith. I do not think we have to do anything that hurts people on Social \nSecurity now, or those about to retire. But we cannot continue to \nborrow the money from the Social Security trust fund every year, put it \nin the operating fund, and then put a Treasury bill in the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Not only are we doing that, this constitutional amendment, unless we \ndeal with that--and we are not dealing with it now because the Reid \namendment was defeated--this constitutional amendment basically \ninvites, it invites raiding the trust fund. Because it defines debt as \nbeing debt held by the public. Trust fund debt, putting a Treasury bill \nin the trust fund, is not debt held by the public. And we have what \nprobably is inadvertent--I hope it is inadvertent--we have an \ninadvertent provision here in this amendment that basically invites \nbuilding up more surpluses in the trust fund because you can borrow \nthose funds with impunity from the operating fund and it does not \nrequire 60 votes.\n  Now I think that is another flaw that needs to be dealt with. And I \nwould think the authors of this amendment would want to deal with these \nflaws. But we are about to put something in the Constitution. I know \nthe argument is that if we make any amendment here it has to go back to \nthe House and that causes trouble; it would cost time.\n  Madam President, we are about to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates. We are about to put a provision in here that may be here 50 \nyears from now, 100 years from now, or 200 years from now. I cannot \nconceive of passing something that we believe or a majority believe is \nflawed in an effort to get something through in a rapid fashion.\n  I hope that we will deal with Social Security also, because, if we do \nnot, Madam President, in spite of the fact that the 2002 date may be \nmet--and I hope it is under this, if it is passed and ratified by the \nStates; that is we, by the definition of this amendment, may have a \nbalanced budget in 2002--and that would be an improvement, certainly an \nimprovement over the present situation--it really will not be a balance \nbecause we will be borrowing about $100 billion that year from the \nSocial Security trust fund and that will count as a balance. We will \nput a Treasury bill in the Social Security trust fund and then we will \nsay that we have met the balance.\n  And yet, by the year 2013 or 2014, in that neighborhood, the general \noperating fund will owe the Social Security trust fund about $3 \ntrillion. We will do that. We will have that kind of debt to the Social \nSecurity trust fund even if we meet the mandate in this balanced budget \namendment by 2002. And even if we have a balanced budget amendment in \n2002, 2003, or 2004, if we meet it every year, we are still going to be \nrolling up debt. We are still going to have an operating budget that is \nout of balance because we are operating by borrowing from the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Not only the principal; we are borrowing the interest. What happens \nwhen the baby boomers retire? We will wake up in this country and we \nwill find we owe $3 trillion. We no longer will have three workers for \nevery retiree. We will be moving 2\\1/2\\ down to 2.\n  At some point in the 2020's what we will have to do in order to have \na Social Security fund be able to meet its payments, we will have to \nbegin paying back that $3 trillion. Guess what happens then? We will be \nable to say for a few more years the Social Security trust fund can \nmeet its obligations, but the general fund is going to have to borrow \nmoney, or we will have to tax people much, much greater than we are \ntaxing now. In fact, the tax rates could become almost unbearable and \nalmost unworkable in that situation.\n  Now, I have to say that if we deal with this Social Security question \nlike the Reid amendment or some other amendment, and I hope we will, in \nmy opinion, in all honesty, it will take more than 7 years to get the \nbudget balanced. We should not keep the 7-year provision in this bill \nbecause we will have to find another $110 or $120 billion in the year \n2002. It will probably take more like 10 years.\n  But I cannot think of anything more disillusioning to the American \npeople than to go through the whole constitutional action here, pass it \nin the Senate, pass it in the House, pass it in three-fourths of the \nStates, get down do 2002, 2003, 2004 and discover we have been \nborrowing money from the Social Security every year and that we still \ndo not really have a balanced operational budget.\n  Only in the macro sense will we have the economic effect, but we will \nbe rolling up debt after debt after debt. We will owe $3 trillion by \nthe time many of our children will be getting to the point they retire. \nThat is going to be very, very disturbing.\n  It is my hope that we will deal with both of these matters. On the \nSocial Security I know there are a lot of people who feel that way. If \nwe do not deal with it here, it will come up over and over and over \nagain this year. We will be caught in a catch-22. We will be caught in \na catch-22.\n  I may not vote against this amendment because of Social Security, \nalthough I may. I have not decided that. I certainly know that I am not \ngoing to be able to support this unless we deal with the judicial part \nof this judicial review.\n  Assuming we pass this, we are going to be dealing with it, they will \ncontinue big efforts on the floor of the House and the Senate to get \nSocial Security out of here--not because Social Security itself does \nnot have to be addressed. It does. We will have to address it \nseparately. We should be addressing the Social Security system not as a \nway of building up surpluses that mask the true size of the Federal \ndeficit. We ought to be dealing with it to preserve the integrity of \nthat fund over a long period of time, and to make sure that our elderly \npeople are fully protected. I am afraid that is not the way we will go.\n  Madam President, one final thought. The way this amendment is worded \nnow where it is only debt held by the public that counts in terms of \ndebt, what we have is a major enticement for a loophole in this \namendment. The loophole is, if we create more surplus in the trust \nfunds, the Social Security trust fund, the airport trust fund, the \nhighway trust fund, where our gas taxes go, the more surpluses we build \nup in there, the less we are going to have to do on deficits because \nthose surpluses can be borrowed under the provisions of this amendment \nwith impunity.\n  They will not count as deficit. They will not count as debt. I think \nthat is a major mistake. I think it is a real flaw in this amendment. I \nthink it will come back to haunt us. If this passes and is ratified we \nwill have people--year after year, and at some point it will probably \npass--come to the point where they say we are not going to continue to \nuse these Social Security surpluses. We will stop that.\n  It may happen on the budget resolution. At some point, the people of \nthis country will find out and we will pass that kind of recusal. It \nmay be on a budget resolution, and then we will be in the dilemma. We \nwill have 7 years to get the budget balanced under this constitutional \namendment.\n  We are not going to be able to change that by statute. We will not be \nable to meet the requirements, because at some point we are going to \ncome to our senses and quit borrowing that Social Security trust fund \neach and every year. Then we will be in a situation, I predict, where \nwe will not be able to meet the requirements of the balanced budget \namendment by 2002, setting off a whole other round of disillusioned \npeople out there, wondering if we will ever be able to deal with our \nfiscal problems responsibly.\n  Madam President, I point these flaws out because I am one who hopes \nto be able to support this constitutional amendment as a last resort. I \nthink having a constitutional amendment to deal with fiscal matters and \nbudgetary questions is really a tragedy. I think it is an indictment of \nour entire political process that we are at this point. But we are at \nthis point.\n  I am one of those who would, if we have the right provisions in this \namendment, I will vote for it. If we do not, it will be very difficult, \nbut I will have to cast my vote no. The judicial part to me is \nenormously important, as I have said over and over again in this \npresentation, and I have said it privately to my colleagues, and I have \nsaid it in many different forums. The \n[[Page S3042]]  last thing we need added to our budgetary difficulties \nin this country is to have Federal judges setting tax and spending \npolicy.\n  Madam President, I understand both of my amendments are now in order \nand are sequenced, and I will be entitled to have votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have listened carefully to the comments \nof my colleague. I have to say that I am disappointed he feels the way \nhe does because I believe that the amendment that he offers does not \naccomplish what he wants to accomplish anyway.\n  Declaratory relief can be just as intrusive as an injunction. When a \ncourt declares a statute unconstitutional, it has the same effect as \nenjoining the Constitution. Exactly the same thing.\n  My dear friend and colleague, who I have a great deal of admiration \nfor and who I respect very much, seems to agree that the standing \ndoctrine would give the courts the ability to interfere with the \nbudgetary process, but because it is a possibility that the courts \nmight interfere, certainly not a probability under anybody's viewpoint, \nthat he would like to see that changed. Well, that may be. Others would \nlike to not see it changed.\n  The Senator cited Missouri versus Jenkins. I have to say Missouri \nversus Jenkins is a 14th amendment case. The 14th amendment only \napplies to States. Frankly, it does not apply to the Federal \nGovernment. We have never had a ruling from the Supreme Court that \napplies to budgetary policy or macroeconomic policy in that sense, \nwhere the courts will tell a Federal Government to tax and spend.\n  The courts have maintained an aloofness from that. It is not a \nquestion in the mind of most who look at it. Missouri versus Jenkins is \nan example, but that case only applies to the States. As I say, it is a \n14th amendment school desegregation case. The court in Jenkins noted \nthat its result does not duplicate coequal branches or implicate \ncoequal branches of government. There is no way that that case applies.\n  In fact, even that case is under severe questioning by almost \neverybody in law today as having gone too far, even though it was a \ndesegregation case, which is considerably different from what we are \ntalking about here.\n  I am confident, and I have no doubt at all, that we can deal with the \njudicial activism problem through implementing legislation. Here are \nsome examples, the Norris-La Guardia Act, it is in effect today where \nCongress prohibited courts from enjoining labor disputes. We abide by \nit to this day because the courts were enjoining labor disputes. In \ncontract and a whole variety of other areas, the courts were \ninterfering. But the Congress decided to limit the jurisdiction of the \ncourts and to this day we have abided by that limitation. The Anti-\nInjunction Act, prohibiting courts from enjoining collection of taxes.\n  We will, in the Judiciary Committee, make it a top priority, and \ncertainly it will be a top priority of mine, to draft implementing \nlegislation to deal with this matter. I hope my colleague will not get \nhimself in such a position that he cannot vote for this when it is the \nbest he is ever going to see under those circumstances.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is a fine-tuned law. It \nmanages to strike the delicate balance between reviewability by the \ncourts and limitations on the court's ability to interfere with \ncongressional authority. But the proposed amendment could destroy that \nbalance and endanger the ability of the balanced budget amendment to \neffectuate real change in the way Congress does business.\n  The Nunn amendment, which is virtually identical to Senator \nDanforth's amendment of last year to the balanced budget amendment, \nwould limit judicial remedies to declaratory judgments or such remedies \nthat Congress specifies in implementing legislation.\n  If the purpose of the Nunn amendment is to prevent judicial activism, \nto prohibit the courts from ordering the raising of taxes, the cutting \nof spending programs, or the slashing of the Federal budget, as a \nvehicle it does not accomplish its aim. Simply put, in many \ncircumstances a declaratory judgment can be as intrusive as an \ninjunction. Consider a hypothetical situation where a Federal spending \nprogram is unconstitutional. Whether a court restrains the \nimplementation of the program by injunction or declares that program \nunconstitutional, the effect is the same: The agency will not enforce \nthe program.\n  The intrusive nature of declaratory relief was at least implicitly \nrecognized by Justice Felix Frankfurter in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. \n549 (1946). In writing for the majority, Justice Frankfurter opined \nthat a declatory judgment is a statutory equitable remedy that should \nonly be granted when standards for granting an injunction are met.\n  Moreover, I fear that expressly permitting declaratory relief in \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 may be construed by some activist court as a \nconstitutional invitation to interfere in the budgetary process--the \nvery situation that Senator Nunn seeks to avoid.\n  Finally, I believe this amendment is unnecessary. The long existing \nand well-recognized precepts of standing, justiciability, separation of \npowers, as well as the political question doctrine, refrain courts from \ninterfering with the budgetary process. Furthermore, as a further \nsafeguard against judicial activism, pursuant to both article III of \nthe Constitution and section 6 of House Joint Resolution 1, Congress \nmay limit the jurisdiction of courts and the remedies that courts may \nprovide. The Judiciary Committee will study this and draft implementing \nlegislation to prevent undue judicial activism. The proper\n place to do this is in implementing legislation and not in the body of \na constitutional amendment. No constitutional provision presently \ncontains a jurisdictional limitation on courts.\n\n  Let me explain at greater length why I think the Nunn amendment is \nunnecessary:\n\n\n                          judicial enforcement\n\n  First let me state that I wholeheartedly agree with former Attorney \nGeneral William P. Barr, who stated that if House Joint Resolution 1 is \nratified there is:\n\n       * * * little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micro- management or superintendence \n     of the Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent \n     such judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself \n     equips Congress to correct the problem by statute. On \n     balance, moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that \n     courts will play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the \n     amendment, that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by \n     the benefits of such an amendment.\n\n\n                 congress' power to restrain the courts\n\n  In order to resist the ambition of the courts, the Framers gave to \nCongress in article III of the Constitution the authority to limit the \njurisdiction of the courts and the type of remedies the courts may \nrender. If Congress truly fears certain courts may decide to ignore law \nand precedent, Congress--if it finds it necessary--may, through \nimplementing legislation, forbid courts the use of their injunctive \npowers altogether. Or Congress could create an exclusive cause of \naction or tribunal with carefully limited powers, satisfactory to \nCongress, to deal with balanced budget complaints.\n  But Congress should not, as the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nproposes, limit judicial review to declaratory judgments. I believe \nthat House Joint Resolution 1 strikes the right balance in terms of \njudicial review. By remaining silent about judicial review in the \namendment itself, its authors have refused to establish congressional \nsanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in fundamental \nmacroeconomic and budgetary questions. At the same time, this balanced \nbudget amendment does not undermine the court's equally fundamental \nobligation, as first stated in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 \n(1803), to ``say what the law is.'' After all, while I am confident \nthat courts will not be able to interfere with our budgetary \nprerogatives, I am frank enough to say I cannot predict every \nconceivable lawsuit which might arise under this amendment, and which\n does not implicate these budgetary prerogatives. A litigant, in such \nnarrow circumstances, if he or she can demonstrate standing, ought to \nbe able to have their case heard.\n\n  It is simply wrong to assume that Congress would just sit by in the \nunlikely event that a court would commit some overreaching act. Believe \nme, Congress knows how to defend itself. \n[[Page S3043]]  Congress knows how to restrict the jurisdiction of \ncourts or limit the scope of judicial remedies. But I do not think this \nnecessary. Lower courts follow precedent, and the precepts of standing, \nseparation of powers, and the political question doctrine effectively \nlimit the ability of courts to interfere in the budgetary process.\n  Nevertheless, if necessary, a shield against judicial interference is \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 itself. Under this section, \nCongress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any purported \nbudgetary shortfall, such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency fund. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear \nthat Congress, if it finds it necessary, could limit the type of \nremedies a court may grant or limit courts' jurisdiction in some other \nmanner to proscribe judicial overreaching. This is not at all a new \ndevice; Congress has adopted such limitations in other circumstances \npursuant to its article III authority.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit judicial review to particular \nspecial tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. Such a \ntribunal was set up as recently as the Reagan administration, which \nneeded a special claims tribunal to settle claims on Iranian assets.\n  Beyond which, in the virtually impossible scenario where these \nsafeguards fail, Congress can take whatever action it must to moot any \ncase in which a risk of judicial overreaching becomes real.\n\n\n        standing, separation of powers, and political questions\n\n  There exists three basic constraints which prevent the courts from \ninterfering in the budgetary process. First, limitations on Federal \ncourts contained in article III of the Constitution, primarily the \ndoctrine of ``standing.'' Second, the deference courts owe to Congress \nunder both the political question doctrine and section 6 of the \namendment itself, which confers enforcement authority in Congress. \nThird, the limits on judicial remedies which can be imposed on a \ncoordinate branch of government--in this case, of course, the \nlegislative branch. These are limitations on remedies that are self-\nimposed by courts and that, in appropriate circumstances, may be \nimposed on the courts by Congress. These limitations, such as the \ndoctrine of separation of powers, prohibit courts from raising taxes, a \npower exclusively delegated\n to Congress by the Constitution and not altered by the balanced budget \namendment.\n\n  Consequently, contrary to the contention of opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, separation of power concerns further the purpose of \nthe amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance the budget \nfalls squarely on the shoulders of Congress--which is consistent with \nthe intent of the Framers of the Constitution that all budgetary \nmatters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n\n\n                                standing\n\n  Concerning the doctrine of ``standing,'' it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must first demonstrate standing to \nsue. To demonstrate article III standing, a litigant at a minimum must \nmeet three requirements that were enunciated by the Supreme Court in \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (19920: First, Injury in \nfact--that the litigant suffered some concrete and particularized \ninjury; second, traceability--that the concrete injury was both caused \nby and is traceable to the unlawful conduct; and third, \nredressibility--that the relief sought will redress the alleged injury. \nIt is a large hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate the ``injury in \nfact'' requirement; that is, something more concrete than a \n``generalized grievance'' and burden shared by all citizens and \ntaxpayers.\n  Even in the vastly improbable case where an ``injury in fact'' was \nestablished, a litigant would find it nearly impossible to establish \nthe ``traceability'' and ``redressibility'' requirements of the article \nIII standing test. After all, there will be hundreds and hundreds of \nFederal spending programs even after Federal spending is brought under \ncontrol. Furthermore, because the Congress would have numerous options \nto achieve balanced budget compliance, there would be no legitimate \nbasis for a court to nullify or modify a specific spending measure \nobjected to by the litigant.\n  As to the ``redressibility'' prong, this requirement would be \ndifficult to meet simply because courts are wary of becoming involved \nin the budget process--which is legislative in nature--and separation \nof power concerns will prevent courts from specifying adjustments to \nany Federal program or expenditures. Thus, for this reason, Missouri v. \nJenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), where the Supreme Court upheld a district \ncourt's power to order a local school district to levy taxes to support \na desegregation plan, is inapposite. Plainly put, the Jenkins case is \nnot applicable to the balanced budget amendment because section 1 of \nthe 14th amendment--from which the judiciary derives its power to rule \nagainst the States in equal protection claims--does\n not apply to the Federal Government and because the separation of \npowers doctrine prevents judicial encroachments on Congress' bailiwick. \nCourts simply will not have the authority to order Congress to raise \ntaxes.\n\n\n                           political question\n\n  The well-established political question and justifiability doctrines \nwill mandate that courts give the greatest deference to congressional \nbudgetary measures, particularly since section 6 of House Joint \nResolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress the responsibility of \nenforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows Congress to ``rely on \nestimates of outlays and receipts.'' Under these circumstances, it is \nextremely unlikely that a court would substitute its judgment for that \nof Congress.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the ``taxpayer'' standing case, Flast v. Cohen, 392 \nU.S. 83 (1968), is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. The Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court to \nestablishment clause cases. Also, Flast is, by its own terms, limited \nto cases challenging taxes created for an illicit purpose.\n  I also believe that there would be no so-called congressional \nstanding for Members of Congress to commence actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Because Members of Congress would not be able to \ndemonstrate that they were ``harmed in fact'' by any dilution or \nnullification of their vote--and because under the doctrine of \n``equitable discretion,'' Members would not be able to show that \nsubstantial relief could not otherwise be obtained from fellow \nlegislators through the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a statute--\nit is hardly likely that Members of Congress would have standing to \nchallenge actions under the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that the enforcement concerns \nabout the balanced budget amendment do not amount to a hill of beans. \nThe fear of the demon of judicial interference is exorcised by the \nreality of over a century of constitutional doctrines that prevent \nunelected courts from interfering with the power of the democratic \nbranch of Government and that bestow Congress with the means to protect \nits prerogatives.\n  Madam President, I will over the weekend try to answer every question \nthat he has raised because I know that he is raising sincere questions. \nWe have answered some of them, but we will answer all of them.\n  I hope he will keep his options open, because this is no small \nmatter. We have worked on this ever since I have been in the Senate. It \nhas been Democrats and Republicans. We have no way of pleasing \neverybody in this body or that body. It has taken a consensus. It has \ntaken the work of literally hundreds of us to get to this point.\n  I wish I could accommodate every Senator who wants to change \nsomething here, but I cannot. Anybody who says that Social Security \ndebt is not public debt I do not think understands the budget. The fact \nof the matter is we owe that as the Federal Government, and we owe it \nto the public from whom it is borrowed. And that is every senior \ncitizen in this country that will exist at the time those notes come \ndue.\n  But be that as it may, we have done the best we can. I believe the \namendment will be voted up next Tuesday, but if it is voted down, so be \nit. I have lived with it as long as anybody. I have done everything I \npossibly can to satisfy everybody. So has Senator Simon and others who \nhave worked on this, \n[[Page S3044]]  and there is just no way we can do that.\n  Frankly, it is a choice between doing nothing, again, or doing what \nwe can do. That is what it comes down to. I think when the votes are \ncast next Tuesday, we are going to do what we can do because everybody \nhere knows we have to take drastic action. We can no longer afford to \nlet this thing go; we just no longer can afford to do it.\n  I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Georgia, and I would \nlike to accommodate him in every way. I wish I could. I always try to \ndo that with him because he is one of the great Senators here, and I am \nnot just saying that. I know that and I feel that, and he is my friend. \nBut I just plain do not believe that a constitutional case can be made \nthat will allow the courts to interfere in the budgetary process of the \nCongress without the Congress slapping the living daylights out of the \ncourts.\n  I suppose anything is possible, but with the amendment that he has, \ndeclaratory judgment relief may put us in a bigger bind than not having \nit there at all. That is why I did not like that last year, to be \nhonest with you. It would be a lot better for us to work on restricting \nthe jurisdiction of the court, which we can do, as we did in the \nNorris-LaGuardia Act, and a number of other cases, and do it in a \nstraight-up, intentionally good way. It would pass overwhelmingly if \nnot unanimously in both bodies. We can do that and do it right without \nscuttling the one chance in history to get spending under control and \nto get our priorities under control, part of which the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia and I would fight our guts out for, and that is \nthe national security interests of this country.\n  The only way we are ever going to get to that point where we really \nstart being concerned in the Federal Government about the real \npriorities of government, especially the Federal Government, is to have \nthis consensus, have it written into the Constitution whereby we have a \nrule that requires us to do something. This is our chance.\n  If I could make it perfect, I would do that. There are ways that I \nwould write this differently if I were the sole arbiter or dictator in \nthis body. I am sure that is true with just about everybody in this \nbody. But we come to a point sometimes in this life where we have to do \nthe best we can.\n  Frankly, if the distinguished Senator insists on having these \namendments added to it, we lose votes otherwise. And we lose anyway if \nhis vote is the deciding vote in this matter, and it very well may be--\nI suspect it is--or at least comes close to being. I am not going to \ngive up no matter who votes against this.\n  To make a long story short, I wish I could accommodate him. So do a \nlot of others. I would always accommodate my friend from Georgia, if I \ncould. But we always have 535 people we have to accommodate around here \nif we do that.\n  Look, I believe we have done the best job we can to bring an \namendment to the floor of both Houses. This amendment has passed \nbefore. I believe my colleague has voted for it before. The last one \ndid have this declaratory judgment in, and I did not like that and \nneither did a lot of others, but we swallowed hard and took it at that \ntime because the Senate had to pass it, and we did not pass it, by the \nway. We lost by four votes. It did not work. We did get Senator \nDanforth. But the fact of the matter is, it did not pass.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Utah. I know how hard he has worked \non this. I do know, having managed bills on the floor, that you cannot \naccommodate everyone. I understand that. You have to count the votes \nand make those judgments. I respect that.\n  As my friend knows, I have immense respect for him and his leadership \nin this matter and on every other matter. The reason I put in the \nDanforth amendment, as you know, the Johnston amendment had nothing in \nit about declaratory judgment, and that was voted down. The Danforth \namendment had been accepted. I would just as soon have left out the \ndeclaratory judgment part. That was put in because that amendment was \naccepted by the Senator from Utah and the Senate last year.\n  I have another amendment here that basically says:\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article except as \n     may be specifically authorized by legislation adopted \n     pursuant to this section.\n\n  I am perfectly willing to modify my amendment and substitute this, \nwhich leaves out any reference to declaratory judgment. I can do that \nnow, or if you want to look it over.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to say that is preferable. But I also have to say, \nI think that my friend knows how I feel about him; I do not have a \nperson I look up to more than my friend from Georgia in this whole \nbody. But I am worried if my friend insists that either language has to \ngo in here--I would like to accommodate him--but if he insists on it, I \nthink this battle may well be over, because even if we could pass it \nhere, I am not sure we can over there.\n  They have done a good job. It comes down to doing the best we can. I \nhave to say, I can make this amendment more perfect. I can give you a \nvariety of ways of doing that, but I cannot get a consensus to go with \nme. It has been a hard thing for me, too.\n  Look, I spent my lifetime, as the distinguished Senator has, in the \nlaw. I hold the ABA rating for Martindale-Hubbell, and I really feel \ndeeply about the law. I feel deeply that we could write other things in \nhere that might make it more perfect--no doubt about it--but I cannot \nget a consensus. I hope my friend will consider that because we worked \nour guts out to get this here. This is the last chance I think we may \never have to pass it.\n  I have to say that that amendment, even if that were accepted, would \ndo very little more than what we can do by doing good implementing \nlegislation afterwards. And I promise my friend that I will write that \nwith him to his satisfaction and help get it through both Houses of \nCongress, and I think we can do it before the summer is up.\n  But let me tell you, I think it will work just as well as any other \nchange where we have limited jurisdiction of the courts. I will work \ntogether with him to do that. I do not think my friend has any doubt \nthat Congress is going to zealously guard its rights. If any court--if \nany court--tries to infringe on our budgetary process, we are going to \nslap that court down so fast their heads are going to be spinning.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Utah, I have two problems with that \nargument. If Congress is going to zealously guard this right, this is \nthe time to do it when we are amending the Constitution, because once \nyou have put it in the Constitution, you have elevated the whole matter \nto the judges and the judges then decide their responsibility and their \nduties under the Constitution. And there is no case that indicates that \nthe Supreme Court is willing for Congress to make the final decision \nabout which jurisdiction the courts have in interpreting the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. There are a lot of cases--I will try to look them up for \nthe Senator--where the court has deferred completely to Congress, and \nin every budgetary case of congressional budgetmaking, the courts have \nstayed out of them.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend, I think he is absolutely sincere in \nthat, and I hope his legal arguments will prevail both in this body and \nin the courts if this amendment becomes law.\n  I also will say, those who passed the 14th amendment to the \nConstitution that resulted in an interpretation in the Jenkins versus \nMissouri case, I suspect those people would have been shocked to find \nthat the Federal courts used the 14th amendment to require a State to \nraise taxes.\n  I doubt very seriously if any of the authors of the 14th amendment \nanticipated that later on the Federal courts were going to require a \nState to raise taxes. I think they would have been in pretty much the \nsame position you are in now. They would have argued vigorously that it \nwould never happen. But it did happen. I think it could happen in this \nmanner. It may even be more likely here in dealing with budgetary \nmatters and putting an explicit provision into the Constitution.\n  Mr. HATCH. If my friend will yield, I think that is not a great \nconcern. I will \n[[Page S3045]]  tell you why. First of all, Jenkins versus Missouri was \na desegregation case where the court decided to enforce desegregation \nthe way it did, and it used the 14th amendment, which only applies to \nthe States. It cannot be used to apply to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. NUNN. This amendment can.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really. In section 6, it says, ``Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.'' In \nother words, we have constitutional impetus. If my friend would work \nwith me to come up with implementing legislation that would restrict \nthe courts--which it will--and which will pass overwhelmingly in both \nbodies, we have the total authority and direction under this amendment \nto do that. I cannot imagine any court in the land that would ignore \nthat mandate in a constitutional amendment; I just cannot.\n  Mr. NUNN. My problem is, I say to my friend--and I know he is an \neminent legal scholar, but there are other constitutional scholars, \nsuch as Nicholas Katzenbach, Robert Bork, Mr. Freed, Larry Tribe, and a \nnumber of others, who fundamentally disagree with that analysis.\n  Mr. HATCH. But they cannot disagree with the fact that, look, there \nis no provision in the Constitution today, and neither will this be a \nprovision, that will limit judicial review. That is a premise I think \nwe have to agree with.\n  Mr. NUNN. The 11th amendment to the Constitution is an explicit part \nof the Constitution, and it does limit judicial review. It says:\n\n       ``The Judicial power of the United States shall not be \n     construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced \n     or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of \n     another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign \n     State.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. We are talking about implementing legislation mandated by \na constitutional amendment that allows us--in fact, mandates us--to \ncome up with implementing legislation to enforce this article. That is \ndifferent from that. I agree the courts can have judicial review--I do \nnot think there is any question about that--on anything they want to \ntake jurisdiction of, but they have to abide by section 6. ``The \nCongress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation.'' And they will abide by that. I do not think Judge Bork \nor Freed or Dellinger, any of them, would say that is not going to be \nabided by if you and I and we pass it through Congress, do legislation \nimplementing this that says the courts do not have the power to do so.\n  Mr. NUNN. My problem is, that is a big ``if.'' If we cannot do it now \nbecause there are people who oppose it here, and if we cannot make this \nclear now when you and I both agree that we do not want the courts \ninvolved in this, what makes the Senator believe we can do it by \nstatute?\n  Mr. HATCH. It would be easy to do by statute because I believe----\n  Mr. NUNN. Why, when one of the authors of the amendment on the House \nside says he wants judicial review? Evidently, there are people over on \nthe House side that want judicial review. Otherwise, the Senator would \nnot be in the box he is in, in terms of not being able to get this \namendment accepted.\n  Mr. HATCH. He was a cosponsor of the amendment. He is not even an \nattorney. He is an intelligent person but not a constitutional scholar. \nI do not think that anybody doubts that his comment that he wants \njudicial review means a doggone thing.\n  Mr. NUNN. To get legislation passed, we do not have to get 50 percent \nof the constitutional scholars, we have to get 50 percent of the people \nvoting.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. I do not think the Senator from Georgia doubts for \na minute that we can get 51 percent in each body to pass implementing \nlegislation that would limit the jurisdiction of the courts in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would not have doubted it until we started debating this \nseveral days ago and, to my surprise, I saw the Johnston amendment \ndefeated. I would not have doubted it until then. I cannot conceive a \nU.S. Senate--now a conservative majority--leaving in an ambiguity about \nwhether the Federal courts are going to be given the license or \ninvitation to take over taxing and spending decisions under a \nconstitutional amendment. I could not conceive that until 2 weeks ago.\n  Mr. HATCH. Remember that I as the manager of the bill led the fight \nto defeat that amendment. I will lead the fight to make sure the \nimplementing legislation does what the Senator from Georgia wants it to \ndo.\n  There is no way that this amendment solves every problem with regard \nto budgeting or with regard to balancing the budget that can possibly \ncome up. There is no way you can do that without writing a 300-page \nstatute. And even then you cannot do it.\n  So what I am saying is that I hope my colleague will at least let me \nwork on answering his questions over the weekend. I hope he will look \nat the answer and keep his powder dry on this and look at the fact that \nwe have done our single best--our collective best, really--to come up \nwith an amendment that is the only one we can come up with. It will \nwork. We can implement it.\n  The implementing language can be the way the Senator would like it to \nbe, I have no doubt in my mind. I do not think the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia has much doubt that we can pass the implementing \nlegislation on this. I have even gotten the acquiescence of the Speaker \nof the House that he will work hard to get it passed. I do not have any \ndoubt at all that we will do that.\n  The Johnston amendment--even if it were accepted--would still have to \nhave implementing legislation one way or the other. We can do what the \nSenator wants done, and I have no doubt that we can--and I do not think \nanybody doubts that, including the Senator from Georgia especially, if \nwe all come together--and still make that giant step to try to get \nspending under control.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend that there is a vast difference in \nhaving to pass implementing legislation in order to block a court from \nexercising jurisdiction and having to pass implementing legislation if \nthey are going to have jurisdiction.\n  If we pass this amendment, the implementing legislation would be \nrequired, but in the absence thereof, the courts would have no \njurisdiction. If we do not pass this amendment, it is my great fear \nthat the courts will have jurisdiction unless we pass implementing \nlegislation; and even if we do, the courts can say that implementing \nlegislation exceeds the powers of Congress to limit their \nconstitutional review because they have jurisdiction over the \nConstitution. When we put this in there, it is an invitation to assert \nthat jurisdiction. Maybe they would not do it. Maybe it would not \nhappen next year or the year after or in 5 years. But we have a risk \nthat at some time this amendment--without clarity on the judicial \nreview provision--could change the balance of powers in this country \nand basically eliminate a whole part of the separation of powers. I do \nnot think the people of this country really want that.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true in every provision in the Constitution. The \ncourts have the right of judicial review if they want to exercise it. \nIf we take that position, we would have to exclude them from everything \nin the Constitution that we do not want them to be involved in. The \nfact is that the courts have been scrupulous, for the most part--other \nthan in Jenkins--in these areas. Jenkins does not apply because it is a \n14th amendment case. But even then it is held in disrepute by most \nscholars because it went too far. Still it was not on point, nor can it \nbe used on point.\n  If we are going to have runaway courts, it will not make any \ndifference what we write into this amendment. The fact is that we have \nto have some faith in the courts that they are going to live within the \nconstraints that the Constitution allows for. In this particular case \nwe have article III, which allows us to restrain or restrict the \njurisdiction of the courts, which I propose we can do in implementing \nlegislation. And we have section 6 here of the amendment, which tells \nus we have to implement this and enforce this legislation.\n  So all I am saying is that I am not sure we are arguing differently. \nI am concerned, just like my friend from Georgia is. But I think we can \nresolve \n[[Page S3046]]  it by working together to get it resolved without \nscuttling the whole effort that has now taken almost 4 solid weeks on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend that I thank him for listening, and I \nthank him for his concern and leadership. I assure him that until the \nfinal vote, I will continue to listen to him and try to work with him. \nIt is my hope, though, that there would be some revisiting going on \nbetween the people who are saying they could not accept this amendment \nand the Senator from Utah, because the people I talked to on the House \nside, including Republican and Democratic leadership--not all of them, \nbut a number--who are leading the way on this amendment, indicate to me \nthis kind of provision would be acceptable and even welcomed by them.\n  Mr. HATCH. Some feel that way, and others do not. That is one of the \nproblems I have.\n  Mr. NUNN. There is a group of those who want the judiciary to \nbasically get involved in these decisions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Those who want to defeat the amendment--there are still \nsome of those, and we have found in the process that there are some of \nthose who even voted for it in the past but who now would like to see \nit defeated.\n  Mr. NUNN. I am not one of those.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not suggesting that.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would like to say that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I hope it is not true. I am counting the Senator is not.\n  The fact is that is the kind of problem we have been faced with. All \nI can say is I am trying to do the best I can as one inferior mortal, \nto try to bring this thing to fruition and try to do the best I can to \nget us to a point where we really have the chance to do something about \nour national debt. To me this is our only chance, and I do not think I \nam standing here alone on that. Even the Senator from Georgia has \nacknowledged that we need something like this to do it. It is just he \nwishes he could write this into it.\n  Mr. NUNN. I wish we did not need it, but we do, I am afraid.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend from Georgia, and we will try to bring \nmore light to this subject as the week goes on.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, in my remarks yesterday I continued \nthe examination of our experience since the advent of contemporary \neconomics in moderating the business cycle and substantially resolving \nthe crisess of capitalism which in the century before World War II was \nwidely seen as implacable and unresolvable. The business cycle of the \nindustrial age with its extraordinary alterations of boom and bust was \na new experience for mankind. Many concluded it was an unacceptable \nexperience--that capitalism had to go; that private ownership had to \ngo. Then a learning process took place and the problem has moderated to \nthe point when it can be said within reason to have been resolved.\n  The swings that we experienced would be near-to-unbelievable today; \ncertainly unacceptable.\n  In 1906, output increased by 11.6 percent, to be followed 2 years \nlater by a decline of 8.2 percent in 1908, and an increase of 16.6 \npercent in 1909.\n  In 1918, output increased by 12.3 percent to be followed by 3 years \nof negative growth including a drop in output of 8.7 percent in 1921.\n  Then came the Great Depression. After increasing by 6.7 percent in \n1929, output fell by 9.9 percent in 1930, another 7.7 percent in 1931, \nand then a further decline of an incredible 14.8 percent in 1932.\n  After World War II all this changed, following a brief adjustment \nperiod, as we converted from a war-time to peace-time economy. Since \nthen the largest reduction in output was 2.2 percent in 1982.\n  In my earlier remarks I attributed the steady growth in the post \nWorld War II period to ``a great achievement in social learning'' which \nwe would put in jeopardy if we adopted the balanced budget amendment.\n  We have learned to moderate the business cycle using the budget as a \ncounter-cyclical tool. We used this knowledge in both Republicans and \nDemocratic administrations. For example, George P. Shultz--one of the \nmost admired public men of his generation--while OMB director in the \nNixon administration put in place expansionary budget policies that \nstimulated the economy following the 1970-71 recession.\n  In my remarks on February 10 and February 13, and again yesterday, I \nindicated that several economists, including staff working for Charles \nShultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter \nadministration, have concluded that if we try to balance the budget in \nthe middle of a recession that the unemployment rate could exceed 10 \npercent--a level that was reached only momentarily, during the 1981-82 \nrecession, in all of the post-World II era.\n  In today's Wall Street Journal, Al Hunt reports on a Treasury \nDepartment study which confirms this analysis for the 1990-92 \nrecession--a mild recession in which the unemployment rate rose from \n5.1 percent in June 1990 to 7.7 percent in June 1992. Analysts at the \nTreasury Department estimate that\n\n       * * * if a balanced budget amendment had been in effect--\n     and the cyclical increase in the deficit had been offset by \n     spending cuts and tax increases--the unemployment rate would \n     have peaked somewhere in the range of 8.3 to 9.4 percent.\n       The implication of this analysis is that employment would \n     have been about 1.5 million lower in mid-1992 * * * if a \n     balanced budget amendment had been in effect.\n\n  Clearly, if the recession had been deeper--in the 1979-82 period the \nunemployment rate increased from 5.6 to 10.8 percent--or if the \nunemployment rate at the beginning of the recession had been higher--\nthe unemployment rate last month was 5.7 percent--then the unemployment \nrate would have increased to more than 10 percent if a balanced budget \namendment had been in effect.\n  The Treasury Department study also analyzed the effects of the \nbalanced budget amendment on the unemployment rate of each State. Even \nin the mild recession of 1990-1992, the unemployment rate could reach \ndouble digits in the following States, many of which are large \nindustrial States:\n  Alaska, 10.6 percent;\n  California, 12.1 percent;\n  Florida, 10.4 percent;\n  Massachusetts, 10.9 percent;\n  Michigan, 10.0 percent;\n  New Jersey, 11.8 percent;\n  My own state of New York, 11.4 percent;\n  Rhode Island, 10.6 percent;\n  West Virginia, 13.5 percent.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nTreasury Department study entitled ``The Balanced Budget Amendment and \nthe Economy'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, and what is our reaction to the \npotential economic impact of the balanced budget amendment? According \nto Louis Uchitelle of the New York Times,\n\n       Such estimates of the potential impact are not emphasized \n     very much, however, in the debate over the balanced budget \n     amendment. So far, the battle has focused on its value as a \n     tool to shrink government or to discipline spending. But if \n     the amendment is enacted, the side effect would be huge: a \n     system that has softened recessions since the 1930's would be \n     dismantled.\n\n  Let me repeat part of this observation: ``if the amendment is \nenacted, the side effect would be huge: a system that has softened \nrecessions since the 1930's would be dismantled.''\n  To put it simply, if ratified, the balanced budget amendment would \nsubstitute budget policies that magnify the business cycle for policies \nthat have dampened cycles in the post World War II period. In the pre-\nWorld War II period the Federal budget, except for war years, was about \n2-3 percent of the GDP and had very little influence on macro-economic \nactivity. After World War II, the Federal budget exceeds 10 percent of \nGDP and becomes an important instrument for stablizing the economy.\n  The transformation is clearly discernible from this chart. After \nWorld War II, automatic stabilizers--which go into effect long before \nthe National Bureau of of Economic Research has made a determination \nthat we are in or have had a recession--and discretionary fiscal policy \nhugely moderate the business cycle.\n  [[Page S3047]] Up until now the Federal budget in the post-World War \nII period has cushioned the effects of a recession. In this chart we \nhave seen the result--only a few tiny declines. But now, if we tried to \nbalance the budget in a recession, we would amplify the shocks and \nreturn the economy to the panics and depressions of the pre-World War \nII period shown on the chart.\n  What happens if we undo all that we have learned over the past 60 \nyears? Joseph Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, observes, in his comments to New York Times reporter Louis \nUchitelle, that ``The Government would become, almost inevitably, a \ndestabilizer of the economy rather than a stabilizer.''\n  The Treasury study, referred to earlier in my remarks, concludes with \na theme that I have emphasized over the past few weeks on the floor of \nthe Senate, as I have reviewed the history of fiscal policy over the \npast 40 years.\n  On February 8 I stated:\n       * * * I make the point that there is nothing inherent in \n     American democracy that suggests we amend our basic and \n     abiding law to deal with the fugitive tendencies of a given \n     moment. I rise today to provide documentation as to how a \n     series of one-time events of the 1980's led to our present \n     fiscal disorders, even as events in the 1990's point to a way \n     out of them.\n\n  Similarly the Treasury study concludes:\n       Large deficits in the recent past have led many to believe \n     that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the \n     only way to ensure fiscal discipline. The large deficits of \n     the 1930's and early 1990's, however, are an exception to the \n     general pattern since World War II * * *.\n       The relatively small deficits prior to the 1980's and the \n     experience of the past two years shows that fiscal discipline \n     does not require such drastic action as amending the \n     Constitution and the severe economic consequences that would \n     result.\n\n  The choices before us are best summed up by William Hoagland, the \nrespected Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. In \nthe New York Times article by Mr. Uchitelle Mr. Hoagland is quoted as \nfollows:\n\n       There are risks associated with a balanced budget and I \n     don't think anyone should deny them * * * Nevertheless, the \n     debate on the floor has been dominated by what we must do to \n     get the budget in balance, not what the risks of a balanced \n     budget might be.\n\n  Before we adopt this balanced budget amendment let's make sure we \nunderstand the risks. As I study the pre and post-World War II patterns \nof economic cycles, that are clearly evident on this chart, I conclude \nthat the risks are too great.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n The Balanced Budget Amendment and the Economy: How a Balanced Budget \n        Amendment Would Have Worsened the Recession of 1990-1992\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       So far the debate over a balanced budget amendment has been \n     primarily a political debate. Proponents of ``cutting'' have \n     squared off against proponents of ``spending.'' The one thing \n     that has been oddly lacking is a straightforward discussion \n     of how a balanced budget amendment might affect the economy. \n     Thus, this paper examines the possible consequences of a \n     balanced budget amendment on jobs, on incomes, and on the \n     long-term standards of living of the American people.\n       Simply put, a balanced budget amendment could cause \n     significant harm to the economy. The balanced budget \n     amendment currently being considered by Congress would \n     require the federal budget to be balanced by a date certain. \n     This requirement could harm the American economy and American \n     workers in two basic ways. First, the economy may have \n     trouble handling the elimination of the deficit too fast--by \n     cutting spending and raising taxes by about $1.2 trillion \n     between now and 2002 ($1.6 trillion if tax cuts proposed in \n     the Contract With America are adopted). Perhaps more \n     importantly, requiring a balanced budget in every year, \n     regardless of the economic situation, would hamper the \n     ability of the federal government to lessen the impact of \n     recessions.\n\n\n                         Danger to the Economy\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would make economic recessions \n     more severe than they otherwise would be. Currently the \n     federal budget helps to lessen the impact of recessions \n     through ``automatic stabilizers.'' These automatic \n     stabilizers allow spending to increase and revenue to fall \n     during times of economic hardship. For example, spending on \n     federal government programs like unemployment compensation \n     and food stamps automatically increase as the economy goes \n     into recession because more people become eligible for the \n     programs. In addition, as people earn less money as a result \n     of a recession, they pay less in taxes. While these changes \n     in spending and taxes increase the deficit, they serve to \n     reduce the damage done by recessions to the American economy \n     and American families.\n       A balanced budget amendment would force the government to \n     raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the \n     moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do the \n     most harm to the economy and aggravate the recession.\n       How do automatic stabilizers work? On average, every one \n     dollar drop in production and incomes as the economy enters a \n     recession generates a twenty-seven cent increase in the \n     deficit, as tax revenues fall and spending on programs rises.\n       Thus, a one dollar fall in incomes and spending becomes a \n     fall of only 73 cents to the economy as a whole. Shocks to \n     total demand and spending would therefore be more than one-\n     third larger if the federal budget were forced to be in year-\n     by-year balance as the economy goes through business cycles.\n       The principal benefit of the automatic stabilizers is that \n     they are automatic and take effect immediately. We lack the \n     advance notice of a recession for either Congress or the \n     Federal Reserve to react effectively. For example, as of \n     early 1991, the Federal Reserve concluded that it had adopted \n     appropriate anti-recessionary policies and expected a \n     recovery by mid-1992. It did not anticipate the further rise \n     in unemployment.\n       Thus, while the Federal Reserve bears an important part of \n     the responsibility for managing the business cycle, its \n     ability to ``fine tune'' the economy is limited. Given the \n     lags with which its policies affect the economy, the Federal \n     Reserve would have difficulty compensating for the \n     elimination of automatic stabilizers during recessions and \n     the shock to the economy of reducing the deficit too fast. \n     Even with the most effective Federal Reserve policy, a \n     balanced budget amendment would amplify recessions and harm \n     the economy.\n\n\n                         the recession of 1992\n\n       To illustrate how the business cycle would change under an \n     amendment, consider the recession of 1990-1992. During this \n     recession, the unemployment rate rose from 5.1 percent in \n     June of 1990 to 7.7 percent in June of 1992. The automatic \n     stabilizers in the federal budget injected roughly $87 \n     billion into the economy in 1992 relative to 1990. This \n     cyclical increase in the deficit helped to mitigate the \n     impact of the recession, making the unemployment rate between \n     0.7 and 1.7 percentage points lower in June of 1992 than it \n     otherwise would have been. Thus, if a balanced budget \n     amendment had been in effect--and the cyclical increase in \n     the deficit had been offset by spending cuts and tax \n     increases--the unemployment rate would have peaked somewhere \n     in the range of 8.3 to 9.4 percent.\n       The implication of this analysis is that employment would \n     have been about 1.5 million lower in mid-1992--as shown in \n     Chart A--if a balanced budget amendment had been in effect.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Large deficits in the recent past have led many to believe \n     that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the \n     only way to ensure fiscal discipline. The large deficits of \n     the 1980s and early 1990s, however, are an exception to the \n     general pattern since World War II.\n       Further, while the deficit as a share of the Gross Domestic \n     Product (GDP) did rise to high levels during the 1980s, this \n     ratio is now on a downward trend. The deficit as a share of \n     GDP, which was 4.9 percent in 1992, is currently projected to \n     steadily decline to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2005. The \n     Administration and Congress have achieved this through \n     difficult decisions to reduce spending and to increase \n     revenues (see chart B).\n       For example, before this Administration took office, the \n     deficit was projected to be $400 billion in 1998--current \n     projections show that this has been cut by more than half, to \n     $194 billion. In fact, the federal budget is currently in \n     primary surplus--revenues exceed the federal government's \n     spending on all federal programs combined. The deficit is due \n     solely to the cost of paying interest on the debt accumulated \n     largely during the high deficits of the 1980s--not because we \n     are overspending today (see Chart C).\n       The relatively small deficits prior to the 1980s and the \n     experience of the past two years shows that fiscal discipline \n     does not require such drastic action as amending the \n     Constitution and the severe economic consequences that would \n     result.\n the impact on alabama jobs if a balanced budget amendment had been in \n                place during the recession of

in Wisconsin would have peaked at a higher \n     level between 5.4 and 5.8 percent.\n       Thus the balanced budget amendment would have led to an \n     additional rise in unemployment of 5,300 to 15,800 in \n     Wisconsin in the recession of 1990-1992.\n the impact of wyoming jobs if a balanced budget amendment had been in \n                place during the recession of 1990-1992\n\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment and Wyoming:\n       During the recession of 1990-1992, the unemployment rate in \n     Wyoming rose from 5.4 percent to a peak of 5.8 percent.\n       Had the balanced budget amendment been in effect, the \n     unemployment rate in Wyoming would have peaked at higher \n     level between 6.0 and 6.3 percent.\n       Thus the balanced budget amendment would have led to an \n     additional rise in unemployment of 300 to 1,000 in Wyoming in \n     the recession of 1990-1992.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment and the United States:\n       During the recession of 1990-1992, the unemployment rate in \n     the United States rose from 5.1 percent to a peak of 7.7 \n     percent in June of 1992.\n       Had the balanced budget amendment been in effect, the \n     unemployment rate would have peaked at a higher level: in the \n     range of 8.3 to 9.4 percent.\n       Thus the balanced budget amendment would have led to a rise \n     in nationwide unemployment of 750,000 to 2.2 million in the \n     recession of 1990-1992.\n       Why Does a Balanced Budget Amendment Raise Unemployment?\n       Under current law, spending on federal government programs \n     like unemployment compensation and food stamps automatically \n     increases as the economy goes into recession. In addition, as \n     people earn less money as a result of a recession they pay \n     lower taxes. These changes in spending and taxes affect the \n     federal deficit. The increases in the federal deficit during \n     recessions are ``automatic stabilizers'' that reduce the \n     damage done by recessions to the American economy and \n     American workers.\n       A balanced budget amendment would force the government to \n     raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the \n     moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do most \n     harm to the economy, and aggravate the recession.\n\n\n                        summary of methodology.\n\n       From the cycle peak in June 1990 to the unemployment rate \n     peak in June 1992, the unemployment rate rose by 2.6 \n     percentage points.\n       Using a (low estimate of the) Okun's Law coefficient of 2, \n     and an automatic stabilizer magnitude (estimated over 1953-\n     1994) of 0.27, the associated cyclical swing in the deficit \n     is some 1.4 percentage points of GDP.\n       In the absence of automatic stabilizers the Keynesian \n     multiplier would be higher than we usually assume. Estimate \n     the multiplier in the absence of automatic stabilizers at \n     1.7, as opposed to 1.2 in the presence of automatic \n     stabilizers.\n       Thus the downward shock to exogenous demand of 1.4 percent \n     of GDP administered by the tax increases and spending cuts \n     necessary to offset the cyclical component of the deficit \n     would have depressed GDP by some 2.4 percent.\n       Using an Okun's law coefficient of 2, the central scenario \n     estimate of the extra rise in unemployment in the absence of \n     automatic stabilizers is 1.2 percentage points.\n       Obtain a favorable scenario by assuming that Federal \n     Reserve action manages to offset half of the increase in the \n     size of the recession.\n       Obtain an unfavorable scenario by assuming that the size of \n     automatic stabilizers has trended upward in the post-WWII \n     period, and using a higher Okun's law coefficient of 2.5.\n       Distribute the rise in the unemployment rate across states \n     proportionately to their 1990-1992 recession-driven increase \n     in unemployment.\n                explanation of vote on amendment no. 306\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wanted to take a moment to explain my \nposition for the record on the vote \n[[Page S3051]]  on the Rockefeller amendment. I voted to table Senator \nJohn Rockefeller's amendment on the balanced budget amendment. Senators \non the other side of the aisle would have you believe that this \nCongress is ready and willing to break a sacred obligation to care for \nour veterans and their survivors. Binding future Congresses in how we \nmanage veterans' programs is counterproductive micromanagement which \ncould very well harm the best interests of veterans and has no place in \na constitutional amendment. No one should interpret my vote as waning \nin my personal commitment to veterans and their families. I have always \nworked hard to properly fund veterans' programs and I will personally \ndo everything I can to ensure veterans benefits are fully funded in the \nfuture. The truth of the matter is that this country has a moral \nobligation to those who have paid dearly through their pain and \nsuffering in defense of the freedoms that all Americans enjoy today and \nwe must not and will not abdicate our responsibilities.\n     protecting federal law enforcement dollars--amendment no. 301\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Byrd's \namendment to protect Federal outlays for law enforcement, and the \nreduction and prevention of crime.\n  I am proud of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act we \npassed last year. It is a comprehensive approach to solving our \nNation's crime problem. It includes: funds for 100,000 new police \nofficers across the Nation; a ban on the manufacture, sale, and future \npossession of 19 semiautomatic assault weapons; and increased penalties \nfor Federal violent crimes and sex crimes.\n  However, passing tougher laws and putting more police on our streets \nwill not stop the violence that is ravaging our Nation. These measures, \nwhile effective, are only part of the larger solution. We also must \nfocus on preventive measures if we hope to find permanent solutions to \nthe epidemic of violence.\n  Last year's crime bill does just that. The legislation includes: the \nViolence Against Women Act, which authorizes funding for rape education \nand community prevention programs, battered women's shelters, and a \nnational family violence hotline.\n  The crime bill also authorizes local grants for education, after-\nschool safe haven programs, and other initiatives aimed at reducing \ngang membership among young people. The bill provides for grants to \nlocalities for crime prevention measures, including: police \npartnerships for children, supervised child visitation centers, and \npartnerships between senior citizens and police.\n  In addition, the legislation provides grants to law enforcement to \ncreate partnerships with child and family support agencies to fight \ncrimes committed against children.\n  Madam President, I believe in the value and necessity of these vital \nprograms. As a woman, a mother, and a former teacher I want to make \nsure we let our children know we care about them, they can trust us to \ndo the right thing, and we will not turn our backs on them.\n  Although I am pleased that Republican proposals to redirect these \nimportant prevention dollars do not target the Violence Against Women \nAct, I am disturbed about the implications for programs aimed at our \nNation's youth.\n  Our children are afraid, and sadly, they have every reason to be. \nEvery day, 5,703 teenagers are victims of violent crimes. Every 2 \nhours, a child is murdered. Every 5 seconds of the schoolday, a student \ndrops out of public school.\n  We, as adults, have a responsibility to care for our children, to \nteach them to value themselves and their communities, and not to give \nup on them. It is time for us as adults to address the issue of \nviolence honestly. Violence is a symptom of deeper problems. Lets not \nrestrict our attention to punishing criminals and building more \nprisons, while ignoring the causes of violence among our children.\n  I have talked with young people throughout the State of Washington. \nMy overwhelming conclusion is that a lot of the youth on our streets \nhave been victims themselves--victims of abusive adults, victims of our \noverburdened school system, and victims of a juvenile justice system \nthat cannot respond to their real needs. These disaffected kids \ninvariably have kids of their own, and the cycle of violence begins \nagain. Prevention and education are the keys to breaking this dangerous \npattern of violence.\n  Madam President, the dollars allocated to fund the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 are extremely important. I \napplaud Senator Byrd's effort to safeguard these crime fighting \ndollars.\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould work a purely technical correction to extend the time period for \na study currently being conducted in certain Federal courts.\n  The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 set up two programs to study \nvarious innovative programs in court management. One program involves \nso-called pilot courts, and the other involves what are referred to as \ndemonstration districts. Those court programs were originally \nestablished for a 3-year period, with the studies to be conducted over \na 4-year period and the resulting reports transmitted to Congress by \nDecember 31, 1995. The Rand Corp. has been carrying out the study of \nthe pilot courts, while the Federal Judicial Center is conducting the \nstudy of the demonstration districts.\n  Last year, the pilot court programs were extended for an additional \nyear, and the Rand Corp. received a 1-year extension for its study of \nthose courts. That extension was included in the Judicial Amendments \nAct of 1994. \n[[Page S3053]]  Through an oversight, however, no extension was \nincluded for the demonstration districts.\n  The legislation I am introducing would grant precisely the same 1-\nyear extension for the demonstration districts as was granted for the \npilot courts. That will make the two programs and their studies \nconsistent so that the final reports can be directly compared. That was \nprecisely the intent behind the identical deadlines that were \nestablished when the two study programs were set up. This legislation \nwill restore that end. Also, the extension of the deadline will improve \nthe study, since more cases will be complete and included in the study. \nImproving the reliability and consistency of the resulting reports can \nonly help us improve the efficiency of our courts.\n  Finally, this 1-year extension will entail no additional costs since \nthe demonstration districts are planning to continue the programs under \nstudy in any event. The extension of the deadline will not affect the \nbudget or personnel of any Federal entity.\n  I also note that this purely technical bill has bipartisan support: \nSenators Biden, Grassley, and Heflin are original cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide \ncongressional authorization for restrictions on receipt of out-of-State \nmunicipal solid waste and for State control over transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                the interstate waste control act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local \nGovernment Interstate Waste Control Act of 1995. This bill will give \nour cities and States the authority they need to restrict imports of \ntrash coming from other States.\n\n\n                          commerce in garbage\n\n  Not many people think of garbage as a commodity like other products \nthat flow in interstate commerce but it is.\n  Every year, the United States produces more than 200 million tons of \nmunicipal waste. Seven percent of this garbage--1 ton in 14--is sent to \na landfill or incinerator in another State.\n  Nearly every State is a seller or buyer in the municipal waste \nmarket. Forty-seven States export some garbage, and 44 import some \ngarbage.\n  When you think about it, trading garbage makes sense, especially for \nborder towns. In Montana, for example, two towns have made arrangements \nto share landfills with western North Dakota towns. And some trash, \nfrom the Wyoming areas of Yellowstone Park, is disposed of in Montana.\n  These arrangements save money for the communities involved. And \nshared regional landfills can be a policy that makes sense.\n\n\n                         decide our own destiny\n\n  But it only makes sense when everyone involved agrees to it. Nobody \nshould have barrels of garbage emptied over their heads. And it is a \nnasty fact that some people see big thinly populated States like \nMontana as potential trash cans.\n  The people of Montana, or any other State, should not be forced to \ntake trash they do not want. The citizens of Miles City, for example, \nhave been fighting to stop a proposed mega-landfill from taking out-of-\nState waste.\n  This idea would have brought entire coal trains full of garbage to \ndump on a small prairie town. These trains average 110 cars each. One \nhundred and ten open-roofed coal cars full of trash. Like prairie \ngarbage schooners. It is an outrage.\n  Miles City, like all cities, should be able to decide whether it \nwants these trains. We should be able to control our own destiny. And \nwe want the right to say ``no.''\n  If we see landfill sharing as appropriate for our needs, fine. But we \nought to be able to reject these arrangements when we don't like them. \nAs Deborah Hanson of the Custer Resource Alliance put it a couple of \nyears ago, ``we want to guarantee that Montana will not become a \ndumping ground.''\n  It's that simple, Mr. President. No city or State should become a \ndumping ground simply because an exporting community does not have the \nwill to take care of its own garbage.\n  Today, however, we do not have that power. Neither local communities, \nnor Governor Racicot, nor the legislature can reject unwanted garbage \nimports. The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down State laws aimed \nat restricting out-of-State garbage, because these laws violate the \nConstitution's interstate commerce protections. And that must change.\n\n\n                       the interstate waste bill\n\n  Mr. President, we have been working on this issue for 6 years. We \nhave explored all options in an effort to find a workable solution.\n  We have held hearings and debated the issues. The Senate passed \ninterstate waste bills in the 101st Congress, the 102d Congress, and \nagain last Congress. It is time to put this issue behind us.\n  If we build on the progress we made last year, we can pass a bill \nthat becomes law. I believe that this bill strikes the right compromise \nto do just that. It is largely the same bill that the Senate and the \nHouse came close to agreeing on last year. We came within a \nfingernail's width of agreement last year, and it is time to finish the \njob.\n  The bill resolves a problem that our States cannot solve without \ncongressional action.\n\n\n                           striking a balance\n\n  And it strikes a balance that will work for every community, in every \nState. It has four major points:\n  First, it allows every Governor to freeze future imports of garbage \nat the amount his or her State received in 1993.\n  Second, it bans any new imports of municipal waste unless the \ncommunity receiving the garbage specifically wants it.\n  Third, it requires large exporting States to reduce their future \nexports. This will encourage recycling and other efforts to cut the \namount of garbage we produce.\n  And fourth, to ensure that no State becomes a dumping ground for any \nother State, the bill authorizes a Governor to limit imports from any \nsingle State.\n  Thus, this bill empowers States and communities. It lets them decide \nwhether they want more out-of-State garbage. If the community wants new \nimports, it can enter a host community agreement subject to the \napproval of the Governor. The decision is up to the people at home.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this bill will give States the power to \nrestrict trash imports. It will require exporting States to reduce \ntheir exports. And it will do all this without disrupting beneficial \nexisting arrangements or creating incentives for illegal disposal.\n  Finally, and most important, it will give people in rural towns some \nsay in their own lives and communities. Some control over their \ndestiny.\n  It will mean more decisions by ordinary middle-class people, and \nfewer decisions by big Government and big business. And that is what \nthe people want.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nalong with a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal \nthe rule providing for termination of disabled adult child's benefits \nupon marriage; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the social security act amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I reintroduce legislation that \nwould resolve a long-standing inequity in the rules that govern \neligibility under the Social Security Act's coverage of disabled \nindividuals.\n  The so-called disabled adult child benefit under title II of the \nSocial Security Act provides benefits to the disabled children of \nindividuals who receive old age or disability insurance benefits. \nEligible individuals receive a cash benefit and Medicare coverage. Very \noften the Medicare coverage that individuals receive is more important \nthan the cash benefit, because the severely disabled recipients have \nnowhere else to go to get insurance that would cover their preexisting, \noften severe disabilities.\n  Under current law, individuals who receive the disabled adult child \nbenefit automatically lose their benefits if they get married, \nregardless of their income. This penalty is archaic and should be \nremoved from the law. When these provisions were originally enacted \nsociety had a different view of the disabled than it does today. The \nnotion was that, upon marriage, disabled individuals would leave their \ndependence relationship with the Social Security program only to enter \ninto a dependence relationship on a spouse. Today, we have come to \nrealize that disabled people can be productive members of society in \ntheir own right. They can and should be free to marry, and raise \nfamilies and engage in the pursuit of happiness like everyone else in \nthis country. This automatic loss of benefits, especially of the all-\nimportant Medicare coverage--is a huge obstacle for disabled adult \nchild recipients who want to do so.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am reintroducing today would repeal the \nprovision which requires that these individuals lose their benefits \nwhen they marry.\n  Several years ago, a constituent of mine named Jimmy Rick drove his \nwheelchair all the way to Washington, DC, and Capitol Hill from his \nhome in Amide, LA, in order to bring this matter to my attention. Mr. \nRica has been paralyzed from the neck down since he was 3 years old and \nhas had a series of incredibly painful and debilitating operations over \nthe course of his 46 years. Every night of his life he must sleep in an \niron lung. Somehow, he still managed to pilot his wheel chair the 1,100 \nmiles from Aide, LA, to Capitol Hill to explain the effect that the \nmarriage provision has had on his life.\n  Mr. Rick and his wife, Dona, had to wait 7 years before they could \nget married and adopt children. He was completely dependent on the \nMedicare coverage he had as a beneficiary and could not have gotten \ninsurance anywhere else. Jimmy and Dona could not get married until she \nfound a job with the U.S. Postal Service that carried the kind of \nhealth insurance coverage that Jimmy absolutely needed in order to \nsurvive. Since their marriage in May 1990 the Ricks have adopted two \nchildren, and they would like to adopt more. They are a happy, \nproductive and stable family. The archaic marriage penalty in the \nSocial Security law only served to delay this happy circumstance for 7 \nunnecessary years.\n  This Congress will be the third Congress in which I have introduced \nthis legislation. In June 1992, the Senate Finance Committee approved a \nprovision based on this legislation as part of a larger measure that \nwould have liberalized the Social Security earnings limit. \nUnfortunately, the provision was stripped before the legislation passed \ndue to conflict with the Budget Committee's interpretation of rules \nrelated to on-budget versus off-budget financing. Try to explain that \nto constituents whose day to day lives were drastically affected by an \nunreasonable provision of the law.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this legislation, which will strengthen \nthe concept of the family and allow thousands of disabled persons to \nmarry who cannot now do so, receives the favorable \n[[Page S3057]]  attention of my colleagues and can finally be passed \ninto law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Benchmark Rail Group, Inc., and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the benchmark rail group relief act of 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, at the end of last session this body \npassed legislation to provide relief to the Benchmark Rail Group, Inc., \na company in St. Louis, MO, that performed emergency work, at the \nrequest of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, following \nthe Northridge earthquake in California. Unfortunately, the House did \nnot act on this legislation.\n  It was not until after several weeks into the emergency repair work \non rail lines in the Los Angeles area that Benchmark learned of a \nprovision in California State law that requires State agencies to only \nhire contractors licensed to do work in the State of California. This \nprovision disqualified Benchmark from receiving payment owed--\napproximately $500,000.\n  FEMA, following the direction provided under section 406(a) of the \nRobert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, \ncontributed 90 percent to the net eligible cost of repair, restoration, \nreconstruction, and replacement of public facilities as a result of the \nearthquake. On August 23, 1994, funds were obligated by FEMA for \nvarious projects undertaken by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, \nincluding Southern California Regional Rail Authority and the work \nperformed by the Benchmark Rail Group. Because of the provision of \nCalifornia State law, unfortunately the funds obligated cannot be \nawarded to Benchmark by the State of California or the Southern \nCalifornia Regional Rail Authority.\n  In a letter to Governor Wilson, FEMA stated that:\n\n       Benchmark Rail Group of St. Louis, MO, travelled halfway \n     across the country at the invitation of the Southern \n     California\n      Regional Rail Authority to help people in dire need of \n     assistance. this action was clearly an example of the \n     concept of people-helping-people at work\n\n  According to the letter:\n\n       FEMA is precluded from directly paying Benchmark or \n     otherwise effectuating or facilitating payment to Benchmark \n     because of limitations imposed by both State and Federal law.\n\n  FEMA cannot pay Benchmark for two reasons. First, ``the Federal \nGovernment, in the performance of its duties and responsibilities, \ncannot ignore or abrogate State law. Since the failure to have a \nparticular California license is the obstacle to payment by the State, \nFEMA is not legally in a position to do what the State of California, \nthe Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Southern California Regional \nRail Authority cannot do.'' Second, the Stafford Act prohibits FEMA \nfrom providing funds directly to Benchmark, since the company is not an \neligible grantee. Section 406(a) of the Stafford Act and the applicable \nregulations authorizes reimbursement by FEMA only to the grantee of the \nFederal share of disaster assistance funds which must be a State or \nlocal government.\n  The State of California, like FEMA, recognized the problem and tried \nto resolve it last summer. Governor Wilson worked with the California \nState Legislature to amend California law to authorize payment to \nBenchmark. The effort got underway late in the legislative session and \nfailed. Governor Wilson wrote to FEMA and stated:\n\n       We are hopeful that this problem can be resolved if FEMA \n     obtains the administrative flexibility to make the Stafford \n     Act payment directly to Benchmark.\n\n  The legislation that was introduced by the former senior Senator of \nMissouri, Senator Danforth, and passed this body last year, and which I \nam reintroducing today, would do just that. This legislation directs \nFEMA to reimburse Benchmark for all work which is eligible for \nreimbursement under the Stafford Act, including the 90-percent share \nthat FEMA would ordinarily pay and the 10-percent share that the non-\nFederal entity would pay.\n  It is unfortunate that Benchmark Rail Group has gotten caught in the \nmiddle of State and Federal bureaucracy. Benchmark, who rushed to help \nothers suffering from a natural disaster, now is suffering and cannot \nget help because of the inflexibility in both Federal and State law. I \nbelieve we have a responsibility to make certain that Benchmark is \ncompensated for the work performed. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 468.

Mr. President, today with my colleague, Mr. DeWine, \nI am introducing a bill to extend the time limitation on an already \nissued Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] license for the \nSummit pumped energy storage project in Norton, OH. Legislation \nauthorizing the FERC to grant this extension has been introduced in the \nHouse by Congressman Sawyer.\n  Upon completion of environmental, engineering and other project \nreview, the FERC issued a license to Summit Energy Storage, Inc., for \nthe Summit pumped storage hydropower project. The 1,500 megawatt Summit \nproject, to be located in Summit and Medina Counties, OH, will generate \nan estimated maximum 3,900 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year.\n  Section 13 of the Federal Power Act prescribes the time limits for \ncommencement of construction of a hydropower project once FERC has \nissued a license. The licensee must begin construction not more than 2 \nyears from the date the license is issued, unless FERC extends the \ninitial 2-year deadline. FERC has extended the Summit project's \nconstruction commencement deadline for the one permissible 2-year \nperiod, setting the current deadline of April 11, 1995. The bills we \nintroduce would grant FERC authority to extend the commencement of \nconstruction deadline for up to 6 additional years.\n  Mr. President, I urge the enactment of this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Both of these, created under \nGoals 2000, specifically shift a significant amount of the control of \ncurriculum and management of elementary and secondary schools from \nlocal communities and States to the Federal Government.\n  By repealing these two pieces of Goals 2000, we rid States and \nlocalities of the most offensive provisions of this legislation and \nmove to restore local control of education. The first step is \neliminating the National Education Standard and Improvement Council \n[NESIC], also referred to as the National School Board. This body is \ncharged with certifying national content and performance standards and \nopportunity to learn standards. These standards basically address all \nareas affecting the way elementary and secondary schools are operated. \nWe have already seen the failure of national standards with the \ncreation of U.S. history standards. Let's stop this disaster before it \ngoes any further.\n  The second step in the process of restoring local control is to \neliminate opportunity to learn standards. Basically, these standards \nare a Federal methodology of how people teach, what they are taught and \nthe atmosphere in which they are taught. Opportunity to learn standards \ndeal with input; they address curriculum, instructional materials, \nteacher capabilities, and school facilities. Since when is the Federal \nGovernment involved in deciding how many pencils each classroom should \nhave?\n  Proponents of opportunity to learn standards insist that the \nimplementation of these standards is voluntary. However, if a State \nwants their fair share of the available funds, they must develop these \nstandards, even if they have no intention of using them; this does not \nappear to be voluntary to me.\n  We must make it clear that energizing local communities, the parents, \nthe teachers, the principals, and the school boards is the key to \nimproving education. My legislation does just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nthe distribution to the public of violent video programming during \nhours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial \nportion of the audience; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         the children's protection from television violence act\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing \nlegislation that will protect children from the harmful effects of \ngratuitous television violence. As the President said in his State of \nthe Union Address, the entertainment industry has a ``* * * \nresponsibility to assess the impact of [its] work and to understand the \ndamage that comes from the incessant, repetitive mindless violence that \npermeates our media all the time.'' I do not believe the industry has \ndone its best to honor that special responsibility.\n  My approach is the most reasonable and feasible way to deal with the \nreality that television has become the permanent babysitter and some-\ntime parent. The television does not simply occupy a child's time; it \nhas become one of the more powerful influences in a child's life. Yet \nit continues to be nothing but a vast wasteland.\n  We've heard all the commitments to reduce the level of violence on \ntelevision. We've heard the commitments to improve the quality of \nchildren's programming. But what has been the result? More violence. \nThe industry's primary focus continues to be the bottom line--not on \nthe quality of the programming and its educational value.\n  The evidence is overwhelming. Arnold Goldstein, the Director of the \nCenter for Research on Aggression at Syracuse University, has done \nextensive research in the area of violence and its impact on youth. His \nresearch conclusively finds a link between TV violence and real-world \nviolence and adds support to congressional efforts to curb the amount \nof violence on television. The Commerce Committee's hearing record last \nCongress provides further evidence of the extent of violence in \nsociety. Each year, over 20,000 people are murdered in the United \nStates--1 person is killed every 22 minutes. Violence is the second \nleading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. The \nCenters for Disease Control now considers violence to be a public \nhealth problem.\n  According to several studies, television violence increased in the \n1980's both during prime time and during children's television hours. \nEvidence shows that children spend more time watching television than \nthey spend in school. For example, children between the ages of 2 and \n11 watch television an average of 28 hours per week. Furthermore, a \nUniversity of Pennsylvania study documented that a record 32 violent \nacts per hour were shown during children's shows in 1992. The American \nPsychological Association [APA] estimates that a typical child will \nwatch 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence before finishing \nelementary school.\n  The Commerce Committee has been looking at the issue of television \nviolence and its impact on youth. Last Congress, the Commerce Committee \nheld a hearing on this issue and found that there is indeed a \ncompelling governmental interest to protect children from the harmful \neffects of violence on television. To address this interest, my bill \ndirects the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to adopt rules to \nrequire the networks and cable industry to channel violent programming \ninto times of the day when children are not likely to comprise a \nsubstantial part of the audience. This is consistent with Supreme Court \ndecisions recognizing the compelling nature of the Government's \ninterest in helping parents supervise their children and in \nindependently protecting the well being of its youth.\n  I am sensitive to the constitutional concerns raised by this issue. \nHowever, I believe the safe harbor mandated by my bill is sound public \npolicy and is the least restrictive means to protect children. The \ncourts have found many deficiencies in past legislative efforts to curb \nindecent programming. In fact, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia ruled that the safe harbor timeframe for indecent \nbroadcasts from 12 midnight to 6 a.m. was unconstitutional. The court \nsaid the timeframe mandated by Congress and adopted in the FCC's rules \nwas overly broad and not based upon a sufficient record.\n  My bill avoids the deficiencies found in prior legislative efforts. \nIn Action for Children's Television versus FCC (Act IV), the court said \nthe FCC's effort to implement a safe harbor for indecent programming \nfailed because its regulations attempted to protect every person--\nadults and children--from the \n[[Page S3060]]  harmful effects of indecent programming. The FCC failed \nto balance properly the first amendment considerations necessary to \nrestrict indecent broadcasts since the FCC's rules did not exclude \nadults from the persons to be protected from indecent broadcasts.\n  In his concurring opinion, Judge Edwards asserted that violent \nprogramming is more harmful to children than indecent broadcasts and \nthat a more compelling case can be made for regulating violence--if the \nregulation is narrowly tailored. Judge Edwards stated that ``the \nstrength of the Government's interest in shielding children from \nexposure to indecent programming is tied directly to the magnitude of \nthe harms sought to be prevented. The apparent lack of specific \nevidence of harms from indecent programming stands in direct contrast, \nfor example, to the evidence of harm caused by violent programming--a \ngenre that, as yet, has gone virtually unregulated.''\n  My bill does not ban programs with violence, and it does not regulate \nthe content of any program. Rather, it directs the FCC to adopt rules \nto require the networks and the cable industry to channel violent \nprogramming into time slots when children are not likely to comprise a \nsubstantial part of the audience.\n  The programming that children watch today is no longer produced by a \nfew Hollywood studios and broadcast by three networks. We now have an \nestablished fourth network, several emerging networks, independent \ntelevision stations, and cable television, all of which have multiple \nsources of programming. Therefore, we can no longer hold just the three \nnetworks responsible for what children watch. That is why my bill \nadopts a broad approach directed at all providers of video programming.\n  I am convinced this bill is the least restrictive means by which we \ncan limit children's exposure to violent programming. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider it carefully.\n  I ask unanimously consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Television station operators, cable television system \n     operators, and video programmers should follow practices in \n     connection with video programming that take into \n     consideration that television broadcast and cable \n     programming--\n       (A) has established a uniquely pervasive presence in the \n     lives of all Americans; and\n       (B) is readily accessible to children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency for violent and aggressive behavior later in life \n     than those children not so exposed. Children exposed to \n     violent video programming are prone to assume that acts of \n     violence are acceptable behavior and therefore to imitate \n     such behavior.\n       (5) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (6) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (7) Restricting the hours when violent video programming is \n     shown is the least restrictive and most narrowly tailored \n     means to achieve that compelling governmental interest.\n       (8) Warning labels about the violent content of video \n     programming will not in themselves prevent children from \n     watching violent video programming.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the payment to States of plot \nallowances for certain veterans eligible for burial in a national \ncemetery who are buried in cemeteries of such States; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                the veterans plot allowance act of 1995\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing \nlegislation I first offered last year regarding the $150 veterans plot \nallowance to states. My bill would provide a payment for all veterans--\nnot just some veterans--who are buried free of charge in a State \nveterans cemetery, if they are eligible for burial in a national \nveterans cemetery. I am pleased to be joined in this effort today by \nSenators D'Amato, Hollings, Roth, and Stevens.\n  The imperative for enacting this legislation is even greater today \nthan it was when I introduced the same bill last May. Earlier this \nweek, the Associated Press reported that our national cemeteries are \nfast running out of space. Of the 114 national cemeteries, 56--one \nshort of half--are already full. And, space exists for just 230,000 \nmore caskets and the cremated remains of just 50,000 more veterans. \nCompared that with the 27 million veterans living today who will be \neligible for burial in a national cemetery.\n  For those familiar with veterans issues, these statistics will not \ncome as a great shock. In fact, the rapidly dwindling space in national \ncemeteries is one of the main reasons that over a decade ago, Congress \nestablished the state cemetery grant program. In doing so, we hoped to \nencourage States to build State veterans cemeteries to ease the burden \non the national cemetery system.\n  This Federal-State partnership has not only worked, it is a shining \nexample of what the States and the Federal Government can do together. \nSince the creation of the program, over 25 States have built State \nveterans cemeteries--and there are now 42 such cemeteries throughout \nthe United States. For States like Delaware, which do not have a \nnational cemetery at all, the State cemetery program ensures that \nveterans will receive the dignified burial they deserve in a veterans-\nonly cemetery, while being buried closer to home than if they were \nburied in a national cemetery.\n  Now, however, I fear that this partnership is at risk--precisely when \nwe need it the most. The reason is because of an anomaly in the law. \nStates are required to bury in a State-owned veterans cemetery those \nveterans who are eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery--\nthat is, all honorably \n[[Page S3061]]  discharged veterans. To help meet the cost, the Federal \nGovernment promised to pay a $150 plot allowance to the State for each \nveteran who is buried free of charge. But--and here is the catch--this \npayment is not made for all honorably discharged veterans. Rather, a \nState is eligible for the plot allowance only for burying veterans who \nmeet a set of more restrictive criteria. Specifically, the plot \nallowance is paid only for those veterans who: First, were receiving \nveterans disability compensation or a veterans pension; second, died in \na VA hospital; third, were indigent, and the body was unclaimed; or \nfourth, were, or could have been, discharged from the military due to a \ndisability.\n  In short, State-owned veterans cemeteries exist to help relieve the \nFederal Government of its responsibility to bury all veterans in \nnational cemeteries. At the\n same time, States do not receive the $150 plot allowance for burying \nall national cemetery eligible veterans. It seems to me that this \ndisparate treatment is in conflict with the very purpose for which \nState veterans cemeteries were established.\n\n  And, because of the limits on the payment of the plot allowance, I \nhave heard anecdotal evidence in recent years that some States may soon \nstop burying veterans free of charge. They claim that they cannot \nafford to do so when the Federal Government does not pay the $150 plot \nallowance.\n  To further complicate matters, last year, Congress extended \neligibility for burial in a national cemetery to National Guard members \nand reservists who have served at least 20 years. By their eligibility \nfor burial in a national cemetery, they are also now eligible for \nburial in State veterans cemeteries. But, of course, few, if any, will \nmeet the four-point criteria I mentioned a moment ago--and the States \nwill not receive a $150 plot allowance for their burial.\n  So, Mr. President, as we are asking more of State veterans \ncemeteries--through expanded eligibility and through decreased space in \nnational cemeteries--and as State veterans cemeteries become more vital \nto the national cemetery system, we need to ensure that States continue \nto participate in the program. To guarantee that--and to be fair to the \nStates--my legislation would simply provide States the $150 plot \nallowance for burying without charge any veterans eligible for burial \nin a national veterans cemetery. No more restricted criteria. No more \ncontradictory goals. Only one simple and fair rule: If a State buries a \nveteran in lieu of burial in a national cemetery, the State is paid the \nplot allowance.\n  If my legislation were enacted, the Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated that it would cost the Federal Government about $1 million \nannually. While my bill does not have offsetting reductions in other \nFederal spending to cover this cost, I am committed to finding such \nreductions before the measure is passed.\n  Mr. President, on this, the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo \nJima--at a time when we are honoring the brave men who fought there and \nthe almost 7,000 who died there--it is well to remember that the \nFederal Government is duty-bound to give all of our veterans a decent \nand dignified burial. The legislation I am introducing today will help \nto ensure that we live up to that solemn commitment. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 472. A bill to consolidate and expand Federal child care services \nto promote self-sufficiency and support working families, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n        the child care consolidation and investment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care \nConsolidation and Investment Act. I am pleased to offer this \nlegislation with my colleague, Senator Kennedy.\n  The bill would consolidate major child care programs, including the \nchild care and development block grant to create a seamless system of \nchild care for working parents; expand access to affordable child care \nin order to promote work and self-sufficiency; ensure that parents will \nnot be forced to leave their children in unsafe situations to comply \nwith work requirements; and build on the child care and development \nblock grant to encourage parental choice, provide for quality and \nensure basic health and safety standards.\n  I attended a hearing of the Subcommittee on Children and Families \nlast week which highlighted the need for this legislation. We heard \nfrom several witnesses about the desperate need for an increased \ninvestment in child care. We also heard about the unintended but \nterrible consequences of imposing work requirements or time limits for \nwelfare without a corresponding investment in child care.\n  In addition, witnesses discussed the importance of emphasizing \nquality child care. It is not enough to simply warehouse our children. \nWe must provide them with a safe, clean, stimulating environment. They \ndeserve no less. That is why our bill would preserve and build on the \nquality component of the child care and development block grant.\n  The bill seeks to simplify and consolidate Federal child care \nprograms in hopes of creating seamless support so that individuals have \naccess to child care as they move from welfare to job training to work. \nBut it recognizes that consolidation, as important as it is, is no \nsubstitute for devoting resources to meet the needs of our kids.\n  Finally, the bill would seek to put child care at its rightful place \nin the center of the welfare reform debate. It would require any State \nthat imposes work requirements on welfare recipients to offer child \ncare assistance for the recipients' children.\n\n\n                   barriers between welfare and work\n\n  I think we all share the same goal in reforming the welfare system--\nto encourage self-sufficiency and reward work. To get the job done, we \nmust identify the barriers between individuals on welfare and work--and \nthen do our best to eliminate those barriers.\n  Our bill recognizes that one of the most significant barriers to work \nis a lack of affordable, quality child care. But most of the welfare \nreform proposals coming from the other side of the aisle are woefully \ninadequate on this point.\n  Most of the plans would put welfare recipients to work. I \nwholeheartedly agree that work and job training requirements are \ncritical if we ever hope to break the cycle of poverty. Placing work at \nthe center of our welfare policy is the right approach.\n  But this raises an important question. Since two-thirds of families \nreceiving aid to families with dependent children have at least one \npre-school age child, what happens to the children while their parents \nare at work? Where do they go? Who will look out for them?\n  The major Republican proposal in the House completely ignores these \nquestions. Instead of putting children at the center of the welfare \nreform debate--as they should be--some Republicans are treating them as \nnuisances to be swept under the rug.\n  At a time when we should be investing in child care to make work \npossible, the House bill would cut child care funding. The House bill \nwould eliminate child care subsidies for 377,000 kids by the year 2000, \nand cut funding by 24 percent by that time. The House bill would also \ncompletely eliminate quality standards--even minimal health and safety \nrequirements.\n  During a subcommittee mark-up in the other body last week, \nRepresentative Jim Nussle had the following to say about proposals to \nensure child care as part of welfare reform:\n\n       Pretty soon we'll have the department of the alarm clocks \n     to wake them up in the morning and the department of bedtime \n     stories to tuck them in at night. It's not the Government's \n     responsibility.\n\n  That kind of flip, cavalier attitude toward our Nation's children is \ncompletely unacceptable. I would suggest the Government does have a \nresponsibility to young children. It is not kids' fault that their \nparents are on welfare, and they shouldn't be punished for the mistakes \nor bad luck of adults.\n  I maintain that if we are going to put welfare parents to work, we \nhave an obligation to do something for their kids. It's just that \nsimple.\n                      making a bad situation worse\n\n  Demand for child care already outstrips the supply. There are now \nthousands of children on waiting lists in 37 \n[[Page S3062]]  States. You don't need to be an economist to understand \nwhat would happen if 2 to 3 million additional children need child care \nwhen their parents are put to work.\n  A bad situation will grow worse. Increased demand will drive up \nfees--pricing more working families out of the system. Former welfare \nrecipients will find it difficult to remain in the job market if they \nhave no one to care for their kids. The quality of child care will \ndecline. We will find that we haven't reformed much of anything.\n  We must recognize that to build a welfare system that truly rewards \nwork, we must have a national child care policy that makes work \npossible.\n  We have a wealth of hard evidence to prove this point:\n  A study by the Illinois Department of Public Aid found that 42 \npercent of AFDC recipients said that child care problems kept them from \nworking full-time. Twenty percent said they had abandoned jobs and \nreturned to welfare within the previous year--because of inadequate \nchild care.\n  Child care expenses and simple economics often conspire to make \nwelfare more attractive than work. The GAO found that the median family \nincome of the working poor was $159 higher per month than those of AFDC \nrecipients. But working poor families pay an average of $260 per month \non child care--more than enough to wipe out the economic advantage they \nget from working.\n  If we want to replace welfare with work, it is obvious we must do \nsomething about child care. And if we want to do something about child \ncare for the working poor, the child care development block grant is \nthe place to start: 70 percent of the children served by the block \ngrant have working parents and 67 percent of the children have family \nincomes at or below poverty.\n  The child care development block grant provides funds to States to \nhelp parents pay for care. It encourages States to increase the number \nof providers and make it easier for parents to find the care they need.\n  The new investments in child care have already paid off. In many \nStates, the financial support available for low-income families has \nmore than doubled.\n                                quality\n\n  The child care development block grant is also noteworthy because it \nprovides the States with money to invest in quality, a provision that \nsets it apart from any other source of Federal child care funds.\n  A major study released this month clearly illustrated how critical \nthis emphasis on quality is. The multiyear, multistate study, entitled \n``Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes in Child Care Centers,'' was \nconducted by a team of researchers at four universities. It found that \nonly one in seven child care centers provides good quality child care.\n  For infants and toddlers, the situation is particularly bad. A \nstaggering 40 percent of child care centers do not meet minimal \nstandards for this group, meaning basic sanitary conditions are not \nmet, there are safety problems or learning is not encouraged.\n  The poor quality of child care already puts our kids at risk. The \nsituation will only grow worse if we try to shove millions more kids \ninto the system with no thought to the quality of that system.\n  That's why our bill would build on the block grant's commitment to \nquality. The block grant's quality set-aside funds a variety of \nefforts, including renovations and repairs to help centers meet State \nlicensing standards, the purchase of educational materials, support for \nlow-income family home child care providers, and training and technical \nassistance for staff. These are critical efforts, and they should be \ncontinued.\n  Child care has been a strongly bipartisan issue in the Senate, and I \nhope colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join us in this \neffort to put children at the center of the welfare reform debate. \nLet's not leave our kids behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Consolidation and \n     Investment Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) fragmentation of the Federal Government's major child \n     care assistance programs has left gaps for many parents \n     moving from welfare to work;\n       (2) child care problems have prevented 34 percent of poor \n     mothers between the ages 21 and 29 from working;\n       (3) \\2/3\\ of all families receiving assistance under the \n     Aid to Families with Dependent Children program have at least \n     one preschool age child and need child care in order to work;\n       (4) there already exists an unmet need for child care \n     assistance--37 States now have waiting lists that can run as \n     high as 35,000 individuals;\n       (5) child care directly affects an individual's ability to \n     stay in the work force;\n       (6) welfare reform that places work at its center will \n     increase the demand for child care and require an additional \n     investment of resources;\n       (7) child care consumes $260 per month or about 27 percent \n     of income for average working poor families, leaving them \n     with less income than families eligible for assistance under \n     the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program;\n       (8) quality must be a central feature of the child care \n     policy of the United States;\n       (9) only 1 in 7 day care centers offer good quality care;\n       (10) 40 percent of day care centers serving infants and \n     toddlers do not meet basic sanitary conditions, have safety \n     problems, and do not encourage learning; and\n       (11) only 9 percent of family and relative day care is \n     considered good quality care.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) eliminate program fragmentation and create a seamless \n     system of high quality child care that allows for continuity \n     of care for children as parents move from welfare to job \n     training to work;\n       (2) provide for parental choice among high quality child \n     care programs; and\n       (3) increase the availability of high quality affordable \n     child care in order to promote self sufficiency and support \n     working families.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in \nintroducing the Child Care Consolidation and Investment Act of 1995.\n  For far too many American families ``Home Alone'' is not just a \nmovie, but a daily crisis. The struggle for decent child care is a fact \nof life that all working families understand--regardless of their \nincome.\n  Today and everyday, millions of American families face impossible \nchoices--cruel choices, between the jobs they need and the children \nthey love--heart-wrenching choices between putting food on the table \nand finding safe and affordable child care for their young sons and \ndaughters.\n  Nine million children live in single-parent working families. Twenty-\nseven million more children live in two-parent families where both \nparents work. The average cost of child care is nearly $5,000 a year--\nyet the take home pay from a minimum wage job is stuck at $8,500. This \nstandard of living is not manageable. It is not fair and it is not \nacceptable.\n  We have heard a lot about turning welfare into work, but not nearly \nenough about who will care for the 10 million children on AFDC when \ntheir parents are in job training or at work. If we are serious about \npromoting work, if we mean it when we talk about strengthening families \ninstead of punishing then, we must deal with the essential issue of \nchild care.\n  We know that every day, millions of young children are left in \nunsupervised settings and in poor quality child care that jeopardize \ntheir health and safety--not because their parents do not care, but \nbecause they lack options, lack information, and lack cash.\n  Today, 21 million low-income children under 12 are eligible for \nservices under the Federal child care programs. Yet only 6 percent of \nthese children receive this essential support. Government cannot \nreplace parents, but it can and should help them in their efforts to \nmake ends meet and care for the children.\n  Quality child care creates opportunity and increases productivity--\nnot just for one generation, but for two generations. Child care is not \nabout giving parents a blank check. It is about giving them a fair \nchance. Leaving children out of welfare reform will make a mockery of \nany such reform. It will pass the real life tragedy of dependency on \nfrom this generation to the next. Families cannot afford that--and \nneither can the Nation.\n  The current child care and development block grant is a tribute to \nbipartisan cooperation and effective partnerships. For the families \nwhose lives it has touched, it has made child care more affordable and \nresource and referral services more available. It has guaranteed higher \nquality. It strikes a good balance between flexibility and \naccountability.\n  Unfortunately, this sound structure does not guide all Federal child \ncare spending, but it should. It is the strong foundation on which \nchild care reform should be constructed.\n  We must create a system of support that allows families to move from \nwelfare to job training to work without continually disrupting the care \nof their children. We must build a system with assistance based on \nneed, not on welfare status. I support this approach to consolidation \nand our legislation moves us in that direction.\n  The Child Care Consolidation and Investment Act of 1995 combines the \nmajor child care efforts into a single funding stream, rather than \nmaintaining separate programs for families on welfare, families \nrecently off welfare, and families at-risk of falling onto welfare--\neach with its own rules, regulations, and eligibility standards. \nFamilies have enough stress in their lives without having to weave \ntheir way through this maze--all too often only to hear that there is \nno more help available.\n  But consolidation alone will never be enough. In the end, it will \nonly mean well-organized deck chairs on a ship that is sinking. \nConsolidation can streamline bureaucracy and enhance efficiency, but it \nwill not produce real \n[[Page S3064]]  savings to meet the every-increasing need for quality \nchild care.\n  To do more than end welfare, we must remove the existing barriers\n   to self-sufficiency, not raise them higher. For many, that barrier \nis lack of child care. One in three poor women not in the labor force \nsay child care is their greatest barrier to participation. One in five \npart-time workers say they would work longer hours if child care is \navailable and affordable.\n\n  Two-thirds of AFDC families have at least one preschool child. They \nneed child care assistance in order to enroll in job training, job \nsearch, or educational activities.\n  There have been loud calls for cutting benefits and ending welfare. \nBut there has been a deafening silence on child care. It is time to \nbreak that silence and put together a realistic program--based not on \nrhetoric but on results.\n  The bill approved Act passed by the House Republicans will roll back \nthe positive advances we have made. According to estimates from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the proposal will cut child \ncare funds by 20 percent--a $2.5 billion reduction over the next 5 \nyears. In the year 2000, 400,000 fewer children will receive this \nessential assistance. That does not sound like progress and it isn't \nprogress. More children ``Home Alone'' is never progress.\n  On top of all that, now they even want to slash nutrition aid for \nschools and for child care food programs. If taking food out of the \nmouths of hungry children is not Republican extremism, I do not know \nwhat is. Republicans like to boast about their new ideas, but these \nideas are out to lunch.\n  In contrast, the Child Care Consolidation and Investment Act provides \nthe resources needed to promote self-sufficiency and to support working \nfamilies. It is a realistic pro-work and pro-family proposal. The Act \nwill give AFDC families a helping hand and it will give working \nfamilies a fighting chance for a better life. It will bring a long-\nneeded cease-fire to the battle for limited slots between families \ntrying to get off welfare and families trying to stay off welfare--a \nbattle with no winners.\n  We must reject any policy that pulls the rug out from under families \njust as they are getting on their feet. Such approaches are callous and \ncounterproductive. In Massachusetts, of mothers who left welfare for\n work and then returned to welfare, 35 percent said child care problems \nwere the reason. Additional support at that critical time could have \nmade all the difference.\n\n  Recent studies remind us of the mediocre to poor quality of child \ncare that most children receive. Only one in seven child care centers \noffers quality care and only 9 percent of family day care homes are \nfound to be of high quality. Children deserve more than custodial care. \nThey need individual attention and a safe place to learn and grow.\n  As the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \nServices stated in a recent report:\n\n       The Child Care and Development Block Grant has been the \n     principal source of Federal support to strengthen the quality \n     and enhance the supply of child care. The implementation of \n     the Act has been instrumental in raising the standards of \n     other child care programs.\n\n  This act will take the next step by applying the requirement of \nquality standards to all Federal efforts, and by continuing to set \naside a percentage of all child care funds to enable States to \nstrengthen the quality of their programs. The innovative approaches \nthat States have taken under this act have benefited all children in \nchild care--not just those receiving assistance.\n  Clearly, for all of us who care about working families and genuine \nwelfare reform, facing up to the challenge of child care deserves much \nhigher priority than it has had so far.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Ashcroft, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S.J. Res. 27. Joint resolution to grant the consent of the Congress \nto certain additional powers conferred upon the Bi-State Development \nAgency by the States of Missouri and Illinois; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               the bi-state compact amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this joint \nresolution with my friend and colleague, Senator Ashcroft; the \ndistinguished senior Senator from the State of Illinois, Senator Simon; \nand my colleague and junior Senator from the State of Illinois, Senator \nMosely-Braun.\n  The Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan \nDistrict is an interstate compact agency. The purpose of this joint \nresolution is to seek congressional approval for legislation enacted by \nthe States of Missouri and Illinois which grants additional powers to \nthe agency.\n  Since the agency's passenger transportation systems operate through \nvarious local jurisdictions, the agency has had difficulty insuring \nthat fare evasion and other conduct prohibited on agency facilities and \nconveyances, and the penalties therefore, are uniform. In addition, \nissues have arisen regarding the jurisdiction of various local peace \nofficers to arrest for conduct occurring on the light rail system.\n  The legislatures of the States of Missouri and Illinois have enacted \nlegislation to confer the additional powers necessary to resolve the \nuniformity issues which the Bi-State Development Agency faces. To move \nforward, these changes approved by the elected officials of Missouri \nand Illinois now need congressional approval. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this joint resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3052-6", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3064-S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 228\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 228, a bill to amend certain provisions of title 5, United States \nCode, relating to the treatment of Members of Congress and \nCongressional employees for retirement purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 233\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 233, a bill \nto provide for the termination of reporting requirements of certain \nexecutive reports submitted to the Congress, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 256, a bill to \namend title 10, United States Code, to establish procedures for \ndetermining the status of certain missing members of the Armed Forces \nand certain civilians, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 351\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the names of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston] and the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 351, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto make permanent the credit for increasing research activities.\n\n\n                                 s. 357\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, the name of the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. \nInouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 357, a bill to amend the \nNational Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to establish the Friends of \nKaloko-Honokohau, an advisory commission for the Kaloko-Honokohau \nNational Historical Park, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 413\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 413, a bill to amend \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage rate \nunder such Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 434\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the names of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Exon], the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], and the Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Simon] were added as cosponsors of S. 434, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the deductibility \nof business meal expenses for individuals who are subject to Federal \nlimitations on hours of service.\n\n\n                       senate joint resolution 18\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hollings, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 18, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution relative to contributions and expenditures intended to \naffect elections for Federal, State, and local office.\n                    [[Page S3065]] amendment no. 274\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Reid] was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 274 proposed to \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, a joint resolution proposing a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3064-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation \naimed at improving access to affordable long-term care services. This \nbill allows families with exorbitant health care bills to deduct long-\nterm care costs as medical expenses, creates incentives for older \nAmericans and their families to plan for future long-term care \nexpenses, and removes tax barriers that stifle the private long-term \ncare insurance market.\n  Henry David Thoreau once wrote that ``If you have built castles in \nthe air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now \nput the foundations under them.''\n  Each day Americans, quite unknowingly, heed Thoreau's advice as they \nwork to safeguard their families, their homes, and their dreams from \nthe precarious circumstances life may hand them from time to time. As \nhe suggests, we work not only to build our castles, but strive to \nprotect them once they are built.\n  Unfortunately, most of us have not adequately protected ourselves and \nour families from one of the most devastating financial risks that \ncould face us in our entire lifetime--the need for long-term care \nservices.\n  While approximately 38 million people lack basic health insurance, \nalmost every American family is exposed to the catastrophic costs of \nlong-term care. In fact, less than 3 percent of all Americans have \ninsurance to cover long-term care. With average nursing home costs \nnearing $40,000 per year and home health care costing from $50 to $200 \nper day, long-term care expenses can quickly wipe out the lifetime \nsavings of a disabled individual and his or her family.\n  Sadly, many families erroneously assume that their current insurance \nor Medicare will cover long-term care expenses. It is only when a \nloved-one becomes disabled that they discover coverage is limited to \nacute medical care and that long nursing home stays and extended home \ncare services must be paid for out-of-pocket. In fact, a 1994 public \nopinion poll conducted for the Employee Benefit Research Institute \nfound that 45 percent of all respondents believe that Medicare pays for \nlong-term care, when in fact it does not.\n  And despite what many of us believe, the chance of needing long-term \ncare is significant and increasing as life expectancies increase. In \n1990 for example, people age 65 or older faced a 43-percent risk of \nentering a nursing home. About 1 in 5 of those seniors are estimated to \nbe in a nursing home stay over 1 year, about 1 in 10 would be in a \nfacility for 5 years or longer and many more would receive caregiving \nfrom friends, families, and home care workers.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I know the \nobstacles many disabled older Americans and their families face paying \nfor necessary long-term care. Despite heroic caregiving efforts by \nspouses, children, and friends, many disabled Americans do not receive \nthe appropriate medical and social services they desperately need. \nFamilies are literally torn apart or pushed to the brink of financial \ndisaster due to the overwhelming costs of long-term care.\n  This lack of protection pulls the rug out from under hard working \nfamilies at a time when they are in their greatest need. Growing frail \nor learning to function with severe disabilities is a formidable task \nin itself. Yet this is only half the battle for an uninsured older \nAmerican--since at the same time they must face huge financial burdens \nposed by long-term care.\n  The legislation levels the playing field between acute and long-term \ncare services, and provides all Americans with incentives to purchase \nprotection against the risk of catastrophic long-term care expenses. As \nhealthy and as independent as we may want to stay, \n[[Page S3066]]  the fountain of youth has yet to be discovered.\n  We are all vulnerable to diseases such as Alzheimer's\n   Parkinson's, and osteoporosis that can leave us mentally or \nphysically disabled. We must accept the risk of needing long-term care \nand consider it in our normal retirement planning.\n\n  This bill encourages personal responsibility and makes it easier for \nindividuals to plan for their future long-term care needs. It provides \nimportant tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care insurance \nand places consumer protections on long-term care insurance policies so \nquality products will be affordable and accessible to more Americans.\n  It allows States to develop programs under which individuals can keep \nmore of their assets and still qualify for Medicaid if they take steps \nto finance their own long-term care needs, allows individuals to make \ntax free withdrawals from their individual retirement accounts without \npenalty if they purchase private long-term care insurance, and provides \nfor consumer education to help families decide how to best plan for \ntheir own particular circumstances.\n  Stimulating the private market through tax incentives and asset \nprotection programs is a long-term investment in reducing Americans' \nreliance on Medicaid, and other Federal and State entitlements. Just as \nemployer-sponsored health insurance got a boost after Congress exempted \nemployers' payments for health insurance from corporate taxes, the \nlong-term care market needs a major boost if we are seriously going to \nencourage individuals to provide for their own long-term care needs.\n  Last year Congress was involved in an exhausting debate over how to \nreform our entire health care system. To my great disappointment, that \ndebate did not yield legislation that could be passed on a bipartisan \nbasis. Instead we fought an all or nothing battle for health care \nreform that left the American public no better off than when we began.\n  Long-term care reform was one of the victims of this all or nothing \nstrategy. Several bills contained provisions to establish a non-means-\ntested long-term care program that would have cost taxpayers over $48 \nbillion. While the program would have certainly provided necessary \nlong-term care services to many families, it was simply unrealistic to \nbuild a large publicly funded program at a time when we were trying to \nbalance the budget. Furthermore, creating a non-means-tested program \nwould have only strengthened the misconception that the Government will \npay for long-term care and that there is little need to purchase \nprotection.\n  As Abraham Lincoln once cautioned, ``We must not promise what we \nought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot.''\n  The provisions included in the long-term care reform bill I am \nintroducing today are not only reasonable, but enjoy strong bipartisan \nsupport. They were included in almost every health care bill introduced \nlast year and are an important part of the Senior's Equity Act in the \nHouse Republican Contract With America.\n  A strong private long-term care market will not only give individuals \ngreater financial security for their future, but will ease the \nfinancial burden on the Federal Government for years to come, as our \npopulation ages and more elderly persons require long-term care.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation which \nwill improve the financial security of older Americans and their \nfamilies both now and in the future. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3065-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3066-S3068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RELEASE OF GAO HIGH RISK LIST REPORT\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office [GAO] \nhas just released its second series of reports which identify the \nFederal program areas they consider most vulnerable to waste, fraud, \nabuse, and mismanagement--placing hundreds of billions of taxpayer \ndollars at risk.\n  GAO began its high-risk program in 1990, with much encouragement on \nmy behalf as the then-chairman of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. Its purpose was to highlight problems that were costing the \nGovernment--meaning U.S. taxpayers--billions of dollars.\n  In 1992, GAO issued a series of reports that outlined the problems, \nroot causes, and needed actions for each of the areas designated as \nhigh-risk. At that time, some agencies were beginning to address their \nhigh risks but progress was minimal and the task ahead was daunting.\n  Under my leadership, the Committee on Governmental Affairs strongly \nsupported GAO's high-risk effort. We worked with them as well as agency \nheads to address problems resulting from a lack of accountability and \nweak management controls. We also labored hard to provide the necessary \noversight and follow-up legislation, on a bipartisan basis, to finally \nbegin addressing these major problems and start a concentrated and \nsystemic approach to governmentwide management.\n  Efforts like strengthening and expanding the Inspectors General Act \nto detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Or the Chief Financial \nOfficers [CFO] Act of 1990, which is forcing Federal agencies to \nestablish formal financial management structures, including a chief \nfinancial officer, and that for the very first time in our Nation's \nhistory will produce audited financial statements for certain accounts \nand programs. Just last year, we also passed the Government Management \nReform Act [GMRA] which, among other things, will require--beginning \nwith fiscal year 1997--an audited financial statement on programs and \noperations for the Government as a whole.\n  Also, I was pleased to work with Senator Roth, our new committee \nchairman with a long interest in these areas, to pass the 1993 \nGovernment Performance and Results Act [GPRA]. This legislation \nmandates that Federal agencies develop performance measurement systems \nso that we can begin to determine how these programs are working, \nwhether they meet their objectives, and what return and value we are \ngetting for our money.\n  Another important bipartisan effort is our committee's continuing \nwork to reauthorize the Paperwork Reduction Act. As in the last \nCongress, our committee has reported out legislation to reauthorize and \nimprove the act. We are now waiting action by the full Senate, which we \nare sure will duplicate last year's unanimous vote in favor of the \nlegislation. Our bill strengthens the Act's paperwork clearance \nrequirements. It also gives new focus to the Act's information \nresources management [IRM] provisions. The IRM reforms are critically \nimportant and will help agencies address the information technology \nrisks highlighted in GAO's new report.\n  One other area here deserves attention, that is comprehensive \nprocurement reform legislation, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \nAct [FASA] of 1994, which was passed due to the efforts of myself and \nseveral other Members on both sides of the aisle. it significantly \nstreamlines the procurement process, saving time and taxpayer dollars, \nthrough the revision and consolidation of acquisition states to bring a \ndose of common sense and reality into our acquisition process.\n  I do believe that as these laws become more fully implemented, as \nwell as integrated, we will have come a long way toward finally getting \ncontrol of the creature we call ``government.'' These measures will, \nunlike any previous laws we have passed, improve the performance of \nFederal programs and allow us to use financial and budgetary \ninformation to better chart the course of Government expenditures.\n  But, as this GAO series shows, we are not there yet. In fact, we have \nquite a ways to go.\n  That is not to say there is not any good news the taxpayers can be \nthankful for. On the contrary, there is.\n  For example, according to GAO, 5 out of the 18 previously designated \nhigh risk areas have made enough progress as a result of this \nconcentrated effort to be taken off the list. The Bank Insurance Fund, \nfor instance, went from being in the red, that is from having a \nnegative fund balance to a $17.5 billion surplus since the last report. \nThe dramatic turnaround was caused by the combination of an improving \neconomy, legislative actions, and agency and industry reforms.\n  Congressional actions also played a key role in reducing the risks \nposed by the Resolution Trust Corporation \n[[Page S3067]]  [RTC] and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n[PBGC], thereby enabling those agencies to be removed from the high-\nrisk program.\n  There is still a bit of more good news from which taxpayers can take \nsome justifiable relief. According to GAO's report, 10 of the 13 areas \nthat remain on its high-risk list have meaningful improvement \ninitiatives underway. Because so many of these initiatives are in the \nearliest stages of implementation and will require continued commitment \nand resolve to see them through, it is premature to declare any \nvictories. But there is some hope: The high-risk program experience \nclearly shows that focusing on high-risk problems prompts long-needed \nimprovement actions.\n  And hope will be needed because, notwithstanding the improvements \ncited and areas removed, GAO'S high-risk list has grown. In its new \nseries, GAO has categorized its 20 current high-risk areas into 6 broad \ncategories that represent the Government's most critical problems.\n  These categories cover almost all of the Government's $1.25 trillion \nrevenue collection efforts and hundreds of billions of dollars in \nexpenditures. They represent areas where the Government is carelessly \nand needlessly losing billions of dollars and missing huge \nopportunities to achieve its objectives at less cost and with better \nservice delivery.\n  Let us take a look at them.\n  First, accountability and cost-effective management is not provided \nfor in Department of Defense [DOD] programs. DOD spending for 1995 is \nestimated at $270 billion, 18 percent of the total Federal budget and \nabout half of all discretionary funds. Yet DOD cannot accurately \naccount for how it spends its funds or for the $1 trillion in assets it \nhas worldwide.\n  GAO cites four areas particularly vulnerable: financial management \nsystems, practices, and procedures; contract management; the weapons \nsystems acquisition process, and inventory management. Because these \nareas are so broad and the weaknesses so pervasive, DOD's entire budget \ncan be considered at-risk. Some egregious examples of Defense problems \ninclude:\n  Vendors who have been paid $29 billion in disbursements that cannot \nbe matched against purchase invoices to determine if these payments \nwere proper.\n  A former Navy officer received $3 million in fraudulent payments for \nover 100 false invoice claims, and approximately $8 million in Army \npayroll payments were made to unauthorized persons, including 6 ghost \nsoldiers and 76 deserters.\n  Contractors themselves--not DOD--detected and returned to the \nPentagon $957 million in overpayments during fiscal year 1994 alone.\n  DOD, with $80 billion a year at stake, has not yet solved pervasive \nproblems in its weapons systems acquisition process, including \nunreliable cost data, unrealistic schedule estimates, and unaffordable \nprogram plans.\n  DOD, even after disposing of $43 billion in unneeded inventory over \nthe past 3 years, still holds unnecessary items valued at $36 billion, \nor 47 percent of its current inventory.\n  Second, revenue owed to the Government is not collected and accounted \nfor.\n  The Internal Revenue Service [IRS] and the Customs Service [USCS] \ncurrently collect $1.25 trillion annually, but neither agency can say \nhow much more is owed to the Government and ought to be collected. The \ninability to adequately estimate what is due the Government could be \ncosting the Government billions of dollars.\n  A 1992 IRS estimate put unreported taxes--the so-called tax gap--at \n$127 billion; however, IRS admits that this estimate was not based on \ncurrent, complete data. In addition, both IRS and Customs remain unable \nto accurately account for amounts that have been collected. GAO \nconsiders four revenue collection areas to be high-risk: IRS financial \nmanagement; IRS tax receivables; IRS filing fraud, and Customs Service \nfinancial management. Examples of revenue collection problems include:\n  Over $90 billion of transactions were not posted to taxpayer \naccounts.\n  Delinquent taxes receivable nearly doubled from $87 billion to $156 \nbillion between 1990 and 1994, while annual collections of delinquent \ntaxes declined from $25.5 billion to $23.5 billion.\n  During the first 6 months of 1994, IRS identified nearly 35,000 \nfraudulent paper returns and 24,000 fraudulent electronic returns--\nincreases of 151 percent and 51 percent, respectively, over the same \nperiod 1 year before. While IRS admits to losing tens of millions of \ndollars to detected fraud schemes, some estimates indicate undetected \nfraud could be costing the Government billions of dollars.\n  Serious problems remain in the seized asset program at the Customs \nService, placing tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars in cash \nand other property vulnerable to theft and misappropriation. In just \none case, thieves broke into a Customs facility and stole 356 pounds of \ncocaine.\n  The Customs Service has not implemented the controls, systems, and \nprocesses to ensure that carriers, importers, and their agents comply \nwith trade laws, or that important trade statistics are reliable.\n  Third, multibillion-dollar investments in information technology do \nnot provide an adequate return.\n  The Government has spent more than $200 billion on information \nmanagement systems during the last 12 years. Yet, successful automation \nprojects are the exception rather than the rule. As a result, critical \nfinancial, program, and management information systems remain largely \nincompatible, costly to operate and maintain, and woefully inadequate \nin meeting current users' needs.\n  GAO has chosen four multibillion dollar information technology \ninitiatives--there are evidently other projects with similar \ndifficulties available to chose from--to add to its high-risk list \nbecause these particular ones have experienced past failures, involve \ncomplex technology, or are critical to agencies' missions. These \nprojects do not just have financial implications. Rather, they impact \nthe very health and safety of all Americans--the air traffic control \nsystem and the national weather system, for example.\n  The $36 billion air traffic control modernization project has been \nplagued by failures and critical components have had to be canceled, \nreplaced, and/or restructured.\n  After spending $2.5 billion of its estimated $8 billion cost, IRS' \ntax system modernization [TSM] initiative still doesn't have the \nnecessary business and technical foundation to achieve the systems' \ngoals and objectives. To persuade IRS of the need to develop an overall \nplan for the modernization, Congress reduced IRS' fiscal year 1995 \nbudget request by $339 million.\n  DOD is spending some $3 billion annually on its corporate information \nmanagement [CIM] initiative even though it has yet to examine the \nbusiness processes being automated for reengineering opportunities.\n  The National Weather Service modernization project has more than \ndoubled in cost to $4 billion and its completion is estimated to be 4 \nyears behind schedule.\n  Fourth, Medicare claims fraud and abuse is widespread.\n  Last year the Government spent over $440 million a day, or $162 \nbillion, on Medicare. Only the costs for DOD, Social Security, and \ninterest on the debt are higher. And it is estimated that Medicare \nspending will more than double by the year 2003 to more than $389 \nbillion.\n  While no one, including GAO, has been able to quantify exactly how \nmuch of Medicare spending is attributable to fraud and abuse, health \ncare experts have estimated that 10 percent of national health spending \nis lost to such practices. Even if the number were lower--say 8 or 6 \npercent--when applied to $162 billion, that amount is devastating. And \nit will become even more devastating as the program grows. The Health \nCare Financing Administration [HCFA] is aware that health care scams \nand abusive practices plague Medicare, but the exploitation continues. \nFor example:\n  Medicare has been charged rates as high as $600 per hour for speech \nand occupational therapy, though therapists' salaries range from under \n$20 to $32 per hour.\n  One shell company, which existed solely for the purpose of billing--\nand bilking--Medicare, added about $135,000 in administrative costs to \nthe cost of therapy services in 1 year.\n  [[Page S3068]] Medicare has paid health maintenance organizations \n[HMO's] from 6 to 28 percent more than it would have spent had those \nsame beneficiaries remained in the fee-for-service sector.\n  A national psychiatric hospital chain, charged with fraudulently \nincreasing its reimbursements, in 1994 paid over $300 million in the \nlargest settlement to the Federal Government for health care fraud.\n  Fifth, loan program losses are too high.\n  The Federal Government has become the Nation's largest source of \ncredit. It obligated almost $23 billion in new direct loans and \nguaranteed $204 billion in new non-Federal lending last year. Now, \nwhether you agree with the Government's role as a banker or not, you \nhave to agree that the Government is not doing a good job of minimizing \nits losses on its loan and guarantees.\n  The Office of Management and Budget [OMB] has estimated that of the \n$241 billion owed the Government for direct loans and claims paid on \ndefaulted guaranteed loans, $50 billion is delinquent and at risk of \nloss. GAO's high risk program concentrates on three lending programs:\n  Farm loan programs have become a continuous source of credit for many \nborrowers and have had a high rate of loan defaults, resulting in the \nloss of over $6 billion of taxpayers' money from 1991 through 1994. In \naddition, its outstanding loan portfolio still contains nearly $5 \nbillion in delinquent debt.\n  Student financial aid programs have been successful in providing \nmoney for postsecondary education but have been costly, nearly $25 \nbillion in losses in the guaranteed student loan program alone with \n$2.4 billion in losses just last year.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], which ensures \nsome $400 billion in housing loans, guarantees more than $400 billion \nin outstanding securities, and spends $25 billion a year on housing \nprograms, is at risk because of fundamental management weaknesses.\n  Sixth. The management of Federal contracts at civilian agencies needs \nimprovement.\n  Civilian agencies spend tens of billions of dollars per year on \ncontracts, yet they often don't get what they pay for or they reimburse \ncontractors for unallowable or unreasonable costs. According to GAO, at \nthe heart of contracting problems, there is a lack of senior-level \nmanagement attention. GAO has focused on three contracting areas:\n  The Department of Energy [DOE] spends about $15 billion annually \nthrough management and operating contracts but has failed to protect \nthe Government's interests. DOE did not require its contractors to \nprepare auditble financial statements nor did it audit, every 5 years \nas is required, the net expenditures reports contractors did prepare.\n  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] spends about \n$12 billion to $13 billion each year--90 percent of its funding--on \ncontracts, but with poor oversight. In addition, NASA has traditionally \nassumed virtually all risks related to contract costs and results. This \nhas led to frequent funding increases, schedule delays, and performance \nproblems on many of NASA's large space projects.\n  Contract management problems in the multibillion-dollar Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA] Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program have \nprovided contractors too little incentive to control costs. A recent \nreview of three contractors showed that all three billed the Government \nfor entertainment, tickets for sporting events, or alcoholic beverage \ncosts that were not allowable. But contractors are probably not too \nworried about what they bill. As of August 1994, there were 528 \nunfilled requests for audits of Superfund contractor costs.\n  These are just the highlights of GAO's new high-risk list. They show \nwhat we're up against if we are to achieve real and measurable progress \nin the battle against Government waste and mismanagement. While this \nseries indicates that with a concerted and committed effort it is \npossible to correct and rectify program weaknesses--putting less \ntaxpayer dollars at risk--it also reveals what happens when systems are \ndeficient or administrators are less than vigilant, or both.\n  Only with a continuing and persistent effort can we in Congress, \nworking with the administration and GAO, attack these problems, one by \none, case by case. If we are ever to restore people's faith in \nGovernment--and its overall credibility--it has to be done, and done \nquickly. As I have in the past, I will pledge my best efforts with the \neventual hope that, one day, there will be no high-risk list at all. I \nurge my colleagues to work together to accomplish this goal.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3066-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE CONGRESSIONAL PENSION EQUITY ACT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to become a \ncosponsor of S. 228, the Congressional Pension Equity Act. I commend \nSenator Bryan for his leadership on this issue and I look forward to \nworking with him to reform our pension system and bring it in line with \nall other Federal civilian pensions.\n  Like pensions in the private sector, the pension a member of Congress \nreceives is based upon length of service and rate of pay. So, naturally \na senior member, or staffer, earns a bigger pension than an individual \nwith just a few years of service. But, under the current system members \nand staff receive substantially more generous pensions than other \nFederal employees. This bill will rectify that situation and bring \nparity between the legislative branch and the executive branch. Those \nwho serve in Congress should be treated the same as other Federal \nemployees.\n  For those who claim that people come to Congress and serve too long, \nthis fix should end the careerism charge. Overly generous pensions will \nno longer entice people to stay in their congressional jobs. \nCongressional service will be no more desirable than other Federal \nservice, and members and staff will not be deterred from rotating out \nof Congress.\n  This bill makes three important changes to congressional pensions. \nFirst, it places a cap on retirement benefits. Now, retired members can \nwind up receiving pensions that are bigger than the salaries they made \nwhile in Congress. The bill will ensure that pension benefits do not \nexceed the highest salary earned while in Congress. Second, it \nestablishes a uniform rate of accrual for all Federal employees, so \nthat congressional employees earn their pension benefits at the same \nrate as all other Federal employees. And, finally it adjusts the \ncontribution rate for congressional employees to conform to the rate \npaid by all other employees. Currently, members and staff pay a \nslightly higher contribution for a much more generous benefit. This \nbill will require congressional and executive branch employees, \nincluding Members of Congress, to pay the same for the same benefit.\n  Congressional retirement benefits are not an entitlement. We are in \nthe midst of streamlining and cutting back the scope of the Federal \nGovernment. We are trying to make the Federal Government more efficient \nand effective. That's what the American people want and what they \ndeserve. Well, one place to begin is with congressional pensions. This \nbill represents that effort. I look forward to early consideration of \nthis bill by the Government Affairs Committee and its swift passage by \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3068-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3068-S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE CONCERNED CITIZENS OF BAYONNE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \npay tribute to the Concerned Citizens of Bayonne [CCB] on the \norganization's 25th anniversary. I also want to call special attention \nto the contributions that Mr. Frank Perrucci has made to the \norganization and the community.\n  In 1970, Frank and Jean Perrucci, Vinnie Perrucci, Joseph Brache, Sal \nCovella, Penny Covella, Pete Capitano, John Baccarella, Jean McMahon, \nand Nicholas Mangelli met at Frank and Jean's home in Bayonne. It was \nhere that they agreed unanimously to form the Concerned Citizens of \nBayonne, so that citizens could participate in decisions which affect \nBayonne, Hudson County, and New Jersey.\n  No time was wasted. They immediately became involved in the upgrading \nof the jury system, led the opposition to the taxation of Social \nSecurity \n[[Page S3069]]  benefits, heightened community awareness on the evils \nof pornography, and called attention to the location of a toxic waste \nfacility in Newark Bay.\n  The CCB continuously reaffirms its belief that a strong and vibrant \ncommunity exists only where its citizens get involved and stay \ninvolved. They accomplish this by initiating community efforts to \nsupport projects such as building an indoor ice skating rink, keeping \nparks clean, and supporting programs like Toys for Tots and Pennies for \nMiss Liberty. They have participated in and led fundraising drives to \nassist the Bayonne Hospital, the high school football team, Italian \nearthquake victims, and the starving millions in Ethiopia.\n  Mr. Frank Perrucci, while carving out his own career as a leader with \nthe Laborers' International Union of North America, always found time \nfor others. He served as an aide to Congressmen Dominick Daniels and \nJoseph LeFante and is a former director of community development in \nBayonne. Over the years, as captain of the Catholic War Veterans color \nguard, he has travelled extensively throughout New Jersey, \nparticipating in veterans events and parades.\n  Frank, himself a member of the merchant marine and a soldier during \nWWII, made sure that his organization always remembered to support \nAmerican military troops during peacetime and war.\n  During Desert Storm, CCB members regularly corresponded with military \npersonnel overseas, as well as conducted drives to send ``goodies'' and \nnecessities to those supporting democracy so far from home.\n  Aside from being the proud husband of Jean, the father of four \nwonderful children and seven grandchildren, Frank Perrucci is quoted as \nsaying that the proudest part of his life is serving others through the \ncommitted, loyal, and hard-working members of the Concerned Citizens of \nBayonne.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I take special pleasure in standing before \nyou today to thank and congratulate Mr. Frank Perrucci and the members \nof the Concerned Citizens of Bayonne. They are a special group of \npeople who know what it takes to make a strong community. They have \nunselfishly committed themselves time after time to keeping Bayonne one \nof the safest, cleanest, and proudest cities in the United \nStates.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3068-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         BISHOP KENNETH POVISH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exemplary \nindividual, Bishop Kenneth Povish. This year Bishop Povish will \ncelebrate his 45th year as a priest, his 25th year as a Bishop and his \n20th year as bishop of the diocese of Lansing, MI.\n  I was lucky enough to grow up in Lansing and attend college in that \ncommunity. Thus I came to know Bishop Povish as a man who has dedicated \nhis life to serving his community's spiritual needs.\n  Bishop Povish was born in Alpena, MI. There he attended parochial \ngrammar schools and public high school. After graduating from Detroit \nSacred Heart Seminary in 1946, he went on to earn his master's degree \nin education from the Catholic University of America in 1950. In that \nsame year Bishop Povish was ordained a priest in Saginaw, MI, and began \nhis pastoral duties in Rogers City. In 1952 he became assistant at \nSaint Hyacinth Catholic Church in Bay City, MI.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Bishop Povish helped found Saint \nPaul's Seminary in Saginaw, MI. There he taught Latin, history, and \nreligion and, from 1960 to 1966, served as dean of the college. He then \nwent on to train over 400 lay catechists as diocesan director of the \nConfraternity of Christian Doctrine. In 1970 Pope Paul VI named him \nbishop and assigned him to Crookston, MN, until 1975.\n  Luckily for Lansing, Bishop Povish then was named to current position \nas bishop of that city. Since then he has enriched the spiritual life \nof his community in many ways. He established the Bishop's Council on \nAlcoholism and has written extensively on that subject. He has reached \nout to the less fortunate and shown his deep faith by teaching others \nthe ways of Jesus Christ.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor to stand before my colleagues on behalf \nof the citizens of Michigan to congratulate Bishop Povish on his 45 \nyears of selfless dedication to the Catholic Church and to the Lansing \ncommunity. May God bless Bishop Povish and allow him to continue his \nservice to those in need of faith, hope, and charity, especially in my \nhometown of Lansing, MI.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3069-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           HONORING ENGINEERS DURING NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our Nation's \nengineers during National Engineers Week. Although we might not realize \ntheir presence, engineers have worked tirelessly to improve our world \nthrough science and technology.\n  Without engineers, there would be no transportation. Engineers design \ncars, trains, and buses, as well as devices that improve them. If not \nfor engineers, we would have no structurally sound buildings, bridges, \nor highways. And their achievements do not end there.\n  Engineers create the technology that help doctors diagnose illnesses. \nWorking with the medical profession, they have developed sensitive \nequipment used in medical research. Options are now available for so \nmany people that would not otherwise be able to lead normal and \nproductive lives.\n  Transportation, infrastructure, and medicine are just some of the \nareas influenced by the mastery of the engineer. Engineers' effect on \nthe communications industry has catapulted us into a new age of \ntechnology. Magnetic tape recording, developed by an engineer, is used \nin audio cassettes, videotape, computer floppy disks, and credit card \nmagnetic strips. We use these items everyday and never even think twice \nabout it, thanks to engineers.\n  And who is responsible for the progress in the entertainment \nindustry? We are seeing more of the morphing technique in movies and \ncommercials. Animation has become so advanced because of these \ntechnological geniuses. This profession has brought us some of the most \ncomplex special effects that keep us spellbound during a movie.\n  For their efforts to improve the world we live in, the engineering \nprofession should be applauded. For their work to improve our future, \nthey should be admired.\n  That is why, during this National Engineers Week, I am taking the \nopportunity to thank engineers, in all fields, for their \naccomplishments.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3069-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3069-S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF CHARLIE RODGERS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nrise today to honor an outstanding Kentuckian who recently passed away. \nCharlie Rodgers of Hopkins County, KY was an outstanding citizen as \nwell as a leader in his profession and community.\n  Mr. Rodgers gave wholeheartedly to his community. Mr. Rodgers was the \nretired owner of Hales Furniture Store. During his lifetime he served \nas president of the Downtown Retail Merchants Association, president of \nthe Rotary Club, chairman of the Salvation Army, and charter member of \nthe Salvation Army Board of Directors. Mr. Rodgers was also the \nrecipient of the Salvation Army's Other Award. He was a member of the \nProvidence Rural Methodist Church and dedicated many hours to religious \nservice.\n  Mr Rodgers was actively involved in both local and State level \npolitics. He served as a leader in the development of the Republican \nParty in his county. Mr. Rodgers served on the State Board of Elections \nfor two 4-year terms, and was as member of the State Republican Party \nfor 20 years. Although he had always shown an interest in politics, he \nnever sought election to public office until 1993 when he ran for the \nthird district magistrate seat. He won this election upsetting a long \ntime democratic stronghold.\n  While we all admire Mr. Rodgers' success in serving his community, \nchurch, and the Republican Party to the best of his ability, I believe \nthat Charlie Rodgers was even more prosperous as an individual. All who \nencountered him knew that they were dealing with a true Kentucky \ngentlemen. He was looked upon as a very honest, kind, and compassionate \nman.\n  Charlie Rodgers, and his wife Peggy, are both long-time friends of \nmine. Mr. \n[[Page S3070]]  President, I can say with great certainty that his \ncommitment to integrity and honesty was unwavering and shone through in \neverything that he was involved in.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Charlie \nRodgers. Hopkins County will certainly miss his presence and sense of \ndevotion. I am confident that Mr. Rodgers strength of character and \nbreadth of accomplishment will remain a standard of excellence for \ngenerations to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/23/senate-section/article/S3069-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 202 AND S. 207\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
