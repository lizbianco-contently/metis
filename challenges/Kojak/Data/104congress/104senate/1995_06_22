Mr. President, I rise this morning to begin the \nfreshman focus. The freshman class, all 11 of us of the 104th Congress, \nhave taken about the role of coming to the floor on a regular basis to \nfocus the Senate on issues of importance really to the next generation \nof Americans. We believe that as freshmen we have a special role to \nplay in looking toward the future and seeing how we can focus the \nattention of the Senate on solving the long-term problems that face \nthis country.\n  Today, under the able leadership of Senator Thomas from Wyoming, who \nhas been a real champion in organizing this effort and bringing the \nfreshman class in the Chamber on a very regular basis, we are going to \ntalk about the Clinton ``budget.'' When I say Clinton ``budget,'' I use \nthe term ``budget'' in quotes because we do not really have what I \nthink anyone would seriously consider a detailed budget of how the \nPresident is going to solve the deficit problem that faces this \ncountry. In fact, we have 6 pages--photocopied on both sides, that is \n12 pages total--of budget specifics as to how he is going to reduce the \nbudget deficit to zero over the next 10 years.\n  Now, it is interesting; if you look at what is going to be required \nto balance the budget over the next 10 years, it requires about $1.6 \ntrillion in spending cuts. That is according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Now, you say: How do they figure that out? How does the Congressional \nBudget Office come up with the assumption that we need to cut spending \nan aggregate amount of $1.6 trillion? They make certain basic \nassumptions, economic assumptions.\n  The economic assumptions that the Congressional Budget Office makes \nis a percentage growth in the economy. They say, well, we estimate over \nthe next 10 years that the economy will grow on average a certain \npercentage per year. The estimates, frankly, if you look at them, are \npretty flat. I think about 2.3 percent growth per year over the next 7 \nyears because they were doing a 7-year budget.\n  Now the President has come up with 10. They extended it up to 10 \nyears. It does not take into account recessions. And most economists \nwill tell you, over the next 10 years we are scheduled to have at least \none recession, probably two recessions. Now, they may not be deep \nrecessions, but they will talk about much lower rates of growth and \nmaybe even some negative growth during that period of time.\n  Now, what happens when we have recessions? Well, when we have \nrecessions, tax revenues go down, expenditures to the Federal \nGovernment go up because unemployment claims go up, welfare payments go \nup, other kinds of Government supports, safety net programs, are much \nmore in use.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, I think, was sort of averaging out \nthe high and low periods of growth above 2 or 3 percent and periods of \ngrowth below and saying, on average, it is roughly 2.3 percent or maybe \na little higher, 2.4 percent in the future.\n  They also make an assumption on interest rates. Why are interest \nrates important? Well, when you have nearly $5 trillion of debt that \nyou have to finance, interest rates are important. The higher the \ninterest rates, the higher the interest costs, the higher the [[Page S \n8842]] deficit. So interest rate projections also affect what the \nbottom line deficit will be. So they have projected out interest rates, \nagain on a conservative basis, because again interest rates fluctuate. \nIf you look at the last 10 years of the history of this country, the \ninterest rates went from double digits to 3 to 4 percent. So you may \nsee a wide variation in the next 10 years. In the next 10 years, you \nwill see a wide variation. They try to work it out, act conservatively. \nYou want to have realistic numbers here. And they came out with some \ninterest rate projections.\n  Now, they use the combination of growth projections and interest rate \nprojections to determine their basic economic assumptions of what the \ndeficit will be. And then they say, ``Now, to meet zero, you have to \ncut so much money out of Government programs or raise taxes to get to \nzero.''\n  How does the President accomplish his 10-year balanced budget? Well, \nhe does not do it by looking at what the Congressional Budget Office \nhas done and then making the spending cuts or tax increases necessary \nto get to a balanced budget. In fact, in his plan he has, instead of \n$1.6 trillion over 10 years which is needed to balance the budget \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, he has $1 trillion in \ncuts, substantially less than what is necessary. Yet he gets the \nbalance.\n  You say, How does he do that? How does he cut less money than is \nrequired to get the balance and still get there? Here is how he does \nit. He does it by changing the assumptions. He assumes a higher rate of \ngrowth in the economy. He assumes lower interest rates. Sort of wishes \nit away. Just decides, ``Well, we know we will have higher growth and \nlower interest rates, and as a result we will have less financing \ncosts. Because interest rates are lower, we will have higher rates of \ngrowth, which means more tax revenues and less Government expenditures. \nSo we will reduce the debt through economic assumptions.''\n  Well, that is nice. It is an easy way to do it. I guess if he wanted \nto, he could go back and just estimate even higher growth rates and \nlower interest rates and not have to do anything. But that is not real.\n  What is the actual effect on the numbers? It is interesting. Look at \nMedicare. Under the President's budget, if you look at the President's \nMedicare number, not what he says he is going to have to reduce \nspending by in Medicare, but the actual amount of money he spends on \nMedicare every year over the next 10 years, in the first 3 years the \nPresident spends less on Medicare than we do, but it is not as big a \ncut as we have. Now, you say, ``Wait a minute. How can that be? If he \nspends less on Medicare next year than we do under the Republican \nbudget, less on Medicare in year two than we do on Medicare and less on \nMedicare in year three, how can his cuts be less?''\n  Well, he assumes a lower rate of growth in Medicare and then cuts \nfrom that. So what he has done is--we have growth of 10 percent per \nyear programmed in because that is what Medicare is doing. It is \ngrowing at about 10 percent a year. We have that programmed in for the \nnext 10 years. What the President has done is he assumes, first, that \nMedicare growth is not going to continue at 10 percent, it will only \ncontinue at 7 percent and then cuts from that. So, as a result, the cut \nis not as much, but the number is actually lower than the number that \nwe are using. So he sort of cuts in part by assuming it away and cuts \nthe other part by actually doing it.\n  So, to suggest that the President is going to cut Medicare less than \nwe are or change Medicare less than we are is just ridiculous. His \nnumbers actually are lower than our numbers.\n  So, I would just suggest, if you look at the specifics of what the \nPresident has done, he has assumed away this budget deficit. He has \nsuggested that we can get rid of the budget deficit by having rosy \neconomic projections, rosy projections on growth and interest rates and \nnot do the hard work of actually having to make decisions on how we are \ngoing to pare back the size of Government.\n  As a result of that, as a result of his unwillingness to face the \nmusic, to use the Congressional Budget Office projections, which he \nsaid in the State of the Union, just down at the other end of this \nhallway, right down here. Walk out the middle door here and just keep \nwalking and you will come to the House of Representatives. And you walk \nthrough that door and keep walking, you will walk right into the podium \nof the House of Representatives. Right there, right at the other end of \nthe hall, the President got up and said, ``We will use the \nCongressional Budget Office scoring because they have been the best at \ndoing it. We all have to use the same numbers.'' He said that.\n  Now, I know it is going to come as a shock to many that he has not \nlived up to his promise, but he did not. He is not using their numbers \nanymore. Why? Well, the same reason every President has not used their \nnumbers. Because their numbers are tougher. It is harder to balance the \nbudget when you use real numbers. It is easier when you get your \nfriends at the Department of the Treasury to sort of wish this stuff \naway. Well, unfortunately we cannot wish it away.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will suspend for 1 second. I want to \nmake sure that we end with day 34 of the President's unwillingness to \ncome to the American people with a serious budget proposal to balance \nthe budget. We are now in day 34, as I said before. We only have 101 \ndays to go before the next fiscal year. As I said before, I will \nprobably put a little thing over here for the ``1.'' Hopefully I will \nnot have to. Hopefully I will not have to come back. But until the \nPresident gets serious about this and is honest with the American \npublic about how they are going to balance the budget, I am going to be \nback.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If the Senator would yield. Let me first say how much I \nappreciate and congratulate the Senator on his continuing efforts to \nget some real understanding. I think some time ago the freshman class, \nthose elected to the body in November, came here more dedicated to more \nserious work to balance the budget than about any other issue. One of \nthe most difficult things for all of us, particularly people listening \nand voters, is what are the real facts? I mean, we start out and \neverybody wants to balance the budget. ``Well, we do not need an \namendment,'' they say. ``We will do it.'' Then we come down to do it. \nBut we cannot do it on the backs of these. You cannot do it here.\n  I guess my question is: It is sort of interesting that most of the \nPresident's budget is backloaded, and it happens after the year 2000. \nNow, that is 6 years from now. That is the rest of this Presidential \nterm and one other term. Is there any significance to the fact that \nmost of the pain comes after the year 2000?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As a matter of fact, if you look at the percentage of \nthe cuts the President makes in discretionary and mandatory programs, \nall the cuts he has to make, 20 percent of them--we have 10 years in \nthe President's budget. You would think that the responsible thing to \ndo would be to cut the budget--if you are going to do 100 percent of \nhis cuts, if you take all the cuts he is going to make, you do it \nequally over the period of years, a straight line, 10 percent a year; \n10 years, 100 percent of the cuts.\n  What the President does is cut very little the first year, cuts \nvirtually nothing. In fact, of all the cuts he suggests, only 2 percent \noccur in the first year. If you look at the second year, only 3 percent \noccur in the second year. After the first 2 years, when you should have \ncut 20 percent to get on your line of 100 percent, he has cut 5 \npercent. You go to the third year, he cuts 5 percent. So over the first \n3 years he has cut 10 percent of the amount needed to cut over the 10 \nyears.\n  Where are the big cuts? Where is the big lifting, the heavy burden \nthe last 2 years, the last 3 years? Twenty percent in the last year; 18 \npercent the year before that; 15 percent the year before that.\n  I mean, well over--well, about 50 percent of the cuts occur in the \nlast 3 years. So he back-end loads this thing. He does not do heavy \nlifting early on. It is left to the next generation, not surprisingly, \nand next Presidents to deal with this.\n  Again, that is another form of wishing it away. I am sure every \nPresident has presented budgets at one point in [[Page S 8843]] time \nthat suggest they will balance the budget, but they never suggest we do \nit starting now, they always suggest we do it down the road sometime. \nThat is not the responsible way to do it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is interesting that Mark Phillips from the Concord \nCoalition says:\n\n       Funny thing about these elusive outyears, they never seem \n     to arrive.\n\n  Is it not also true that the tax reductions, the tax cuts the \nPresident has go into effect much earlier than do the spending cuts?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is always the way it is with taxes. For example, \nyou can look at the Clinton budget in 1993. We had tax increases and \nspending cuts. Tax increases went into effect right away. We felt all \nthose tax increases immediately. What we have not felt yet from the \nfirst budget in 1993 of the President is the spending cuts. They do not \ncome around. They have not occurred. So now we are back and having to \nmake the tough decisions on actually reducing spending.\n  Again, the Senator is right with the tax cuts. The President wants to \nget the tax cuts in now because it is election time; you want to help \npeople out, give back a little of their taxes. Now he wants to cut them \nright before the election. It is clear, the spending cuts do not come.\n  Mr. THOMAS. One question. This is sort of unclear. We had the \nPresident, of course, and his advisers saying it was not prudent to set \na time. That is when we had 7 years and he had no budget. Now he has a \ntime and Mrs. Tyson says that is exactly what we should do, even though \nshe decried it before.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Decried it, she was outraged that someone would do \nthis. This was going to be the fatal blow to our economy. She went at \ngreat length to say that setting a time certain to bring the budget \ninto balance would be disastrous for the economy, and now that the \nPresident has been convinced to do it, it is now a good idea.\n  It amazes me, it absolutely amazes me how they just--as \nRepresentative Obey from Wisconsin said about the President of his \nparty--President Clinton's decision is like the weather, if you do not \nlike it, wait and it will change. I think that is pretty much the way \nhis advisers see it, that he has no responsibility to tell the country \nwhat they believe; their responsibility is to tell the President a line \non what they believe.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator is right. Mrs. Tyson, on February 6, said \nthat their deficit path is a sound deficit path, both for the economy \nin the near term and forcasting the economy, something she said they \nwere dealing with, that they have it under control.\n  This was in February, and then this body rejected that budget 99 to \nzip. She said more recently that we have to balance the budget, we want \nto get a balanced budget and to do it in a time certain that makes some \nsense.\n  My question is, though, under the best analysis--it is confusing--\nwill this 10-year budget that has been sent down by the President \nbalance in 10 years?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is hard. It is very hard for Members of the Senate \nand I know the general public to look and say, How does this all work, \nbecause you are looking 10 years down the road, in the case of the \nRepublican budget 7 years down the road.\n  How do they know what they are going to do is actually going to \naccomplish a balanced budget? Like anybody else who has to deal with \nprojections in the future, whether you are a businessman making \nprojections or a family trying to save for a college education, \nwhatever the case may be, if you are looking into the future and trying \nto plan things, everyone will tell you, every financial adviser, \neverybody else will say,\n\n       Be conservative in your projection; don't assume that \n     things are going to be great, and everything. Let's try to \n     take a realistic, not worst case--because you don't want to \n     always assume worst case--but take a realistic \n     underestimation of what you think will happen and plan on \n     that. That is sort of a good conservative way to look at it. \n     Don't give it up, don't give the store all away by wishing \n     rosy projections.\n\n  That is what the Congressional Budget Office has done. What the \nPresident has done has really not been the prudent thing to do. What he \nhas done is just assume everything is going to be great, that we will \nnot have a recession.\n  Think about this, that we will not have a recession in the next 10 \nyears; that we will not have high interest rates over the next 10 \nyears, that everything is going to continue to grow at a very steady \nand healthy pace over 10 years. Never has that occurred in a post-World \nWar II economy. Never has that occurred. But yet the President \nestimates that to be able to achieve his goals.\n  So as a result, I think most economists who have looked at this have \nsaid this is unrealistic, this is not going to happen and what the \nPresident has done is simply not belly up to the bar and tell us how he \nis going to really do this. As a result, we are going to see deficits. \nIf we go the Clinton route, we are going to see deficits well into \ntriple figures, well into the billions.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator. I have to say, again, I cannot think \nof anything more important to this country and more important to all of \nus than having a legitimate debate about facts with regard to balancing \nthe budget, and the idea that somehow we can politically balance the \nbudget and the pain comes in 10 years and we doctor the figures so that \nit looks good simply does not deal with the problem that is a real \nnational problem to you and to me and to our kids and our grandkids.\n  So I appreciate very much the efforts that the Senator has made to \nseek to get these facts out.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator that the view he just expressed is \na view that is shared by folks across the political spectrum. The \nWashington Post yesterday, or the day before, I do not remember which, \neditorialized--one of the great staunch defenders of this President--\neditorialized against the President and his budget and his assumptions \nand how he went about coming to his balanced budget and said that the \nPresident hurt himself and his credibility, which is difficult to do, \nbut it hurt his credibility by proposing a budget that simply is a \nsmoke-and-mirrors, wishing-the-problem-away kind of budget.\n  So I think objective sources have looked at what the President has \ndone and rejected it out of hand as a political document, going up on \nnational television, with a 5-minute address trying to, again, through \nspeeches, convince the American public he is on their side. But when \nyou see the actions, the actions do not match the words. Whether it was \non his health care speeches or whether it is on his welfare reform \nspeeches or whether it is on the budget deficit, the President will \ngive a great speech. He will give a great speech. He always does. He is \na good communicator, and he will get up and give a great speech about \nwhat he believes in. But do not listen to the speech, watch what he \ndoes. Look at the documents. Look at the plans. Look at what he \nactually is proposing. Ignore the speech and watch the actions, and you \nwill find that the speech does not match the actions and the actions \ncome well short of what is needed to solve these problems.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that point for a moment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I had an experience I will share with the Senator. As I \ndo every Thursday morning, I did a talk radio show back in my State of \nOklahoma. I am sensing something that I did not sense in the last few \nyears and that is an awareness--and I think maybe this came with the \nelection of November 1994--the people are finally aware of what is \nreally going on in this country.\n  They brought this up and I went back and looked it up. They said they \nhave added up the figures--maybe you already talked about this--but in \nthis revised budget he sent down, the figures come up, according to \nCBO, to over $1 trillion added to our debt.\n  Keep in mind, this is from a talk radio show, listeners calling in \nfrom Oklahoma today stating that they are actually aware of how much \nthis is being added to the debt. For so many years, the average person \nin America did not really stop and think about the difference between \ndeficit and debt. So they listened to the President come in and talk \nabout, as President Clinton did during his campaign, that he had a \nprogram that was going to eliminate the deficit and had great deficit \nreductions. [[Page S 8844]] \n  I have often recommended to people to read an article that was in \nDecember's Reader's Digest called ``Budget Baloney'' where they \ndescribe how politicians try to deceive the people back home as Clinton \nis trying to do today\n by making them think that they have a program that is going to \neliminate or cut the debt in some way. They describe it this way: \nSuppose you want a $10,000 car but only have $5,000; you tell everybody \nyou really want a $15,000, so you settle for a $10,000 car, so you have \ncut the deficit by $5,000. That is essentially what he is trying to do.\n\n  The American people are awake now and the people know the difference. \nThey are better informed. And if any message came from the election of \nNovember 8, it is that we are tired of the smoke and mirrors, as the \nSenator from Pennsylvania describes it so accurately, and we want \naction for a change.\n  I remember in 1993, in his budget message, the President stood in the \nHouse Chamber and said that the CBO is the most reliable operation \nhere--not OMB, not any of the rest, but CBO. Yet, CBO says that his \ndeficits are going to average, over the next 10 years, about $200 \nbillion. So we are talking about a $2 trillion increase in our national \ndebt. The people are not going to tolerate that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If the Senator will yield, it seems to me there are a \ncouple of reasons why we are becoming more aware--tangible reasons. We \nhave had a debt and deficit for a long time and we all kind of brushed \nit off and put it on the credit card. But now we are going to have to \nraise the debt limit $5 trillion this year and probably another one \nbefore this administration is out.\n  Second, interest payments become probably the largest single line \nitem in the budget next year--probably more than defense. So that \nbecomes real. It takes money out of people's pockets and from other \nthings. Finally, there is the example, it seems to me, of Medicare. It \nis not a question of whether you do something; it is a question of \nwhether you have reform, or you will be into reserves in 2 years and \nbroke in 7 years. So we have played with this as an abstract thing over \nthe years, I believe, and now all of us are beginning to believe it is \nnot abstract. It is very real and it is there. I just think it is so \nimportant that we deal with facts. There is some pain involved. But to \ntry and act as if there is none, that just will not handle the problem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with the Senator. But when you say there is pain \ninvolved, look at the pain that is associated with continuing on the \nroad we are on right now. The Senator from Pennsylvania just had a \nyoung child, and I congratulate him. I hope people realize this young \nman just had a brand-new baby boy. During that baby boy's lifetime, if \nwe do not change the pattern that we are on right now, according to all \nof those who are prognosticators of the future, he will have to pay 82 \npercent of his lifetime income just to support Government.\n  I remember the other day during our national prayer breakfast we had \nsomebody from one of the Communist countries prior to the time they got \ntheir freedom. He bragged and said they only have to give the \nGovernment--he said, ``We get to keep 20 percent.'' I said, ``What do \nyou mean?'' He said, ``Every month or so, we have to give the \nGovernment 80 percent of everything we make.'' And he is celebrating \nthat. I thought about that. Senator Santorum's newborn baby is going to \nhave to pay 2 percent more than that to support Government if we do not \nmake a change. He is too young to be able to come in and lobby and say \ndo not do that to us.\n  So we hear from all these people saying they are going to cut these \nsocial programs. Here we are with a defense system right now that is \ngoing to be down below what it was in 1980 when we could not afford \nspare parts. Those things we really need Government for are being \nneglected by this administration, and I think the people have awakened.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to say that the Joint Economic Committee is \ngoing to have a hearing on the President's budget. I am a member of \nthat committee. I am looking forward to hearing the President's people \non his budget and these economic assumptions.\n  It is, in my opinion, a very cruel hoax on future generations, and on \nthe current electorate, to suggest that we can balance the budget \nwithout doing the things that are necessary in reducing spending and \nchanging Government, and that are required by any sound economic view \nof the future. We are going to talk about that today. Senator Mack has \nstepped up and said we are going to look at the Clinton budget, examine \nit and give him an opportunity to convince us that he is right. I am \nlooking forward to that. I am willing to give the President and his \npeople their day, but I am very distressed at this continuing pattern \nof this President, just trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the \nAmerican public.\n  The fact of the matter is that the folks, like my son, Daniel, who \nwas born on Father's Day, are the people that are going to have to pay \nthe price and consequences of the actions we have today. Somebody has \nto come to the floor of the Senate and defend those children's future. \nThe Senator from Oklahoma is right. They do not have a chance to talk \nfor themselves, so someone has to stand up and do it for them.\n  My father is an immigrant to this country, and I remember talking to \nmy grandfather on many occasions about why he came to this country and \nbrought my father over as a relatively young person. He said, ``Well, \nthe biggest reason he came to America is because he wanted a better \nlife for his children.''\n  Now, have we gone so far in this country, where this generation of \nAmericans cares more about themselves than about their families and \ntheir futures? If we have, what does that say about the likely \nprospects for the future of this country?\n  What we have is a bunch of people, including the President, who come \nbefore the American people and try to scare them into believing that \nsomehow we are going to hurt them and that we, the Republicans, do not \ncare about them, and scare them into keeping the status quo in place, \nwhich they know hurts future generations, but, frankly, future \ngenerations do not vote now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest to the Senator from Pennsylvania, your father \nsounds like he was a student of history and he looked at what this \ncountry is all about. It reminds me that if we remember in our history, \nwhen de Tocqueville came here, he came over to study our business \nsystem. He was so impressed with the great wealth this Nation had \naccumulated that he wrote a book. The last paragraph says that once the \npeople of this country find out they can vote themselves money out of \nthe public trust, this system will fail.\n  We are so close to that point, and yet, this great discovery that was \nreflected in the election of November shows me that people are saying \nthat we are almost there and we cannot afford to let it continue.\n  The one thing that the three of us have in common is we are all \nfreshmen, we are new here. I think maybe that is why we are a little \nbit more exercised on this. We remember the mandate very well. That is \nall I heard during not just the election, but I have had 77 town \nmeetings since the election. The first thing coming out of the chute is \nthe budget. ``I do not care what you do, do something to stop the \ndeficit.'' That is what we are committed to doing.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator mentioned something about de Tocqueville. \nEarlier in his book he said, as he looked at the new democracy and he \nlooked at the new system of people governing themselves, which at that \ntime was a new experiment, he said that the strength of this country \nwas people doing for themselves and helping each other on a local \ncommunity basis. That is very true. Now we move more and more--and the \nbudget has to do with the direction we take in Government, certainly. \nWhen we decide to have less Government which is less costly, we do that \nas a philosophy, and most everybody subscribes to that. This is the \nlabor that goes with it to cause that to happen. You know, it is all \ntied together, and we cannot be responsible morally and fiscally, \nunless we do something about this imbalance that has gone on for 25 \nyears.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We also have to realize--I do not want to take us off the \ntrack of the budget, but de Tocqueville [[Page S 8845]] was also \nconcerned about some of the social problems he saw forecast in this \ncountry. He said,\n\n       America is great because America is good. When America \n     ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\n\n  So a lot of people in our history, going all the way back to \nWashington, talked about and addressed public debt, and Jefferson was \nalso outspoken on this. I think we are here in a political revolution \nin this country, and I think it is an exciting thing. The President \nwill have to be very persuasive.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Does Senator Santorum have a de Tocqueville quote, also?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I do not, but I do have an editorial from one of my \npapers, in the Lancaster Intelligencer, which said that the difference \nbetween the Republican budget and the President's budget, and they were \nvery supportive of the President's budget, is that the President's \nbudget is compassionate. The President's budget is compassionate \nbecause it does not tear apart all these programs that are here in \nplace in Washington.\n  I would suggest to them that compassion--if compassion is measured by \na group of people in Washington willing to take people's hard-earned \nmoney and give it to people that they see fit to give it to, if that is \nthe measure of compassion I can tell you it is very easy for me. It is \nno skin off my back to vote money from somebody else and give it to \nsomebody else.\n  Some people say that is compassion. If I go to someone who is working \n16-hour days, 6 days a week, and I tax him more money and give it to \nsomebody else who may not be working as hard or may have a problem, \nwhatever the case may be--I am sort of removed from this. It is not \nhurting me. I am not taking any money from me here. I am taking it from \nsomebody else and giving it to somebody else. Where is that compassion?\n  The word compassion, if you look at the derivation of the word \ncompassion, it means ``with suffering.'' I am not suffering with \nanybody. I am not suffering with anybody. I am telling you to give \nmoney. And I am taking it from you and giving it to him. Where am I \ninvolved in the suffering here? There is no suffering.\n  It makes you look nice. It is great to be able to go into a community \nwhere you are handing out money. Look, I love to present checks. Oh, it \nis great to take other people's money, who worked hard for it, and have \nme give it to people. It is a wonderful feeling. You feel great. But \nare you really compassionate? Is that action truly compassionate? Is \nthere any ``suffering with,'' that is going on here? No, no, it is not \ncompassion at all. It is politics. And it is easy and it is fun. Oh, I \nknow it is fun to just take that money away from those people who are \nmaking too much money and give it to folks who are not making enough. \nIt is sort of the modern day Robin Hood. But there is no suffering \nhere.\n  What the Senator from Wyoming said is absolutely right. This country \nis a great country because we have people who cared about people, who \ndid ``suffer with,'' who did care about their neighbor, who did know \nwho their neighbors were and went out and did something about it. And \nbecause Government has gotten so big and is starting to do so much for \npeople, we stop doing so much for each other because it is not our job \nanymore. It is not our job to help take care of our fellow neighbor. \nThere is a Government program that does that and just call this office, \ntoll free.\n  That is not what made America great. Toll-free numbers for calling a \nGovernment bureaucrat is not what made America great. What made America \ngreat, what the Senator from Oklahoma said, is the goodness of America. \nI can tell you there is nothing good about taking money away from \npeople who work hard for it and giving it to people who we want to for \nwhatever reason we want to. That is not good. That may be necessary in \nsome cases. There are people in this country who do need help and there \nare Government programs that do it. But do not come here and say that \nis good, or that is compassionate. It may be necessary sometimes.\n  What is good is if you participate individually, if you get out there \nand help your neighbor and become part of the fabric of community, \nwhich is what de Tocqueville wrote about over 100 years ago. That is \nwhat makes America great. That is what we are trying to get back to--\nunderstanding that families and communities and neighborhoods are \nimportant to the fabric of our society. And if we continue to lose them \nwe will lose America.\n  So, the Lancaster Intelligencer is dead wrong. There is nothing \ncompassionate about keeping the Federal Government in control of \npeople's lives. It is anything but compassionate because there is no \nsuffering here. There is only more suffering out there.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator has made a great point. One of the exciting \nthings, it seems to me, about this Congress is that we have for the \nfirst time in many years an opportunity to take a look at Government \nprograms that have been in place for 30 or 40 years, such as the War on \nPoverty--which has failed. There are more people in poverty now than \nwhen it began.\n  So we are not talking about taking away the safety net. We are not \ntalking about doing away with the assistance to people who need \nassistance. In welfare we want to help those, but help them back into \nthe workplace. And that is exciting, to have for the first time a \nchance to say, Is there a better way to provide this assistance? Is \nthere a more efficient way to do something, rather than just continuing \nto fund failed programs? I think that is the exciting thing we are \ndoing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think it is inherent in the bureaucracy. We have to \naddress it that way.\n  I can remember a very famous speech that was made, back in 1965. My \ncolleague and I, we may be freshmen here but we are the two oldest \nMembers of the freshman class. We can remember this well. The speech \nwas called ``A Rendezvous With Destiny'' by Ronald Reagan. It was his \nfirst political speech. It was back during the Goldwater campaign.\n  In this speech he said something very profound. He said, ``There is \nnothing closer to immortality on the face of this Earth than a \nGovernment program once started.''\n  I learned this lesson when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa. This is \nkind of an interesting story and tells you what is happening here \ntoday.\n  I went in and made a decision that over a 5-year period I would keep \nthe level of government, city government, the same size yet increase \nthe delivery of services. I did this because at that time the average \nlarge city doubled in size every 5 years. I thought, let us try to stop \nthat. So I started firing people for inefficiency. And when I saw them \nlater and said, ``I thought I fired you,'' and they said, ``Well I have \nbeen reinstated,'' I found out in government you cannot fire people for \ninefficiency. I found the way to do it. You defund departments and get \nthem all.\n  There are some bureaucracies that were at one time performing a \nfunction that was needed; the problem went away, but the bureaucracy \ncontinues. This is what we are talking about, going through, having \nsunset provisions where we can say, Is this thing really needed? Is \nthis in the public interest anymore, as it was 40 years ago when that \nparticular agency was started?\n  It is not a lack of compassion, as the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nsaid in such an articulate way, because we are compassionate. But when \nI have town-hall meetings, I talk to senior citizens. Sometimes when I \nhave them during the day, 90 percent of them are senior citizens or \nretired people. They come up. Of course when you tell them what is \ngoing to happen if we continue on this road, what is going to happen to \ntheir grandchildren and great grandchildren and generations to come, I \nfind these people are not selfish. They just do not want to be cut \nunless others are cut.\n  The Senator might remember when the Heritage Foundation did a study \nhere a few years ago where they said if you put on a growth cap of 2 \npercent for just a matter of 5 years on all Government spending, you \nwill balance the budget in that period of time and will not have to cut \nor eliminate one Federal program. Just stop the increase, the \naccelerated growth. That is, I think, what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is the interesting and not well understood point. \nTwo years ago--when the President talks [[Page S 8846]] about deficit \nreduction, the fact is there was no cut in spending. The fact is the \nspending still continues at 5 percent and the cuts, the deficit \nreductions were bookkeeping things and raising taxes. We still \ncontinued. So we are talking not about cutting overall spending. We are \ntalking about reducing the growth. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator might remember, he and I were both in the \nHouse of Representatives back when President Bush--I criticized him \npublicly because of some of the assumptions he came up with in his \nbudget resolution as to growth assumptions. A lot of people do not \nrealize for each 1 percent growth in economic activity, there is a \ngeneration of new revenue of about $24 billion. He was a little overly \noptimistic on some of the projections his people put forward for him \nalso on gas tax revenues and some of the other things.\n  I think we want to be realistic. We want to get to where we are going \nand that is to eliminate the deficit by the year 2002. I would like to \ndo it by the year 2000 instead of 2002. I think most of us would. But \nwe are on the road to doing something realistic. Let us stay with it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8841-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will join Senator Baucus and Senator \nRockefeller in introducing the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1995.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to establish within Medicare a \nrural hospital flexibility program.\n  Such a program is badly needed. Many smaller rural communities, and \ntheir hospitals, are unable to sustain the full range of hospital \nservices necessary to qualify for participation in the Medicare \nProgram. There are several reasons for this. Among the most important \nis that the Medicare rules and requirements for full service hospitals \nare burdensome and inflexible. Compliance with them is difficult for \nsmaller rural facilities. Furthermore, Medicare reimbursement is \ninadequate. This latter problem is compounded by the fact that these \nhospitals are likely to be dependent on the program--most of their \npatients in any given year are likely to be Medicare beneficiaries. \nThus, most of their reimbursement comes from the Medicare Program.\n  As a consequence, under the current Medicare rules and reimbursement \nlevels, many of these small, rural hospitals across the country could \ngo out of business. If they do, their communities would lose their \ncurrent access to emergency medical services.\n  This legislation could make the difference between survival and \nclosure for these hospitals. In Iowa, there are at least 10 hospitals, \nperhaps more, which could qualify for participation in the program this \nlegislation would establish.\n  This legislation would help those hospitals to continue offering \nessential hospital services in at least four ways: It would provide \nmore appropriate and flexible staffing and licensure standards. It \nwould reimburse both inpatient and outpatient services on a reasonable \ncost basis. It would promote integration of these hospitals in broader \nnetworks by requiring participating States to develop at least one \nrural health network in which the rural critical access hospital would \nparticipate. And it would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to recommend to the Congress an appropriate reimbursement \nmethodology under Medicare for telemedicine services.\n  Hospitals which participate in this program could thus continue to \nprovide an essential point of access to hospital level services in \ntheir rural communities. Essentially, these hospitals could pare back \nthe services they offer to emergency care services and to 24-hour \nnursing services, while continuing to participate in the Medicare \nProgram on a reasonable cost basis. In this way, they would continue to \nbe the major point of access to emergency medical care in their \ncommunities.\n  Again, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator \nRockefeller, and I commend their leadership on this problem.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8846-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8846-S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to continue the discussion begun \nthis morning by my fellow freshman Senators on the President's budget \nproposal introduced last week.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to see that President Clinton has joined \nRepublicans in at last recognizing the need--the critical need--to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  But while the President's new position is a dramatic policy reversal \nfrom his previously stated view, and his new budget proposal is an \nimprovement over his last one which did nothing to reign in the growth \nof government, the President's budget does not go nearly far enough.\n  Mr. President, the President's logic that slowing the path of deficit \nreduction would ease the pain on the elderly, on students, on the \ndisabled, and the economy just does not hold up. In fact, the reverse \nis true. Delaying balancing the budget is more costly in the long run, \nas we run up more and more debt and higher and higher interest \npayments. And according to CBO, expected reductions in interest rates \nthat would result under the Republican balanced budget plan are not \ncertain to materialize under the President's plan. This means that \nunder the President's plan, home mortgages, business loans, credit card \ninterest, and virtually everything that is affected by interest rates \nin this country would be more expensive. And finally, delaying balance \nfor 10 years runs the risk that we may never get there if we do not put \nour country on a strict diet of spending discipline beginning now.\n  President Clinton has recognized that there must be spending \nrestraint on entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, if we \nare to achieve balance, and I commend him for at least talking the talk \nof entitlement reform. But the President's specific proposals are \ntroublesome. The Clinton June budget actually spends $1 billion more in \nnondefense discretionary spending than did his February budget. And it \nrelies on overly optimistic estimates relating to economic growth and \nthe cost of increases in Medicare and Medicaid. These rosy estimates, \nwhile appearing to be only slightly different from congressional \nestimates in the early years, are greatly magnified over a 10-year \nperiod. As a result, deficits will be much higher if analyzed using \nCongressional Budget Office figures.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office--who Mr. Clinton once \nexalted and now deplores--Mr. Clinton's latest budget will fall far \nshort of its goals, and like the last budget Mr. Clinton sent to \nCapitol Hill, will still leave the Nation in\n debt by as much as $234 billion by the year 2002.\n\n  It is clear to me what the President wants to do. He very much wants \nto balance the budget. He knows that balancing the budget is the right \nthing to do. But he really does not want to make the hard choices that \nmust be made if we are going to truly put America back on the road to \nfiscal health.\n  The President's budget proposals relating to health care are \nindicative of the President's split-personality budget. He first takes \na lower baseline for Medicare and Medicaid, which in plain terms means \nhow much these programs are projected to cost over the next 10 years. \nThis averts some pain by saying, ``It's really not as bad as we \nthought.'' Then the President's budget proposal reduces spending for \nMedicare--only by cutting payments to providers. In effect, the \nPresident is saying, ``Let's reduce spending for Medicare, but only if \nit doesn't hurt anyone.'' There are no proposed changes for payments to \nbeneficiaries or real reform of the system.\n  Mr. President, this approach does not make any sense in 1995. We must \nreform Medicare to save Medicare, to improve it, to preserve it. We \nhave to change the program so that it is preserved for generations to \ncome. We will never ensure long-term solvency of the Medicare program \nby just continuing [[Page S 8847]] to cut payments to health care \nproviders. Republicans have instead proposed restructuring the Medicare \nprogram to save it and improve it. The Republican plan would expand \nchoice, for our seniors and our disabled, and would increase market \nefficiencies and reduce waste. The President's plan, on the other hand, \nwould only postpone bankruptcy of the Medicare program until 2005.\n  Mr. President, while I admire the President's goals, I believe that \nthe President's latest budget submission is yet one more case of \nfailing to adequately address the crisis at hand and choosing instead \nto respond to critics by producing a budget designed for domestic \npolitical consumption rather than the welfare of the American people.\n  I hope the President will work with the Republicans. We, on our side \nof the aisle, have made some tough choices, and there are more to come. \nBut I know the American people are with us, and they will put the \ninterests of the country ahead of special interests. They voted for the \nfundamental change that Republicans have proposed and we must honor our \ncommitment to the Americans who sent us to Washington last November.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague. We are indeed fortunate, not only here in the Senate but the \nUnited States, to have one who made this important career change having \ndedicated his life to saving lives in his career. Now, he brings to the \ninstitution of the Senate enormous knowledge, not only personal but \nthat gained from working with his colleagues in the medical profession \nfor these many years, such that we can have the benefit of his wisdom \nand experience as we address the critical issues relating to health \ncare. I express my appreciation to the Senator for these remarks this \nmorning. They are very timely.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8846-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE STAFFORD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, one of the most remarkable public servants \nin Kansas history was Frank Carlson, who served in this Chamber for 18 \nyears.\n  During his career, Senator Carlson also served for 4 years as a \nmember of the Kansas House of Representatives, 12 years in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and 4 years as Governor.\n  Senator Carlson did many great things in his career, including \nhelping to draft Dwight Eisenhower for President in 1952.\n  But I am here this morning to talk about another great thing that \nFrank Carlson did. And that is the fact that he brought George Stafford \nto Washington, DC.\n  George passed away last week, and I wanted to take a minute to \nremember this outstanding Kansan and outstanding American.\n  George was executive secretary to Frank Carlson during his term as \nGovernor, and followed him to Washington as his Senate administrative \nassistant.\n  He served in that role for 17 years with great intelligence and \nintegrity, always reaching out to provide advice and support to young \nKansans who were new in town.\n  In 1967, then-President Johnson appointed George to serve on the \nInterstate Commerce Commission. He remained on the commission until \n1980, serving as its chairman for 7 years.\n  George's years in Topeka and Washington are not the only examples of \nthe service he gave to his country. He also defended freedom in World \nWar II, rising to the rank of Captain, and receiving both the bronze \nstar and the purple heart.\n  Like many in Kansas and in Washington, I was proud to call George \nStafford my friend.\n  I know that Senator Kassebaum joins with me in extending our \nsympathies to Lena Stafford, George's wife of 48 years; his children; \nBill, Susan, and Quincy; and his five grandchildren.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8847-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF GEN.

Sullivan, on his retirement after 36 years \nof service to our Army and to our Nation.\n  I had the distinct honor of working closely with General Sullivan \nover the years when he served as the deputy of the Command and Staff \nCollege at Fort Leavenworth, KS and during his command of the Big Red \nOne at Fort Riley, KS.\n  Indeed, it was my pleasure to introduce General Sullivan before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation as chief of \nstaff of the Army just 4 years ago.\n  In my view, Gordon Sullivan was exactly the right man at the right \ntime to lead our Army during one of the most difficult periods of \nrestructuring and downsizing. He kept the right perspective, and put it \nbest in his own words, ``smaller is not better, better is better.''\n  Throughout his 4 years as Army Chief of Staff, General Sullivan kept \nhis focus and vision. His priorities were our soldiers whom he prepared \nto fight and win our Nation's wars. And their families who support our \nsolders and willingly sacrifice for their purpose.\n  I frequently conferred with General Sullivan throughout this term as \nArmy Chief. His views and counsel were always on the mark. Gordon \nSullivan brought tremendous wisdom to the job and a style of leadership \nwhich reflected his greatness.\n  Our Army will sorely miss General Sullivan, but it is stronger and \nbetter for his service. The legacy he leaves, a ready Army, a future \nforce that will be unmatched, and the deep love and devotion of his \nsolders is fitting of this great man.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan \nfor his sacrifice, his leadership, and his commitment to our solders \nand to our Nation.\n  God's speed and blessings to him and to his wife Gay, and their \nfamily.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8847-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8847-S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE STERLING\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Saturday last, in Arezzo, Italy, \nClaire Sterling died, age 76. So passed, as her great friend Meg \nGreenfield put it, ``one of the great journalists of all time.''\n  She was born in Queens, took her degree from Brooklyn College, and \nwent from there to the Columbia graduate school of journalism. In time \nshe joined the staff of the Reporter where she was a colleague of Ms. \nGreenfield for some 17 years, albeit from her post in Rome.\n  In her youth, as a student involved with student politics at Brooklyn \nCollege, and later as a union organizer, she came in contact with the \nStalinist left which gave her a perspective, almost a second sense \nconcerning ideological politics that ever thereafter informed her \naccounts of world politics at the highest, and yes, lowest, even \ncriminal and clandestine levels. What liberals did not wish to know--\nmany liberals, that is--and conservatives could not grasp, she \ninstantly understood, and sublimely construed. There is a Hebrew \nsaying, ha mevin yavin: those who understand, understand. Claire \nSterling understood and not just at metaphysical heights. Who else \nwould have persuaded the rebels opposing French rule in Algeria to let \nher know which trains she could take back to the coast which were not \nscheduled to be blown up.\n  Meg Greenfield allows as how ``it is hard to think of her as dead, \nfor she was so alive.'' And so we will remember her, even as we offer \nour condolences to her beloved husband Tom, and her son Luke, daughter \nAbigail, and her sister Ethel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \narticles from the New York Times and the Washington Post be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 1995]\n\n         Claire Sterling, 76, Dies; Writer on Crime and Terror\n\n                             (By Eric Pace)\n\n       Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based \n     in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, \n     assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in \n     Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived outside of Cortona, near \n     Arezzo.\n       She had cancer of the colon, her husband said.\n       Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and \n     traveled widely. Her most [[Page S 8848]] recent book, \n     ``Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of \n     Organized Crime'' (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by \n     Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced \n     Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making ``a \n     significant contribution to post-cold-war debate'' by \n     affirming ``that the growing interdependence among nation-\n     states and financial institutions has made it easier for \n     crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries.''\n       In an earlier book, ``Octopus: the Long Reach of the \n     International Sicilian Mafia'' (1990), she examined the \n     Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in \n     Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United \n     States as its longtime main target.\n       In her 1984 book ``The Time of the Assassins,'' Mrs. \n     Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to \n     kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca \n     had ``come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a \n     Bulgarian spy ring.'' She presented what she called ``massive \n     proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided \n     the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror \n     network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic \n     society.''\n       Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the \n     attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that \n     Italian courts in 1988 had ``expressed their moral certainty \n     that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal \n     shooting.''\n       She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book ``The \n     Terror Network,'' which traced connections among terrorist \n     groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the \n     book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was \n     writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her \n     house to protect her.\n       A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis \n     reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy \n     of ``The Terror Network'' before a group of official \n     intelligence experts and had ``said contemptuously that he \n     had learned more from it than from all of them.''\n       Mrs. Sterling's first book was ``The Masaryk Case'' (1969), \n     about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was \n     reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of \n     his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed \n     by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from \n     defecting to the West.\n       In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New \n     York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, \n     Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington \n     Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.\n       Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a \n     bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and \n     worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical \n     workers.\n       In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia \n     Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer \n     Traveling Scholarship.\n       She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a \n     1981 interview as ``a fly-by-night American news agency.'' \n     She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of \n     business, she returned to the United States and joined the \n     staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in \n     early 1949.\n       Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the \n     Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born \n     publisher and editor, said, ``If anybody's going to write \n     about Italy around here, it's me.''\n       In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered \n     that ``Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month \n     assignment in Rome.''\n       Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, \n     ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By \n     then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where \n     Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. \n     So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing \n     her Masaryk book.\n       She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a \n     daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two \n     grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 1995]\n\n              Claire Sterling, Investigative Writer, Dies\n\n                            (By Bart Barnes)\n\n       Claire Sterling, 75, a U.S. journalist and author of \n     investigative books that explored connections between the \n     Soviet government and terrorist organizations around the \n     world, died of cancer June 17 at a hospital in Arezzo, Italy.\n       In a journalistic career that spanned almost five decades, \n     Mrs. Sterling covered and wrote about armed revolutionary \n     movements in Third World countries, U.S. gangsters, World War \n     II refugees and political assassinations. She was based in \n     Italy for most of that period, and from there she wrote \n     stories for The Washington Post and other newspapers. But her \n     work also took her to Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East \n     and Asia.\n       Her books included ``The Masaryk Case'' (1969), In which \n     she argued that the 1948 death of Czech Foreign Minister Jan \n     Masaryk was murder, not suicide; ``The Terror Network'' \n     (1981), in which she argued that the Soviets were sponsoring \n     and supporting terrorist organizations in several countries; \n     and ``The Time of the Assassins'' (1984), in which she \n     accused the Soviet Union of complicity in the 1981 attempted \n     assassination of Pope John Paul II.\n       She began her career in journalism shortly after World War \n     II, working in Italy for the now-defunct Overseas News \n     Service. It was an era when women were rare and often \n     unwelcome in the news business, and Mrs. Sterling became \n     known as an adventuresome and energetic reporter who \n     sometimes used creative methods to get her stories.\n       In Italy, she boarded a Palestine-bound ship with Jewish \n     war refugees, taping her U.S. passport to her arm, which she \n     had encased in a cast as if it were broken. The ship was \n     intercepted by British authorities, and she was taken to an \n     internment camp. But she was released when she produced the \n     passport proving her U.S. nationality.\n       During the 1950s, she wrote about independence movements in \n     North Africa, and she often traveled with bands of armed \n     insurgents, including once when she was five months pregnant. \n     When her husband expressed concern about this, she told him \n     not to worry--the rebels had promised not to blow up any \n     trains she was on.\n       Mrs. Sterling was born in New York. She graduated from \n     Brooklyn College and received a degree in journalism from \n     Columbia University.\n       After a short stint with the Overseas News Service, she \n     joined the staff of Reporter magazine in 1949. She \n     interviewed New York mob boss Lucky Luciano and wrote an \n     unflattering profile of Clare Booth Luce, the U.S. ambassador \n     to Italy during the Eisenhower administration. She wrote \n     stories from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n       After Reporter folded in 1968, Mrs. Sterling wrote articles \n     for Harper's magazine, did freelance writing and wrote books.\n       In 1968, she covered the brief period of social and \n     political liberalization in Czechoslovakia under the \n     leadership of Alexander Dubcek, which became known as the \n     Prague Spring. In the course of reporting that story, she \n     began looking into the 1948 death of Masaryk, the foreign \n     minister, who had been found dead in the courtyard of \n     Prague's Czernin Palace, apparently after falling from a \n     window. The death had been ruled a suicide.\n       From previously published material, interviews and new \n     documents, Mrs. Sterling concluded that Masaryk, a popular \n     political figure and a leader of the Czech government in \n     exile during the wartime occupation by Germany, had been \n     murdered by Communist agents, probably to prevent his \n     defection to the West. She speculated in her book ``The \n     Masaryk Case'' that he had been overpowered by security \n     agents, suffocated with pillows and flung from the window.\n       Her second book, ``The Terror Network,'' was based on an \n     article she had written for Atlantic Monthly in which she \n     explored similarities between the kidnappings and murders in \n     the 1970s of former Italian premier Aldo Moro by the Italian \n     Red Brigades and of West German industrialist Hans-Martin \n     Schleyer by the German Red Army Faction.\n       In this book, Mrs. Sterling traced what she said were \n     extensive political and military links between terrorist \n     organizations, all of which, she suggested, received material \n     but clandestine support from Moscow. ``In effect,'' she \n     wrote, ``the Soviet Union simply laid a loaded gun on the \n     table, leaving the others to get on with it.'' The book was \n     well received by the newly inaugurated administration of \n     Ronald Reagan, but liberal critics complained that Mrs. \n     Sterling's argument was unsupported by conclusive evidence.\n       In ``The Time of the Assassins,'' Mrs. Sterling \n     investigated claims by Mehmet Al Agca that he was acting on \n     orders from the Bulgarian secret service in his 1981 attempt \n     on the life of Pope John Paul II. In 1986, an Italian jury \n     acquitted three Bulgarians and three Turks of conspiracy in \n     the plot for lack of proof. Mrs. Sterling continued to insist \n     that the Soviet Union was behind it.\n       She married novelist Thomas Sterling in 1951. They lived in \n     Rome and Cortona, Italy.\n       In addition to her husband, she is survived by two \n     children, Luke Sterling, a painter who lives in Cortona, and \n     Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; and two grandchildren.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8847-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8848-S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I learned with regret last week that the \nPeople's Republic of China has recalled its ambassador to the United \nStates, Li Daoyu, because of the visit of Taiwan President Lee Teng-\nhui. I am disappointed that the Chinese government has chosen this step \nas a form of protest over Lee's visit.\n  President Lee came to the United States on a private visit after he \nwas invited to speak at his alma mater. He was granted a visa as a \nsimple act of courtesy and his trip does not represent a change in our \ngovernment's one-China policy. The United States believes strongly that \nnotable speakers from around the world should be free to travel here to \nspeak their views. I feel that Beijing's reaction to Lee's visit is \nboth excessive and unproductive. Lee's visit was a small matter and \nshould be seen as insignificant for overall Sino-United States \nrelations.\n  There is a great reservoir of friendship between the peoples of China \nand the United States. I think of that friendship as an iceberg. Right \nnow we may see problems at the tip, but underneath is a large, enduring \nsolidness. I feel certain that sturdy base will help us outlast minor \nirritants to the relationship, such as this one. It is my deep wish \nthat Beijing would simply agree to disagree with Washington on this \nmatter, return Ambassador Li to his post quickly, and move on to the \ntruly important matters we have between the two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8849-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMERICAN CENTER PLZEN\n\n  Mr. PELL. On May 6, 1995, I was honored to be part of the delegation \nheaded by Ambassador Madeleine Albright and accompanied by Gen. Charles \nG. Boyd, commander in chief, U.S. European Command, to represent \nPresident Clinton at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the \nliberation of Plzen in the Czech Republic.\n  Having served as a foreign service officer in Prague in 1946 after \nWorld War II, it was a particular personal honor to be present at such \na warm outpouring of appreciation and gratitude shown by the people of \nthe Czech Republic toward the gallant contributions made by the service \nmen and women of Gen. George Patton's Third Army.\n  While in Plzen I was also honored to participate in the opening of \nAmerican Center Plzen, with Prime Minister Klaus, the United States \nAmbassador to the Czech Republic, Adrian Basora, Ambassador Albright, \nand General Boyd. The creation of the American Center in Plzen was the \npersonal accomplishment of a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer from \nBarrington, RI, John R. Hess.\n  The Center is a tribute to the enthusiasm and commitment of John Hess \nand the citizens of Plzen. Significantly, it was completed without \nhaving to commit any U.S. tax dollars. I asked Mr. Hess if he would \nsend me a report on the creation of American Center Plzen, so that his \nwork could serve as an example to others reaching out to our neighbors \naround the world. I ask unanimous consent that his report on American \nCenter Plzen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Report on American Center Plzen\n\n       This is a report requested by U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell \n     about my activities as a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer in \n     establishing American Center Plzen without use of American \n     taxpayers money. Senator Pell was in Plzen at the time of the \n     Center's opening.\n       The idea of having an American Center for American-Czech \n     business and cultural exchange in Plzen began with then \n     Deputy Mayor of Plzen, Zdenek Prosek when in 1993 he \n     discussed the thought with the U.S. Ambassador, Foreign \n     Commercial Service, USIS, and representatives of the Czech \n     American Enterprise Fund (CAEF). All thought well of the \n     concept. CAEF liked the plan because there would be business \n     investment opportunities for them and the others because it \n     could help to create U.S. and Czech business growth as well \n     as expand U.S. and Czech cultural understanding. The purpose \n     of the Center would offer something to both the United States \n     and to Plzen. A Center would make it easier for U.S. \n     businesses to establish themselves in Western Bohemia as \n     investors and for export possibilities. It would also enhance \n     and build upon the warm feelings held by the West Bohemian \n     people toward the U.S. resulting from General Patton's \n     liberation of this area in 1945. Plzen would benefit as the \n     Center will open access to U.S. business for joint ventures \n     and could obtain the balanced economy sought by city leaders. \n     CAEF offered to donate the equivalent of $35,000.00 as ``seed \n     money'' for the project to cover any first year operating \n     deficits. The United States Embassy clearly stated that no \n     U.S. funds were available for the purpose of establishing the \n     Center. Advisory assistance would be offered.\n       The city of Plzen made it known that it would bear all \n     costs. Deputy Mayor Prosek (now Lord Mayor) told the Embassy \n     and CAEF that the City would donate a historic building in \n     the city center and would restore it at Plzen's expense. \n     Plzen certainly did that spending the equivalent of \n     $1,250,000 on the renovation as well as donating the \n     building. Mayor Prosek also stated that a Foundation would be \n     created with a Czech Director to operate the Center under \n     Czech law and would be self supporting. It was agreed among \n     the parties that a Peace Corps Business Volunteer as a \n     catalyst to ensure that the project would be designed and \n     implemented in a manner to assure success would be assigned \n     to Plzen.\n       As that volunteer I discussed with project planners and \n     architects hired by the city the layout of the building to \n     meet the purpose of the project. It was agreed among the \n     project designers, the architects, and myself that the \n     building must be competitive for well into the 21st Century \n     and must meet western standards. The building would have a \n     social center, a meeting room for seminars, permanent \n     offices, temporary offices for companies seeking partners, an \n     information area, and a place for cultural displays. The \n     building has over 100 communication outlets for phones, \n     faxes, and computers. It is centrally air conditioned and \n     handicap accessible. In addition, all offices have raised \n     floors for ease of cabling. Ability to communicate was a \n     major thrust and attention to computer, fax, and telephone \n     access was a priority of the building infrastructure. The \n     City also wanted the building completed in time for the 50 \n     year Liberation Ceremony to take place in May 1995.\n       A working committee consisting of ten people was formed and \n     met regularly to review plans. The committee assisted in \n     hiring the Director for the Center as well as talking with \n     the U.S. and Czech business communities about the Center. The \n     makeup of the committee included five Czechs and five \n     Americans. Four Czechs were from Plzen and one Czech and \n     three Americans were from Prague.\n       Plans for the building were completed in June 1994 and were \n     approved by the City. Building restoration began in September \n     1994 and was completed in late April 1995. The City paid all \n     the expenses for the building. No U.S. taxpayer money was a \n     part of the building renovations. The building is expected to \n     be self sufficient financially by January 1997 through rental \n     charges for offices, meetings, special services, etc.\n       The Foundation has been established and has two Boards, one \n     advisory which includes American Chamber of Commerce in the \n     Czech Republic, Peace Corps, an American Embassy person, and \n     Chamber of Commerce Plzen. The voting Board is chaired by a \n     Czech who is also Chair of the Business Innovation Center in \n     Plzen. There are four Czechs and one American on the voting \n     Board.\n       A few American and Czech companies have made donations of \n     operating equipment such as fax machines and computers to the \n     Center which are greatly appreciated.\n       A Peace Corps Business Volunteer will continue as an \n     advisor to the Center until late January 1996. Peace Corps \n     does not plan to assign another volunteer to this project \n     after that date.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8849-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

We are working on \nseveral now to resolve them. But others who have problems, now is the \ntime.\n  The schedule is such that between now and 11:30 there is time for \ndiscussion and debate. There will be no votes before 11:30. At 11:30, \nwe have a chance to vote. I would like to see us move to final passage \nand vote then. But if not, at 12 o'clock, we go back on the cloture \nmotion. And the vote on that, as I understand, is at 2 o'clock. At the \nconclusion of that vote, if we have not finished this bill, we will be \nback on it again. But I know the leadership is very anxious to get this \nover with because there is a host of other measures with which they \nwant to deal.\n  So I say to all within listening and viewing distance, come over, \nbring your amendments and let us dispose of them.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, during the most recent recess, I had the \nprivilege of meeting with 36 farmers, who make up an agriculture \nadvisory board from across the State of Tennessee. We actually met in \nKnoxville, TN. The women and men on that board are real farmers, not \njust representatives of farmers, but people who personally earn their \nliving on a farm.\n  One gentleman, exhausted from the dawn-to-dusk pace of a farm in \nearly summer, told my staff quite candidly that he simply would not \nhave time to meet with a Senator unless it turned out to be a rainy \nday. That kind of humble feedback is in itself an important reason for \nus in the U.S. Senate, as elected representatives, to go home and talk \nto real people. Some members of this agriculture board from the western \npart of my State could not join me at that meeting because that very \nday they were struggling with the floodwaters that were destroying and \nthreatening to destroy their crops. Nothing--nothing--could have served \nto make the need for Federal disaster relief more concrete and more \nreal for me than the voice of a good man on the phone near panic over \nthe rising waters.\n  It was a fascinating day. When I had asked these 30 farmers to tell \nme what they would like their duly elected Senator to know today about \nagriculture, they were forthright and firm in their advice and their \ncounsel. On two points they were very clear. Sam Worley of Hampshire, \nTN, said:\n\n       We want a smaller Federal Government that thinks not short \n     term but long term.\n\n  He went on and expressed that they wanted to be treated fairly in the \nspending reductions that they expect and that they know are necessary \nfor the long-term health of this country for that next generation.\n  These hard-working Tennesseans resent the media portraying them as \nparasites. They are willing to sacrifice, each and every one, as long \nas all Americans do, to balance the budget. They shuddered when I \nshared with them the fact that a child born today acquires an $18,000 \nshare in the Federal debt--a share of the Federal debt that they will \nbe expected to pay the interest on over the course of a lifetime. They \nmade it very clear to me that they are ready to do their part, as long \nas we do not try to balance the budget on the backs of the farmers.\n  What else did these men and women have to tell me? They are \nfrustrated with the perverse incentives of our welfare system. Mike \nVaught of Lacassas, TN, told me of being unable to find an overseer to \nlive on his farm because he could not provide the cable TV that was \navailable in the public housing just miles away. They are frustrated \nwith the intrusive Federal agencies that often act at cross purposes \nwith each other. The Environmental Protection Agency orders action that \nthe Soil Conservation Service prohibits. Jimmy Shellabarger of Jackson, \nTN, told me that he is frustrated by the huge fines for minor \ninfractions of complicated rules. David Robinson of Jonesboro said,\n\n       We are tired of being held to expensive standards of \n     production when our global competitors are allowed to ignore \n     these same standards.\n\n  These farmers also asked for tax relief. This may surprise some of my \ncolleagues across the aisle, but the tax relief that they asked me for, \nthat they spoke about, was a cut in the capital gains tax rate. These \nare mainly middle-class Tennesseans. Some have experienced or been very \nclose to bankruptcy, riding the roller coaster of commodity prices. But \nthey fully understand what seems to elude so many of my colleagues, \nthat a cut in the capital gains tax rate is critical to middle-income \nAmericans; that it will stimulate the economy to the benefit of \neveryone in America.\n  In closing, I want to tell you what James Wooden of South Pittsburg, \nTN, said. He said, ``I am going to talk to you just like we do under \nthe shade tree.'' I will remember those words of James Wooden when the \n700-page farm bill, full of Washington lingo, comes by my way. We all \nneed to go out under the shade tree and listen to the people across \nthis country and let the people, firsthand, tell us what they know.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8850-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8850-S8854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first I want to remind my colleagues the two \nmanagers are here on the highway bill and have been here since 9:30 and \nwould very much like to complete action on this bill by noon today \nbecause at noon we have 2 hours of debate on the Foster nomination and \nthen another vote. And then hopefully after that we would go to \nsecurities litigation legislation.\n  I have just talked with Virginia Senator, Senator Warner. Maybe many \nof these amendments will never be called up, but it will be helpful if \nour colleagues on either side will let the managers know. If we are not \ngoing to call up the amendments or if you have an amendment, it would \ncertainly be better to offer it at 10:30 in the morning rather than \n10:30 tonight. The reason we are here every night until 10 o'clock, 11 \no'clock, is because people will not cooperate during the daytime. They \nare the same ones who complain in the evening after 7 or 8 o'clock. So \nI would tell my colleagues, if you have an amendment, the managers are \nhere.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say to the distinguished \nleader, half of these amendments are not matters related to the bill. \nThey are not matters either the Senator from Montana nor I can really \nsettle out because [[Page S 8851]] other chairmen and ranking members \nof other committees are involved in the subject of the amendments.\n  It seems to me it takes a good deal of work to get these things done \nby persons other than the managers of the pending bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I note the presence of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee. There are a number of amendments under the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, Energy Committee, whatever. As \nthe Senator from Virginia has pointed out, they are not under the \njurisdiction of the committee that has the bill on the floor.\n  In any event, I know many of my colleagues may have conflicts at this \nmoment because there are amendments here by Senator Boxer, three by \nSenator Exon, one by Senator Ford, Senator Hatfield, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Nickles, Senator McCain, Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator Smith, Senator Stevens, and Senator Murkowski. We would hope \nwhoever is willing to come to the floor would do so. If they do not \nintend to offer their amendments, if they would notify the managers on \neither side then we can move on because we do have a lot of legislation \nwe will finish before the July 4 recess begins. It is up to our \ncolleagues when that may happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I might inform the leader Senator Hatfield \nhas just withdrawn his amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are making progress.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now we are making progress.\n  Mr. DOLE. Now can we have a bit from the other side?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say to the leader, in response to his question, \nthat means automatically one or two others are dropped. Automatically, \ntoo, that means others are dropped.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think that means Senator McCain's amendment will \ndisappear.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Also another one on this side, too, will not be offered \nas a consequence of that last development.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are making progress as we speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe the Senator could find another one that has the \nsame ripple effect?\n  Mr. DOLE. Could I ask, will there be any of these other amendments \nrequiring rollcall votes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished leader and \nothers, at this present time the managers of the bill do not know of a \nrequest for a rollcall vote other than final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I agree with the analysis of the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia. We are making some progress.\n  We would appreciate your sticking around a little longer, though. We \nhave just disposed of three in 30 seconds. It is like a house of cards. \nIf we pull one card out, perhaps the whole thing will come collapsing \ndown and we will finish. In any event, we are striving. We will call on \nthese individual Senators to see if they are satisfied.\n  I think the point the managers make here is a very valid one. These \namendments, many of them, do not involve this committee. They involve \nother committees. And we are caught in a crossfire here. The Commerce \nCommittee or the Energy Committee--they have nothing to do with us. I \ndo not even know why they are on this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are a number of them relating to the \nBanking Committee. As such, I know Senator D'Amato has been trying to \nbe very helpful on it. Other committee chairmen are working together \nwith their ranking members. It is most unusual.\n  Mr. DOLE. Perhaps--perhaps we can, if our colleagues do not object, \nthen we can go to third reading, say at 11:30? That would be one way \ntoo expedite the process. We have indicated to one of our colleagues, \nthe eldest, there may not be any votes until 11:30. But that does not \nmean we should not proceed. I think we are making progress and I want \nto congratulate the managers. I do believe I can see some of these may \nbe tied together. Some may not have any--some may be more related to \nthe next bill than this bill, as I understand it. Some that do not want \nthe other bill to come up.\n  In the meantime, while we are waiting for our colleagues to come, I \nknow there must be a rush on the subway as I speak. They are all \nheading for the floor at the same time.\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting additional action on this bill, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The managers wish to thank Senators. We are making \nconsiderable progress. I would like to make a report, together with my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  On the horizon is the opportunity perhaps to vote final passage at \nabout 11:30, or at such time thereafter, or before 12, as the \nleadership of the Senate may designate.\n  But to bring Senators up to date, referring to page 2 of today's \ncalendar, the amendments pending from last night by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, are withdrawn; Senator Chafee withdrawn; \nSenator Ford, we have reason to believe that is going to be withdrawn; \nSenator Hatfield, withdrawn; Senator Kerry, we have reason to believe \nthat will be withdrawn; Senator Lautenberg has resolved his amendment. \nWe have reason to believe Senator Nickles' amendment will be withdrawn. \nSenator McCain has been resolved.\n  That leaves Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Smith is very close to \nreconciliation. Senator Chafee is working on that with Senator Smith. \nThere still remains an amendment by Senators Stevens and Murkowski, the \nSenators from Alaska, but we are hopeful that that matter can be \nresolved. It relates to the Committee on Energy, of which Senator \nMurkowski is the chairman. We hope that can be resolved. Neither of the \nmanagers of the pending bill have any dealings with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to join in commending \nSenators who have worked out resolutions of amendments. The Senator \nfrom Virginia has done an admirable job, a wonderful job talking with \nSenators and working out resolutions.\n  On the Democratic side, we are about finished. Senator Exon has three \namendments. I hope, because those are Commerce Committee amendments, \nthat the chairman of the Commerce Committee and his staff can work out \nagreements with Senator Exon. Senator Exon is on the floor now ready to \nproceed with his amendments. I hope that those can be worked out. We \nare very close to final passage. Very close. I expect we can finish \nthis bill before noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers of the bill. \nWhile the dialog was just briefly going on between the two managers, I \nhave received information we have clearance for the second Exon \namendment now on both sides of the aisle. I will take those in order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska is correct. On \nthe second amendment, clearance has been arranged.\n                           Amendment No. 1462\n\n      (Purpose: To increase safety where the rails meet the roads)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1462.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

CROSSING ELIMINATION; STATEWIDE CROSSING FREEZE.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--\n       (1) Railroad-highway grade crossings present inherent \n     hazards to the safety of railroad operations and to the \n     safety of persons using those crossings. It is in the public \n     interest--\n       (A) to eliminate redundant and high risk railroad-highway \n     grade crossings; and\n       (B) to limit the creation of new crossings to the minimum \n     necessary to provide for the reasonable mobility of the \n     American people and their property, including emergency \n     access.\n       (2) Elimination of redundant and high-risk railroad-highway \n     grade crossings is necessary to permit optimum use of \n     available funds to improve the safety of remaining crossings, \n     including funds provided under Federal law.\n       (3) Effective programs to reduce the number of unneeded \n     railroad-highway grade crossings, and to close those \n     crossings that cannot be made reasonably safe (due to reasons \n     of topography, angles of intersection, etc.), require the \n     partnership of Federal, State, and local officials and \n     agencies, and affected railroads.\n       (4) Promotion of a balanced national transportation system \n     requires that highway planning specifically take into \n     consideration the interface between highways and the national \n     railroad system.\n       (b) Partnership and Oversight.--The Secretary shall foster \n     a partnership among Federal, State, and local transportation \n     officials and agencies to reduce the number of railroad-\n     highway grade crossings and to improve safety at remaining \n     crossings. The Secretary shall make provision for periodic \n     review to ensure that each State (including State \n     subdivisions and local governments) is making substantial, \n     continued progress toward achievement of the purposes of this \n     section.\n       (c) Crossing Freeze.--If, upon review, and after \n     opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary determines that a \n     State or political subdivision thereof has failed to make \n     substantial, continued progress toward achievement of the \n     purposes of this section, then the Secretary shall impose a \n     limit on the maximum number of public railroad-highway grade \n     crossings in that State. The limitation imposed by the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall remain in effect until \n     the State demonstrates compliance with the requirements of \n     this section. In addition, the Secretary may, for a period of \n     not more than 3 years after such a determination, require \n     compliance with specific numeric targets for net reductions \n     in the number of railroad-highway grade crossings (including \n     specification of hazard categories with which such crossings \n     are associated).\n       (d) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such \n     regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the two \nmanagers. I have been trying to work with them to move this \nexpeditiously ahead. I think we have made some great progress \novernight. At least two of the amendments that were in question have \nnow been resolved.\n  The first amendment that I have just offered is the Federal highway-\nrailroad grade-crossing safety amendment. This legislation builds on \nthe important work already done by the U.S. Senate. The provisions in \nthis amendment should be familiar and are familiar to the Senate, and \nit is noncontroversial.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to offer the Federal highway and railroad \ngrade crossing safety amendment. This legislation builds on important \nwork already done by the U.S. Senate. The provisions in this amendment \nshould be familiar to the Senate and noncontroversial.\n  Most deaths and injuries which occur in the rail industry are as a \nresult of trespassers and motorist violation of railroad grade crossing \nlaws. About 600 people a year die as a result of railroad crossing \naccidents and about 600 people a year die as a result of trespassing on \nrailroad property. An automobile and a train collide once about every \n90 minutes in the United States. In 1992 approximately 2,500 people \nwere either killed or seriously injured as a result of railroad grade \ncrossing accidents.\n  This is one area of death and injury which is almost entirely \npreventable. The amendment I offer is meant to complement landmark rail \nsafety legislation approved last year as part of the so-called Swift \nRail Act, named in honor of former House Chairman Al Swift.\n  As the former chairman of the Senate Surface Transportation \nSubcommittee, I chaired a number of hearings on railroad and grade \ncrossing safety. Those hearings indicated that although significant \nprogress has been made in reducing the number of rail related deaths, \nthere is still room for improvement, especially when it comes to grade \ncrossing safety. Unfortunately, in the past, jurisdictional disputes \nwith the House of Representatives got in the way of a number of \nimportant Senate grade crossing safety initiatives. Now that the House \nof Representatives has reorganized, I am hopeful that good ideas will \nnot be slain by the sword of jurisdiction.\n  States and local governments must be encouraged to enforce their laws \nagainst grade crossing violations and must be encouraged to finally \nclose crossings. The split jurisdiction between the Federal Highway \nAdministration, The Federal Rail Administration, States, local \ngovernments, and railroads has led to a gridlock of responsibility. \nThis amendment helps shatter that gridlock.\n  It is time to make the places where rails meet roads safer for rail \nworkers, drivers, and pedestrians.\n  This amendment should be very familiar to the Senate. Its provisions \nare [[Page S 8853]] taken from legislation unanimously approved by the \nSenate last year.\n  Provisions taken from the railroad safety bill unanimously approved \nby the Senate in 1994 consist of provisions dropped from the final \nSwift Rail Act because they were outside the jurisdiction of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  These provisions require that grade crossing safety be made part of \nat least two intelligent vehicle highway systems projects; ensure that \nStates include grade crossing closure and safety enhancement plans in \ntheir highway safety management plans; stiffen penalties for truck \nviolations of grade crossing safety laws and encourage cooperation \nbetween State and Federal authorities on grade crossing safety.\n  Finally, the amendment gives the Secretary power--but only as a last \nresort--to impose a statewide freeze on grade crossings where a State \nhas failed to make substantial, continued progress toward crossing \nreduction and improvement.\n  Mr. President, with the amendment, the Senate can vote to save lives. \nAgain, this amendment should be noncontroversial and simply represents \nunfinished business from last year.\n  I say to the managers of the bill that we have agreed to strike the \ntwo provisions that your committee had objection to, and we are going \nsimply with the proposition that was originally cleared by the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before accepting the amendment, I would \nlike to commend the Senator from Nebraska. About 600 people a year die \nat railroad crossings. It seems to me we in Congress have an obligation \nto do what we can do to reduce that number.\n  The Senator from Nebraska came up with an ingenious idea to reduce \nthe deaths. All the Members are indebted to him for his efforts. I \ncommend the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1462) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1463\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1463.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRUCK LENGTH AND THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       Any Federal regulatory standard for single trailer length \n     issued pursuant to negotiations and procedures authorized \n     under the North American Free Trade Agreement, shall not \n     exceed fifty-three feet.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Exon truck-length amendment is a very \nsimple and straightforward provision. It only applies to Federal \nregulations on length issued pursuant to the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing on this issue. Pursuant to the NAFTA \nagreement, the governments of Mexico, Canada, and the United States of \nAmerica are negotiating the harmonization of traffic safety laws. The \nSenate has been very concerned about these negotiations and following \nthe approval of NAFTA approved a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that these negotiations should bring Canadian and Mexican \ntraffic safety up to United States levels, not to lower United States \nstandards. I am pleased to report that the Clinton administration \nexpressed their desire to involve Congress in the adoption of any new \nsafety rules arising out of these negotiations.\n  Since the Federal Government maintains no single trailer length \nstandard, there is a risk that a future administration could use the \nNAFTA negotiations to increase lengths beyond the generally accepted \n53-foot standard. If the administration sets a single trailer length \nstandard pursuant to NAFTA negotiations, that exceeds 53 feet, \ncongressional action would be necessary to implement the longer Federal \nstandard.\n  The amendment does not restrict State action.\n  The amendment does not affect Federal legislative action.\n  The amendment does not affect Federal regulatory action not related \nto the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  The amendment is consistent with the intent of the Reigle-Exon NAFTA-\ntruck safety resolution approved by the Senate following the approval \nof NAFTA and in no way disrupts the long combination vehicle freeze \nSenator Lautenburg and I authored as part of ISTEA.\n  I ask my colleagues to adopt this narrow amendment which will \npreserve congressional discretion over truck safety and the NAFTA.\n  This does not affect truck lengths at all, as far as normal processes \nare concerned. What this amendment would do is to prevent the \nadministration, through any real or imagined parts of the NAFTA \nagreement, to increase truck lengths unilaterally without any \nconsideration at all by the Congress. I think this is a safety matter, \nbut it is very narrowly drawn and has been cleared by, as far as I \nknow, all participants who have an interest in this matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, indeed, we have endeavored to clear this \namendment, but we have just been notified that a Senator has interposed \nan objection to the amendment. Perhaps given that objection, the \nSenator from Nebraska might wish to expand his explanation of this \namendment in the hopes that that expanded explanation might meet the \nobjections of the Senator who has interposed it.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend. I will be glad to expand on it a little \nbit further and maybe satisfy the concerns of all in this particular \narea.\n  We have so many last-minute objections by so many people that I do \nnot know who they are. It has been very difficult to kill these rats \nwhen they keep coming out of the hay bin.\n  I repeat again, we have had in the Commerce Committee and in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction on this particular piece of legislation \nvarious studies and indepth hearings all aimed at safety, safety on the \nhighways of America. There is a discussion ongoing right now as to \nwhether or not we should increase by law the length and the width of \ntrucks traveling on our highways.\n  Generally speaking, this is a matter that has been split. The \nCommerce Committee has been generally recognized to have jurisdiction \nover truck lengths. The committee that is headed by the two \ndistinguished managers of this bill have always had jurisdiction over \nthe width. I cannot go into an explanation of why one committee has \nlength and the other committee has width. That is too complicated a \nmatter for me to understand, and I cannot explain it because I do not \nknow the reason for it myself.\n  But we are not changing any of that, and we are not changing any \nlengths of trucks in this amendment. All that we are saying in this \namendment--very clearly defined--is that the administration, under the \nauthority granted the administration in the NAFTA agreement, cannot \nautomatically extend the lengths of trucks over and beyond what is the \nlaw of the land at the present time.\n  There is some indication that in order to facilitate the movement and \nto make it easier for some of the Mexican trucks to enter the United \nStates, the administration might have the authority, under the terms of \nNAFTA, to supersede the laws presently in place in the United States \nwith regard to lengths of trucks.\n  All this narrowly defined amendment does is it writes into law and \nsnatches away that part of the law that some might interpret as \nauthority for the administration unilaterally, without any consultation \nwith the Congress, let alone laws, unilaterally to authorize longer \ntrucks on our highways under NAFTA that would otherwise be prohibited.\n That is a simple, straightforward explanation. With that, I do not \nknow what the objection would be. If there is an objection, I would be \nglad to attempt to address it.\n[[Page S 8854]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. An objection will be interposed, and we will discuss the \nobjection with the Senator from Nebraska.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside, such that the managers can continue with other \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers are continuing to make steady \nprogress. We retain our hope that we can vote on final passage before \n12 noon. I urge those very few Senators--it is down to two or three \nSenators now that would require further reconciliation of their views.\n  Mr. President, on a personal matter, if I might make a few remarks. I \ncommend the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nTwenty-five years ago, I first met the then Governor of Rhode Island. \nIn 1969, we formed a team in the Department of the Navy where he, as \nSecretary, and I, as principal deputy and Under Secretary, undertook a \ntask at the height of the Vietnam war to give leadership to the \nDepartment of the Navy and to participate in other activities in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Now, 25 years later, we are still together. I do not say this with \nregret, but I do note that he is still the boss and I am still the \nfirst deputy, so not much has changed in a quarter of a century. There \nsits a man that has always stepped forward to lead in this country, be \nit in the time of war, as he did in World War II, as a marine fighting \nin the Pacific, and then being recalled back to duty during the Korean \nconflict, as a captain, company commander, and then as Governor. And \nnow as a U.S. Senator, he has distinguished himself as a public \nservant. He is greatly respected in the U.S. Senate, as well as in his \nown State. It is a privilege for me to once again be in partnership, \nbut as always, No. 2.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his generous remarks. He is right that in our long-time \nfriendship we have worked together. It has not been a one-two \nrelationship. It has been a partnership. He and I worked together in \nthe Defense Department starting in January 1969 in the Navy, as \nSecretary and Under Secretary, and we were in those posts together for \n3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia then became Secretary of the \nNavy and went on after that to head the bicentennial commission, was \nelected to the U.S. Senate in 1978, and he has served here with great \ndistinction. So it is indeed a marvelous friendship and association \nthat we have had together. And now on the Environment Committee, where \nhe is handling this legislation so effectively, doing such an excellent \njob as chairman of the subcommittee dealing with this type of \nlegislation.\n  So I thank my long-time friend--I will not say ``old'' friend, but \n``long-time'' friend--for the joys that we have had together and the \njoint achievements that I believe we have accomplished.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague. I \nhope we have many more years working together here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I note the presence on the floor of the Senator from Maine. I extend \nto him an apology. On two occasions I have indicated the clearance of \nthe Senator's amendment. But subsequent thereto, objections arose. I \nbelieve it is now resolved, and I would appreciate if the Senator from \nMaine could advise the managers. The Senator from Virginia will \ncontinue to ascertain the status of the Senator's amendment. I am \nhopeful that it can be resolved. I thank the Senator from Maine, \nhowever, for his patience on this matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8850-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8854-S8855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few comments on the \nnomination of Dr. Foster to be Surgeon General. We are going to have \nfurther debate this afternoon. We are going to have one more rollcall \nvote in terms of whether or not the proceedings should come to a close \nand a vote take place on Dr. Foster.\n  I must say that this is one of those issues which has really \ngalvanized the American people, those who are interested in this issue. \nWe have letters and calls pouring into our offices from those who are \nstrongly in favor, and those who are equally determined to oppose his \nnomination. The rhetoric is hot. It is, in fact, intemperate. I think \nthe passion of the letters finds its voice right here in the U.S. \nSenate. That voice, at times, is angry, raw, and even ugly.\n  Mr. President, the charge has been made that we are sacrificing Dr. \nFoster on the altar of right-wing radicalism. I must say that there \nhave been a number of good and decent people who have found their \nintegrity and character shredded on the altar of left-wing liberalism. \nThat is one of the problems that I see taking place in this Chamber and \nelsewhere. There seems to be a double standard on display, what we \nmight call a case of situational ethics.\n  What comes to mind is the debate that took place when Ronald Reagan, \nfor example, nominated Robert Bork to be a member of the Supreme Court. \nI recall that debate very well. Judge Bork's writings were plucked from \nthe past. Those writings were provocative. He was, in fact, a \nprovocative professor who challenged conventional wisdom. He disagreed \nwith the rationale that was found and articulated in Roe versus Wade. \nHe found no right of privacy lurking or hidden in the penumbra of the \nConstitution.\n  What took place with Bob Bork is that he was demonized. It was \ncharged that he would take us back to the boneyard of conservatism, to \nthe dark ages, maybe even to hell itself. I say that by virtue of a \nphotograph that I remember that was on the cover of Time magazine.\n  It was a portrait, a photograph, of Robert Bork with his judicial \nrobes on looking much like a cape. Of course, he had the beard. There \nwas a red glow to the entire cover. And one could almost see the hint \nof horns emerging from the top of his head. One would have thought that \nMephistopheles himself was about to be appointed to the Court, would \ncorrupt the Court, would rip up the Constitution and shred our rights \nof privacy.\n  I might point out, sometime thereafter Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who \nactually was endorsed by Robert Bork, also found fault with the Court's \nreasoning in Roe v. Wade. She said the Court had reached the right \nresult but for the wrong reason. Yet we did not hear much criticism \ncoming from the left, the liberal element in our society, at that time.\n  I mention that because I think we are reaching a point in the \nconfirmation process in which it is going to be very difficult to have \ngood and decent people willing to step forward and subject themselves \nto the confirmation process. My own friend, John Tower --I think what \ntook place in this Chamber against John Tower was a disgrace. I saw a \ngood man who had his character shredded by allegations and innuendo and \nfalse charges. He was so bloodied up that the critics said, ``He has \nbeen too damaged to be a successful Secretary of Defense. President \nBush, why don't you just cut him down from that tree that he is \nswinging from and take him back to Texas?'' So we saw another challenge \nto an individual which I felt was unwarranted.\n  How many Republican nominees were rejected because of membership at \nall-white clubs? It did not matter that they were not racist. It did \nnot matter that they had employed blacks or Hispanics or other \nminorities in their businesses or even in their homes. If they were \nmembers or had memberships in an all-white club, that was enough to \nbring down their nomination.\n  The same rule, however, was not applied when it came to people like \nWebster Hubbell, who also belonged to an [[Page S 8855]] all-white club \nat that particular point. But we had a different standard imposed.\n  So I suggest we have to get away from this double standard that when \nthose who raise questions about someone's nomination by virtue of their \ndifference of philosophy, that we not charge it is based upon right-\nwing radicalism any more than it is based on left-wing radicalism. We \nhave to put a stop to this situation. We have to remember that Bill \nClinton won the election. He is the President of the United States. It \nis my own judgment he is entitled to the nominees of his choice.\n  We may disagree with those nominees, but every time we disagree with \nBill Clinton's philosophy, President Clinton's philosophy, or that of \nthe individuals he nominates, we should not then, by virtue of our \ndisagreement with their ideology or practice, turn it into a character \nissue and then begin an all-out assault on character.\n  We obviously have a duty to challenge philosophy and policies when \nthey are fundamentally in conflict with our own. But we also have to \ndeal fairly with these individuals. We have to remember, also, the \naxiom that bad appointments make bad politics. The President of the \nUnited States, when he makes an appointment, is held accountable for \nthat individual's record, that individual's character, that \nindividual's performance. And, barring evidence of incompetence as far \nas technical qualifications are concerned, professional qualifications, \nbarring clear and convincing evidence of moral deficiencies that would \nprevent that person from occupying that position, I think we have an \nobligation to confirm the President's nominees.\n  What we have to stop in this system is, really, shredding the \ncharacter of the individuals who come before the body for confirmation. \nIf we disagree philosophically, let us be very up front about it and \nbase it on that. What I see taking place is something of a variation of \nwhat Senator Moynihan of New York talked about in his brilliant piece a \ncouple of years ago, called ``Defining Deviancy Down.'' What he was \ntalking about at that time was events that took place in the 1920's or \n1930's, some decades ago, that we would look at and say, ``What a \nhorrible thing that was.'' The Saint Valentine's Day massacre was one \nhe pointed to. There were, as I recall, seven people involved in that. \nFour were killed by three others, or vice versa. That incident made \nworldwide news. It has gone in the history books. Today, it is likely \nthat might not appear in bold headlines in the Metro section of the New \nYork Times or the Post or elsewhere.\n  We have seen so much violence spread in our society we have become \ninoculated against it, almost. We have been immunized against a sense \nof outrage about the level of deviancy because we defined it down.\n  It seems to me we have to also talk about defining civility down. We \nhave, I think, lost some of our moorings. We now resort not only to \nchallenges of philosophy but to challenges of character. In doing so, I \nthink we have lowered the standard for civil debate and discourse in \nthis country.\n  The anger we see outside of these Chambers is being reflected inside \nthe Chambers. We do not want to tolerate or promote barbarism outside \nthe gates. We do not want to promote it inside the gates. I think what \nwe have to do is lower the rhetoric and the charges and the \ncountercharges about who is sacrificing whom on which altar and stop \nimposing double standards and situational ethics and come back to what \nI believe to be the correct standard. Either we find Dr. Foster to be \nmedically, professionally unqualified to serve in this position, or we \nfind him to be so morally bankrupt that it would be a discredit and an \ninjustice to have him serve in that position.\n  Frankly, I do not find that we have measured up to that burden of \nproof. I believe Dr. Foster is a good and decent man. I believe \nPresident Clinton is entitled to have his nominee confirmed, even \nthough we might disagree or I might disagree with his particular views \nor practice. Nonetheless, that is not the test that should be imposed. \nThe test should be, Is he professionally qualified and does he have a \nmoral character to serve in that position?\n  There are those on this side who believe fundamentally he has \nmisrepresented the number of abortions that he performed during the \ncourse of a long practice. That is, perhaps, a legitimate issue to be \nraised. But I do not think we ought to be engaged in savaging each \nother, in attacking each others' motives. This is a serious issue and \nis one that ought to be debated in that fashion without resorting to a \nlot of hurtling of invective.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will in fact allow a \nconsideration of Dr. Foster on the merits. That was in fact allowed for \nJudge Bork. He was defeated. It was allowed for Senator Tower, whose \nnomination was also defeated, and others whose names never really made \nit to the floor by virtue of their membership in what were described as \nracist clubs or organizations.\n  My hope is that we can return to a level of civil discourse in this \nsociety of ours, rather than the shouting and the anger that we see \nbeing displayed from day to day, and really try to deal with these \nissues on the merits.\n  I think Dr. Foster is entitled to have his name considered on the \nmerits. We hope there will be enough Members who will vote to terminate \nany attempt to filibuster his nomination.\n  Seeing the hour of 11:30 is about to be reached, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Foster, Jr., to become Medical \n     Director in the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service, \n     subject to qualifications therefor as provided by law and \n     regulations, and to be Surgeon General of the Public Health \n     Service.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, there is an agreement to \nvote at 2 o'clock. So there is a 2-hour time limitation, an hour to be \ncontrolled by the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and the other \nhour to be controlled by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, over the period of the last 24 hours, I have tried to \nlook at this whole nomination, including the extensive hearings that we \nhad as well as the debate on the floor, to try to determine what is \nreally before the U.S. Senate.\n  What we have before the U.S. Senate is an extraordinary nominee--an \nextraordinary human being--who is eminently qualified to serve as the \nnation's Surgeon General. And I thought back to the beginning, and \nasked myself: ``What shape did the process take?''\n  We know that Dr. Henry Foster's name was brought to the attention of \nPresident Clinton by a very distinguished former Republican Cabinet \nMember, Dr. Louis Sullivan, with whom many of us worked very closely \nduring his leadership at the Department of HHS. We know that Dr. \nFoster's nomination was seconded, effectively, by the presence of Lamar \nAlexander, a Republican Governor, who recognized the work of Dr. Henry \nFoster and his leadership ability in confronting the problem of teenage \npregnancy and asked him to develop a program to do so. Those are two \nRepublicans that right from the start recommended Dr. Henry Foster for \nthis important position.\n  And even on the Labor Committee, Senator Frist--Dr. Frist--the one \nMember of the U.S. Senate who is a doctor and who knows Dr. Foster and \nwho has supported his nomination, coming forward and speaking on behalf \nof Dr. Foster's extraordinary record and qualifications as a physician, \neducator and community leader.\n  So, looking back from the very beginning, we see that this nomination \nwas borne of the effort to put forth someone who has been recognized as \nhaving a distinguished record--and he has had a distinguished record, \nwhich I will speak to--but also someone who was not going to be \nnecessarily identified with any one particular political party, but \nrather with strong bipartisan support.\n  We have heard a great deal on the floor of the Senate and in the \npress, that Dr. Foster was selected for narrow partisan or political \nreasons. The fact of the matter is that he was nominated because of a \nvery distinguished record.\n  And what a record it has been--what a record it has been. Dr. Foster \npossesses an extraordinary record of service. We have a nominee who has \ndemonstrated his commitment to the neediest people in our country and \nour society. After he graduated from medical school, he could have \npracticed medicine in any of the cities of this country and in many \nrural areas and had a very comfortable life. But, no, he did not do \nthat.\n  What did he do? He went to the poorest areas of America. Why? Because \nhe wanted to serve his fellow human beings. He went to the rural \nSouth--and treated women and their children. Most of Dr. Foster's \npatients had never even seen a doctor before. He went into homes and \nhouses down there that, in many instances, did not even have \nelectricity or hot water. He went there to help and assist deliver \nbabies. To provide pre-natal care to women who had never had access to \npre-natal care before. He is a baby doctor. A baby doctor who is about \nservice to his community. Service to people. He is a good and decent \nman who has committed his entire life--his entire life--to service. Not \nonly did he engage in an program of service in rural Alabama, but his \nrecord shows that he was widely recognized for his dedication, ability, \nleadership and expertise.\n  He was recognized as a physician. He was recognized as an educator. \nHe was recognized as a researcher in sickle cell anemia and infant \nmortality and the problems facing the youngest and most vulnerable in \nour society.\n  He was recognized by the Institute of Medicine, perhaps the most \nprestigious assemblage of the medical profession in our country, being \nelected to that prestigious body with a regular membership of only 500 \nmembers. In 1992, he was elected by the membership to serve as one of \nonly 21 members of the Institute's governing council--one of only 21 \nmembers selected by the members of the Institute--his peers. What an \nextraordinary, extraordinary recognition of a man who was selfless, \ndedicated and passionate about serving those living in the poorest \nareas of this country.\n  During his career, after numerous accomplishments, he was selected to \nbe Dean of the Meharry School of Medicine--a distinguished medical \nschool. Did he stop with that? No. What did he want to do? He wanted to \nbe a teacher in the classroom as well as dean of the medical school. \nWhy? Because he wanted to work with young people. He wanted to help \ntrain them, and bring more qualified and compassionate doctors into the \nfield of medicine.\n  Was he satisfied with that? No. He went to his community and \ndeveloped a program to deal with the problems of teenage pregnancy and \nthe school drop-out problem. He developed a program that has made such \na difference in the lives of young people, that it has been recognized \nby a President, George Bush, a Republican President of the United \nStates.\n  Now that is the record of Dr. Foster. That is the record that is \nbefore the U.S. Senate. That is the record of service before us. By \nvoting for Dr. Foster, we are not doing Dr. Foster a favor, we are \ndoing a favor to all Americans. We are doing a favor to those parents \nof those teenagers who are confronted with the sad prospects of teenage \npregnancy, welfare dependency, and hopelessness. We are doing a favor \nto all those who struggle with the life-threatening illness of cancer. \nWe are doing a favor to all those whose families or friends or \nneighbors are afflicted with AIDS. We are doing the United States of \nAmerica a favor, which needs a highly principled and dedicated person \nto serve his country. That is what we have here: A good, outstanding, \nselfless individual.\n  Now, you would not understand that, necessarily, from those who have \nspoken in opposition to this nomination, because they have their own \nmessage, and their message is very clear. They want to send a very \nparticular message. Sure, they have distorted his record, \nmisrepresented his record, and in spite of the fact that Dr. Foster at \nthe committee hearings, and the committee itself, thoroughly answered \nand refuted the shallow allegations against him, they are repeated \nagain and again and again and again and again. And those that repeat \nthem do a disservice to themselves, they do a disservice to themselves.\n  What their message is and why this is being done is very clear to me. \nThey are doing this because they want to say to any and every doctor in \nAmerica, ``If you ever perform an abortion, if you ever do so, even to \nsave the life of the mother, you'll never get a position of confidence \nor leadership in the U.S. Government, because you'll never make it \nthrough the confirmation process by the U.S. Senate.''\n  That is the message. We understand that. They are not fooling anyone. \nWhen, on one hand you have Dr. Foster's extraordinary record of service \nand on the other, you have the repeated distortions, \nmisrepresentations, and shallow allegations, the message is very clear \nand it is motivated by narrow political concerns and interests. That is \nthe message that is being sent to doctors in this country. That is the \nmessage that is here.\n  Dr. Foster's opponents prefer to play a negative card. When all of \nAmerica is struggling to look upward, higher--to reach out for a better \nfuture for themselves and their children--his opponents would have us \nlanguish in darkness. They do not want to recognize the [[Page S \n8857]] light, the hope, that Dr. Foster represents for the future of \nthis country.\n  During the course of Dr. Foster's testimony at the hearings, Senator \nPell asked him what has been one of the most inspiring moments of his \nlife. And Dr. Foster answered, ``Well, it was just after I and my \nclassmates had graduated from seventh grade, and my father brought us \nout to the edge of town and treated all the children in our class to an \nairplane ride.'' Two children in the front with the pilot, children in \nthe back--Dr. Foster described the way he felt when that plane took \noff.\n  He said, ``When we got up in that air, every child that was in that \nclass looked out and they could see trees as far as the eye could see. \nThey could see that there was a broader land, that there are lakes out \nthere and there are hills.''\n  Perhaps for the first time, they saw that there was a broader America \nthan just the school house where they went to the school, and their own \nsmall home where they grew up, in a segregated society with little \nopportunity.\n  He said:\n\n       That plane ride was one of the most inspiring moments of my \n     life, because it taught me that there is a future out there, \n     and that I could be a part of it. My hope and dream of \n     service is to provide that same ``airplane ride'' to the \n     young people all across this country.\n\n  That is the soul of Dr. Foster. You would not know it listening to \nthe distortions and misrepresentations of the opposing side; you would \nnot know the true record of the nominee who is before us. You would not \nknow it when they repeat and repeat and repeat these charges that any \nfair-minded person would understand have been responded to.\n  How many political primaries are we going to have on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate? The election is 18 months away. What was yesterday? Super \nWednesday? What is today? Super Thursday? What are we going to say to \nevery person that is nominated? Do we tell them that they are going to \ngo through this pillory to serve the American people?\n  That is the issue. Are we going, in this institution and in this \nbody, to appeal to the better instincts of its membership? Or are we \ngoing to be slaves to those kinds of interests that are holding hostage \nthe nomination process here before the U.S. Senate? I hope, Mr. \nPresident, that the higher angels of our character will come out today \nwhen we vote at the hour of 2 o'clock.\n  I see my colleague on the floor, the Senator from Washington, who has \nbeen such a leader on this issue and who speaks with such eloquence and \ninsight into the qualifications of this nomination.\n  I yield her 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \noutstanding work on this nomination. I remind my colleagues that we \nshould be here debating the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster and what \nmessage and tone he can bring to this office. But we are not. We are \nhere debating whether or not Dr. Foster will have the opportunity to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have been working with Dr. Foster for a number of months now. It is \nextremely disappointing to see this fine man, after all he has been \nthrough, being denied a vote on the floor of the Senate. I hope our \ncolleagues across the aisle can step back today and think about the \nlarger message. Think about what will happen if we block this vote \ntoday and do not allow this man with great dignity to have the vote \nthat he deserves after the last 5 months.\n  Throughout this debate, I have been focusing on what Dr. Foster \nbrings to this office. Certainly, he brings the issues of women's \nhealth care clearly to the forefront of this Nation for the first time \nin our history, and that is a good thing. Certainly, he brings the \nability to send a message to our teenagers, a vision of hope, a vision \nthat they can be somebody. That is something that is needed in this \nNation.\n  But I fear, Mr. President, that many of our American viewers today do \nnot realize that that is not what this vote is all about. This vote has \nbecome a vote about Presidential politics, and I find that very sad. As \nwe have worked to get to the last three votes, it has been surprising \nand saddening to hear what some of my colleagues have expressed. They \ndo not feel they can vote for this candidate--not because he is not \nqualified, not because they think the process should be fair. They tell \nme they do not want to be seen as giving one Presidential candidate a \nvote over another Presidential candidate. It has become an issue of \nwinners and losers. Who are the winners? Who is going to win? I can \ntell you who the losers are. The losers are the American people. The \nAmerican people will be the losers because not only will they lose a \nfine candidate for Surgeon General, they will lose because the process \nhas been sullied, and I think that is a sad statement for this Nation.\n  I think the winner--no matter what the outcome of this vote--is Dr. \nFoster. He is a man of dignity, a man of courage, and he is a man of \nhonor. Every one of us--every one in this Nation--should stand up and \ngive this man a loud round of applause. He deserves it. He has lived \nthrough torture--name calling, watching his whole, entire life be put \nin print--and he has shown all of us, as he sat before the committee, \nthat he is a man of dignity. Dr. Foster certainly is the kind of person \nthat deserves to be in the Surgeon General position, and he is also a \nman we all want to be like. He is a man of honor, and he should be very \nproud today that he has shown this Nation how to be a leader and what \nwe should expect of leaders and what we want our Nation's leaders to \nlook like.\n  I hope that all of our colleagues will step back and think about the \nlarger message as they vote today. This man deserves a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. But above all, he deserves our applause for going \nthrough this process and showing us what a leader really looks like.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts and \nmy friend from Washington for their extraordinary leadership in trying \nto get a very simple premise fulfilled, and that premise is that Dr. \nFoster deserves an up-or-down vote. It is wrong to deny this man a \nvote. Let him stand or fall on his merits or demerits.\n  I saw him standing next to the President yesterday at the White \nHouse, saying, ``All I ask for is fairness.'' He wants a vote, and 57 \nMembers of the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--said, ``That is \nright, Dr. Foster; you deserve a vote.'' But a minority said no. If I \nwere one of them, I would not have slept very well last night because \nit is a mean-spirited thing to do to a decent American. It is not fair. \nIf Americans are anything, they are fair.\n  Dr. Foster is a pawn in a political game--a pawn in a political \ngame--a physician who went to work in rural America when he could have \nhad a cushy job. He is a physician who went into the toughest, most \ndifficult parts of our Nation to help lower the infant mortality rate, \nand he did. He is one who took on the problem of teenage pregnancy. It \nis incredible that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \ntrying to block this vote criticize his program. What did they ever do \nin their lives to help stop teenage pregnancy? Let us hear what they \nhave done. Oh, they throw the stones. What have they done? Have they \nwalked into the toughest parts of America and taken a problem on that \nnobody else wants to take on? I do not think so.\n  They have a pretty cushy job right here. But they throw stones at a \nman who should be honored--and, by the way, he has been honored by \nPresident Bush, a Republican, I might say, who gave him a Thousand \nPoints of Light Award. He was honored by Dr. Louis Sullivan, a former \nRepublican Secretary of HHS, who recommended him for this job. People \nsay President Clinton was playing politics. I have to tell you, this \nwas the most bipartisan appointment I have seen. Senator Kennedy made \nthat point at a press conference yesterday. It is a truly bipartisan \nappointment.\n  Dr. Foster is being denied a vote because two Republican candidates \nfor President want to block a vote on him. The Republicans are being \ntold, ``You have to be loyal. Do not allow a vote on this man. It will \nhurt our chances.''\n  Playing politics is not what a U.S. Senator is supposed to do. They \nare [[Page S 8858]] supposed to be fair. They are supposed to be just. \nThey are supposed to step up to the plate and put political \nconsiderations behind them and give a man a chance.\n  I have to tell you, maybe these two political candidates for \nPresident will do well in the short run. But do you know what I think? \nIn the long run, I do not think they will do very well because they are \nout of step with mainstream America. If you ask the American people \nwhat are the two important things they want to see in a President, it \nis fairness and courage. And it is not fair to deny this man his day. \nIt is not courageous to cower to the right wing of one political party. \nSo, in the long run, mainstream America is not going to look kindly at \nthese two candidates--mark my words.\n  I think this debate has been somewhat disturbing. Last night I was on \na TV show with one of the leading opponents of Dr. Foster, and that \nSenator called Dr. Foster an abortionist. I think it is an outrage. He \nowes Dr. Foster an apology. Dr. Foster brought thousands of babies into \nthis world and he is called an abortionist? Thirty-nine abortions over \n38 years, a legal medical procedure, and he calls him an abortionist on \nnational TV. He is lucky he cannot be sued for defamation of character.\n  Dr. Foster is an ob-gyn, an obstetrician/gynecologist, a decent man, \nand he deserves a vote. I stand very proudly with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, with the Democratic women Senators, with the 11 \nRepublicans who had the guts to stand up and say fair is fair, and I \nhope and pray that we have a different result today. If we do not, I \nthink the fallout will be much greater than anyone now anticipates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 40 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just yield myself 15 seconds, and then I will yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from California.\n  In one of the most important considerations in debate, the silence on \nthe other side is deafening--their willingness to engage in this debate \nand discussion, and we have nothing to speak about on the other side.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I thank the Senator from Washington for all the work she \nhas done on this matter.\n  I really address my remarks, Mr. President, to 43 Members of this \nbody, and I want to share with them some of my thoughts and see where \nthey register with them.\n  Let me start by saying that my basic belief regarding this nominee is \nthat--in the absence of any compelling evidence of misconduct, \ninsufficiency of professional qualifications, or flaws in character--\nthe Senate owes it to the President and the nominee to conclude its \nadvise-and-consent role and grant its approval. I say that particularly \nin view of what has happened to his predecessor.\n  In my belief, it is not appropriate for a minority of the Senate to \nprevent a vote on a Presidential selection based on unsubstantiated \narguments about what Dr. Foster might have known or should have said. \nThat is not the Senate's role.\n  In addition, it is unprecedented to deny the President even an up or \ndown vote on a well-qualified nominee for a public health position such \nas Surgeon General.\n  Therefore, I believe that Dr. Foster is entitled to an up or down \nvote by the Senate. Not a procedural vote, but a real majority vote \nthat will show the Nation that a majority of Senators favor Dr. Foster.\n  Let me also say that I believe that many of the concerns raised by \nDr. Foster's opponents over the last 5 months have been a smokescreen \nof false issues, innuendo, and other distractions designed to obscure \nthe central issue here, which is a woman's right to choose an abortion.\n  However, I am grateful that Dr. Foster's nomination has been \ninvestigated approved by the Labor Committee by a 9-7 vote and finally \nbeen brought to the Senate floor. It is my hope that in the remaining \ntime for debate, Dr. Foster's real qualifications can be made clear and \nany remaining issues can be raised and answered, once and for all, and \nthat a few more Senators can be persuaded.\n  The concerns of Dr. Foster's critics boil down to a few basic \nelements, which we have continued to hear over and over. These \narguments are:\n  Dr. Foster has insufficient professional qualifications and \ncredentials to serve as Surgeon General;\n  Dr. Foster provided contradictory information on the number of \nabortions he has performed;\n  Dr. Foster knew about the Tuskegee experiment, in which 400 black men \nwith syphilis were left untreated, before it was revealed in 1972;\n  Dr. Foster performed sterilizations of mentally retarded women during \nthe 1970's; and\n  Dr. Foster's I Have a Future teenage pregnancy prevention program \nfocuses on contraception rather than abstinence.\n  While most of these issues have already been thoroughly addressed and \ndismissed, I would like to briefly summarize the factual responses to \neach of them, based on what I have learned:\n  On the issue of Dr. Foster's qualifications and credentials, I \nbelieve that they are impressive. Dr. Foster, is in rough chronological \norder:\n  A graduate of Morehouse College and the University of Arkansas \nmedical school;\n  A former U.S. Air Force captain;\n  An examiner for the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists;\n  An advisor to the National Institutes on Health and the FDA on \nmaternal and child health;\n  A member of the National Board of Medical Examiners, the \naccreditation council for graduate medical education, and the board of \nthe March of Dimes;\n  A Distinguished Practitioner recognized in 1987 by the National \nAcademies of Practice;\n  Acting president of Meharry Medical College, where he has served for \nthe last 21 years as dean of Medicine and Chairman of Obstetrics.\n  On the issue of the contradictory estimates of abortions Dr. Foster \nperformed and his overall credibility:\n  A review of 38 years of medical records determined that the actual \nnumber of abortions Dr. Foster has performed or been the doctor of \nrecord are small in number [39]--particularly in view of his estimated \ndelivery of 10,000 live babies.\n  The initial confusion surrounding this number resulted from Dr. \nFoster having been listed as the attending physician for additional \nprocedures that he himself did not perform, as well as disputes over \nwhether hysterectomies Dr. Foster performed to protect the health of \nwomen should be counted as abortions if pregnancies were discovered \nduring the procedure.\n  During his hearing, Dr. Foster provided the following explanation of \nthe early contradictions: ``In my desire to provide instant answers to \nthe barrage of questions coming at me, I spoke without having all the \nfacts at my disposal.'' The majority of the committee found this \nexplanation reasonable enough to approve the nominee.\n  On the claim that Dr. Foster consented to the infamous experiments at \nthe Tuskegee Institute:\n  While Dr. Foster was at Tuskegee during the time of the study, his \nexpertise was maternal and child health rather than sexually \ntransmitted diseases;\n  A full committee investigation showed that the possibility Dr. Foster \nknew about the study is tenuous at best, resting on assumptions about \nwhat he should have known or might have been told, rather than direct \nevidence; the doctor whose statements have been used to suggest Dr. \nFoster failed to act promptly has stated repeatedly that Dr. Foster did \nnot know of the study before it was revealed in 1972.\n  Without any direct or concrete evidence that Dr. Foster actually knew \nabout the experiments and failed to take action, it is not reasonable \nto judge him a participant or to burden him with the responsibility of \nhaving to shut down an experiment he did not control nor was he a party \nof this ill-conceived study. [[Page S 8859]] \n  On the assertion that Dr. Foster performed sterilizations of mentally \nretarded women:\n  Dr. Foster sterilized retarded girls at the request of their parents \nunder the established practice guidelines and ethics of the times, and \nwrote sensitively about these cases and the danger and tragedy of \nforced sterilization in 1974;\n  If there were any real questions about Dr. Foster's ethics, he would \nnot have been endorsed by every major medical association in the United \nStates.\n  On the claim that I Have a Future Program does not promote \nabstinence:\n  This after-school program focuses on delaying teenage pregnancy, \nincluding providing education about abstinence and increasing self-\nesteem as a way of preventing early sexual activity. Only if necessary \nare participants referred to medical personnel for information about \ncontraception;\n  Every press article and description I have seen talks about how the \nprogram emphasizes abstinence and does not just throw condoms at the \nkids. Whether or not all program brochures include the word \n``abstinence'' or not is not the central issue.\n  In fact, the central motivation for the I Have a Future Program was \nDr. Foster's observation that simply providing contraceptives to at-\nrisk teens was not an effective form of pregnancy prevention for at-\nrisk teens, and self-esteem and personal goal-setting must be included.\n  Should he be denied because abstinence was not on a piece of paper?\n  In all, here is a man who has impressive qualifications, an \nupstanding character, and reputation for integrity in his home \ncommunity and among his professional peers. He has no glaring flaw that \njustifies denying him confirmation.\n  Instead--and this is increasingly clear--there is just one real \nreason that he is being opposed: he performed 39--the number is \ndisputed--medically necessary legal abortions as part of a career that \nincludes 10,000 deliveries of live babies.\n  What I would like to point out is that 39 is an amazingly small \nnumber, considering the human situations that Dr. Foster has \nencountered--women who have been raped; women whose mental or physical \ncondition is such that they could not give birth; questions of major \nfetal deficiencies.\n  The fact is that out of 10,000 live babies delivered, there were few \ncases where Dr. Foster performed a medically necessary and appropriate \nabortion. To me, this is a very small number.\n  Were the procedures legal? Were they in accord with medical standards \nand performed as part of his established responsibilities? The answer \nto these questions, of course, is yes. Nothing has been raised to \ncontradict this statement.\n  What is clear to me from the last 5 months of debate over Dr. \nFoster's nomination is that there is now a question whether any \nobstetrician could ever hold the office of Surgeon General if they have \nperformed even one legal, medically appropriate abortion.\n  That clearly is the question in my mind. I really believe the issue \nis that simple. And I strongly believe that the answer to that question \nshould be yes.\n  I believe this body has but one choice and I am hopeful that, of the \n43 there are 3 who will come forward and simply say, in fairness, Dr. \nHenry Foster deserves a vote in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I doubt that anything I say will shatter \nthe deafening silence the Senator from Massachusetts alluded to. But it \nwill at least interrupt. We have a number of speakers. Mrs. Kassebaum, \nwho normally would be managing this, is chairing a hearing of the Labor \nCommittee. I know the Senator from Massachusetts, who was a former \nchairman of that committee, understands that sometimes they do not end \nas quickly as you would hope. She will be here as soon as she can. A \nnumber of other Members plan to speak on our side. Several of them are \ntied up in that same hearing but will be here shortly.\n  Mr. President, if yesterday's vote is any indication, Dr. Foster will \nnot be confirmed as the next Surgeon General of the United States when \nwe take this vote at 2 o'clock. I believe that conclusion is justified \nby the record. The Labor and Human Resources Committee held what \neveryone has described as thorough and fair hearings. Dr. Foster was \ngiven every opportunity to present, at whatever length of time he \nrequired and in whatever detail or depth he required, his \nqualifications, his experience, and to present his answers to the \nquestions that were raised.\n  Many have concluded, on the basis of that hearing, those who sat \nthrough the hearing and those who have examined the record, that Dr. \nFoster did not satisfactorily answer the many disturbing questions that \nwere raised, that a disturbing pattern of behavior and of responses--\nwhether directed by the White House or not I do not know for sure--\nemanated from those hearings and left many with serious questions. I \ndetailed many of those in a letter to my colleagues, a very lengthy \nletter comparing the public documents, matters of public record, which \nin many numerous instances was in direct contradiction to Dr. Foster's \nversion of the various incidents; issues in this debate that arose. \nSome of those will be addressed here today. That, however, has been a \nmatter of examination for all Senators. They have all had the \nopportunity to do that, and in a sufficient length of time to do that.\n  I believe that the conclusion that Dr. Foster is not the right man \nfor this job is justified by the record. Questions of medical ethics \nthat were raised are not just disturbing, in my opinion they are \ndisqualifying. Questions of credibility in this Senator's opinion have \nnever been adequately answered leaving us with a candidate that the New \nYork Times says ``fails the candor test.''\n  These problems, problems that the administration and problems that \nthe nominee himself were largely responsible for, I believe have \ndecided the outcome of this procedure. But I would like to spend a \nmoment this afternoon on the broader lessons that should be taken from \nthe tenure of the former Surgeon General, Dr. Elders, and the apparent \nfailure of this nominee to receive the necessary support for this \nposition, lessons that hopefully will inform the selection of the next \nnominee for this office.\n  The President of the United States needs to understand that there are \nmillions of Americans committed to the protection of innocent life and \nthe protection of the innocence of childhood. They are not fanatics to \nbe demonized. They are part of the responsible mainstream of American \nlife.\n  They understand that this administration disagrees with them. But \nwhat they do not understand is why this administration has chosen to \nactively assault their deepest beliefs, to disdainfully dismiss their \nhighest ideals, to treat them as if they were beneath civility.\n  This bias has been particularly obvious in the Office of Surgeon \nGeneral. The former occupant of the Surgeon General's Office, Dr. \nJoycelyn Elders, abdicated her role as spokesman for public health \nentirely, and became what appeared to be a full-time spokeswoman for \nradical causes. And this nominee has shown, as I believe the record \nindicates, little sensitivity for the moral concerns of countless \nAmericans whom he himself called ``right-wing extremists.''\n  There is almost a mantra coming out of the White House, a mantra \ncoming out of the Democrat Campaign Committee, a mantra being heard on \nthis floor that any opposition to the President, almost on any subject, \nis the work of right-wing extremists. Boy, what a powerful group they \nare. I am not sure even if we can identify who they are. But any \nopposition raised to what the President deems his priority, his agenda \nfor America, is dismissed either by the President or by his \nspokespeople as just the work of the right-wing extremists and, \ntherefore, to be dismissed.\n  I would suggest it goes to something far deeper than that. It goes to \nan undercurrent that threads its way throughout American life, American \nculture. It goes to the values that many Americans hold dear, people \nwho do not even belong to any particular political party, people who \nwould not begin to identify themselves as right wing or extremist or \nanything else--just concerns that affect everyday Americans, American \nfamilies, American parents, those of us that are concerned with some of \nthe breakdown in our culture and some of the undermining of our values. \n[[Page S 8860]] \n  So we raise questions about the bully pulpit that is being used by \nthe administration, by the President and by the Office of Surgeon \nGeneral to advocate an agenda that many of us feel is out of the \nmainstream of what the Democrats describe as the mainstream, but very \nmuch in the mainstream of what America has tried as America's agenda. \nWe can debate this. We can debate what is the best course of action to \ntake, and what direction we ought to go and what our values ought to \nbe. We are not very successful at legislating those values. And I do \nnot think it is possible to legislate those values. These problems are \nnot going to be solved in this Chamber. They are going to be decided \nand solved around the kitchen table, in the family rooms, and where \nAmericans live and work, and where the most discourse takes place among \nour citizens.\n  But there are many who are concerned that the Office of Surgeon \nGeneral has been used as an advocacy post for a certain agenda, an \nagenda that many of us feel is out of step with America's agenda, and \nthe agenda of at least a very substantial majority of our people.\n  This use of this position for this purpose makes the work of the \nSurgeon General literally impossible because the role of that office \ntraditionally has been--and I think in most of our definitions should \nbe--the role of building consensus around important public health \nissues. Instead, it is hard to argue any other way but that the \nadministration has turned public health into an ethical battleground by \nenphasizing not issues that unite us but issues that divide us. And \nmore than that, they have ridiculed anyone who dares to disagree, \nincluding the Catholic Church, the pro-life movement, and millions of \nparents who do not believe that condoms are a universal substitute for \nmoral conviction.\n  This administration by this attitude has undermined the public health \ndiscussion in America, and it has squandered the potential that exists \nfor the Surgeon General and the Office of Surgeon General.\n  Now the President, it appears, will have again a choice to make with \nanother nominee--whether that nominee will bind our Nation or rend it, \nwhether it will unite the Senate or divide us. I have some questions \nfor the administration, questions that I think deserve serious \nconsideration and deserve an answer. Mr. President, when will you \nfinally nominate someone who can unite us as Americans around important \nissues of public health instead of polarizing us? When, Mr. President, \nwill you choose a candidate for this office who is not an advocate of \nthe most divisive issues of our times but is an advocate for those \nissues that can bring us together as a people? When, Mr. President, \nwill you allow us to return our focus from moral controversies to \nissues of public health? We are not asking you to send us someone that \nwe always agree with. But we are asking you to send us someone who does \nnot bitterly divide us as a people. If your administration fails to do \nthis, the consequences will be immediate, and I am afraid unfortunate.\n Because if the President insists that the Office of Surgeon General is \na bully pulpit for radicalism, for advocacy, we will be forced to ask \nif the office should exist at all. I hope this is a decision we do not \nhave to make. And I hope that the President will make his next choice \nwith a lot more care than he exercised on his last two choices.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is decision day on Henry Foster. This is not \ndecision day on Joycelyn Elders. This is not decision day on Bill \nClinton. We get to do that in November 1996.\n  This is decision day on Henry Foster. We should be talking about \nHenry Foster and is he or is he not qualified to be the Surgeon General \nof the United States of America. I believe he is.\n  Now, when one wants to ask: Where are those people who will unite us \non broad issues of public health? Bill Clinton has done it. He gave us \nDr. Phil Lee, a distinguished physician, who is our Assistant Secretary \nof Health, who is coordinating health policy in a time during shrinking \nbudgets and higher need. He has given us Dr. Varmus to head the \nNational Institutes of Health when George Bush delayed the appointment \nof the head of NIH because of a litmus test on fetal tissue. But Dr. \nVarmus is attracting the kind of young talent and retaining the \nseasoned talent for NIH to continue to be the flagship of research of \nthe life science issues in America.\n  Bill Clinton is meeting his responsibility. Today, it is our \nresponsibility to pick a Surgeon General. And we are not voting on Dr. \nElders. We did that. We are voting on Henry Foster.\n  Henry Foster is a man unique unto himself, bringing his own \ncredentials and expertise. He is not Joycelyn Elders in wingtips.\n  Now, let us get it straight. I regret that abortion has become the \nfocal point of this debate rather than the broad policy issues of \npublic health. We should be focusing on who can focus on prevention, \nprimary care, and personal responsibility in a public health agenda. \nThat is what it is all about, and Dr. Foster has done that.\n  We knew that, yes, there would be those who would focus on the big A \nword, abortion, so in a public hearing at the Labor Committee, chaired \nin a very outstanding way by Senator Kassebaum, I asked Henry Foster \ntough questions because I felt the public had a right to know. I said \nto Dr. Foster, ``Did you ever perform an illegal abortion?'' He said, \n``Absolutely not. I have only done those things that were legal and \nmedically necessary.'' I said, ``Did you ever do a trimester \nabortion?'' He said, ``Absolutely not.'' I said, ``Did you ever do an \nabortion for sex selection?'' He said, ``Absolutely not.'' I said, \n``Did you ever sterilize mentally retarded girls without parental \ninvolvement?'' And he said, ``Absolutely not.''\n  So that is the record, and it is on the record. ``Absolutely not.'' \nAnd on this sterilization study that has been discussed, the record is \nclear. Dr. Foster's name is on a study of a variety of people who \nconducted hysterectomies on retarded women, and on those three in which \nhe was involved--and he was involved in only three--there was parental \ninvolvement and parental consent. They were acting in loco parentis, in \nthe guardianship role of parents. Now, we believe parents should be \ninvolved. I support parental consent for abortion. There was parental \nconsent in this area. Henry Foster did the right thing as a clinician, \nand he did the right thing in involving parents.\n  So that is where we are on these issues. Now, the question becomes \nwith Henry Foster, when is good good enough? This man has devoted his \nlife to public service and the practice of medicine. To be Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States, to serve your country, when is good good \nenough? Thirty-eight years in the practice of medicine. When is good \ngood enough to be Surgeon General? When you serve in the U.S. military \nas a captain, as a physician, when you have done that job for your \ncountry, when is good good enough to be Surgeon General? When you \npractice medicine in a town like Nashville, and you are chosen to be \nhead of your own bioethics committee, you are asked to be the dean of a \nmedical school, is that not good enough credentials? What more do we \nwant? Competency, well respected by your peers, 38 years of devotion, \nvolunteer work in the community, starting a program called ``I Have a \nFuture,'' going into the public housing projects to say to kids that \nyou just say no.\n  Schoolmarmist admonitions with these Victorian values only get good \nheadlines. They do not get good results. You have to go to those kids \nand reach out to them. And the way you get them to say no is when they \nsay yes to the possibilities of a life where they can define themselves \nas full men and women, not only in terms of their sexual prowess.\n  That is what he did. And that is why George Bush wanted him to be a \npoint of light, because these kinds of programs are a point of light.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Could I have 1 additional moment?\n  Let me just conclude by saying this. In a room in a meeting with Dr. \nFoster, I said to him, ``What do you want to do as Surgeon General?'' \nHe said, ``I want to help all Americans live better and I [[Page S \n8861]] want to help poor kids do better and make sure they have a \nfuture.''\n  Dr. Foster has devoted his life to giving other people a chance. Let \nus give him a chance and not hide behind parliamentary procedure. Let \nus make this decision day for Henry Foster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I believe the Senator from New Hampshire has been \nwaiting. Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. SMITH. I have been here. Yes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would like to yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Pennsylvania has said he is only asking \nfor 3 minutes. I will be happy to yield and then take my time after the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Kansas or the Senator from \nMassachusetts yielding time to the Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts to yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my hope that at least three \nadditional Senators will vote in favor of closing debate so that Dr. \nFoster can receive a vote on the merits.\n  I believe Dr. Foster is entitled to his day in court. He is entitled \nto his vote in the Senate. The sole issue which is holding up this \nconfirmation is the issue of abortion. Cutting to the bone, that is it, \npure and simple. And I think it is simply wrong to deny Dr. Foster \nconfirmation because he has performed an operation which is lawful \nunder the Constitution of the United States. And you see the pattern \nemerging. In yesterday's Washington Times, it is Ralph Reed, Jr., who \nis calling the tune for those who are opposing Dr. Foster, and in \ntoday's Washington Post it is Gary Bauer who is handing out plaudits to \nthose in the Senate who are opposing Dr. Foster. I believe it is \ninappropriate for this body to deny this man a vote on the merits and \nto deny confirmation for performing a medical procedure, abortions, \nlawful under the U.S. Constitution.\n  I would remind my colleagues, Mr. President, that there is nothing in \nthe Contract With America, which was the basis of our Republican \nvictory last November, nothing in the Contract With America, on \nabortion. And that is not a mandate from the American people defining \nthe Republican stand. I would also remind my colleagues that if this \nbody is going to become embroiled in this kind of an ideological \nbattle, we are not going to be able to take up the issues which the \nAmerican people elected us for. They did not elect us in 1994 on the \nabortion issue. They elected us to have smaller Government, less \nspending, reduced taxes, and strong national defense. Those are our \ncore values and, if I may say, our core Republican values. And it is a \nvery dangerous precedent for this body to have an ideological debate.\n  If we are going to subject people who want to be public servants to \n60 votes, not the democratic majority, we are going to discourage \npeople like Henry Foster and other qualified individuals from coming to \nthis town, this Government, to serve. If there had been a demand for 60 \nvotes for Justice Clarence Thomas, he would not be sitting on the \nSupreme Court of the United States today. And I know there have been \nnominees who have had a past filibuster test. But the appropriate \nstandard, the nonideological standard is to say, ``Is he qualified when \nhe performs a medical procedure which is constitutional?'' I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We reserve whatever time we have. I believe the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has been typically courteous to permit the Senator \nfrom Iowa to proceed for 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus my comments a little on the comments \nmade yesterday by the majority leader, Senator Dole. I have been for \nsome time involved in the whole issue of filibusters. Senators may \nremember I tried earlier this year to do something about filibusters. \nThe filibuster is being used here today. So, I looked it up in the \nRecord, and here is what Senator Dole said yesterday. He said, ``Yes, \nsupporters must obtain 60 votes.'' That is the way it works. I had the \nCongressional Research Service do a little work in that area. I have \nheard people say, ``Oh, this never happened before.'' It has happened a \nlot.'' He goes on to say, ``Since 1968 24 nominations have been \nsubjected to cloture votes.'' As Paul Harvey might say, ``Now for the \nrest of the story,'' because that is not quite correct. The fact is, \nMr. President, that nominations have been defeated by filibuster after \nfailure to invoke cloture in only two cases: the first was Abe Fortas \nto be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1968; the other was Sam \nBrown to be an Ambassador in 1994. Both nominations were made by \nDemocratic Presidents and defeated by Republican filibusters.\n  Senator Dole was half right. He said that there had been 24 \nfilibusters. What he did not say was that 22 of them went through, and \nthey got their nominations. Only two did not make it--Abe Fortas and \nSam Brown.\n  I might also point out, Mr. President, that Democrats have never \nblocked a nomination of a Republican President by filibuster and defeat \nof a cloture motion. Never. Not once. Now, until recently we never had \ncloture votes on nominations. Up until 1949 you could not filibuster a \nnomination. Then the rules were changed and you could. And even then \ncomity prevailed on both sides of the aisle. During the Eisenhower \nadministration we let Ike have whatever nominees he wanted. It was not \nuntil 1968 that the first filibuster was held. That was on Abe Fortas. \nAnd cloture was not invoked.\n  The second, I said, was in 1994 on Sam Brown. But during all those \nyears when there were Republican Presidents, a Democratic Senate never \ndefeated, not once, by a filibuster a nomination of a Republican \nPresident. Those are the facts. And they cannot be disputed, Mr. \nPresident. Those are the facts.\n  So I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, do not \nhide. Do not hide behind this procedure. Have the guts to come out and \nvote up or down on whether Dr. Foster ought to be the Surgeon General \nof the United States. And for once and for all, put behind us this \nfilibuster procedure on nominations. I believe, Mr. President, we are \ngoing down a very bad road, a very bad road, because if we continue \nthis, the worm will turn. There will be a Republican President and \nthere will be a Democratic Senate. And then the shoe will be on the \nother foot. And I say that is the wrong road for us to go down. Let us \ninvoke cloture and have an up or down vote. Let us not hide behind \nprocedure.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Kansas for yielding me this time. \nMr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to Dr. Foster being \nconfirmed as President Clinton's nomination to be Surgeon General of \nthe United States. I also at this point would like to thank Senator \nKassebaum for the fine job that she did with the hearings that were \nconducted very fairly, and I thank Senator Coats for his leadership in \nbringing information to the forefront regarding this nomination.\n  As Senator Coats has ably pointed out during this debate, there are \nmany troubling issues surrounding the confirmation of Dr. Foster. And I \nalways feel somewhat sad to have to be involved in these debates when \nindividuals like Dr. Foster are brought into the arena, so to speak, \nbecause appropriate research was not done on the [[Page S \n8862]] nomination prior to placing that person in the arena, which has \nhappened in this case, I believe.\n  The issues that I am concerned about include the credibility of Dr. \nFoster's responses to questions about his knowledge of the Tuskegee \nsyphilis study, the infamous experiment with hundreds of black men with \nsyphilis where they were deliberately left untreated in the name of \nmedical research.\n  In addition, several members of the Labor Committee have indicated \nthey remain unconvinced that Dr. Foster was, as he claimed, ``in the \nmainstream'' of medical practice when he performed hysterectomies on \nmentally retarded women without securing independent-party written \nconsent and even years after the State and Federal courts, as well as \nthe U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had proscribed \nthose and similar practices.\n  One of the principal issues surrounding this nomination is the \ncredibility of Dr. Foster with respect to the number of abortions that \nhe has performed. Various times since he was chosen by the President to \nbe Surgeon General, Dr. Foster has claimed 1, 12, 39, and 55 abortions. \nAnd there is even a transcript of a public proceeding in which he \nappears to have claimed that he performed 700. The interesting thing \nabout this, whether it is 1 or whether it is 700, one of those \nindividuals, you never know, could very well, had they had the \nopportunity to live a full life, been the nominee for Surgeon General \nof the United States of America at some point in the future.\n  All of these doubts about Dr. Foster were summed up just right I \nthought by the New York Times editorial entitled ``Ending the Foster \nNomination,'' calling Dr. Foster a flawed nominee whose nomination \ninvolved sacrificing the principle that candidates for high office must \nfully disclose relevant facts and attitudes. The Times concluded that \nDr. Foster's nomination deserves to be rejected.\n  Mr. President, even though there are many reasons to oppose the \nnomination other than his performance of and advocacy of abortions, let \nme focus my remarks this afternoon on just how extreme--I emphasize the \nword ``extreme''--Dr. Foster's abortion policy views are. Polls by \nGallup and others have consistently found that over three-fourths of \nthe American people believe that abortion should be prohibited except \nto save the life of the mother after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. \nYet in the 1984 speech to Planned Parenthood of Eastern Tennessee, Dr. \nFoster expressed his strong opposition to restrictions on abortion \nafter 12 weeks, about 150,000 of which are performed annually. Dr. \nFoster said--and I quote--``We in the movement must work to prevent the \nerection of such barriers to late abortion access.'' That is after 12 \nweeks. In other words, Mr. President, Dr. Foster's view is that \nabortion should be legal, on demand, throughout pregnancy at any time. \nLet us explore for just a couple of moments what that means.\n  Last Friday Senator Gramm and I introduced S. 939, the partial-birth \nabortion ban of 1995. Our bill is companion legislation to a bill \ncalled H.R. 1833 reported favorably by the House Judiciary Subcommittee \nyesterday.\n  Mr. President, partial-birth abortions are first performed at 19 to \n20 weeks of gestation, very often much later.\n  To give my colleagues a clear understanding of how well developed an \nunborn child is that late in pregnancy, I have with me an anatomically \ncorrect model of a child--not a fetus, it is a child. It is a little \nchild. Its face is formed; its arms, toes, fingers, eyes--this is a \nchild.\n  Dr. Foster said he never performed a late-term abortion, and I have \nno reason to doubt that. I do not know. That is the statement that he \nmade, and I am not accusing him of performing late-term abortions, but \nhe is not blocking them either. So if you are not a murderer but you do \nnot stop a murder, I think you can draw the conclusion.\n  I brought some photographs to show that premature babies of this very \nage are the victims of these partial-birth abortions. In this \nphotograph, this is Faith Materowski. She was born at 23 weeks of \ngestation, just 3 weeks older than this little model would be, weighing \n1 pound and 3 ounces, Mr. President. This photograph was taken about a \nmonth after she was born, and I am happy to report that Faith survived. \nShe survived because her mother wanted her to live not die.\n  Let me explain, with the aid of a series of illustrations, exactly \nwhat is done to children about the same age in a partial-birth \nabortion. As I do, keep in mind that Dr. Martin Haskell, who by his own \nadmission has performed 700 of these partial-birth abortions as of \n1993--Lord knows how many after that--has told the American Medical \nNews, the official newspaper of the AMA, that the illustrations and \ndescriptions that I am about to present are accurate, technically \naccurate. In the first illustration, the abortionist----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH. I will not yield. I will be happy to yield when I finish \nand engage in questions and answers on your time.\n  In the first illustration, the abortionist, guided by ultrasound, \ngrabs the baby's leg with forceps.\n  As you see in illustration 2, the baby's leg is then pulled from the \nbirth canal. So you see the forceps now have grabbed the legs, pulling \nthe baby from the birth canal.\n  In the third picture, in this so-called partial-birth abortion \nprocess, the abortionist delivers the entire baby, with the exception \nof the head--the entire baby. So I ask my colleagues to think about \nthis, as to whether or not this is some impersonal thing or whether \nthis is a child now in the hands of the abortionist. It could be a \ndoctor, Mr. President. If it were a doctor who wanted to save that \nlife, the life would be saved; the baby would be born and the life \nwould be saved. The only difference is it is an abortionist.\n  In illustration No. 4, the abortionist takes a pair of scissors and \ninserts the scissors into the back of the skull and then opens the \nscissors up to make a gap in the back of the skull in order to insert a \ncatheter to literally suck the brains from the back of that child's \nhead.\n  That is what happens in the so-called partial-birth abortion. \nAnywhere from the 19th or 20th week up, this can happen. It is \nunspeakably brutal, and yet some say the child does not feel this. Take \na pair of scissors and slowly insert them into the skin in the back of \nyour neck a little way and see how that feels to you.\n  According to neurologist Paul Renalli, premature babies born at this \nstage may be more sensitive to painful stimulation than others. I would \nthink my colleagues would be repulsed by this and most Americans would \nbe appalled, sickened, and angered that such a brutal act could be \ncarried out against a defenseless child. This is a child, I say to my \ncolleagues. This is a child; a defenseless child.\n  I ask you, would you put your dog to sleep by inserting scissors in \nthe back of the neck and using a catheter to suck out its brains? Yet, \nunder the Supreme Court Roe versus Wade decision, the brutal partial-\nbirth abortion procedure that I just described is legal in all 50 \nStates--all 50 States. And, in fact, the National Abortion Federation \nhas written:\n\n       Don't apologize, this is a legal abortion procedure.\n\n  Exactly my point and exactly the connection with Dr. Foster. And \nbefore my colleagues stand up and accuse me of saying it, I am not \naccusing Dr. Foster of doing this. What I am accusing Dr. Foster of is \nignoring the fact that it is taking place and accepting the fact that \nby any means, any means legal--and this is legal--by any means legal, a \nlife can be taken. So lest my views get misrepresented on the floor of \nthis Senate, I am making it very clear.\n  So when Dr. Foster says he wants to prevent the erection of barriers \nto late-abortion access, he is tolerating and condoning this. That is a \nlate abortion, and he is tolerating it and allowing it to happen. Based \non Dr. Foster's own statement, one can only conclude that he would \noppose, and oppose strongly, the very bill that I have introduced. I \nhave not heard otherwise.\n  The grotesque and brutal partial-birth abortion procedure that I just \ndescribed and illustrated on the floor of the Senate today can and \nshould be outlawed. And if the Surgeon General of the United States, \nwhoever he or she may be, spoke out against it, it would [[Page S \n8863]] be outlawed, and that is the kind of Surgeon General that I \nwant.\n  The bill that Senator Gramm and I have introduced would outlaw it, \nand our bill amends title 18 of the United States Code so that:\n\n       Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, \n     knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills \n     a human fetus should be fined . . .\n\n  Not the woman, the doctor--called a doctor--the abortionist.\n  So, Mr. President, when Dr. Foster speaks of these barriers, he is \ntalking, in effect, about bills like mine, like the bill that would ban \npartial-birth abortions. He is providing, when he says a woman's right \nto choose, a woman's right to choose partial-birth abortions. This is \nwhat it means. Let us put some meaning to the words, because that is \nwhat it means.\n  Out of all of the controversy surrounding Joycelyn Elders, all of the \nunbelievable statements and the controversy that we endured during her \nall-too-long and lengthy tenure, I cannot understand why the President \nwould choose as his successor someone whose past record and policy \nviews on the pressing social questions of our time are so out of tune, \nso far out of sync, with the rest of the American people.\n  The Surgeon General should be someone that the American people have \nconfidence in, someone who would put the intense controversy of the \nElders years behind us. Yet, President Clinton apparently, without even \nreviewing carefully Dr. Foster's record, which places him, \nunfortunately, in this debate, did not do a good job of investigating \nhis past and even recklessly went ahead and made this nomination.\n  Mr. President, there are over 650,000 physicians in the United States \nof America--black, white, male, female, Asian, Hispanic, Indian. \nSurely, surely there is one out of 650,000 that could be brought to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate that would not have this kind of controversy \nand this kind of debate following the Elders reign.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Mikulski, a few moments ago said on \nthe floor that she could not understand why this whole thing was about \nabortion, why the debate was so focused on abortion. In the Washington \nPost this morning--I might answer the Senator from Maryland by saying \nthis--here is what President Clinton said:\n\n       Make no mistake about it, this was not a vote about the \n     right of a President to choose a Surgeon General. This was \n     really a vote about every American woman's right to choose.\n\n  That is why it is about abortion, because the President is making it \nabout abortion, because he wants this kind of thing to occur.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that when the votes are counted, it is \ngoing to be the same result as yesterday, and Dr. Foster will not be \nthe next Surgeon General.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield myself 1 minute, and then I will yield to my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. President, I am appalled and shocked that there would be this \nkind of display on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Certainly, Dr. Foster \nhas made it very clear, as Senator Mikulski explained to all of us, \nthat he does not support third trimester abortions, that he does not \nsupport abortions for sex selection, nor does he support illegal \nabortions.\n  I think it is really outrageous that guilt by association occurs on \nthe floor of the Senate. I think the American people deserve a debate \nwith dignity. I think Dr. Foster deserves a debate with dignity, and I \nhope that all of us can remember that.\n  Again, I remind you, Dr. Foster's nomination is in front of us \nbecause he is a man with a tremendous history of service--community \nservice--delivering more than 10,000 babies, and I think that is what \nwe should be debating today.\n  I yield my colleague from New Jersey 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and \nurge her to continue her quest to see that fairness is finally \ndelivered on this floor.\n I am astounded by what we have just seen. I assume that the pictures \nthat we saw reflect a woman's decision, that she chose to have that \nabortion. You can make it look as ugly as you want. But the fact is \nthat it is a medical procedure, and this woman chose to have it. This \nsame Senator--a distinguished Senator and a friend of mine--from New \nHampshire voted the other day and led the fight to take helmets off \nmotorcycle riders. They could be laying all over the road, and they \nwind up in a hospital as paraplegics and quadriplegics, and we pay for \nit. That is OK. But to permit a woman who, under the law, has a right \nto make a choice, no, no.\n\n  Here we are watching a small minority deciding how the behavior of \nthe majority ought to perform. This is an outrage. Yes, this is about \nabortion because the other side made it about abortion, instead of \ntaking this man with superb credentials, who did what he had to under \nhis oath as a physician and under his compassion as a human being. He \nobeyed the law and delivered excellent service. Over 10,000 babies \ndelivered. The Senator from New Hampshire wants to pick out a procedure \nthat was required and make that the subject of this discussion.\n  No, it is a narrow minority who says to the women across this country \nthat you have no right to choose, even though the law says so. In his \nvery statement, he said that. He said if we had a Surgeon General who \nspoke against it, then it would be OK with this Senator and those whom \nhe represents--Senator Gramm and the others.\n  This is an outrage. What we are witnessing here is the truth about \nthis issue. This has nothing to do with Dr. Foster. This has to do with \npolitics, raw politics. I appeal to the people across this country, if \nyou think you are being dealt with fairly, just look at what took \nplace: Decrying a law that is on the books and a physician for doing \nhis duty. We ought to get a couple of friends here with enough courage \nto stand up and say we are not going to take it anymore and we are \ngoing to vote on behalf of the women in this country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield my colleague from Illinois 4 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, everybody is talking about what the \nissue is here. I think there are a number of American people who think \nthat the only real issue is fairness. It is whether or not a minority \nof this body will stop this nomination, using the time-honored trick of \nthe filibuster in order to enforce an extreme agenda on the President \nof the United States through his nominee. It is just that simple.\n  The extreme agenda, I think, is pretty evident. I have never seen \nanything as horrific, as horrendous, as awful, as ugly and graphic as \nthe posters and the doll figure I saw on the floor a few minutes ago. \nIt is outrageous to bring something like that on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate to make whatever point. Whether you are for or against choice, \nto bring that kind of graphic depiction of ugliness on this floor, I \nthink, only serves the purpose of inflaming people around an issue that \nreally inflames and divides the American people, and that does go to \nthe heart of the opposition's extreme agenda here.\n  People who say the Supreme Court was wrong in terms of Roe versus \nWade are finding 9,000 ways to overturn it in subtle ways. People who \ndo not believe that a woman has a right to choose--by the way, \neverybody is entitled to their own view on that issue. American people \nare and will be divided. That is a profoundly divisive issue in our \nbody politic. But the question is: Why would that profoundly divisive \nissue be applied to Dr. Foster's nomination?\n  Here is a man who is not an abortionist. He is a women's doctor. He \nhas delivered tens of thousands of babies, and he has made the point \nthat he supports the laws in terms of a woman's right to choose, but \nthat is not his practice and never has been. Dr. Foster has played by \nthe rules, has promoted women's health over the years, and he has a \nstellar background.\n  I join my colleague from New Jersey in saying that this really is a \nnomination now that is wrapped up in games and politics. Indeed, I will \ngo as far as to say that Dr. Foster is a political hostage to \nextremism. That is the issue here--whether or not we are going to allow \nthat extremism to derail this [[Page S 8864]] nomination through use of \nthe filibuster, or whether we are going to allow this man to have a \nmajority vote of this body. Fifty-seven Members of this body, \nyesterday, voted to allow the nomination to come to a vote. That is \nmore than half. That is more than a majority. What it is not is enough \nto overcome the time-honored trick of the filibuster. It is continuing \nthat filibuster that is at the heart of the vote that will take place \nthis afternoon.\n  I urge my colleagues to strike a blow for fairness and say to the \nAmerican people that we are prepared to allow a majority to rule in the \nU.S. Senate, like it does on other matters--the budget, the \nappropriations, and all the other things we do. Let us say we are going \nto allow the majority vote to prevail regarding this nomination for the \nPresident's administration.\n  Dr. Foster was nominated by the President over 136 days ago. We have \nbeen sitting here in the U.S. Senate with all of the public issues we \nhave before us--violence and crime, the issues in the communities, \nAIDS, you can go down the list--and they have not been attended to. \nWhy? Because of the politics of abortion and politics of the \nPresidential campaign. I say let us free Dr. Foster and have his \nnomination vote take place today.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding. We are coming down to the final moments of the debate. We \nwill have our final vote here in a few minutes.\n  I would like simply to review the key issues. First of all, let me \naddress the issue of the cloture vote. To listen to our colleagues, it \nwould sound as if we never vote on cloture in the U.S. Senate. Yet, \nhardly a week goes by that we do not have a cloture vote. It is part of \nthe fabric of American democracy. It was part of the process making the \nSenate the deliberative body of Congress that George Washington \ndescribed to Thomas Jefferson when Jefferson came back from France. \nThomas Jefferson had been the American Minister to France while the \nConstitutional Convention was occurring.\n  Our colleagues talk about cloture votes and filibuster. Yet, since \n1968, 24 times we have had cloture votes on nominations, and nearly \nevery one of them occurring when we had Democratically controlled \nCongresses.\n  The way our system works is, if there is a determined minority, that \nminority has the right to speak in the U.S. Senate. There is, today, a \ndetermined minority. And to accommodate the Senate, an agreement was \nworked out so that the proponents of this nomination had not one vote, \nbut two. That was agreed to by unanimous consent. Any Member of the \nSenate could have objected. No one objected. So this is a process that \nwe chose and that every Member agreed to. This is a process that we all \nunderstand, and it is a process called ``democracy.'' It has served us \nwell in the past. It will serve us well today when we reject this \nnomination.\n  I remind my colleagues that there was a Democratic effort to stop the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice Rehnquist of the Supreme Court. That \nnomination went to a cloture vote. In that case, cloture was invoked. \nBut the point was somebody on the Democratic side of the aisle felt so \nstrongly about that nomination to one of the three most important \noffices in the land--the head of an entire branch of American \nGovernment--that they exercised their right. Many people did not like \nit, but that is how our system works. In that case, the process worked. \nWe invoked cloture. Judge Rehnquist was confirmed. And in this case it \nis going to work as well. We are not going to invoke cloture, and Dr. \nFoster is not going to be confirmed.\n  Now, let me address the issue of Dr. Foster's credentials, and let me \nmake it very clear that there is absolutely nothing in this debate that \nhas anything to do with anything other than his qualifications to hold \nthis office. There are two principal qualifications that our colleagues \ngo on and on about with Dr. Foster. No. 1, he was the department head \nat a medical school in America. That is true. It is also true that the \ndepartment he headed lost its accreditation while he was head of that \ndepartment. Was it his fault? Were there extenuating circumstances? \nWere there other factors involved? Certainly there were. There always \nare.\n But the bottom line is that he served as the department head of a \ndepartment that lost its accreditation.\n\n  The second argument given is that he established a program with a \nwonderful name, ``I Have a Future.'' That program's stated goal was to \nreduce teen pregnancy. Our colleagues make a big point that this \nprogram was given a Point of Light Award. It was given that award \nbecause of its objective, a noble and great objective, and one that we \nneed to promote all over America. But the bottom line is there were two \nobjective assessments of that program, and both of them were made after \nit was given this award. Both evaluations concluded exactly the same \nthing: This program did not in any statistically significant way reduce \nteen pregnancy among those who participated in the program.\n  I said it yesterday. I will say it again today. And every Member of \nthe Senate knows it. If we had set up a distinguished panel of \nphysicians to go out and look at qualifications of physicians in \nAmerica and to come up with a list of 1,000 physicians who were \neminently qualified to hold the position as America's first physician, \nSurgeon General, Dr. Foster's name would not have been on that list. I \ndo not think anybody here believes that Dr. Foster is qualified to be \nSurgeon General when considering his two major credentials: One being \nthe head of a department that lost its accreditation; the other being \nthe director of wonderful-sounding program with a noble objective \nwhich, according to two objective assessments, proved totally \nineffective in promoting those objectives.\n  Because it has been the focal point of the debate, as it should be, I \nam not going to get into again the problem of Dr. Foster's credibility. \nMaybe it was his fault, maybe it was the White House's fault, maybe it \nis failing memory, maybe it is simply a lack of understanding of the \npolitical process and how it works. But the bottom line is, on \nvirtually every issue that has been raised, there has been a problem of \ncredibility.\n  Finally, on the whole issue of abortion. I did not see the \npresentation that my dear colleague, Senator Smith, made about partial-\nbirth abortions. Maybe some people were offended by the presentation. \nBut I am offended that this is happening in America. I think people do \nhave different views on abortion, and I respect the opinion of people \nwho disagree with me.\n  But I think it is an extreme view when you take the view which Dr. \nFoster takes, in opposition to parental consent in cases involving \nabortion and minors. Polls show that is an extreme view; 80 percent of \nthe people in America think that parents ought to be notified when \nabortion is going to be performed on a minor. I think it is an extreme \nview when a child is in the process of being born, and its life is \nextinguished. I think it is an extreme view that when a lady is being \ntaken down the hallway toward the delivery room, that it is perfectly \nacceptable in America to make a left turn to perform an abortion. The \nAmerican people, by a margin of over 70 percent, think that is an \nextreme view.\n  Why filibuster? Why force a 60-percent vote? The answer to that is \nvery, very simple. A lot of us felt very strongly about Joycelyn \nElders. When I read the things that she had said about the Roman \nCatholic Church, when I read the her comments which made her sound more \npotentially successful as a radio talk show host than a Surgeon General \nof the United States, when I looked at how extreme her views were, I \ndid not think she ought to have that job.\n  But this was the President's first nomination for this position, and \nthere was no way of knowing in advance exactly what she would be like. \nI voted no; I opposed her nomination; I fought it; I wanted to defeat \nit, but I did not use the power that the minority has in the Senate, \nand that is the power to debate. Having made that mistake on Joycelyn \nElders, I and others were determined that we were not going to make \nthat mistake again.\n  I believe Dr. Foster is not qualified for this position. I believe \nthat there are real credibility problems concerning the facts that have \nbeen presented to the country and the Congress. And [[Page S \n8865]] finally, I believe that his views are radical and outside the \nmainstream of American thinking.\n  Yesterday, I quoted our President four times from his campaign, \ntalking about the values of our people, talking about family values, \ntalking about traditional values. I do not believe that Dr. Foster's \nviews match the President's 1992 campaign rhetoric.\n  I think one thing we have a right to expect Presidents to do once \nthey are elected is to put forth nominees whose views are consistent \nwith their campaign rhetoric. We have a right to expect that those \ncampaign views will be reflected in their nominees. Do not get me \nwrong. When people voted for Bill Clinton, they voted for more \nspending, more taxes, more regulation, more Government, and for the \nappointment of liberals. If they did not know it, they should have \nknown it. That is what democracy is about.\n  But they did not vote for the radicals that this President has \nappointed. This is an appointment where the views of this candidate are \noutside the mainstream of American thinking, and I believe we are \nmaking the right decision in saying no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished manager.\n  I do not know whether this debate is more about politics or more \nabout abortion or exactly what it is about. But I do not truly believe \nthis debate is about Dr. Henry Foster. There are two Henry Fosters: The \none that is depicted and portrayed by his opposition; and there is the \nreal Henry Foster, a man of deep compassion and certainly a man of \ngreat ability.\n  There have been a lot of articles written, a lot of stories on TV and \nradio and in newspapers, about who is winning in this Foster fight; \nwhether it is one of the candidates for the Republican nomination for \nPresident or the other candidate.\n  Mr. President, I can say the loser in this fight, if we do not get 60 \nvotes today, will be the American people. It will be the American \npeople who are going to be the great loser if we do not confirm this \nman.\n  He has stated time and time and time again his position on abortion \nis very, very simple: That they should be safe, that they should be \nlegal, and that they should be rare. That is his position on abortion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this splendid man as our next \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to support the nomination \nof Henry W. Foster Jr., M.D. to one of the most important health care \nposts in our Government, Surgeon General. As you know, the Surgeon \nGeneral is the national spokesperson to promote good health activities \nand to alert the nation regarding things that are harmful or \npotentially harmful. In May, Dr. Foster convinced the Labor and Human \nResources Committee that he was the right man for the job.\n  Today, I am here to explain to my colleagues why I know Dr. Foster is \nthe right person for that job. To reiterate, soon after I set out to \nlearn more about our nominee for Surgeon General, I realized that there \nare actually two Dr. Henry Fosters. One is the Dr. Foster created by \ninside-the-beltway groups using diversionary tactics to derail the \nnomination of a respected physician. The other is the Dr. Foster who \ngrew up in Pine Bluff, AR, attended University of Arkansas as the only \nAfrican-American in his class, served his country as a medical officer \nin the Air Force, and set up a practice in Tennessee where he trained \nhundreds of the nation's finest medical practitioners.\n  Mr. President, I am here to tell you that I am convinced that this \nsecond Dr. Foster is the real Dr. Foster. For those who doubt this and \nwant to see something tangible, I urge you to visit Nashville to see \nhis accomplishments, such as the doctors he trained, the day care \ncenters he created, and the individuals, young and old, he has \ndelivered into this world over his many years of practice.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention one of Dr. Foster's greatest \naccomplishments, his I Have a Future Program, a pioneering effort to \nreduce the number of teen pregnancies by improving teens' self-esteem. \nAs you may know, President George Bush named Dr. Foster's program as \none of American's Thousand Points of Light in 1991. President Bush's \nown Secretary of HHS, Dr. Louis Sullivan, has lauded Dr. Foster's \nnomination.\n  Let me also talk about what Dr. Foster's peers say about him. The \nAmerican Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the National Medical Association, the American College \nof Preventive Medicine, are just some of the professional organizations \nthat have come out in support of Dr. Foster.\n  Mr. President, in addition to letters from his peers, I have also \ngotten letters from other groups. One organization, the Council for \nHealth and Human Service Ministries of the United Church of Christ \nwrote:\n\n       We are people of faith, committed to promoting and \n     maintaining optimum health of all people. We believe that the \n     professional credentials and experiences of Dr. Foster are \n     impressive and provide sufficient evidence of his ability to \n     be the nation's spokesperson on matter of public health \n     policies and practices.\n\n  In sum, Mr. President, let me make these points about Dr. Foster:\n  He is a practicing physician, a scholar and academic administrator of \nnational stature, and a community leader.\n  Dr. Foster is a skilled communicator who emphasizes consensus-\nbuilding over confrontation.\n  Dr. Foster has bipartisan support.\n  Dr. Foster is one of the nation's leading experts on, and advocates \nfor, maternal and child health, and has developed and directed teen \npregnancy and drug-abuse prevention programs that bolster self-esteem \nand encourage personal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, let us look at the Dr. Foster from Tennessee, the man \nwho has done so much for people who others have ignored. Let us follow \nthe Labor and Human Resource Committee's lead and confirm Dr. Foster's \nnomination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was not going to take the floor back, \nbut I have to respond to some of the things done and said on this \nfloor. I feel very strongly that it is my responsibility as a U.S. \nSenator from the largest State in the Union to the say a couple of \nthings here.\n  No. 1, to my colleague from Texas, people in America want a fair \nPresident. This is not fair. To deny this man a vote is not fair--\nperiod. And then to keep bringing up Joycelyn Elders. I do not say \nabout my colleague that he is like Richard Nixon or he is like Herbert \nHoover. If I agree with him, I agree with him because it is him. I do \nnot say he is like someone else. So let us cut it out. If you want to \nfight a guy, fight it on fair terms.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire shows us pictures meant to divide \nthis country. He shows us pictures that should never be shown in front \nof the Senate pages who sit here. They should have been spared that. \nYou want to outlaw abortion? You want to make it a crime? You want to \nput women in jail for having them? You want to put doctors in jail? \nBring the legislation to the floor. I will debate with you toe to toe--\ntoe to toe. And I will win that battle because, thank you very much, \nthe women of America do not want Senators telling them how to handle \ntheir private lives.\n  I am always amazed that the very people who say get Government out of \nour lives want to put Government in the bedrooms of the women and men \nof this country.\n  You are out of the mainstream, and you are stopping this nomination \nwith a minority vote here. It is wrong to do that.\n  I want to end my remarks with a positive picture--and I wish I had \nit--of 10,000 little babies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I have 30 additional seconds?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield the additional time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. [[Page S 8866]] \n  If I had only known we were going to do this picture situation, I \nwould have tried to get the picture of thousands of new babies--10,000 \nbrought into the world by this physician who went into the Deep South, \nwhere no one would go, who turned around the infant mortality rate. Did \nyou ever see a picture of a baby who was born without prenatal care? I \nwill tell you about it. I happen to have one. I have two who were born \npremature with prenatal care. But I want to tell you, it is not a \npretty picture. They have tubes up their noses. They suffer. They \nstruggle. They get high bilirubin. They turn yellow. And I will never \nforget, before my baby was born prematurely, I remembered then \nPresident Kennedy had a baby that was born prematurely. It is not a \npretty sight.\n  He turned it around. He showed those pictures. Dr. Foster never \nperformed a late-term abortion that was not to save the life of the \nmother. That is on the record. It is an unfair thing to do to this man.\n  I urge my colleagues, in light of those pictures, to change your \nvote, show that you have a conscience, and stand up for what is right \nand just.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for up to \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nDr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.\n  The role of the Surgeon General is to be a public advocate--to \npersuade Americans to change their private behavior and lead healthier \nlives. That is why the credibility of the Surgeon General--his or her \nability to communicate with the American people--is vital to his \nsuccess in that job. The Surgeon General has to be able to connect with \nthe general public in a truly personal way.\n  To do this, the Surgeon General has to be sensitive to people's real \nconcerns. He cannot be someone who appears to shrug off important \nissues.\n  That is why Dr. Foster's record on the very important issue of \nsterilizations is so troubling.\n  What are the facts? The facts are that in the early 1970's, it was \nbecoming increasingly clear, to a broad public, to the medical \nprofession, that mentally retarded individuals needed special \nprotections--to prevent abuses of the practice of sterilization.\n  In 1970, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nissued the following statement of policy:\n\n       If an operation to accomplish sterilization is recommended \n     by the physician for medical indications, the recorded \n     opinion of a knowledgeable consultant should be obtained.\n\n  Four years later, in 1974, Dr. Foster wrote an article in which he \nsaid--and I quote: ``Recently, I have begun to use hysterectomy in \npatients with severe mental retardation.''\n  The operative words are ``recently'' and ``begun.''\n  ``I have recently begun''.\n  In a written inquiry, I asked Dr. Foster whether he had obtained the \nrecorded opinion of a consultant prior to performing those \nhysterectomies. His answer was--and I quote--``I do not believe I \nobtained the recorded opinion of a consultant.''\n  But he adds:\n\n       I believed that * * * the manner in which they were \n     performed was fully consistent with prevailing rules \n     governing informed consent.\n\n  Dr. Foster is now--and was then--a member of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists. But in response to my question, Dr. \nFoster said he believes that the policies of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists simply are not binding.\n  I have a problem with that. I think that the position of the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--their insistence on a \nrecorded opinion from a consultant--should not be dismissed so \ncavalierly. Indeed, the whole trend of history was moving toward \nprotecting the rights of the mentally retarded, and away from Dr. \nFoster's position, at the time he wrote that article.\n  Let me add a few more comments to put it into really historic \ncontext.\n  In 1972, a Federal district court--in the case of Wyatt versus \nStickney--had placed Alabama's institutions for the mentally ill and \nmentally retarded under sweeping and detailed court orders forbidding \nexperimental research and certain kinds of treatment without express \nand informed consent.\n  In June 1973, two girls--ages 12 and 14--were surgically sterilized \nin Montgomery, AL.\n  Without going into all the details, it was an absolutely shocking set \nof facts.\n  When the sterilizations came to light, there was immediate public \nreaction--and a move toward nationwide reform. By the end of that same \nmonth--June 1973--there was already a lawsuit filed. In the following \nmonth--July 1973--Senator Edward Kennedy held hearings on this \ncontroversy. The Secretary of HEW announced that new regulations on the \nuse of Federal funds for sterilizations would be published within \nweeks.\n  And the regulations were published. They sought to protect the rights \nof all persons--including the mentally retarded--with respect to \nfederally funded sterilizations.\n  These regulations never took effect, because in 1974 a Federal \ndistrict court found--in the case of Relf versus Weinberger--that HEW \nhad no authority to perform any nonconsensual--that is what we are \ntalking about, nonconsensual--sterilizations whatsoever.\n  On January 8, 1974--the very beginning of 1974--Federal District \nJudge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., issued an order that specified the \nprocedures that would have to be followed in cases of the sterilization \nof institutionalized mentally handicapped individuals. Judge Johnson \nrequired that any sterilization would have to be approved by the \ndirector of the institution, a review committee, and the court.\n  That was January 1974.\n  That tells us a little bit about what the climate was.\n  That was the moral and legal climate in which Dr. Foster was \njustifying and defending the practice of sterilizing mentally \nhandicapped women.\n  In the summer of that same year--months after the decision by Judge \nFrank Johnson, and a year after the Kennedy hearings--Dr. Foster made \nhis statement that he had ``recently * * * begun to use hysterectomy in \npatients with severe mental retardation.''\n  The physician--even more than the average citizen--owes what our \nDeclaration of Independence calls ``a decent respect to the opinions of \nmankind.'' That is way Dr. Foster's responses on the issue of \nsterilization gives cause to me for grave concern. They lead one to \nbelieve that Dr. Foster can be tone deaf to some very important issues.\n  It is one thing to have a controversial position on some issue. It is \nsomething else entirely when someone chooses to remain totally \nindifferent to the moral controversies of his time.\n  If you are going to be Surgeon General, you have to be able to reach \npeople. You have to be sensitive to them. You have to care about what \nis going in their hearts and their fundamental moral sensibilities.\n  Dr. Foster, as I have said on several different occasions, Mr. \nPresident, is a good man. He is a caring person. He is a loving human \nbeing. That is not the issue. I believe, based upon the hearings, on my \nown conversations with him, on his responses to my written questions, \nthat Dr. Foster simply cannot adequately perform this job; that he \ncannot use the job of the Surgeon General of the United States to its \nfullest capability; that he cannot use it as the bully pulpit that it \nshould be used as; that he cannot maximize the great potential that \noffice has.\n  That is why I will again today vote no on his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise reluctantly today to join the \ndebate on Dr. Henry Foster's nomination as Surgeon General. I am \nreluctant because this has gone on too long; there should not be such \nfierce opposition to a candidate so clearly qualified as Dr. Foster. \nHowever, the debate continues, and I feel it is important to point out \nhis qualifications, and thereby separate the germane issues from \ndistractions, wordplay, and rhetoric.\n  The facts of Dr. Foster's career speak for themselves. His work at \nMeharry Medical College, his service for a long list of organizations, \nincluding the March of Dimes Foundation and the [[Page S \n8867]] American Cancer Society, are evidence of his dedication and \nprofessionalism. His I Have a Future Program has helped young men and \nwomen leave housing projects and embark on field trips, jobs, and \ncollege educations. The program was aptly chosen as No. 404 of the \nThousand Points of Light. Who can deny that teaching job skills, self-\nesteem, communication skills, and counseling for at-risk youths is a \nlight in these troubled times? Who can question the values of a man who \nbuilds up a community, provides support for teenagers, and encourages \nfamily participation in crucial life decisions?\n  Dr. Foster was there for the teenagers of Nashville when their \ndecisions were anything but simple. Violence, pregnancy, drugs, and \npoverty are problems that faced these youths, and which face us here \ntoday. We have a chance to provide America with a Surgeon General who \nhas said that as the People's Doctor, he would try to ``replace a \nculture of hopelessness with one that gives young people a clear \npathway to healthy futures.'' We can debate endlessly, lamenting the \nlack of values in America and condemning violence, but when we prevent \nDr. Foster's nomination, we prevent him from continuing and expanding \nhis fight against today's problems.\n  Dr. Foster has used his position as a medical doctor and an educator \nto encourage abstinence and to give teenagers hope for the future, so \nthat they will take the responsible path. He has used his knowledge and \nhis expertise to bring adolescent health services to places where they \nare desperately needed. He has performed a function beyond the call of \na traditional physician. In his own words, his work ``involves the \nentire families and the total social matrix of the surrounding \ncommunity.''\n  In holding back this nomination, we hold back possible solutions to \nproblems which face all of us, problems which will not be solved \nwithout work like Dr. Foster's, problems which will not go away, and \nproblems which will not wait for political delays.\n  We must listen to the facts in this case. By now, we are all familiar \nwith Dr. Foster's outstanding achievements as a doctor, an educator, a \nscholar, and a community leader. We know that Dr. Foster has the \nsupport of the American Medical Association, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges, and hundreds of other \nrespected institutions and individuals. We cannot ignore the letters \nwhich pour in from informed organizations like these, all supporting \nDr. Foster, and all condemning the politicization of this issue. We \nshould look at Dr. Foster's numerous achievements, instead of creating \na smokescreen of accusations. We should confirm Dr. Foster, and allow \nhim to continue his hard work for at-risk teenagers, for families, for \neach and every one of us in this Chamber, and for this country.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nstatement of support for Dr. Henry Foster's nomination as Surgeon \nGeneral be printed in the Congressional Record. The statement was \npresented on May 26, 1995, at the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nvote on the nomination, and fully explains my reasons for supporting \nthis nominee.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n Statement by Senator Bill Frist on Dr. Henry W. Foster, Jr.--May 26, \n                                  1995\n\n       Last November, the people of Tennessee elected me to make \n     difficult decisions. And this has been a decision I've \n     struggled with. I know that thoughtful people honestly and \n     fundamentally differ on whether Hank Foster should be Surgeon \n     General.\n       What makes my statement different from those you have heard \n     today? I know Hank Foster. I know him as a fellow Tennessean. \n     I know him as a fellow physician and colleague, who worked 4 \n     miles from my office. We are both members of the Nashville \n     Academy of Medicine, on whose Ethics Board he has served. And \n     I know him as a fellow Nashvillian, who has done what few \n     physicians do--step out of the clinic into their community to \n     address the really tough problems in our society.\n       Since February 2, the day the President announced his \n     choice, I've listened carefully to every conceivable argument \n     for and against the nominee. And over the past 3 months, I've \n     done my very best to remain neutral--neither to blindly \n     endorse Hank Foster because he is a fellow Nashvillian, nor \n     to condemn him because of allegations drawn from the attics \n     of his past. I have waited until final testimony was \n     submitted just last Friday so that I could thoughtfully, and \n     carefully, consider every aspect, every ramification, of his \n     nomination. Several days ago, I again met with Hank Foster--\n     one-on-one, face-to-face--to specifically and directly ask \n     him about his plans as Surgeon General.\n       I asked him the tough questions. Would he be like his \n     predecessor, Dr. Elders? Would he allow himself to be used as \n     a political tool for an out-of-step President, who time and \n     time again has promoted radical agendas? Or would he \n     represent mainstream America and family values?\n       Dr. Foster told me, without hesitation, that his number one \n     goal was to reduce teen pregnancy--a problem that we as a \n     people have done a miserable job addressing. It's a problem \n     that literally threatens the very fabric of America. His \n     approach? He looked me straight in the eye, and said ``number \n     one, build self-esteem; number two, promote abstinence; and \n     number three, instill family values.''\n       He told me that the other main issues on his agenda would \n     include screening for breast cancer and prostatic cancer, \n     addressing the AIDS epidemic, and teenage smoking. Dr. Foster \n     stressed to me that he places primary emphasis on family, \n     that he understands the importance of leading by building a \n     consensus, and that he understands that his agenda as Surgeon \n     General\n      must appeal to, and be embraced by, mainstream America.\n       Madam Chairman, many have told me that this nomination is \n     no longer about Hank Foster, the man. They say it's about the \n     inept way in which the Administration has handled his \n     nomination. They say it's about the tardy and roundabout \n     manner in which information has been provided to this \n     Committee and to the American people. They say it's about a \n     radical social agenda that is beyond the bounds of mainstream \n     America and traditional values.\n       But, I don't buy it. I guess as a newcomer to this body, I \n     see it all very differently. I believe it is about Hank \n     Foster, the man--the man who had delivered thousands of \n     babies into this world; the man who has committed his life \n     not to making money, not to promoting himself, but to serving \n     others' needs; the man who has cared for and nursed to health \n     thousands of women; the man who in addition to the practice \n     of medicine, has courageously and unselfishly stepped out \n     into his community to give others a chance to step out of a \n     world of poverty; and the man who 4 days ago, looked me in \n     the eye and described a fundamental commitment to the \n     principles of self-esteem, personal responsibility, and \n     family values.\n       As I stated at the Committee hearings, it should not be our \n     purpose to search for every possible mistake or imperfection \n     in Hank Foster's life. The question before us is a much more \n     narrow one: does this man have the commitment, the \n     intelligence, the training, the honesty, and the integrity to \n     be the chief spokesman for Americans on matters concerning \n     public health? These are the issues that I've considered, and \n     I'm satisfied with what I've seen and heard.\n       Having known Hank Foster as a fellow Tennessean, having \n     heard his testimony, having had the opportunity to talk to \n     him extensively face-to-face, and having considered every \n     aspect of his nomination very carefully, I believe his \n     nomination should be referred out of Committee favorably and \n     brought before the U.S. Senate. And I also believe we should \n     move forward with this process. We've got a lot of important \n     business to attend to and the American people want this \n     Congress to press on.\n       Madam Chairman, I think it is also important to mention, as \n     I did in the Committee hearing, my belief that this \n     confirmation process is not the place or the time to revisit \n     our national policy on abortion. Americans of conscience will \n     remain deeply divided over this issue regardless of who is \n     appointed Surgeon General. It's important to remember that \n     the office of Surgeon General does not set social policy, nor \n     convey with it the right to vote on any legislation--whether \n     affecting abortion or otherwise. When this body confirmed Dr. \n     C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General, a staunch opponent of \n     abortion, that confirmation did not outlaw abortion. If this \n     body confirms Hank Foster, that confirmation won't condone \n     abortion.\n       No doubt, the unfortunate events that immediately followed \n     Hank Foster's nomination cast a shadow on his viability to be \n     Surgeon General. Conflicting information raised questions \n     about his credibility. I, too, was angered that the Clinton \n     Administration had badly mishandled yet another nomination by \n     failing to adequately prepare Dr. Foster--a physician who had \n     never had to face such aggressive public scrutiny.\n       Questions arose about Dr. Foster's ability as an \n     administrator, his involvement in 4 hysterectomies performed \n     25 years ago, and his knowledge of a study on black men \n     conducted over a 40 year period in rural Alabama. These \n     issues concerned many, and each and every one concerned me. \n     But I believe that Hank Foster's testimony, evidence \n     submitted to the Committee, and my own one-on-one interviews \n     with him, put to rest those concerns.\n       Dr. Foster, I feel, came through the hearing process with \n     his credibility and integrity intact, and with is \n     qualifications to be Surgeon General apparent. [[Page S \n     8868]] \n       In the end, when people ask me why I support Hank Foster's \n     nomination, I'll tell them simply because he's qualified to \n     carry out the duties of Surgeon General. I am confident that \n     he will perform his job well.\n       Finally, Madame Chairman, I ask my colleagues to consider \n     this nomination, not based on politics, but rather on \n     qualifications and ability. In the past, the Democrats have \n     so often brought politics into the equation--we all remember \n     the nominations of John Tower, Robert Bork and Clarence \n     Thomas. I wasn't here, but as a private citizen, I recall the \n     anger I felt and the disappointment in the process. Let us \n     not make the same mistakes. The American people are tired of \n     politics as usual--that was the message of November 8.\n       For that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to view this \n     candidate away from the distractions and the hype of \n     political expediency, and without regard to who nominated \n     him. Rather, look at his accomplishments, his qualifications, \n     his statements, his goals, and the testimonials of other who \n     know him.\n       And then--based on serious reflection--make your decisions.\n       I've done that, and I choose to support Dr. Henry Foster.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the concerns that have led me to oppose the \nnomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster, Jr., to be Surgeon General of the \nUnited States are not trivial. They are also not intended as a \ncriticism of the nominee personally. He is a fine individual and \ndeserves our respect.\n  However, in deciding whether to support a nominee, character cannot \nbe the only consideration. We must also examine the nominee's ability \nto serve the American people in the office to which he or she was \nnominated.\n  It is important to note that my decision to oppose the nomination of \nDr. Henry W. Foster was made after a great deal of thought and \nconsideration. I do not take lightly the responsibility of the Senate \nin confirming Presidential nominees. Nor do I take lightly the right of \nthe President to nominate individuals who share his philosophy. My own \nphilosophy, opinions or views have run contradictory to most of the \nnominees presented by this administration. However, I have opposed very \nfew of those nominees.\n  Mr. President, as I have noted, I have concerns about Dr. Foster. I \ndo not agree with him on a number of issues, including abortion. \nHowever my opposition on his confirmation is not based on differing \nopinions. I am opposing Dr. Foster's nomination because the many \nproblems surrounding his nomination are issues that will be divisive.\n  An individual can have many fine qualities and excellent experience \nand yet not be qualified to serve as a public official in the position \nof Surgeon General. That position, sometimes referred to as ``America's \nFamily Doctor,'' requires someone who also has the ability to bring \ngroups together to work toward resolving the health problems of this \nNation. To his credit, Dr. Foster has some fine qualities and \nexperience. I do not dispute that fact. However, the controversy \nsurrounding his nomination, the disclosure--or lack of disclosure--of \nthe number of abortions he has performed, as well as the questions \nsurrounding his knowledge of the Tuskegee syphilis study lessen his \nability to bring Americans together on the multitude of health issues \nour Nation faces.\n  Mr. President, the role of Surgeon General requires the ability to \nbring people together, not to be divisive. The controversy surrounding \nDr. Foster's nomination has diminished his ability to play the unifier.\n  In addition, I would add that I have received numerous letters from \nIdahoans expressing concerns and opposition to the confirmation of Dr. \nFoster.\n  Therefore, I have decided to vote ``no'' on the confirmation of Dr. \nHenry Foster for the office of Surgeon General for the United States.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, some today have presented Dr. Foster's \ncredentials and discussed his integrity. Others simply do not support \nthe candidate. We have heard the arguments. We should be ready to \nvote--to go on record, yes or no, whether we approve of this nominee.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, some in this body do not want a vote on \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster. The debate we are now engaged in is \nnot about the qualifications of the candidate for the job of Surgeon \nGeneral. This is about a political game.\n  Machiavelli would enjoy how the Nation's business is handled in \nWashington, D.C. today. Bipartisanship is a word easily tossed around, \nbut seldom practiced. The bottom line is how to prevail in the next \nelection, not how to solve this Nation's problems.\n  Do we really think the best way to find qualified candidates to serve \nthe United States Government is to pick apart their careers and their \ncharacters, groping for something that will justify a political end? Is \nthat what faces all those who wish to serve their country?\n   Ever since the President announced Dr. Foster as the Surgeon General \nnominee, the Nation has witnessed a non-stop exercise in abusive \npolitics.\n  For months Dr. Foster was attacked by those opposed to his profession \nand who questioned his integrity. Based on allegations by ideological \nfactions and media scrutiny, some called for the nomination to be \npulled before allowing Dr. Foster a chance to respond. That is not how \nthis body should consider Presidential nominations. Nominations should \nproceed in a fair manner, allowing candidates to fully present their \nstory.\n  We should debate those whose views differ from our own. That is \ncalled Democracy. But I do not believe every event in a person's life \nshould be held under a national microscope--especially when the person \nin question has no chance to respond. That is called persecution.\n  Fortunately, Dr. Foster finally received a fair hearing in the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee. He responded well to questions raised \nabout his background and proved to be an honest, caring and dedicated \nindividual.\n  After all that Dr. Foster and his family has endured in the past \nseveral months, does he not deserve a vote?\n  Dr. Foster has committed his life to helping others and promoting \npublic health. He is well respected by his professional peers and those \nwhose lives he has touched through community service. In short, this \ncandidate is qualified to serve as Surgeon General and deserves a final \ndecision.\n  The Labor Committee approved of Dr. Foster and passed his nomination. \nIt is now time for the full Senate to exercise its responsibility. I \nurge my colleagues to end this sad political spectacle and vote on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, yesterday I voted against limiting \ndebate on the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General of the \nUnited States. It is my intention to do so again today.\n  I will vote against cloture today because I am disappointed by the \nhandling of Dr. Foster's nomination and because I do not believe debate \nshould be limited before it begins. This is a misuse of the cloture \nmotion. Cloture should be a tool of last resort rather than a tactic \nemployed as soon as an issue hits the Senate floor.\n  In addition, I believe it is improper to raise a single issue and use \nit as the litmus test for the nomination of a Surgeon General. The \nPresident did that yesterday by stating that this vote was really a \nvote about abortion. I am deeply disappointed that the debate has come \nto this.\n  The Surgeon General serves an important role as the national \nspokesperson on matters of public health. Over the years we have seen \nindividuals serving in their capacity as Surgeon General make important \nstatements on the health effects of smoking, the spread of AIDS, and \nteenage pregnancy. This person often becomes a lightening rod for \ncontroversy.\n  In recent years, a number of individuals who have been nominated as \nSurgeon General have been controversial figures. Their nominations did \nnot pass the Senate without a full debate. Dr. Foster's nomination is \ncontroversial. Much of the initial information provided to the Senate \nwas misleading or inadequate. In addition, there are a number of issues \nthat have been raised relating to Dr. Foster's qualifications to serve \nas Surgeon General and I believe that both sides should have an \nopportunity to fully debate these issues.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe confirmation of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General of the \nPublic Health Service. In my view, it is time that the Senate put \npersonal agendas and Presidential primary politics aside.\n  It is time we let Dr. Foster get on with the important job he has \nbeen preparing for throughout his professional [[Page S 8869]] career: \nthe job of chief public health advocate for our country.\n  Based on the public hearings held by the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee and the very detailed questioning those hearings involved, I \nhave come to the conclusion that Dr. Foster is imminently qualified to \nserve as Surgeon General.\n  Just as Presidential politics should not define when and under what \nconditions the Senate conducts its business, neither should we in the \nSenate attempt to define, based on ideology alone, the boundaries of a \nSurgeon General's professional experiences.\n  We in the Senate need to focus on the real world we live in, not the \nworld we wish we lived in. The reality is that our Nation has \ndeplorably high rates of teen pregnancy, infant mortality, and poverty. \nToo many of our children are abused, troubled, hungry, and hopeless. \nChildhood violence and death due to suicide are increasing at alarming \nrates. Incidence of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are \nincreasing in every population in our country.\n  Statistics from my home State of New Mexico illustrate these facts in \ngraphic detail:\n  We have the third worst rate of births to unmarried teens in the \nnation: From 1985 to 1992, the number of births to unmarried teens grew \nfrom 41.6 to 60.1 births per 1,000 females age 15 to 19. That is an \nincrease of 44 percent over 7 years.\n  In 1991, 18,234 cases of child abuse were reported in New Mexico, an \nincrease of 21.4 percent from 1990.\n  More than 10 percent of New Mexico's children live in extreme \npoverty, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty level; \n27.2 percent of our children live in poverty, compared to the national \naverage of less than 20 percent.\n  Nearly 40 percent--4 out of 10--of our children live in families with \nincomes 150 percent of the poverty level or less.\n  Our teen violent death rate, though declining, was still hovering at \nmore than 70 deaths per 100,000 teens in 1992.\n  I could go on, but I believe I have made my point.\n  The real world is tough. The problems we face are tremendous. It will \ntake a person who has faced reality and dealt with the problems he has \nseen with compassion and commitment to find solutions to the enormous \npublic health challenges confronting our nation.\n  My impression is that Dr. Foster is such a person. His background as \na practicing physician, a scholar, and academic administrator, and an \nadvocate for poor children, combined with his proven ability to lead \nare evidence of his strength and compassion.\n  Dr. Foster has proven his commitment to public service and public \nhealth. He deserves to be judged by the Senate on his merits as a \nphysician and an educator. And he deserves the opportunity to serve his \ncountry as the next Surgeon General.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nthe confirmation of Henry Foster as Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  In making my decision to support Dr. Foster, I reflected upon many of \nthe comments on this nomination that I have received from constituents \nin my home State of Wisconsin. Most Wisconsinites wish that fewer women \nhad abortions, hope that fewer young women got pregnant unintendedly, \nand want sufficient access to comprehensive health care services for \nwomen and children.\n  Dr. Foster's capabilities and accomplishments in addressing women's \nand community health are noteworthy. He is a respected medical educator \nand president of Meharry Medical School. He is the past president of \nthe Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and has \nbeen a leader in addressing teenage pregnancy issues in Nashville, TN. \nLastly, by all accounts, he is a sincere, compassionate, and respected \ngynecologist who has delivered thousands of babies and seeks quality \nhealth care for women and their families.\n  All of us heard numerous opinions on the nomination of Dr. Foster. I \nhave received letters from practitioners, leading medical education \ndepartments, and professional associations, and have heard nothing from \nthe medical community which would impeach Dr. Foster's skills, \nabilities, and integrity. For example, when President Clinton nominated \nDr. Foster, Dr. Douglas Laube, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote the President in support of \nthat decision, and sent me a copy of his letter. Dr. Laube has \npersonally worked with Dr. Foster for 7 years, serving on a number of \nnational committees designed to develop the education of medical \nstudents and resident physicians in the United States. Dr. Laube writes \n``Dr. Foster's commitment to medical education nationally and his \nactivities in Tennessee underscore the efforts of an altruistic and \nwell-intentioned person.'' He continues, ``In my personal dealings with \nhim, and in my observations of his dealings with others, I can attest \nto his integrity, consistency, and dogged attention to detail. More \nimportantly, Dr. Foster is a physician who has spent his entire career \nattempting to better the life of others while serving as a role model \nfor countless medical students and resident physicians in training.''\n  With his profession behind him, how, then, has all this controversy \nover Dr. Foster arisen? In his 37 years as an obstetrician and \ngynecologist, despite his work to reduce teen pregnancy, sexually \ntransmitted disease and drug abuse, and his role in delivering more \nthan 10,000 babies, Dr. Foster has also performed some 39 abortions.\n  I do not believe that Dr. Foster should be penalized for acting under \nthe law. The legalization of abortion is an issue for Congress and the \ncourts, ultimately to be decided by the American people, and currently \nabortion is legal in this country. I have been very concerned that \nindividual Members are using this nomination to express their personal \nviews about abortion. The controversy over the number of abortions Dr. \nFoster performed, and his recollection of that number, is really a \nsmoke screen designed to attack and demean Dr. Foster and other health \ncare providers who are involved in providing comprehensive women's \nhealth care. The underlying message is that one can forget holding \npublic office as a physician if you provide health services to women \nthat includes abortion services.\n  As a practitioner, the decision to perform abortions is already risky \nenough. In January of this year, I joined my colleague, the Senator \nfrom California [Mrs. Boxer], in condemning violence at reproductive \nhealth clinics. I explained then that many of the doctors in my home \nState of Wisconsin have taken to wearing bullet proof vests to go to \nclinics to do their work. Are we now saying, that in addition to \nenduring the threats of stalking, bombings, and shootings, physicians \nlike Dr. Foster must also pay the public political price of ostracism \nand denouncement of professional credibility?\n  Despite the controversy surrounding his nomination, Dr. Foster \nconducted himself in the Labor and Human Resources Committee hearings \nin a manner which convinces me both of his skill as a communicator and \nhis compassion as a practitioner. I believe he was responsive to \nquestions asked of him, and that he clearly explained his practice \nrecord including his tenure and involvement at Meharry in Nashville, at \nTuskegee in Alabama, and now on sabbatical at the Association of \nAcademic Health Centers in Washington, DC.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I have evaluated the entire body of Dr. \nFoster's record, and I believe him to be well qualified for this \nposition. I also generally believe that the President is entitled to \nselect key members of his administration and due deference should be \npaid to his choice, where the individual is qualified to serve. I will \ncast my vote to confirm Dr. Foster, and I admire throughout all the \ncontroversy his continued commitment and desire to serve our country in \nthis capacity.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Dr. Henry Foster \nfor the post of Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n  Since his nomination several months ago, Dr. Foster's public and \nprivate history has been subjected to an exceptional level of public \nscrutiny, and has become a pawn in an unfair political game. I believe \nit is a compliment to Dr. Foster's character and achievements, that \nwhen given the opportunity to answer his critics, a majority of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee voted to forward his nomination to \nthe full Senate. [[Page S 8870]] \n  Mr. President, after reviewing the testimony presented at Dr. \nFoster's hearing and examining his credentials and accomplishments, I \nstrongly believe that Henry Foster possesses the skills and experience \nnecessary to address the many public health challenges that face our \nNation.\n  During his 38 years as a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist, Dr. \nFoster has received national recognition as a scholar, academic \nadministrator, and advocate for maternal and child health. He has \ndevoted much of his career to educating medical practitioners at \nMeharry Medical College--serving as a professor, department chairman, \ndean of medicine, and president. As a practicing physician and \neducator, Dr. Foster chose to work with low-income families and \nchildren who might not otherwise have access to health care.\n  Dr. Foster was a pioneer in the movement to introduce the concept of \nresponsibility to at-risk youth. This concept has received a lot of \nattention in Congress lately. In 1988, Dr. Foster founded the highly \nsuccessful I Have a Future Program devoted to preventing teen pregnancy \nand drug abuse. Unlike teen pregnancy prevention efforts which focus on \ncontraception, the I Have a Future Program concentrates on improving \nself-esteem, cultivating a sense of optimism in the lives of \ndisadvantaged young people, and providing incentives to delay sexual \nactivity and childbearing. ``I Have a Future'' has won wide recognition \nfrom many sources, including the American Medical Association, and was \ndesignated as one of America's Thousand Points of Light by President \nBush in 1991.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the vote on Dr. Foster's nomination has \nreally come down to a vote on abortion. An individual's beliefs about \nreproductive choice, or the number of abortions performed during the \ncourse of a medical career, should not be a litmus-test for a nominee \nto the Surgeon General post. Through his delivery and care of over \n10,000 children, commitment to research and education, promotion of \nhealthy lifestyles, and efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies, Dr. \nFoster has proven his dedication to improving the health of all \nAmericans.\n  Dr. Foster has an outstanding private, public, and professional \nrecord. He is uniquely qualified to lead our Nation as an advocate for \nhealthy and responsible lifestyles. Mr. President, this country has \nbeen without a Surgeon General for over 6 months and we now have the \nopportunity to confirm a man who will bring both experience and \nenthusiasm to our efforts to combat public health crises such as infant \nmortality, substance abuse, sexually-transmitted diseases, teen \npregnancy, HIV infection, and others. Unfortunately, it appears that \nthe will of a small minority will block a fair and democratic up-or-\ndown vote on Dr. Foster's nomination.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Dr. Foster deserves more than a \npolitically motivated procedural vote. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture and support Dr. Foster's nomination to the post of \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, much has already been said on the \nSenate floor about why Dr. Henry Foster is unfit to serve as Surgeon \nGeneral. Yesterday, I voted against the petition to invoke cloture on \ndebate concerning Dr. Foster's nomination. As far as I am concerned, \nnothing has happened since yesterday to cause me to change my opinion \nabout Dr. Foster's qualifications to serve as Surgeon General. He was \nthe wrong man for the job yesterday, and he is the wrong man for the \njob today.\n  Many have testified as to their personal knowledge that Dr. Foster is \na fine man--a nice man. I have no reason to disagree with that \nassessment. Despite those testimonials, many--myself included--do not \nbelieve that we are conducting a congeniality contest to fill the \nvacancy created by Dr. Elders' forced resignation. In rushing to fill \nthe position, the Clinton administration failed--once again--to do \ntheir homework and thoroughly investigate a nominee's qualifications \nfor the job for which he is nominated. The saga of Dr. Foster is yet \nanother in a long string of failed efforts by the White House to send \nto the Senate nominees who are prepared to fully disclose important \ninformation about their background--information essential for the \nSenate to exercise its constitutional duty to advise and consent on \nPresidential nominations.\n  After 2\\1/2\\ years in office, I would think that the White House \nstaff would take more seriously their responsibility toward the Senate \nand toward administration nominees. Time after time, we in the Senate \nare subjected to unqualified nominees from the White House gang that \ncan't shoot straight. How much longer will our Nation continue to \ntolerate this sort of negligence in office?\n  Yesterday, 43 Senators sent a clear message to the Clinton \nadministration that we cannot support a nominee whose credibility is in \nserious doubt as a result of numerous inconsistencies in statements by \nDr. Foster and the White House. Beginning on February 2 when the \nPresident nominated Dr. Foster, a steady stream of inaccuracies were \nuncovered concerning crucial details about his professional medical \nbackground. Either Dr. Foster has a selective memory disability or the \nWhite House early on concluded that the full truth about Dr. Foster \nwould sink his chances in the Senate.\n  After hastily confirming other Clinton nominees like Ron Brown and \nHenry Cisneros, both of whom have serious ethical and possibly even \ncriminal misconduct charges outstanding against them, it is \nincomprehensible that the White House would not more carefully screen \nits nominees. Mr. President, let us not forget that President Clinton \noriginally promised that his administration would be the most ethical \nin American history. It is remarkable how far President Clinton has \nfallen from the mark which he set for his administration.\n  I will not recount the long list of inconsistencies in Dr. Foster's \nrecord. Suffice it to say, that any nominee with such a tainted record \nbefore the Senate is de facto unqualified to hold high public office in \nthis Nation. President Clinton should never have nominated Dr. Foster \nand when learning of the many inaccuracies in information provided to \nthe Senate, President Clinton should have withdrawn the nomination.\n  Many months have passed while the administration attempted to \nrehabilitate Dr. Foster's reputation for veracity. However, nothing \nwill change the fact that Dr. Foster and the White House consistently \nprovided the Senate with false information. I cannot in good conscience \nsupport such a nominee.\n  Moreover, I have begun to think that we no longer need a Surgeon \nGeneral. Many of the responsibilities of this Office could easily be \nfulfilled by others in the Department of Health and Human Services. \nSavings from elimination of the Surgeon General's Office could be \ncontributed toward deficit reduction. With the total mishandling of the \nFoster nomination, President Clinton has demonstrated better than any \nof his predecessors the irrelevancy of the Office of Surgeon General.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster as surgeon general of the United States.\n  Let me begin by stating that I am unequivocally opposed to confirming \nDr. Foster for this post.\n  I have been concerned about this nomination from the time it was \nannounced. We are all well aware of the conflicting reports which came \nout of the White House about Dr. Foster's background. I do not think I \nneed to go into the confusion created by the continually changing \nreports about the number of abortions which the doctor has performed. \nBut those inconsistencies quickly cast a shadow over the nomination as \nto whether the administration had done its job of properly \ninvestigating a potential nominee.\n  While I do not believe Dr. Foster should be held responsible for the \nblunderings of the White House staff, the situation raised doubts about \nhis forthrightness which have, in my mind, never been resolved.\n  One of the most glaring examples of this lack of candidness involved \nthe Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which black men with the disease went \nuntreated as part of a study to examine the long-term effects of \nsyphilis. While Dr. Foster claims he had no knowledge of the study \nprior to 1972, Public Health Service records indicate the Macon County \nMedical Society, of which Dr. Foster was vice-president, [[Page S \n8871]] and later president, knew of the study as early as 1969.\n  We have received conflicting reports about whether or not Dr. Foster \nattended the meeting in which the society agreed to cooperate with the \nPHS in the study. Even if he did not attend, documents from PHS \nofficials indicate further efforts were made to share information on \nthe study with all the members of the Macon County Medical Society. I \nsimply do not see how Dr. Foster, as the vice-president of a 10-member \nsociety, could have completely avoided any knowledge of this study \nwhile so many efforts were being made to keep the society fully \ninformed on this matter.\n  But let us not focus entirely on the past. What about the future? \nWhat kind of role would Dr. Foster play as surgeon general? He has \nstressed his concern about the rate of teenage pregnancy in this \ncountry. Surely, this is a concern which all of us share. Illegitimacy, \nespecially among teens, is at a crisis level in the United States. \nEqually important, however, is the manner in which this issue would be \naddressed if Dr. Foster were confirmed.\n  The basis of Dr. Foster's efforts to reduce teen pregnancy may be \nseen in the ``I Have a Future'' program. From my knowledge of the \nprogram, it leans toward the attitude that, ``Kids will be kids.'' It \nassumes that when it comes to sex, we must teach children to be careful \nrather than responsible. I could not possibly disagree more with this \nview. Yes, children must be allowed to make some decisions for \nthemselves. But we, as adults and parents, have a responsibility to \ninstill strong values in today's youth.\n  Dr. Foster's ``I Have a Future'' program failed to provide such \nguidance. Teaching young people about sex, without stressing the \nimportance of abstinence, at best, gives young people an incomplete \nmessage. At worst, it actually encourages the kind of behavior which we \nshould be trying to discourage.\n  Mr. President, we are all well aware of the controversy which has \nsurrounded the Office of the Surgeon General in recent years. The next \nsurgeon general must be able to repair the damage which has been done \nto that position. The focus must be shifted from the personality of the \noffice holder to the important health issues which face our Nation.\n  While I would not question Dr. Foster's level of concern about the \nissues he embraces, I do not believe he would be able to achieve this \ngoal. For this reason, I will oppose Dr. Foster's nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes and 10 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. And how much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes \n17 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 3 \nminutes.\n  As we close the debate today on the nomination of Dr. Foster, I would \nlike to make just a few further comments about the process.\n  I think it has been a good debate the last 2 days. Prior to that \ntime, the Labor and Human Resources Committee spent a considerable \namount of time focusing on the substantive issues and raising \nsubstantive questions regarding this nomination.\n  Some, including a majority of the committee, were satisfied with the \nanswers that Dr. Foster gave, and the vote was 9 to 7 to report him \nfavorably from committee. Others, including myself, were not.\n  With respect to the process in the Chamber, the majority leader had a \nnumber of options, including the option of not bringing up the \nnomination of Dr. Foster at all. I have always believed we should have \nan up-or-down vote on nominations. Nevertheless, the course that was \nchosen by the majority leader is one that is a perfectly legitimate \noption, well within the rules of the Senate. These are rules that have \nbeen used frequently in the past by Members on both sides of the \naisle--as has been pointed out in the course of this debate.\n  The majority leader has made this debate and these votes possible in \nless than 1 month after the nomination was reported from the committee.\n  There is nothing that would have made this process pleasant for any \nof us, most of all Dr. Foster. We may regret how we handle confirmation \nprocesses and nominations for members of a President's Cabinet and \nagency heads. It is not an easy process, and it has become, I think, \nincreasingly a grueling one.\n  In this case, I believe it has been handled in a way which is well \nwithin the parameters of appropriate conduct. There are those who have \nquestioned that, but I think there has been an opportunity to air \nstrong feelings on both sides in ways that have fit the rules and the \nprocedures of the Senate. I am not sure, Mr. President, that we can ask \nfor more than that. It has been my own belief that Dr. Foster has \nanswered successfully and well the questions that were put before him \nin the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I will yield myself 1 more minute.\n  And those were important and substantive questions. For myself, I do \nnot believe he is the person to be a successful Surgeon General of the \nUnited States at this time and that is why I have opposed his \nconfirmation. Nevertheless, I feel strongly that the nomination has \nbeen debated and handled fairly within the scope of legitimate \nprocedures of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of cloture, as \nI believe it is the right of the President to have an opportunity to \nhave a vote up or down on a very fine man who is willing to dedicate \nhis time to public service, who has an unblemished career of dedication \nto those people who need help, those who are economically \ndisadvantaged, and those who have not seen the advantages that have \nbeen brought to so many others.\n  It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this situation because \nthere is no question that this man was picked because he would not \n``Raise the specter of abortion,'' because his record, first of all, of \nbeing an ob/gyn doctor who only performed 39, 40, if you want to count \nanother, abortions in 38 years is certainly not of one who is out \nseeking to make a career of abortions, by any stretch of the \nimagination.\n  In addition to that, by serving the poor and starting his program I \nHave a Future, he set an example we must replicate around this country \nof how we can get the young people in our schools to look towards the \nfuture with hope, to understand that teenage pregnancy is a bad \nsituation and that he had all those kinds of rules that he followed in \nrespect to that, teaching abstinence, of teaching parental guidance \nwhen possible, things that I do not think anyone disagrees with. It is \ntrue that the study was marred by utilization of statistics, but that \ndoes not in any way diminish the importance of the message he was \ngiving to those young people.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues what this vote is \nabout. We are here to consider whether or not we will limit debate on \nthis nomination, whether we not allow a minority of this Chamber to \ntake this nominee hostage.\n  We are going to vote now, not on whether Dr. Henry Foster is \nqualified for the job of Surgeon General--which I believe he is--but on \nwhether we will allow the President's nominee the courtesy, the due \nprocess, of an up or down vote on his nomination.\n  What reason could we possibly have not to vote? Whose interests are \nserved by allowing a minority of Senators to deny a presidential \nnominee a confirmation vote?\n  The charges against Dr. Foster that we heard yesterday and today are \njust that--charges. They are allegations, not fact. During the \ncommittee process I spent hours and hours familiarizing myself with Dr. \nFoster's record and the specifics of his critics' charges. I became \nconvinced of several facts:\n  Henry Foster did not learn of the Tuskegee experiments in 1969 at the \n[[Page S 8872]] briefing given by public health officials. Not only is \nhe documented as attending at a complicated Caesarean section birth \nshortly after the meeting started, but I believe the doctors who were \nat that meeting were not given the full story. Foster did not know \nanything about the denial of treatment for these men.\n  In fact, no one did, because even the doctors at the meeting were not \ntold about it. According to the FBI, the public health officials were \nalready covering their tracks and when they briefed these six or eight \ndoctors they did not tell them the truth about the experiment. How \ncould they have?\n  Certainly someone given the facts would have spoken out publicly and \nhalted the 40-year-long project.\n  Foster did not know because nobody knew. Decades later, we cannot \nprove the content of the meeting because the minutes, trip report and \nfile have long ago disappeared from the CDC archives as the officials \ntried to cover their tracks.\n  Dr. Foster has had a distinguished medical career, treating patients \nwithin the medical norms of his time and even advancing new and better \ntreatments in many cases. I hope my colleagues will resist the \ntemptation to judge treatments given decades ago--like the \nsterilizations of severely mentally impaired women--by the medicine of \ntoday.\n  Then as well as now, Dr. Foster has enjoyed the admiration and \nacclamation of his peers, and he has been supported in this nomination \nby every medical group that I can think of, ranging from the AMA, not \nknown for its liberalism, to the American College of OB/GYNs to the \nAmerican Association of Medical Colleges.\n  It is undeniably true that the administration did not serve Henry \nFoster's nomination well in its characterization of his record on \nabortion. Ever since they misinformed Senator Kassebaum's office about \nthe number of procedures he had performed back in January, there has \nbeen confusion in the numbers game.\n  But after he had the opportunity to review his patients' medical \nrecords, Dr. Foster gave us a number; he is the physician of record for \n39 surgical procedures since 1973. That number has not changed.\n  I can understand why he did not know off the top of his head, because \nI would be hard pressed to give an accurate count of the votes I have \ntaken on a particular issue over the past 20 years. I might volunteer \nan estimate, but I would certainly have to do research to verify the \nnumber.\n  Some have implied that we should not vote on Henry Foster's \nnomination because he was once--once in a 30-year career--charged with \nmedical malpractice. The charges were dropped. The case was not \nadjudicated. Yes, the allegation of improper conduct was made, but it \nwas not substantiated.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that we have a similar situation \nhere and now with this nomination. There is no substance to the charges \nagainst this good man, this talented and hard-working doctor.\n  Let us not let ideology and politics get in the way of fairness. We \nhave a collective responsibility to vote, even on controversial \nnominees. I do hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Dr. \nFoster's nomination, but at the very least I believe he deserves an up \nor down vote. Let us not deny him that. Please join me in voting for \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I spoke yesterday on this nomination, but I wish to \nemphasize again today my strong support for this nominee and my strong \nhope that this very fine American will be given a chance to be voted \non, yes or no. I think it is regrettable that there are those who cast \ntheir votes against this man, who never even bothered to talk to him, \nnever met him, did not participate in the hearings. I would invite my \ncolleagues in the short time that remains to talk to their colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Dr. Frist. The rest of us talk about Dr. Foster. \nAlthough some of us met him and spent time with him, it has been just \nsince February. Dr. Frist, our new colleague from Tennessee, has not \nonly known him but worked with him. I would invite my colleagues to \nread his comments in the Senate Labor Committee hearings, just prior to \nthe favorable vote coming out of that committee.\n  Some of us talk at least from some experience, having spent some time \nwith him, but here is someone who actually worked with him, knows him \nfrom his State, knows people he has worked with. You can listen to \nspeeches by those who oppose him, never met him, never sat down with \nhim, in fact in some cases within hours after his name was sent up \nannounced they were against him. That is almost unheard of. I respect \nthose who let the hearing process go forward, gave him a chance to \nexpress his views, listened to him, and then said they were against \nhim. But to never meet the man, never give him the benefit of a \nhearing, even a personal one, and then decide that he did not deserve \nto be voted on by this body, I think is a sad moment in this Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chair. I thank my colleague.\n  I want to thank Senator Kassebaum for having conducted fair hearings \nand allowing the process to move forward. I hope that today's vote is \none again of fairness.\n  A filibuster on nominations has only occurred 24 times. Twenty-two of \nthose times in this body, the body has said the nomination deserves an \nup-or-down vote; two of those other times they were nominations made by \nDemocratic Presidents and defeated by Republican filibusters.\n  I hope that fairness prevails as it has 22 times in the past and that \nthis Senate votes today to allow this nomination to come forward so we \ncan finally vote up or down on the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster. He \ndeserves that vote, and he deserves our confidence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, no matter how they have tried to distort \nand misrepresent the record of Dr. Foster, he is an outstanding \nphysician, selected by the Institute of Medicine,\n selected to be on the governing board of the most prestigious board in \nthe United States of America for a doctor, outstandingly well \nqualified.\n\n  On the one hand you have the sense of hope, the belief in the young \npeople of this country, someone that really wants to give something \nback to this country for all that it has done for him. And on the other \nside you have gross distortions, misrepresentations, and negativism. \nThat is what we have seen during the course of this debate. And the \nopposition is basically as a result of Presidential politics.\n  I say again, let us leave Presidential politics in Iowa and in the \nother primaries, and let us get on and give this outstanding individual \nthe fair vote that he deserves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas controls 10 minutes 20 seconds.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand the time allocated to this side has been \nexpired. So, I will use my leader time to accommodate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an important moment. The vote we \nare about to cast will affect more than one man or one position. It \nwill help dictate the way this Senate discharges one of its most \nimportant duties. And I ask each of my colleagues to think about that \nas we cast our vote. Each of us has been afforded the right to make our \ncase to the American public. That is how we got here. We cannot deny \nthis afternoon the same right to a man who is clearly qualified to be \nthe next Surgeon General.\n  The Surgeon General has been rightly called America's family doctor. \nAnd in that capacity he or she is called upon to grapple with some of \nthe most [[Page S 8873]] difficult problems of our day; problems like \nAIDS, problems like teen pregnancy, problems like substance abuse and \nbreast cancer, problems that are devastating to the American people and \nto families all over this country.\n  This Senate has talked too little about these problems during the \ncourse of the last 5 hours. Instead of focusing on America's future, \nmany Members of this Senate have chosen to focus on the past and, \nfrankly, distorting it. That is regrettable. The distinguished majority \nleader said yesterday that this is not such an unusual occurrence. \nTwenty-six times in the last 27 years, he said, nominees have been \ndenied confirmation by filibuster.\n  Well, just moments ago I heard the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nset the record straight on that issue. Senator Harkin--as others have \nindicated on several occasions already during this debate--has \nattempted to correct the record on this and so many other matters that \nhave been misreported or on which only half the facts were presented. \nThe fact is that on every occasion during the 27 years Senator Dole \ncited, when it was a Republican nominee, that nominee ultimately was \napproved with bipartisan support. Two nominees were prevented from \nbeing confirmed by a filibuster, and both were Democrats--Abe Fortas, \nwho was nominated by President Johnson to sit on the Supreme Court, and \nSam Brown, who was nominated by President Clinton for the rank of \nAmbassador. So the only filibusters that have prevented nominees from \nreceiving a fair vote were Republican filibusters. Let us be clear \nabout that.\n  So the question before us today is not whether Henry Foster is \nqualified to be Surgeon General. That is the question we will face \nshould we take the next step forward. Mr. President, the question we \nface this afternoon with this vote before us now is one of fairness. \nAnd the American people have made themselves abundantly clear on the \nquestion of fairness. The majority of people have said in poll after \npoll, Henry Foster deserves a vote. And the majority of this body \nagrees with that sentiment.\n  Are we going to confront the health problems that are devastating \nAmerica's families and give Dr. Foster the opportunity to combat those \nproblems as Surgeon General? Will we do that? Or are we going to allow \npartisan Presidential politics to stifle that debate?\n  The question we face right here, right now, is simply that. It is a \nquestion of fairness. What message are we sending to Dr. Foster, to the \nAmerican people who believed in his right to a fair vote? What message \nare we sending to the people who look up to Dr. Foster as a role model \nand to all the Americans who need the services of a qualified Surgeon \nGeneral today if we refuse to extend to Dr. Foster the opportunity \ngiven every one of his predecessors? Mr. President, the issue this \nafternoon is simply one of fairness.\n  What is really being judged here, unfortunately, is not Dr. Henry \nFoster. For 6 months, Dr. Foster has been subjected to intense scrutiny \nfrom the Labor Committee, from the media, and from the American people. \nAnd he has passed every test. The only test he did not pass was the \nlitmus test of the far right. What is being judged here is the Senate \nitself and the way the Senate deals with those who come before us to \noffer their public service.\n  Henry Foster is an extraordinary physician and leader. If this were \nnot an election cycle, I have no doubt that he would be Surgeon General \nalready, that this Senate would have confirmed him overwhelmingly long \nago. Henry Foster is a selfless man who wants to serve his country and \nis being wasted for the selfish political ambitions of a few. If we \nprevent him from receiving a fair vote, we will make it even more \ndifficult to attract good, qualified people to public service. And this \nbody, the U.S. Senate, will be judged harshly.\n  Mr. President, I close with this thought: It is the position of this \nSenator that the process we have just seen is clearly wrong. It is \nwrong for the United States and it must be stopped. The business of \ninterest groups fanning out through the country, digging up dirt on a \nnominee, the business of leaks, of confidential documents put out to \nmembers of the press, the idea that absolutely anything goes that is \nnecessary to stop a nominee, this whole process must end. We in the \nSenate have the power to encourage that process or the power to stop \nit. We have that power by the vote we are about to cast.\n  Mr. President, those are not my words. They belong to a former \ncolleague, Senator John Danforth. Senator Danforth issued that eloquent \nplea nearly 4 years ago in the defense of Clarence Thomas' right to a \nvote on his nomination to sit on the Supreme Court. Justice Thomas \nreceived that vote. He received that vote with the backing of some of \nthe very same people who now would deny that vote to Dr. Foster. And I \nurge Members, in particular today on this nomination, to put politics \naside just for the moment and allow Dr. Foster's nomination to move \nforward. It is a question of fairness, Mr. President. And the answer--\nwell, the answer is in our hands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The majority controls 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I said yesterday, I would like to begin with just a few \nfacts, facts we sometimes are not using in debate or are not reported \nby the media. Let me again say, because I did not read it anywhere and \ndid not hear it on television--maybe it was on radio: During these 2\\1/\n2\\ years in office, President Clinton has submitted 251 names to the \nSenate for confirmation of civilian positions. Of these 251, 115 have \nbeen confirmed, 1 withdrawn and none defeated. The rest are in the \nconfirmation pipeline.\n  Let us get the record clear right up front. You talk about fairness. \nThat is 251, and not one defeated. And, second, I heard about a \nfilibuster. I do not know of any filibuster going on. If so, I missed \nit. By unanimous consent we agreed to this procedure. I think it is a \ngood one. We are giving Dr. Foster the same thing we gave Chief Justice \nRehnquist back in 1986 when I had to file cloture because the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts would not let it come to a vote.\n  So Dr. Foster's nomination was reported out of the Labor Committee on \nMay 26. We began this debate on June 21, and during that period there \nhas been a 7- or 8-day recess. So Dr. Foster has been treated fairly. \nThe Labor Committee has acted promptly and his nomination has been \nplaced before the full Senate for debate and a vote.\n  Again, as I said yesterday, I have always felt that the President \nshould have a right to his nominees, but there may be exceptions from \ntime to time, and I have voted against nominees from time to time--not \nvery often. I believe the record will show that we have cooperated in \nnearly every case; in fact, even helped the President with some of the \nnominations which might have been in trouble without assistance from \nthis side of the aisle.\n  There is plenty of precedent for rejecting a nomination on a cloture \nvote. Again, as I said, I will put in the Record for everyone to see \nthat there were 24 nominations, including the nomination of William \nRehnquist to be Chief Justice, which had to face cloture vote hurdles.\n  So overnight, I have done a little research on the Rehnquist \nnomination, and I learned that 19 of my Democratic colleagues who are \nstill in the Senate today voted against invoking cloture on this \nnomination: Senators Baucus, Biden, Bradley, Byrd, Dodd, Exon, Glenn, \nHarkin, Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Levin, Moynihan, \nPryor, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, and Simon, and also then Senator Albert \nGore. Now, certainly, he would not be unfair, but he was, according to \nall the rhetoric I heard coming from the other side.\n  In fact, I filed a cloture motion on the Rehnquist nomination because \nmy colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, was apparently \nunwilling to end debate. Do not take my word for it, just take a look \nat page 23336 of the Congressional Record for September 15, 1986. \nSenator Kennedy also urged his colleagues to follow the Abe Fortas \nexample: Defeat cloture so the Rehnquist nomination will be withdrawn. \nThat can be found on page 22805 of the Congressional Record of \nSeptember 11, 1986.\n  So, Mr. President, we hear a lot of talk about fairness, we hear a \nlot of talk about the need for an up-or-down vote, but I do not \nremember all the hand wringing about fairness back in [[Page S \n8874]] 1986, or many times since that time, when at that time the Chief \nJustice Rehnquist nomination was on the line.\n  What does history tell us? History tells us that 31 of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle were prepared to filibuster a nominee to \none of the highest positions of our Government, and today many of those \nwho supported this filibuster allege unfairness when Republicans \nexercise the same right--the same right--only this is a minor office \ncompared to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  We are talking about a nominee to an office with a budget of under $1 \nmillion with a staff of six. But he is supposed to make certain \neverybody is taken care of, all the medical problems are going to be \ntaken care of if we just vote yes on this nomination, according to my \ndistinguished colleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle.\n  In fact, I remember my colleague from Massachusetts arguing against \nthe Justice Rehnquist confirmation because he ``lacked candor in \ntestifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee'' and because of \nJustice Rehnquist's ``alleged pattern of explanations * * * that are \ncontradicted by others or are misleading or do not ring true.''\n  Does that sound familiar? Many of us said this time the same thing \nabout Dr. Foster.\n  I have talked to him personally, others have talked to him, others \nwho are on the committee. We should not have the right to make that \njudgment because we are Republicans, but it is all right to make it \nagainst the Chief Justice nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  So, Mr. President, facts can be stubborn things. They are rarely \nnoted by the media, not often used in this Chamber. But they show that \nwe have a double standard and it is alive and well in Washington, DC. \nAnd it goes on and on and on. We hear all the hand wringing over there \nand all the talk of Presidential politics on this side and nothing \nabout Presidential politics downtown. This is not about Presidential \npolitics. That may be a good sound bite. This is about Dr. Foster and \nhis qualifications for the office, and it is about our right to advise \nand consent.\n  I must say, as I look back on it, we could have chosen other options, \nbut it seemed to me this was a fair option, just as fair as it was for \nJustice Rehnquist who was nominated to be Chief Justice.\n  Cloture was invoked in that case. Cloture can be invoked in this \ncase. The issue is not whether cloture was invoked on 22 of the 24 \nnominations that have been subjected to cloture procedure. This is a \nfalse distinction. What is important is we have had 24 nominations \nsubjected to a cloture vote. So he can get an up-or-down vote, all he \nneeds to do is get 60 votes on this, as others have done in the past.\n  I do not question those who say Dr. Foster is probably a fine person. \nI do not know Dr. Foster that well. I have had one visit with him. I do \nnot snoop around about his past. I think Senator Danforth was right \nwhen he made that statement: Tell it to the family of John Tower when \nyou talk about allegations and stuff over the transom, under the \ntransom and wrecking somebody's character; tell it to John Tower's \nfamily. He is gone.\n  Tell it to Robert Bork. Tell it to his wife when they were harangued \nand harassed day after day after day by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Tell it to Bill Lucas and his family, the fine outstanding sheriff of \nWayne County, MI, an outstanding black American who did not even get a \nvote, any kind of a vote on this floor, because the Judiciary Committee \nvoted, in a 7-7 tie, and would not report him out.\n  That is the thing the Democrats do not tell us: How many Republicans \nnever had a hearing, were never reported out of the committee, and when \nthey were reported out, they stayed on the calendar; never had the \ncourtesy to even have a cloture vote. They died on the calendar.\n  I have not heard anybody say anything about that over there, and I \nput those facts in the Record. I thought surely somebody would get up \nand explain why the Democrats would do that when they talk about \nfairness and their hearts ache and they cannot sleep at night. Why do \nthey not read the Record and go back and call all the families of the \npeople who did not even get a hearing or were on the calendar week \nafter week after week, month after month after month and never even had \nthe courtesy of a vote, not even a cloture vote.\n  So I know all about it. I have been here a while, and I keep track of \nthese things. What comes around goes around, and none of us are \nperfect. When we make arguments on the Senate floor, we ought to go \nback and look at the last argument we made and the one before that to \nsee if it is consistent and how did we vote on Rehnquist before \nstanding up to make a speech.\n  I can recall in 1980 joining with the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, when they wanted to block John Breyer's nomination. I \nsaid it should not be blocked, and I voted for cloture, and we \nsucceeded. He was a Democrat, so it is not politics.\n  This nomination was flawed from the start, and the President knows \nit. But he sought to divide the American people on the issue of \nabortion. That is all this nomination is about, trying to divide the \nAmerican people for political purposes, and the President talks about \npolitics and his Chief of Staff Leon Panetta goes on television this \nmorning in some outrageous statement about a vengeance up here--\nvengeance--which means they must be losing.\n  So I wish Dr. Foster well. No one likes to see someone who may want \nto have a job denied that opportunity. I met with a lot of the families \nwho did not even get a vote of any kind because they were Republicans \nin a Democratic Senate. Well, Dr. Foster is getting a vote. I promised \nhim that, and he is getting it very quickly, in 2 days.\n  I met with him on Monday, and here it is Thursday, and we are going \nto have the second vote. I think his initial lack of candor and \ncertainly lack of truthfulness on the part of the White House made this \nnomination in doubt from the start.\n  So whether it is his misleading statements concerning his abortion \nrecord, or his alleged knowledge of the infamous Tuskegee syphilis \nstudy or involvement in sterilizing several mentally retarded women, \nthere are just too many questions. If the Senator from Massachusetts \ncan say that somebody lacks candor, maybe we can say it with the same \ncredibility on this side of the aisle. Maybe we are not entitled to \nthat because we are Republicans, only the liberals are entitled to make \nthose judgments. But we are, too.\n  As I said yesterday, we need somebody in that position to be \nAmerica's doctor--not Republicans, not pro-life, not pro-choice, not \nDemocrats, not conservatives, not liberals, but America's doctors. It \nis not a policy position, it is a public relations job, with a staff of \nsix. The world will not come to an end if we do not ever fill this \noffice or if it is abolished.\n  So it seems to me we do not want somebody to divide us, as the \nprevious Surgeon General did, about legalization of drugs and all the \nother statements made by that Surgeon General, but that has nothing to \ndo with this nomination. My point is, if there is somebody out there, \nthere are thousands and thousands of good people out there who can \nunite America, unite Americans, whatever they can do in that office, \nand this is not the right nomination.\n  Again, I agree with Senator Danforth. I wonder sometimes why anybody \nwould accept a nomination, but I do not know anybody on this side who \nhas been personal about Dr. Foster. I am proud of the fact he is a \nveteran. As far as I can see, he is a good person. We had a nice visit. \nBut also we have to have a record, and the record, I think, is the \nproblem: His lack of candor.\n  So we are proceeding, I think, in a very fair way, as we look at \nhistory and look at the record and look at how quickly this nomination \nhas moved.\n  It seems to me cloture should not be invoked and this nomination \nwould go back on the calendar, as the unanimous-consent agreement \nindicates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8855-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8874-S8875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. Smith, \n     for himself and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1464.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place on the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  .\n\n       The State of New Hampshire shall be deemed as having met \n     the safety belt use law requirements of section 153 of title \n     23 of the U.S. Code, upon certification by the Secretary of \n     Transportation that the State has achieved--\n       (a) a safety belt use rate in each of fiscal years ending \n     September 30, 1995 and September 30, 1996, of not less than \n     50 percent; and\n       (b) a safety belt use rate in each succeeding fiscal year \n     thereafter of not less than the national average safety belt \n     use rate, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which \nallows New Hampshire to meet the safety belt use law requirements under \nsection 153 of ISTEA. Under this amendment, highway safety funds would \nnot be transferred from highway construction projects to highway safety \nprograms if the safety belt use rate in fiscal years ending September \n30, 1995, and September 30, 1996, is not less than 50 percent. In \nfiscal years thereafter safety belt rate shall not fall below the \nnational average as determined by the Secretary of Transportation.\n  It is my belief that the Federal Government should not mandate \nseatbelts; those decisions should be left to the States. I believe all \nindividuals should wear seatbelts whenever they ride in a vehicle. \nFurthermore, I believe that local government, not the Federal \nGovernment, should continue to play a role in educating people \nregarding the need to take every precaution when operating a vehicle.\n  As a former Governor, I realize firsthand the frustration local \ngovernment experiences when the Federal Government attempts to \nmicromanage public policy. Americans no longer want big brother looking \nover their shoulder attempting to force compliance with regard to \nseatbelt compliance.\n  I am pleased that this amendment, which allows New Hampshire to be \njudged on its safety record for safety belt usage, has been adopted. \nThis amendment will remove the current unfair mandatory penalties \nforced on New Hampshire without regard for its excellent seatbelt \ncompliance record.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that takes care of a \nparticular situation that has arisen in New Hampshire and addresses the \ndesires of the Senators there. They are doing extremely well as far as \ntheir seatbelt usage goes. This makes them continue in that path and \nmove up to the national average as time goes on.\n  It is an amendment that has been cleared by both sides, and I think \nit is a good one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I ask the distinguished chairman of the committee, is \nthis the same version the chairman showed me not too long ago, maybe \nabout an hour or so ago?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have examined this amendment and we \nthink it is acceptable.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill, \nthe Senators from Rhode Island, Virginia, [[Page S 8876]] and Montana, \nfor working with me on a compromise amendment that would provide relief \nto the State of New Hampshire from certain highway-related penalties. \nThe issue we have been debating for the last 2 days in section 153 of \nISTEA, which sanctions States that have not enacted mandatory \nmotorcycle helmet and seatbelt laws.\n  This section of current law penalized the State of New Hampshire by \ndiverting its scarce highway maintenance and construction funds to its \nsafety program--whether or not this makes any sense. In other words, \nthe penalties are assessed regardless of whether New Hampshire already \nhas an adequately funded safety program directed toward helmet and \nseatbelt usage, and irrespective of New Hampshire's safety record. \nStates constantly tell us that they are in a better position to address \nthese types of issues than the Federal Government is, and I strongly \nagree.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted to repeal the penalties for noncompliance \nwith motorcycle helmet laws. Today, we have reached an agreement on an \namendment that would provide an incentive for the State of New \nHampshire, which does not have mandatory seatbelt law, to maintain its \n50 + seatbelt use rate and strive to reach the national average within \n2 years. If they do not meet these goals, then the sanctions will be \nimposed as current law dictates.\n  This is a very reasonable amendment and it does not compromise the \nSenator from Rhode Island's objective of achieving a higher percentage \nof individuals wearing seat belts. In fact, it creates a more effective \nincentive, without being punitive or infringing on States rights.\n  New Hampshire will continue to education its citizens on the benefits \nof seatbelt use. Educational programs like those we have in New \nHampshire certainly play an important role in increasing highway \nsafety. States do have the expertise and know-how to develop their own \nprograms without Federal intimidation.\n  In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is through education, not \nnecessarily a mandatory law, that we will achieve higher rates of \nseatbelt use. New Hampshire is capable of ensuring the safety of its \ncitizens without the paternalistic arm of the Federal Government \ndictating to us how we should accomplish this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending before this, \nthe Exon amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two amendments pending at the \npresent time, the Smith amendment----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Is the Smith amendment ready for consideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1464) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if there is no other business to come \nbefore us immediately, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will withhold \njust for a comment or two about the bill?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I certainly will.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding it would be in \norder for comments to be made about the bill, not necessarily about the \namendment that is pending. Is that correct, as a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The managers of \nthe bill are awaiting reconciliation of several amendments. At that \npoint in time, we will move toward final passage, but we welcome the \ncomments of our distinguished colleague from Mississippi beforehand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me commend the managers of the bill \nfor the good work they have done in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor. It is an important contribution to the infrastructure of this \ncountry for the Congress to take action on this bill in a timely \nfashion so States and localities who depend upon these allocations of \nfunds can make plans to do it in a systematic way and to carry forward \nsome of the important road and bridge projects that would be funded in \nthis legislation.\n  I know in our State of Mississippi hardly a bill is passed by the \nCongress that is more important to the continued economic progress and \ndevelopment of our State than this legislation that is before the \nSenate today.\n  I know that there is also a continuation of a study called corridor \n18. That may very well provide a new major corridor and interstate type \nhighway which could go through Mississippi, and it may very well, I am \nsure, traverse many States in the central part of the country, from \nOhio down to Houston, TX, and maybe beyond. There are many communities \nalong this potential corridor that would benefit substantially in an \neconomic way from the opportunities to grow and develop, providing \njobs, producing economic activity and business activity along the way. \nWe hope that study can be successfully completed, and the feasibility \nof it established so that in a timely way we can see the ultimate \nconstruction of that.\n  There are other parts of the bill in which we are interested as well. \nIt was brought to the attention of the manager that there is some \nlanguage that we would like to see included in a managers' amendment at \nthe appropriate point to permit our State to have access to a visitors \ncenter just south of the Tennessee line. This was something that was \nprovided for in the 1994 appropriations bill but has not yet been \nfinally resolved. We hope that this bill can include some language that \nwould help that situation be resolved in a satisfactory way.\n  But all in all, this is a good bill. It is an important bill. It is a \nrestrained bill. The Senators have been encouraged not to get involved \nin new demonstration type projects in the bill. I know we cooperated in \nthat.\n  We want the managers to know that we appreciate the way that they \nhave maintained discipline in this process and have shown that \nrestraint.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  I wish to bring this to his attention. He said we have asked them not \nto add projects. We have not added any. I think this bill can meet \nwhatever test as a clean test in terms of demonstration projects. The \nAmerican public does not want to see these anymore. The various \nGovernors and highway commissions in the several States do not want to \nsee them anymore. I think this bill is a landmark bill in terms of its \nabsence of that type of project. That is owing to the full cooperation \nof the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  So I thank the Senator for bringing it up. I was fearful when he said \nadd not a lot, some might in turn interpret that as that some had been \nadded.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his comments. I certainly agree with him. I recall in my \nearly days in the Congress. I served in the other body, and I was \nassigned to the Public Works and Transportation Committee. I served on \nthe Surface Transportation Subcommittee. I had some good experience in \nworking with Senators, like Senator Chafee, and other members of \ncommittee over here on this side of the Capitol.\n  This is important work. I think it is work that has been well done, \nand I commend all Senators who have had an active role in the \ndevelopment of the bill and the managing of it on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMississippi for his very generous comments. I appreciate the kind words \nhe had to say about the work we have done.\n  I discovered that I have come to the conclusion after a while around \nhere that there are a few bills that attract more attention than \nhighway bills. Everybody shows up when there is a highway bill. And I \nmust say the Senators have exhibited tremendous restraint. Maybe the \nrestraint came about because we did not adopt any. I do not [[Page S \n8877]] think there is a single demonstration project in this bill. I \nwould not know. Because if there was one, I would have one in there for \nRhode Island.\n  But the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has resisted any \nsuch demonstration grants or specific authorizations for projects \nwithin this State or that State. And, so far, we are not through yet. \nWe are not across the finish line. But we have done pretty well so far. \nIf the word should get out that we did any, if we did, I am sure that \nwe would have not four amendments left but 100.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can continue the restraint we have \nshown. I appreciate the wonderful support of the Senator from \nMississippi who has been long interested in these matters.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, I wish to reiterate it has been a bipartisan effort. There \nhas been complete cooperation. Many Senators thinking this was an \nappropriate piece of legislation, as it has been in the past for such \nprojects, came up and, when we acquainted them with the policy \ndecision, they accepted it; indeed, in many respects endorsed it \nknowing that history shows that so many projects of that type that were \nadopted by the Congress have gone back to the States and have proven \nnot to be in terms of priorities what the States really need. Now the \nStates are given greater discretion and the money with which to \nexercise that discretion.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to echo what the Senator from \nVirginia said about the bipartisan effort, that the senior Senator from \nMontana has been tremendously helpful in this. It is not easy. We all \nhave friends that come up and want to remind us of what we want from \ntheir committee; and, two, what a modest little item it is that they \nare requesting. So far, so good. I hope we can continue in that regard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island--I \nknow there are four amendments. Are they going to be offered? Should we \nmove on to another bill and come back to this next week? We do not want \nto sit here in a quorum call for a couple of hours while Members are \nfloating around the Capitol.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could most respectfully address our leader, I would \nurge that he give us a brief period of time within which to urge the \npresentation of these amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Which four are they? Maybe we can identify the players and \nhave them get over here.\n  Mr. WARNER. The principal amendment for which there could be some \nconcern is the amendment of the two Senators from Alaska. Within the \nhour I have consulted with them on it. Frankly, they are questions in \nmy judgment, and very legitimate ones. It is a problem involving State \nrights. It goes back many years in Alaska. I left one of the two \nSenators with the clear impression that he was going to present the \namendment, and unless he is able to effect a resolution of the matter--\nI am prepared to accept the amendment from the Senator from Alaska. I \nwould have to allow the other side to speak for itself on this issue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if we might have a quorum?\n  Mr. DOLE. Is it a managers' amendment? I do not know which amendments \nthey are. I am serious.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is a managers' amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is that one of the four?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. An Exon amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that amendment has been resolved, the Exon \namendment. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be \ndeleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So that would leave Stevens-Murkowski.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. That is one amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Chafee-Warner, a managers' amendment. That is the second \namendment. Are there two others? Smith?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is resolved. There are only two.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is a remaining one from the Senator \nfrom Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes]. I have spoken with him within the hour, \nand indicating--and I will take responsibility--that I cannot accept \nthe amendment. It relates to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. I am \nfearful it would be construed by other Senators as being in the nature \nof a--even though it is authorized already--project. And I felt that I \ncould not accede to his request, regrettably. So that amendment would \nnot be accepted on this side.\n  Mr. DOLE. I certainly want to thank the managers. I do not have any \nquarrel with the managers. But those who have amendments, you know--\npeople are going to be wanting to get out of here for an August recess. \nThey do not want to be here late at night. But they do not want to be \nhere in the afternoon. We cannot have it both ways.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We would prefer not to be here in the morning either.\n  Mr. DOLE. They do not want to be here in the morning either. It is \nvery difficult for the managers who are down to three amendments. They \nhave been on this bill long enough--last week, and 4 days this week. \nThe bill was supposed to take 2 days. It has taken almost 5. Because we \nwant to go to securities litigation next, the only thing I know, \nwithout prejudicing the managers, if we cannot conclude it by 3:30, \nthen we would move to another matter and this would come back sometime \nwhen we finished the next bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say to the distinguished leader that the \nmanagers' amendment is prepared in the nature of a technical amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. There really is only one amendment, and that is the one \nby the two Senators from Alaska. I will go back to them immediately to \ndetermine what their desire is.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n                        private property rights\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a short colloquy \nwith the Senator from Rhode Island, the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the manager of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment which would \nbroaden the definition of like-kind property that would allow affected \nlandowners to defer the capital gains tax after the forced sale of \nproperty which is taken for use in various infrastructure projects. I \nsimply do not believe it is fair to expect property owners who do not \nwish to sell their property to be unable to defer their capital gains \ntax if they are not able to reinvest the amount of the gain in an \nexpanded like-kind property. It is my desire to work with you in your \ncapacity as a member of the Finance Committee to achieve a broader \ndefinition of like-kind property.\n  I have discussed this matter with the Finance Committee staff. \nHowever, I would respectfully ask your assistance in ensuring that the \nFinance Committee will examine this issue when it considers \nreconciliation this year.\n  If that is possible, I would be pleased to withdraw my amendment from \nconsideration.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I understand the problem the Senator from Minnesota has \nraised. I will ask the chairman of the Finance Committee to examine \nthis issue when the committee considers reconciliation, and \nspecifically to consider the problem highlighted by the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is on the list of amendments an \namendment by the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes]. That amendment, \nregrettably, cannot be accepted and, therefore, it will not be \nconsidered as a part of this bill.\n  That leaves on the list the only amendments being that of the \nSenators from Alaska and the managers' amendment. I understand there is \nan amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] that is still \non the list, and I am not prepared to act on that right now.\n  I ask my comanager if this is a time and moment to go to the \nmanagers' amendment.\n[[Page S 8878]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is, I think, \nvery timely. I might say, I do not know what progress we are going to \nmake, if any, on the Nickles amendment. This side does not know what it \nis. I see the Senator from Oklahoma on the floor right now. Maybe he is \nin a position to tell us.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be happy to inform my colleagues. \nThe essence of the amendment is to allow States that do not have Amtrak \nservice to use some of their mass transit moneys to subsidize Amtrak \nservice. Senator D'Amato indicated some reservations about it. We are \ntrying to work with him. Hopefully, we will have that worked out in a \nfew moments.\n  Mr. WARNER. So I understand, a few moments could be a few minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1465\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk now the managers' \namendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Chafee and the Senator from Montana, \nMr. Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 1465.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment makes technical changes to \nS. 440 and minor modifications that have been cleared on both sides. \nSuch modifications include, first, streamlining the enhancements \nprogram and the traffic monitoring program; second, changing the name \nof ``intelligent vehicle highway systems'' to ``intelligent \ntransportation systems''; and, third, require a report on effectiveness \nof accelerated retirement vehicle programs, and other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is basically, as most managers' \namendments are, an amendment which contains minor modifications and \ntechnical corrections. One I would like to point out to the Senate is \nthe change in reference to the ``intelligence vehicle highway systems'' \nto ``intelligent transportation systems.''\n  The theory of the ISTEA legislation that this is the heart of is that \nwe are trying to broaden the definition of ``transportation'' to \ninclude intelligent functions; that is, more advanced technologies in \nhighway travel to include not only highways but other transportation \nmodes. It, obviously, includes seaports and also intermodal connectors.\n  I urge the adoption of the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the managers' \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1465) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the two remaining amendments are being \nvery actively worked on by their sponsors. The managers hope to be able \nto report to the Senate in a very brief period of time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to describe what I think is the \nresult of the discussions that we have been having these past few days.\n  First of all, let me say that I support passage of legislation to \ndesignate the National Highway System as directed by ISTEA, the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. I was, in \nfact, an original cosponsor of legislation in both the 103d and the \n104th Congresses to accomplish this task. This $6.5 billion bill \nauthorizes critically needed funds, and I would like to consider just a \nfew of the facts.\n  Almost one-fourth of our highways are in poor or mediocre condition, \nwhile another 36 percent are rated in the fair category. One in five of \nthe Nation's bridges is structurally deficient--20 percent--meaning \nthat weight restrictions have been set to limit truck traffic.\n  On urban interstate highways, the percentage of peak hour travel \napproaching gridlock conditions increased from 55 percent in 1983 to 70 \npercent in 1991, costing the economy $39 billion.\n  Experts indicate that an additional annual investment of $32 billion \nis needed to bring our highway and bridge infrastructures up to date, \nand failure to make those investments increases the costs, both in the \nshort and long term.\n  For example, failure to invest a dollar today in needed highway \nresurfacing can mean up to $4 in highway reconstruction costs 2 years \nfrom now.\n  The ability of our country to sustain higher productivity is the key \nto economic growth and a higher standard of living.\n  Higher productivity is, in part, a function of the public and private \ninvestment. Recognizing that reality, over 400 of our Nation's leading \neconomists have urged Government to increase public investment. They \nurged us to remember that public investment in our people and in our \ninfrastructure is essential for economic growth.\n  Clearly, the National Highway System program was designed to be part \nof a comprehensive program of public investment.\n  However, as much as I support moving this legislation forward, I will \nvote against the NHS bill.\n  Provisions in this bill are totally inconsistent with, and as a \nresult radically undermine, the goal of increasing investment and \nproductivity.\n  My concern here is that specific provisions, amendments to this bill, \nundermine safety and will substantially increase human and economic \ncosts.\n  While one amendment to the bill was excellent and requires States to \ninstitute zero tolerance laws--that means almost no acceptance of any \npresence of alcohol behind the wheel is accepted. It is .02, very low, \nand that is the way it ought to be. That is very positive. It is a \nproposal that I strongly supported, having been the author or father of \nthe 21-age drinking bill and seeing how successful we were over the \nlast 10 years. It was a very positive step. It will save lives and \nreduce expenditures. But in total, as a result of this bill, more lives \nwill be lost than will be saved.\n  Opponents of speed limits and motorcycle helmet laws--which passed \nthis body--argue that decisions in these areas should be the \nresponsibility of the State. I could not agree more. I want to give \nsome decisions to the States that would increase their flexibility in \nusing Federal transportation assistance. But I cannot buy into the \nconcept that removing speed limits, increasing speeds across our \nNation's highways and roads, is going to help anything except to create \nmayhem. More people will die and more expenses will be incurred.\n  The same thing is true with the helmet laws. To remove helmets is, in \nmy view, positively ludicrous. I do not understand what it is that \nmotivated this body to say take off your helmets, let the wind blow in \nyour hair, and God help you if someone runs over you. I supported the \nconcept in ISTEA for flexibility for States and, again, allowing the \nStates to use NHS funding to support intercity rail service. This is \nhuman rights, the right of the individual to be safe. It is the right \nthat all of us have not to have to spend money because people do \nfoolish things in our society.\n  Mr. President, one-third of all traffic accidents are caused by \nexcessive \n[[Page S 8880]] speed. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration estimates that total repeal of Federal speed limit \nrequirements will increase the number of Americans killed on our \nNation's highways by about 4,750 persons per year.\n  In addition, there will be substantial financial consequences \nassociated with a repeal. Death and injuries will increase as a result \nof ending Federal speed limit restrictions. But it is going to cost \ntaxpayers $15 billion more each year in lost productivity, taxes, and \nincreased health care costs.\n  This loss would be on top of the $24 billion we already lose as a \nresult of motor vehicle accidents which are caused by excessive speed.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to restate that this bill is a $6.5 billion \ninvestment in our Nation's infrastructure, our highways. But, at the \nsame time, we have added an amendment that is going to cost us $15 \nbillion more over the life of this bill than we are presently spending. \nThe total investment for the whole bill is $6.5 billion.\n  Mr. President, the same argument applies to the helmet provisions in \nthe bill. More than 80 percent of all motorcycle crashes result in \ninjury or death to the motorcyclist. Head injury is the leading cause \nof death in motorcycle crashes. Now, compared to a helmeted rider, an \nunhelmeted rider is 40 percent more likely to incur a fatal head injury \nand 15 percent more likely to incur a head injury when involved in a \ncrash.\n  The NHTSA estimates that the use of helmets saved $5.9 billion \nbetween 1984 and 1982. Now, repeal of mandatory helmet requirements \nwill increase the death rate projected for motorcycle riders by 391 \npersons per year and will increase the costs to society by $389 million \neach year. And all of us chip in to pay for those expenses.\n  The American public supports a strong Federal role in transportation \nsafety initiatives because they understand the benefit of mandatory \nhelmet and safety belt laws, mandatory 21 drinking age laws, and \nmaximum speed limit laws.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to ignore the majority will and \nthe public, and all of the empirical data on the value of \ntransportation safety measures.\n  As a result, Mr. President, this bill gives with one hand and takes \naway with the other. It authorizes $6.5 billion worth of spending in \ninfrastructure investment, while adding almost $15.5 billion in \nadditional costs to our society.\n  My colleagues recognize this fact as evidenced by the rejection of \nthe amendment by the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, which would \nhave, in effect, required States to directly absorb medical costs \nassociated with motorcycle riders who were not wearing helmets and were \ninjured in an accident.\n  She said, very simply--and I agreed with her and we got lots of \nvotes--if a State does not want to take prudent measures to have people \nprotect themselves on our highways, they ought to pay for it when \naccidents and expenses are incurred.\n  I want the Congress and the country to understand what is at stake in \nthat debate--4,900 lives, tens of thousands more injuries each year, \nhundreds of millions of dollars in added health care costs and economic \nopportunities forgone.\n  Very simply, this bill takes one step forward but three steps \nbackward.\n  Mr. President, it pains me to say that I am not going to support this \nbill, because I believed for all of the years that I have been in the \nSenate that we do not invest enough in our highways, bridges, and our \ntransportation system, in transit and in intercity rail. So I hate to \nbe one of the people who is going to say no to this bill. But as the \nunderlying legislation dictates, it says that we are going to take more \naway than we give.\n  It is painful to witness what has happened to what was a program \nintended to do our country some good. But when each of the interests \nraised their heads, we wound up taking care of a few at the expense of \nthe many, and that is, unfortunately, what happened to the NHS bill \nwhich so many worked on so diligently for so many years.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very optimistic that we will reach \nwithin the next few minutes final passage of this bill, and therefore I \nwould like to give some closing remarks.\n  As we approach the end of our debate on the designation of the \nNational Highway System, I am pleased to have a bill that will keep \nAmerica moving, moving ahead with progress.\n  This is a big day. The National Highway System is intact and America \nwill move forward with another very important chapter.\n  Last year, the Senate, under the able leadership of my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, passed a clean bill, that is, a bill with no \ndemonstration projects. Today, and again this year, the Senate has \nspoken likewise--no projects. Let our States direct their funding on \ntheir own priorities, not those of the Congress.\n  Throughout these proceedings, my own goal has been simple: To see \nthat this measure moved ahead in a timely manner to meet the deadline \nof September 30, 1995, to ensure the States would receive the $6.5 \nbillion in National Highway System and interstate maintenance funds \nthat they deserve.\n  With our actions today, we are well ahead of schedule.\n  But, Mr. President, I am concerned. While I applaud our inclusion of \nthe zero alcohol tolerance, Mr. President, that noise does not disturb \nme. It is good noise. It is the noise of settlement. I accept it and \ntolerate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will, nonetheless, withhold so it will not \ninterfere with the Senator giving his remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may continue, I would like to repeat \nmyself. But I am concerned, Mr. President. I say that in all \nseriousness. While I applaud the Senate's inclusion of the ``zero \nalcohol tolerance'' for minors, I am concerned that the safety, which I \nstrongly support, of the public may be placed in jeopardy as a result \nof the amendments to this bill; namely, the lifting of the Federal law \non speed limits and opening the door for dual speed limits on trucks \nand automobiles.\n  States rights, a clarion call that I almost invariably support, \nprevailed throughout the debate on this bill. But the wisdom of \nexperience failed to prevail. Experience has clearly demonstrated that \nuniform national speed limits reduce the daily tragic losses of life \nand limb and economic resources on our highways.\n  Likewise, experience has demonstrated that different speed limits for \ntrucks and cars contribute to highway accidents. Our future, our fate \nnow rests with the State legislators, not the Federal Government. \nStates rights now means States responsibilities, as well as the burdens \nnow on the individual States. Legislators of those States are now on \nthe firing line. I urge them in the name of safety to hold the line. \nSpeed can be as intoxicating as alcohol.\n  A future Congress, when ISTEA is reauthorized in 1997, will closely \nexamine the results of our actions on this bill. I would hate to see \nthe Congress once again on a roller coaster, enacting and repealing and \nenacting and then repealing these laws as the constant lobbying between \nthe Congress and the States drives these legislative initiatives.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend and thank the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, as well as the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Baucus. They are both splendid working partners, and Senator \nBaucus has helped immeasurably as a full partner and as a manager with \nthis Senator in seeing that this bill will be adopted.\n  With their strong support, this bill moved promptly through the \ncommittee to the floor. Their cooperation and skill may soon help me to \ncomplete action on this bill.\n  My colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee have also \nmy great respect and appreciation for their commitment and their hard \nwork.\n  I would also like to thank a very able professional staff for their \nefforts. From the beginning of our work to designate the National \nHighway System [[Page S 8881]] there has been a great deal of \ncooperation on both sides of the aisle. So I thank Jean Lauver, Ann \nLoomis, Linda Jordan, Larry Dwyer, Ellen Stein, Tom Sliter, Kathy \nRuffalo, Alex Washburn, and the one and only Steve Shimberg, staff \ndirector.\n  Mr. President, the National Highway System will, indeed, keep America \nmoving toward our next generation of transportation challenges. For \nthese reasons, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to vote for \npassage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is nearing \ncompletion of S. 440, the National Highway System Destination Act of \n1995. And I want to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation on \nthis legislation. The passage of this legislation brings us a big step \ncloser to the deadline we must meet of September 30, if we are to \nreceive a very substantial distribution of some $6.5 billion--that is \n``b'' for ``billion''--of needed highway funds.\n  And I want to commend the manager of the bill, the chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senator Warner, for the \nwonderful job that he has done during the consideration of this \nlegislation. He worked diligently to develop it and to secure the \ncommittee's approval by a vote of 15-1.\n  I also want to thank Senator Baucus as a member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, who is also ranking member of this \nsubcommittee, for the excellent work that he has done on this bill. He \nhas been very cooperative in moving it forward. In fact, he provided \nthe leadership in beginning this process, as mentioned by Senator \nWarner, in that Senator Baucus last year brought this legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate. It passed, but unfortunately we were unable to \nreach an agreement with the House before Congress adjourned.\n  So I am pleased the Senate has approved the National Highway System \nas the Secretary of Transportation and the local and State officials \npresented it to us. I think this underlines the fact that the process \nto designate this system has worked well and resulted in a high degree \nof consensus among Federal and State and local officials.\n  Under this bill the cooperative process will continue. State and \nlocal officials, with the Secretary of Transportation's approval, will \nhave the ability to continue to make changes in the National Highway \nSystem as long as the total mileage of 165,000 miles is not exceeded. \nThis is a dynamic entity with which we are involved.\n  This legislation preserves the important principles that the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the so-called \nISTEA legislation, put in place, emphasizing flexibility. I regret that \nwe were not able to provide the States more flexibility with respect to \nthe Davis-Bacon provisions. As you know, it emerged from the committee \nwith a revocation of the Davis-Bacon language as it pertained to \nhighway construction. That was removed on the floor of the Senate due \nto the presence of a filibuster on that item. I hope we will be able to \ndeal with this Davis-Bacon situation in the future.\n  I deeply regret that this legislation, in my judgment, represents a \ngiant step backward in a particular area; that is, highway safety. I am \nextremely disappointed that the Senate made the decision to repeal the \nFederal speed limit as it pertains to automobiles. It was maintained as \nto trucks. That was a half a victory. As to automobiles, it was not \nmaintained. And as for the motorcycle helmet requirements, they were \nrepealed. Again, it was half a victory, if you would, or half a loss, \nin that of the two items, seatbelts and motorcycle helmets, the \nseatbelts were retained and the motorcycle helmet provision was \nrepealed.\n  I think that is a bad decision and will result in extremely \nunfortunate consequences. I believe lives will be lost that could have \nbeen preserved otherwise. I believe there will be more serious injuries \nthat could have been avoided. And I believe the cost to Federal and \nState governments will go up. But that is life. We had a long debate on \nit. There is no question that the will of the Senate was expressed. \nNothing went through in the dark of night on that one. Everybody knew \nthe issues and a vote was held. The vote was very, very clear to repeal \nthe helmet provision.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary of \nTransportation, Mr. Pena, and Mr. Rodney Slater, the Administrator of \nthe Federal Highway System. They did a splendid job in working with the \nStates to develop this whole system. The system was adopted by the \nSenate as was proposed, as it came up to us. That is a testimony to the \neffective job that was done by the States and the Federal officials, \nparticularly Mr. Slater, who has been very helpful to us not only \nduring the designation of the National Highway System, but in the \nconsideration of this measure on the floor, and his Deputy \nAdministrator, Jane Garvey, and their staff. The staff they have was \nworking with us over the past several days.\n  Finally, I want to join in thanks to the staff who worked on this \nlegislation. On our side, Steve Shimberg, Jean Lauver, Ann Loomis, \nLinda Jordan, and Larry Dwyer. And for the Democratic side, Tom Sliter, \nKathy Ruffalo, and Alice Washburn. All have been absolutely splendid. \nThere is no question we rely to a great degree on them, because we have \nconfidence in them built up over the years.\n  So I want to thank the Chair and thank all my colleagues for their \nassistance in this measure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today the Senate is finally \nabout to pass S. 440, the National Highway System Designation Act of \n1995. I want to thank particularly the chairman, Senator Chafee, for \nhis outstanding leadership, and also Senator Warner, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, who has done an excellent job shepherding this bill \nto this point.\n  This is a critical bill for our States. Billions of dollars in \nhighway funds are at stake. We need to enact this bill, and I remind my \ncolleagues, by September 30; that is, passed by both Houses and signed \ninto law. Otherwise, the State highway programs will be seriously \ndisrupted.\n  I hope the House will take this bill up soon so we can resolve our \ndifferences and get a bill to the President by that deadline.\n  The National Highway System is the backbone of our transportation \nsystem today and the framework for its growth in the 21st century. The \nNHS is designed to have a seamless transportation network of roads that \nlink all modes of transportation between airports, seaports, and rail \nyards with our population and economic centers. It will make our \nbusinesses more competitive in our global economy. And by choosing the \nmost important roads, it will help States to determine the most \nappropriate transportation investments.\n  That is particularly true in the rural West, like Montana, where \nhighways are often the only mode of transportation. Whether it is in \nthe transporting of goods and services, traveling for family vacations, \nbusiness, or taking our kids to college, our highways always play a \nvital role in our lives and our jobs. We do not have the mass transit \nor water transportation systems like other States have. So highways are \ncritical to the lifeblood of our State's economy, which increasingly \ndepends on travel and tourism, and it is our way of life.\n  The bill includes nearly 4,000 miles of roads in Montana. That is 23 \npercent or about 800 miles more than the Bush administration's original \nproposal. The additional routes include Highway 200 between Great Falls \nand Missoula, and from Lewistown going west to Winnett, Jordan, Circle, \nSidney, and Fairview. Highway 12 from Helena to Garrison Junction; \nHighway 59 from Miles City to Broadus; Highway 87 between Billings, \nRoundup, and Grassrange; and Highway 212 from Crow Agency to Lame Deer \nand Alzada.\n  That is good news for Montana. And the other roads in the bill mean \njust as much for the entire region across the Great Plains and down the \nRocky Mountains. All these roads are included in the bill the Senate is \nconsidering today.\n  Mr. President, this bill also makes major reforms by lessening the \nregulatory burdens on our States, giving [[Page S 8882]] them more \nflexibility. It allows States to set their own speed limits for \npassenger cars and also repeals Federal mandates on motorcycle helmets, \nmanagement systems, use of the metrics on highway signs, and crumb \nrubber. These are all good changes.\n  As I said before, this bill is not only in our State's interest, but \nin our national interest. It means jobs; it means growth. So I \ncongratulate the chairmen of our committee and subcommittee for their \nleadership, for their diligence, and for their extreme patience in \nmanaging this bill. And I particularly want to thank the staffs on both \nsides, particularly on the minority side, Tom Sliter and Kathy Ruffalo, \nwho have done a wonderful job; and on the majority side, Jean Lauver \nand Ann Loomis, who have done an equally good job.\n  Particularly at this point, Mr. President, I want to thank the \nFederal Highway Administrator, Rodney Slater. He has been here. He has \nbeen in the wings helping advise us. There were technical problems we \nhad as amendments came up. Jane Garvey, who is the Deputy \nAdministrator, has been just very valuable, along with other FHA staff, \nand I must say that were it not for their expertise, this legislation \nwould be in pretty rough shape. Again, I thank all concerned, and again \nparticularly the chairman, and the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nWarner. They have done a great job.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nI join him in acknowledging the positive, constructive contribution of \nthe Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. Indeed, he has \nbeen here keeping watch, and any Senator could speak with him at any \ntime. He has done an excellent job, a very, very commendable job for \nthis Nation.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1466\n\n (Purpose: To permit States to use assistance provided under the mass \ntransit account of the highway trust fund for capital improvements to, \n      and operating support for, intercity passenger rail service)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ABRAHAM). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1466.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . INTERCITY RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FROM MASS \n                   TRANSIT ACCOUNT OF HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       Section 5323 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(m) Intercity Rail Infrastructure Investment.--Any \n     assistance provided to a State that does not have Amtrak \n     service as of date of enactment of this Act from the Mass \n     Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund may be used for \n     capital improvements to, and operating support for, intercity \n     passenger rail service.''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I wish to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Warner and Senator Baucus, as well as Senator D'Amato and \nSenator Sarbanes, for their supporting this amendment and cooperating \nwith us in the drafting of this amendment.\n  This amendment, basically, would allow States to use their mass \ntransit funds to subsidize Amtrak. Many States, as you know, have had \nreductions in Amtrak. There happen to be 3 States in the lower 48 that \ndo not have Amtrak. We have narrowed this amendment to apply to those \nthree States that do not have Amtrak where they could use mass transit \nfunds to subsidize Amtrak acquisition.\n  I am pleased this amendment is supported. This will help us in our \nState to regain Amtrak. We are the only State in the Nation that has \nhad Amtrak and lost it. It will allow us to use mass transit--we only \nreceive $3 million now, we contribute $30 million but only get $3 \nmillion back--this will allow us to use part of that money to subsidize \nAmtrak and bring about the day when we have restoration of Amtrak in my \nState.\n  I wish to compliment my colleagues for management of this bill. They \nhave shown great patience and forbearance. A lot had different ideas.\n  I introduced legislation some time ago to allow the States to set \nspeed limits, thereby repealing the Federal national speed limit. That \nwas adopted by this body. I think it is a giant step in the right \ndirection. I am pleased it is part of this package. I look forward to \nthe final action and completion of this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the substance of this amendment is, \nfrankly, not within the jurisdiction of this committee. Rather, it is \nin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I have been in contact \nwith Senator Sarbanes, who is the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee. I have been assured he agrees with this amendment and has no \nproblem with it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1466) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, many commendations have been paid to the \nmanagers of the bill. I also would like to pay a commendation to the \ndistinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader who have given \nus full, complete support and, indeed, has shown great patience and \nindulgence in the last hour and a half as we bring this matter to a \nclose.\n  Mr. President, there is one remaining matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join in saying we are happy the highway \nbill is being passed. As one who has a very pressing problem, I know \nthis bill presents an opportunity to raise an issue and have it decided \nby the Congress and have it to the President next week. I see nothing \nwrong with that. That is part of the history of the Senate. In a few \nminutes, we may work out a situation--or we will postpone the \ndecision--but we cannot work it out now and, as far as I am concerned, \nwe will stay on this bill until we can get a decision from the Senate \nas to whether we are right about this issue.\n  So let me respond to my friend from Rhode Island--and he is my \nfriend--Senator Chafee and I stood behind one another in the line going \ninto law school more than 50 years ago, Mr. President, so we know each \nother very well.\n  We do have some differences. I have heard my friend talk about the \nfact that there is a limit of 165,000 miles in the Interstate Highway \nSystem. How would you like to be from a State one-fifth the size of the \nUnited States and have a thousand of those miles, Mr. President, and \nhave the post office keep telling you, ``You have to find some way to \ndeliver the mail up here, we can't pay the subsidy for flying mail?'' \nThen you find that Federal agencies are denying you the right to use \nrights-of-way across Federal lands that were developed by the miners in \n1866 and have been used since that time.\n  What happened? In 1976, we decided that we would repeal revised \nstatute 2477, which provided every State in the West the right to use \nestablished, public rights-of-way across Federal lands as continued \nrights-of-way for use by the public. They became the basis for the \nState highways, the Federal highways and the interstate highways in \nwhat we call the south 48.\n  Has that happened in Alaska? No. Why? Because of arrogant \nbureaucrats.\n  In 1976, we passed a law which absolutely stated, without any \nquestion, that the action of Congress in repealing the revised statute \n2477 would not affect our rights-of-way that had been established prior \nto 1976. That law said in section 701(a), which was signed on October \n21, 1976:\n\n       Nothing in this act or in any amendment made by this act \n     shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, \n     patent, right- [[Page S 8883]] of-way or other land use right \n     or authorization existing on the date of approval of this \n     act.\n\n  We interpreted that in past Congresses and past administrations have \ninterpreted that to mean that the rights-of-way that were established \npursuant to State law before 1976 were valid, if the State determined \nthey were valid.\n  As a matter of fact, there have been specific holdings by the Federal \ncourts of appeals, particularly the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nthat those rights-of-way were to be established and determined on the \nbasis of State law.\n  Now the Department of the Interior says, ``Oh, wait a minute now, we \nhave established since 1976 a whole series of wilderness areas, and in \nthose wilderness areas are some of these rights-of-way which, in fact, \naccess privately held lands, Native-held lands, and State-held lands in \nour State. Other States have similar problems.\n  I want to point out, Utah has the greatest problem of all the Western \nStates as far as the Bureau of Land Management is concerned. The last \nschedule I saw showed they had 3,815 claims pending to be validated. \nValidated by whom? There is no administrative process required to \nvalidate these claims. Now the Department of the Interior says they are \ngoing to determine whether these rights-of-way are valid. This is not \nwhat we said in 1976. If they were valid in 1976 under State law, they \nwere to be valid forever.\n  The language was very simple--very simple. Congress said in 1866:\n\n       The right-of-way for the construction of highways over \n     public lands not reserved for public uses is hereby granted.\n\n  That became revised statute 2477. It was part of the original highway \nact of the United States. The managers of the bill are saying, ``What \nare you doing out on the floor raising this now?'' This is part of the \nhighway system. The highway system in the western United States came \ninto being because of revised statute 2477. And now in my State, \nunfortunately in other States now, the Department of the Interior has \ndecided it is going to determine what is valid, and why? Because it has \nmade reservations of lands since 1976 that it says have validity and \nhave prior rights over the rights established by the people of those \nStates over Federal lands before that date.\n  This to me is not a simple issue. My distinguished friend, Senator \nMurkowski, the other Senator from Alaska, is here and he knows just how \nimportant this is. It is a matter that we both have tried to figure out \nwhat to do with.\n  We have no way to have construction of the highways proceed that we \nget money for under this bill if the Department of the Interior is to \ntell us that the rights-of-way we are going to use now are subject to \ntheir interpretation of whether they are valid or not.\n  To me it is a simple matter of States rights. But it goes beyond \nStates rights. It is the incessant determination of people downtown to \ntry to reverse a decision that the Congress made in 1958 when it \nallowed Alaska to become a State. If we are a State, we should have the \nsame rights as the other States did under this statute, and in 1976 we \npreserved that. I helped work on that section. We wanted to make sure \nwe had the rights that were there. We knew we were not going to \nestablish any new rights across Federal lands after that time, but \ncertainly the rights we had established prior to that time were valid \npursuant to State law, and there is no question that they continue to \nbe the basic right for the expansion of the highway system in Alaska \nand other western States.\n  Someone said to me once, ``Why do you worry about that? Is there that \nmuch Federal land out there?'' I just wish more people would come up \nand see the amount of Federal land we have in Alaska. You cannot get \nanywhere in Alaska without crossing Federal land.\n The Federal Government controls access to almost every piece of land \nthat is in private, State, or Native ownership in Alaska.\n\n  Now, I do believe that there is no question about it that there are a \nlot of forces out there which, if they had their way now, would reverse \nstatehood. They would take away from us the right to be a State. Not \nhaving that ability, what they do is take away from us the right to \nhave the same access to our land mass that other States in the lower 48 \nhave had.\n  The Interior Department has now come up with some very narrow terms \nto define ``highways'' for the purpose of revised statute 2477. That is \nnone of their business. Our rights existed in 1976 or they do not exist \nat all today. But if they existed in 1976, no Secretary of the Interior \nis going to tell me what those rights were or what they are going to \nallow us to claim today. We had the right in 1976 and he has no \nbusiness being involved in this.\n  I know that there are very powerful groups in this country that would \nlike to find ways to invalidate those claims. And in the past these \ngroups have taken the claims to court. These groups have lost, because \na right established prior to 1976 for public access across Federal \nlands continues to be our right.\n  Alaska law defines highways in terms of roads, streets, trails, \nwalkways, bridges, tunnels, drainage structures, ferry systems, and \nother related facilities. Obviously, nobody is going to get in our way \non ferry systems. We have the right to navigable waters.\n  Protection of the RS 2477 grant of right-of-way is essential to the \npreservation of statehood for my State. And it is one of the reasons \nthat I come to this floor at times just a little bit excited, because I \ndo not believe many people take much time to learn much about our \nState. You crisscross the continental United States, but not many of \nyou even come to our State. When you do, we welcome you, we are pleased \nto have you. But you do not take much time to learn some of the \nproblems that exist there. Our problem is transportation, \ntransportation, transportation. We have to have access to our lands.\n  There is one other item I will mention to the Senate. When we were \nseeking statehood, we first sought 30, 40 million acres of land. \nCongress at that time kept saying: But you cannot survive as a State \nunless you have more land. You have to have a land base in order to \nsurvive. So we ended up by getting the right to use 103.5 million acres \nof Federal lands as State lands.\n  Mr. President, having received the right to select 103.5 million \nacres of the Federal domain in Alaska, we proceeded to do that. Our \nrights pertain to Federal lands that were vacant, unreserved, and \nunappropriated as of 1959. A subsequent Congress decided that there \nought to be a limitation on our rights. So we had a process which \nlasted about 7 years and led to the enactment of a law in 1980, the \nAlaska National Interest Land Claims Act, which withdrew a substantial \namount of lands that were vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved in \n1959. In effect, they took away from us the right to select a portion \nof the lands that we originally had the right to consider in exercising \nrights under the Statehood Act. Similarly, the Alaska Natives received \nsome 40-plus million acres in settlement of their historic claims \nagainst the United States, and some of those lands were to be taken \nfrom vacant unappropriated, unreserved lands. And they also were faced \nwith the prospect of having to select lands that were not reserved, \nbecause the Congress had reserved lands.\n  We ended up by selecting lands that were less valuable, did not \ncontain minerals, and were not timbered. Most of the valuable lands of \nAlaska was set aside and not available to either the State or the \nNatives, as originally intended. That is going to lead, in my opinion, \nto a historic lawsuit by my State against the Federal Government. I am \ninformed we must complete our land selections before we can bring that \ncase. But I do think it is a valid case against the United States. And \nthe perpetrators of the wrong were right here on the floor of the \nSenate. Some of them continue to be here, Mr. President. Some Members \nof the Senate continue to try to deny Alaska access to the lands that \nCongress gave us a right to when we became a State, in order to try and \nsupport the new State.\n  Now, we come down to 1976 when we decided to repeal revised statute \n2477. Mr. President, without that law, the West would never have been \nsettled. Without that law, we would not have the Interstate Highway \nSystem. Without that law, we would not really have the unity we have as \na nation.\n  Now, it is sad, in my opinion, to see this penchant of some members \nof our society to deny our new State the same rights, to say that we \nhave no right to [[Page S 8884]] establish a network of highways in our \nState. As I said, we have one major highway in our State. It is the \nsystem that connects Alaska to Canada. It goes from Seward, AK, up to \nFairbanks, and out to the border.\n  I see the leader here. I will yield.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if we can move on to the next bill and not, in any \nway, undercut any of the rights of any of the Senators. As soon as you \nget the language and agreement, we can come back to this bill. In the \nmeantime, let us go ahead and start the other bill, the securities \nlitigation bill. And then, hopefully, you will have the language. The \nfirst vote would be on this, back-to-back with final passage of this \nbill, plus the amendment on litigation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I might say to my friend, we had an agreement last night \nthat I would have the opportunity to offer an amendment to this bill. \nNow there has been a suggestion that we have an amendment that is being \nreviewed by the Senator from Arkansas, as I understand it. That would \ndelay the urgency of this amendment of mine. I am happy to agree to \ncooperate with our leader at any time. I would not want to see us be \nput in the position that we are limited as to what we might do when we \nget back on this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I assume, in talking with Senator Bumpers, it is something \neverybody can agree on. You can offer the amendment when we bring the \nbill up. If it is not satisfactory, you can do what you want. In the \nmeantime, we can go ahead with the litigation bill. When you have it \nworked out----\n  Mr. STEVENS. There may be more amendments before we are through.\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, amendment or amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Under the circumstances, I am happy to continue my \ncomments at a later time, if the leader wishes to go on the other bill \nat this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, it is \nmy understanding that the amendment has been agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was this Senator's understanding, too, but that is \nnot the case.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are currently waiting to hear from \nSenator Bumpers with regard to the pending agreement. I assume that he \nwill be forthcoming.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If my colleague will yield, we have not been able to \ncheck that out with the Senator from Utah because we have not seen the \nfinal version that is agreeable to Senator Bumpers yet.\n  The leader is right. There is nothing we can move ahead on now. That \nis why this Senator is venting a little air, to try to make people \nunderstand why we feel so strongly about this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder, Mr. President, if the majority leader will \nyield, if we can wait maybe 1 minute here. There is a possibility we \ncan get this cleared right now.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then it has to be reviewed by the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If we could just withhold for a few more minutes? Maybe \nthe other Senator from Alaska could speak for just a few more minutes. \nWe are just that close to getting this thing wrapped up. I would want \nto do it now rather than later.\n  Mr. DOLE. We were going to move on to something else at 3:30. Now it \nis 4:30. I would like to finish the bill. I know the managers would. \nThey have done an excellent job. I certainly want to accommodate the \nSenators from Alaska. I understood the Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, thought he had a satisfactory resolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will again yield, it is my \nunderstanding Senator Bumpers has not yet personally seen the language \nand he does want to see it.\n  Mr. DOLE. That could take a while and we could be halfway down the \ntrail on the litigation bill. As soon as it is worked out, we will come \nright back and finish it. I am not going to lay it aside for a day or \neven an hour. We will come back, finish it, get the yeas and nays on \nfinal passage and have that vote occur along with the first vote on any \namendment on the litigation bill. Is that right?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could inquire of the \nmanager and the leader, if, indeed, it is set aside and not taken up \nfor a time, if Senator Stevens and I may have a time to be recognized \nat that time certain, right after the leader calls up the bill? I \nwonder if the leader could indicate when he intends to do that?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think what we would do is make certain you have agreed or \ndisagreed on whatever has been offered. Both Alaska Senators are on the \nfloor, obviously, and the Senator from Utah----\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I may interrupt, the Senator from Utah has as great a \nstake or greater in the immediate outcome. We have been willing to \nclear this with them, but we have not been able to get an agreed \nversion yet on this tentative moratorium.\n  Will the leader yield to the Senator from Utah so he might get \ninvolved in this, Mr. Leader?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have just had a quick opportunity to review this. \nClearly I will want to talk to my senior colleague, Senator Hatch. But \nmy first reaction to this is that this would be agreeable. It would \ndelay the implementation, as I understand it, of the present rules \nuntil December and give us that much more time to try to work things \nout with the Department of the Interior.\n  Our Governor made it clear to Secretary Babbitt that the proposals, \nas they currently stand, are not acceptable and cannot be fixed. We \nhave to start completely from scratch. So that is the position we have \ntaken and I take on behalf of the Governor.\n  But I obviously want to check with Senator Hatch before I give a \nfinal signoff on this issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the leader still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think from what I see developing here, it is just going \nto take a little time. I think it can be worked out. But if we need to \ncontact the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, I know that is not going to happen in 2 \nminutes or 5 minutes or 30 minutes. In the meantime, we could be \nstarted on the litigation bill. Then, as soon as you get the agreement, \nwe can come back to this bill, wrap it up, and have a vote on final \npassage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The question is, if we do not get the agreement, do we \nhave the understanding this will come back and be the regular order \nafter we finish the securities bill?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would have no objection to that proceeding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Then, if I could ask the leader again, roughly, he \nanticipates being back on the securities bill on Monday?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes. We hope to finish the bill tomorrow night. If not, we \nwill be on it Monday. But we could finish this bill, the present bill, \nbefore then, in particular if we get an agreement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if the leader gets an agreement, then \nit is my understanding that he will potentially come back to this bill, \nthe highway bill, at which time we would be recognized and pursue our \namendments with no time limitation and try to resolve the differences \nthat we currently have been unable to clear. Then there would be final \npassage. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. But if you can reach agreement with all parties and it can \nbe done very quickly, we will do it at any time you get the agreement, \nlike 30 minutes from now or an hour from now or 2 hours from now.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we should know very soon.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. That is what they told me at 3:30. Let me get the \nconsent. There will be one additional amendment here and then we will \ngo on.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that the Senate, after adoption of the \nmanagers' amendment, turn to the consideration of Calendar 128, S. 240, \nthe securities litigation bill, and that no call for the regular order \nbring back S. 440 except one call by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask, when the Senate resumes S. 440, the only \namendments remaining in order to the committee substitute be the \nfollowing: They are going to offer the managers' amendment, and then \nthe only following amendment would be the Stevens-Murkowski amendment \nor amendments. And that would also include the [[Page S 8885]] Senators \nfrom Utah, Senator Bennett and Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall \nnot. We also have an understanding that the closing statements of the \nmanagers appear in the Record as the last.\n  Mr. DOLE. I did get consent you could offer the managers' amendment \nright now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1464, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk a technical amendment \nto be added to the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the agreement been entered into?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has. Without objection, the agreement \nis entered into.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment which \nincludes the State of Maine as covered by the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  I ask that it be accepted. It is to a previously agreed to amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment, if I could, to \nsay that we just had a very wonderful opportunity in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee room to have a very healthy and productive \ndiscussion with a group of our colleagues, Senators from Chile, who are \nhere in the United States, to meet with their counterparts in the \nSenate and some Members of the House and the administration on a \nvariety of subject matters, not the least of which--and it will not \ncome as a great surprise--is NAFTA.\n  I know many colleagues share the view that Chile would be a welcome \npartner in the NAFTA agreements. That is a matter we will address in \nthe future.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to introduce to my \ndistinguished colleagues four Members of the Chilean Senate. With us \ntoday are Senator Arturo Allessandri, Senator Sebastian Pinera, Senator \nHernan Larrain, and Senator Jaime Gazmuri.\n  We are pleased to welcome four of our colleagues from Chile to the \nU.S. Senate.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995, is the bill we take up today. There is no doubt \nthat this bill is considered by some to be rather contentious. But this \nlegislation is important and necessary to fix the problem caused by \nfrivolous lawsuits that are making it difficult for companies to raise \nthe capital needed to fuel our economy.\n  This bill seeks to strike the right balance, which is always \ndifficult, between protecting the rights of those who are truly \naggrieved and yet not opening the door to frivolous litigation. This \nlegislation is necessary as there has developed a small but very \neffective cadre of lawyers who bring suits not to help recover losses \nfor those who are truly aggrieved but because they see an opportunity \nto strike it rich for themselves.\n  There is a term for this kind of lawsuit, they are called ``strike \nsuits.'' A strike suit occurs when a lawyer searches very carefully for \nnegative news announcements by a company or a decline in a company \nstock price. Then these lawyers race to the courthouse to file a suit \nalleging securities frauds, alleging mismanagement, or misinformation. \nI look to my colleagues on the floor from Alaska for an analogy--there \nis gold in the hills if a firm offers a security. There are lawyers who \nare mining that gold for themselves. Sometimes, even if a stock price \ngoes up, lawyers will race to bring suits because they allege that they \nwere not given information that this company would have higher earnings \nthan anticipated. Imagine. If there is bad news, you are vulnerable. If \nthere is good news, you are vulnerable.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the courts and the American judicial \nsystem is not to make these lawyers rich. It is to legitimately protect \nthose who have been aggrieved; those who have been taken advantage of, \nwho have suffered due to fraud, or who have suffered due to the \ndeliberate withholding of information or insider trading.\n  The question is not should these suits be stopped. The contentious \nnature of this legislation comes from the question of how to protect \nthe rights of our citizens and the integrity of the capital markets to \nassure there is not insider trading, taking advantage of information, \nwithholding information, or misrepresenting facts to steal people's \nmoney, and at the same time protect companies from strike suits.\n  Let me first commend my distinguished colleagues, Senators Domenici \nand Dodd, for their tireless work in spearheading the effort to reform \nsecurities litigation. I also want to thank Senator Gramm for his \nleadership on this issue as chairman of the Securities Subcommittee.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Banking Committee has heard substantial \ntestimony that certain lawyers file frivolous strike suits alleging \nviolations of Federal securities laws in\n hopes that defendants will quickly settle. These suits, which \nunnecessarily interfere with, and increase the cost of, raising \ncapital, are often based on nothing more than a company's announcement \nof bad news, not evidence of fraud. In addition, the fact that many of \nthese lawsuits are brought as class actions has produced an in terrorem \neffect on corporate America.\n\n  S. 240 provides a strong disincentive for filing abusive lawsuits. It \nhits strike suit artists where it hurts--in the pocketbook. S. 240 does \nnot contain a loser-pays provision. That would go too far. A loser-pays \nprovision makes it difficult, if not impossible, for injured investors \nto maintain a legitimate cause of action.\n  Instead, the bill requires courts to make specific findings about \nwhether an attorney violated rule 11 and to sanction attorneys who do.\n  One study showed that, in the early 1980's every company in one part \nof the business sector that had a market loss of $20 million or more in \nits capitalization was sued. Another survey of venture-backed companies \nin existence for less than 10 years--small companies that are the \nengine of economic growth--showed that one in six of [[Page S \n8892]] those companies had been sued at least once.\n  These lawsuits are expensive. The statistics show that although many \nsuits are still pending, these suits have consumed on average over \n1,000 hours of management time and legal cost--per case--of over \n$690,000 that the company has had to pay out. That is a lot of time and \nthat is a lot of money.\n  Does Congress want to let this trend continue? This Senator cannot \nsit idly by and permit small businesses to be the target of abusive \nlawsuits. Most of these companies are startup or high-technology \nbusinesses, which play an important role in our economy. These \nbusinesses provide new, innovative products to consumers, improving the \nquality of life and the way we conduct business.\n  Small startup, high-technology firms depend on research and \ndevelopment for their new products. As products succeed, fail, or \nsometimes just take longer to develop, the stock price of these \ncompanies may fluctuate. This stock price fluctuation or product \ndevelopment slowdown is not, on its face, evidence of fraud. Yet, in \nmany States, alleging that a product did not succeed and the price of \nthe company's stock dropped is enough to sustain a complaint in a \nsecurities fraud lawsuit.\n  S. 240 creates a uniform pleading standard that will help to weed out \nfrivolous complaints before companies must pay heavy legal bills. S. \n240, codifies the pleading standard of the second circuit in New York, \nwhich requires that a plaintiff plead facts giving rise to a strong \ninference of the defendant's fraudulent intent.\n  Small, startup, and high-technology companies have become sitting \nducks for securities fraud lawsuits. The costs of defending a \nsecurities fraud complaint, which does not have to show any evidence of \nfraud, is enormous. According to the American Electronics Association, \nwho testified at one of the committee's hearings, of the 300 or so \nlawsuits filed every year, almost 93 percent settle at an average \nsettlement cost of $8.6 million.\n  Furthermore, it is not just the company that is sued. Other, \nperipheral, deep-pocket defendants are joined to ensure there is enough \nmoney available to produce a meaningful recovery. As a result, \nunderwriters, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals have become \nprime targets of securities fraud lawsuits. Insurance companies that \nprovide director and officer liability insurance also pay up in these \nsettlements. In 1994 alone, insurers and companies paid out $1.4 \nbillion to settle securities fraud lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, this is not to say that some of those suits may not \nhave been bona fide. But all too often companies are paying simply to \nstop the litigation because they cannot afford the legal bills or they \ncannot afford the incredible negative exposure that a case can bring, \nespecially under the system of joint and several liability.\n  S. 240 modifies the doctrine of joint and several liability for \nperipheral defendants, who are named in the lawsuit more for their deep \npockets than their culpability.\n  In the current system, if you have any connection to the defendant \ncompanies, if they can tie you in at all, you can be held liable for \nthe full amount of the judgment. Even that defendant who has only a \nscintilla of liability for wrongdoing, or culpability or negligence--\nnot gross negligence, not knowing or wanton misconduct, not fraud--has \na chance of being held 100 percent liable for damages. That is just not \nfair. That is wrong.\n  Who benefits from these settlements? Not the plaintiffs. According to \nthe statistics, the victims of these so-called frauds generally get \npennies on the dollar. They are just being used.\n  Not only is this unfair, but often the investors do not understand \nexactly what the settlement represents, what their portion of the \nsettlement is, or why the lawyers even recommended the settlement.\n  S. 240 requires that certain information be provided to class members \nand that counsel be available to answer questions about the settlement.\n  No longer will attorneys be able to make a settlement for $6 million, \n$7 million, and not properly inform the people in the class. Nor will \nthe attorneys be able to pocket most of the settlement while class \nmembers receive pennies for their losses.\n  As one witness told the committee, and I quote:\n\n       As a stockholder, I feel that lawyers use the stockholders \n     as a steppingstone, preying on their misfortune, as a means \n     to file a lawsuit that will inevitably settle, in which the \n     lawyers will reap millions in fees while their clients \n     recover pennies on the dollar in their losses.\n\n  S. 240 limits the award of the attorney's fees to a ``reasonable'' \npercentage of the damages awarded to investors. Notably, it is the \ninvestors who end up paying the costs of these lawsuits.\n  Institutional investors, with about $9.5 trillion in assets, \napproximately $4.5 trillion of which are pension funds, are long-term \ninvestors. This means that the value of retirees' pension fund \ninvestments are adversely affected by abusive litigation. As the \nCouncil for Institutional Investors advised the committee, and I quote:\n\n       We are . . . hurt if the system allows someone to force us \n     to spend huge sums of money in legal costs by merely paying \n     ten dollars and filing a meritless cookie cutter complaint \n     against a company or its accountants.\n\n  Abusive litigation also severely impacts the willingness of corporate \nmanagers to disclose information to the marketplace. Many companies \nrefuse to talk or write about future business plans, knowing that \nprojections that do not materialize will inevitably lead to lawsuits, \nmany of which will simply allege that a prediction did not come true. \nOnce discovery begins, plaintiff's counsel begins what we call a \nfishing expedition for evidence. And as one witness told the committee, \nthe over-broad discovery request in this typical case ended up with the \ncompany producing over 1,500 boxes of documents at an expense of $1.4 \nmillion. Companies cannot continue to spend the time and the money that \nthese cases cost. So many times they are forced to settle meritless \ncases.\n  As a result, investors do not have the benefit of knowing about the \nfuture plans of a company because companies are afraid to make that \ninformation available. As a former SEC Chairman told the committee, and \nI quote:\n\n       Shareholders are also damaged due to the chilling effect of \n     the current system on the robustness and candor of \n     disclosure. Understanding a company's own assessment of its \n     future potential would be amongst the most valuable \n     information shareholders and potential investors could have.\n\n  S. 240 will encourage companies to make what we call forward-looking \nstatements by reducing the threat of abusive litigation. Companies that \nmake projections and that provide a clear warning to investors that the \nprojections may not be accurate will be protected from costly \nlitigation.\n  Some have said that this safe harbor for forward looking statements \nwould give license for companies to say anything. That it will give \nlicense to the quick buck artist, the penny stock guys, the people who \ncome out with IPO's. This is not true. We have excluded newly started \ncompanies which have not established a track record from this \nprotection. Only recognized companies with substantial interests will \nget this protection. Most importantly, if a defendant knowingly makes a \nfalse or misleading forecast, they are not protected.\n  The statement that this legislation will allow companies to knowingly \nlie and get away with it--and that statement has been made--is just not \ntrue. If you knowingly lie, if you intentionally mislead, you can be \nheld liable. There is no safe harbor for initial public offerings, for \nblank check offerings, for rollups, for penny stocks, for tender offers \nand leveraged buyouts. Safe harbor does not affect the power to bring \nan enforcement case.\n  Now, exactly who are the victims of securities fraud? Many times, \nthere is no victim. Instead there is just a professional plaintiff \nwhose name appears in the lawsuits, these names appear time after time \nafter time. In one case, a retired lawyer appeared as the lead \nplaintiff in 300 lawsuits, he bought small numbers of shares in many \ncompanies and then served when they were sued. Last year, an Ohio judge \nrefused to permit class action certification, noting that the lead \ndefendant had filed 182 class action suits in 12 years.\n  Now, that is not what the private right of action is intended to do.\n  S. 240 discourages the use of professional plaintiffs by eliminating \nthe bonus payments to plaintiffs and prohibiting referral fees. In \nother words, if [[Page S 8893]] you are one of these people who bought \n10 shares in 700, 800, or 900 companies you can no longer receive a \nbonus when a lawyer uses your name for a suit.\n  The practice of using professional plaintiffs permits the lawyers to \nhire the client. Professional plaintiffs also permit the lawyer to win \nthe ``race to the courthouse'' in filing a complaint. Often whoever \nfiles a claim first becomes the lead plaintiff, the lead counsel, even \nwhen multiple complaints are filed against the companies alleging \nsecurities fraud.\n  Because the huge settlements in these cases provide significant fees \nto counsel, the competition is fierce. This bill creates a new \nprocedure to ensure that the plaintiffs who are legitimately damaged, \nwho have a real stake, who are not these professional plaintiffs, who \nown 1 share or 10 shares in multiple companies, can control the suit. \nThis bill says the institutional investors, the people who have \nbillions in pension funds, the retirees, those managers will have a \ngreater stake in the case.\n  Can you imagine empowering somebody who owns 10 shares to represent \nyou when you represent 500 million. Someone who has a half billion \ndollars invested could have no say in who the attorney will be, or what \nthe eventual settlement will be while the case is managed by someone \nwho has only 10 shares.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for some observations?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator said it would be managed by shareholders \nwith 10 shares.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is what is taking place now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually, it is even worse than that because it is \nmanaged by the lawyer of the shareholder of 10 shares.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Correct. Because in many cases the shareholder receives \na bonus from the lawyer but is not otherwise involved in the case.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The lawyer calls himself an entrepreneurial lawyer in \nthis case. He is in business. It is not the shareholder; it is the \nlawyer who is in the business of managing the lawsuit. In fact, I will \nquote some courts that have found that to be the case.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. I thank the Senator for bringing this \npoint to the floor. Again I would like to commend Senator Domenici and \nSenator Dodd who have labored for years to craft a bill that is fair, \nthat is balanced, that protects those investors, the small investors, \nthe pension people, who have invested their life savings and also \nprotects businesses who raise the capital that keeps our communities \nhealthy, from lawyers who go after deep pocket firms and file suits \nagainst people just because their projections did not come true.\n This bill will curb private securities fraud lawsuits, but only the \nfrivolous ones that result from abusive practices. Victims of \nsecurities fraud will not be left without remedy. The time for reform \nof this system is now. This bill has 51 cosponsors and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. It is well crafted. It is \ncontentious only because it tries to strike a balance. Whenever you try \nto find a middle ground there are people on either side who think you \nshould go further in their direction. No one can doubt that the system \nis out of control and it needs fixing; that is what we attempt to do \nwith this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Dodd, why do you not proceed and I will follow \nyou, if it is all right?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me inquire, Mr. President, of my colleague from \nMaryland, does my colleague from Maryland, the ranking member of the \nbanking committee if he wishes to proceed first. I am obviously \ninterested in the bill, but I also appreciate immensely the seniority \nsystem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We are quite happy to hear the three proponents of the \nbill who are on the floor now. We heard from Senator D'Amato, and we \nwould be happy to hear from the Senator from Connecticut and Senator \nDomenici. And then those of us who oppose it might have a chance to \nmake our statements. But I would be happy to defer to the Senator from \nConnecticut. Then we can address his comments.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague from New Mexico. \nI worked with him for a long time on this issue, Mr. President. We go \nback several years. This is not a recent event but rather goes back \ninto the previous Congress and before, so I thank him for his \ntremendous efforts in helping us fashion a piece of legislation here \nthat we hope will attract the support of a substantial number of our \ncolleagues. It has already, as my colleague from New York pointed out--\nand I thank my colleague from New York, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, for his leadership on this issue for setting up a set of \nhearings for us, timely hearings, and a markup of this legislation and \nbringing the bill to the floor.\n  I also want to commend my colleague from Maryland who has a different \npoint of view on this legislation but nonetheless is working \ncooperatively with us, expressing his points of view very forcefully \nand offered various amendments in the committee, and I am confident he \nwill again on the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is an important day for American investors and \nfor the American economy. This is the day we start a full Senate debate \non a bill that would restore, in my view, fairness and integrity to our \nsecurities litigation system.\n  To some this may sound like a dry and technical subject. But in \nreality it is crucial to our investors, our economy and our \ninternational competitiveness. We are all counting on our high-\ntechnology firms to fuel our economy into the 21st century. We are \ncounting on them to lead the charge for us in the global marketplace, \nso to speak. Those are the same firms that are most hamstrung, I would \npoint out, by a securities litigation system that, frankly, works for \nno one, save plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  Over the past year-and-a-half the process by which private \nindividuals bring securities lawsuits has been under the microscope. \nThe result of this intense scrutiny has been to dramatically change the \nterms of the debate. We are no longer arguing about whether the current \nsystem needs to be repaired. We are now focused on how best to repair \nit. Even those who once maintained that the litigation system needed no \nreform are now conceding that substantive and meaningful changes are \nrequired if we are to maintain the fundamental integrity of private \nsecurities litigation.\n  The flaws, Mr. President, of the current system are simply too \nobvious to deny. The record is replete with examples of how the system \nis being abused, and misused. In fact, the Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, said at the beginning of this \nyear--and I quote him--``There is no denying,'' he said, ``that there \nare real problems in the current system,''--speaking of securities \nlitigation--``problems that need to be addressed not just because of \nabstract rights and responsibilities, but because investors and markets \nare being hurt by litigation excesses.''\n  The legislation under consideration today is based upon a bill that \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico and I have introduced for the \nlast several Congresses. While there are some provisions from the \noriginal version of S. 240 that, frankly, I would have liked to have \nseen included in this bill--and we will discuss that later--I \nunderstand, as I think my colleagues do, the need to produce a \nconsensus document if you are going to proceed. Producing a balanced \nbill is never easy. The old saw, Mr. President, that ``if a compromise \nmakes everyone somewhat angry, then it must be fair'' is perfectly apt \nfor today's debate. But that is what we have today, Mr. President, a \nbill that carefully and considerately balances the need for our high-\ngrowth industries with the legitimate rights of investors, large and \nsmall.\n  I am proud of the spirit of fairness and equity that permeates this \nlegislation. I am also proud, Mr. President, of the fact that this \nlegislation tackles a very complicated and difficult issue in a \nthoughtful way that avoids excess and achieves, I believe, and I think \nmy colleagues from New York and New Mexico do, a meaningful equilibrium \nunder which all of the interested parties can survive and thrive.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, perhaps most importantly, this is a broadly \nbipartisan effort. This bill passed the [[Page S 8894]] Banking \nCommittee 11-4, with strong support from both sides of the political \naisles. And the 51 cosponsors of S. 240 in this body are composed of \nU.S. Senators from both parties, reflecting all points on the so-called \nideological spectrum. H.L. Mencken once said, every problem has a \nsolution that is neat, simple, and usually wrong. Believe me, if there \nwere a simple solution to the problem besetting securities litigation \ntoday almost everyone in this Chamber would have jumped at it. But \nthose problems are so pervasive and complex that we have moved far \nbeyond the point where the public interest is served by waiting for the \ncourts or other bodies to fix them for us.\n  The private securities litigation system is far too important to the \nintegrity and vitality of American capital markets to continue to allow \nit to be undermined by those who seek to line their own pockets with \nabusive and meritless suits. Let me be clear, Mr. President, private \nsecurities litigation is an indispensable tool with which defrauded \ninvestors can recover their losses without having to rely upon \nGovernment action.\n  Mr. President, I cannot possibly overstate just how critical \nsecurities lawsuits brought by private individuals are to ensuring \npublic and global confidence in our capital markets. I believe that \nvery deeply. These private actions help deter wrongdoing, help \nguarantee that corporate officers, auditors and directors, lawyers and \nothers properly perform their jobs. That is the high standard to which \nthis legislation seeks to return the securities litigation system. But \nas it stands today, the current system has drifted so far from that \nnoble role that we see more buccaneering barristers taking advantage of \nthe system than we do corporate wrongdoers being exposed by it.\n  But there is more at risk, Mr. President, if we fail to reform this \nflawed system. Quite simply put, the way the private litigation system \nworks today is costing millions of investors, the vast majority of whom \ndo not participate in these lawsuits, their hard-earned cash. As Ralph \nWhitworth of the United Shareholders Association told the securities \nsubcommittee--I quote him--``The winners in these suits are invariably \nlawyers who collect huge contingency fees, professional 'plaintiffs,' \nwho''--as our colleague from New York has already described-- ``collect \nbonuses, and, in cases where fraud has been committed, executives and \nboard members who use corporate funds and corporate-owned insurance \npolicies to escape personal liability. The one constant,'' he went on \nto say, ``is that the shareholders pay for it all.''\n  And Maryellen Anderson from the Connecticut Retirement and Trust \nFunds testified that the participants in the pension funds,\n\n       * * * are the ones who are hurt if a system allows someone \n     to force us to spend huge sums of money in legal costs * * * \n     when that plaintiff is disappointed in his or her investment.\n       Our pensions and jobs depend on our employment by and \n     investment in our companies.\n       If we saddle our companies with big and unproductive costs \n     * * *. We cannot be surprised if our jobs and raises begin to \n     disappear and our pensions come up short as our population \n     ages.\n\n  There lies the risk of allowing the current securities litigation \nsystem to continue to run out of control. Ultimately, it is the average \ninvestor, the retired pensioner who will pay the enormous costs clearly \nassociated with this growing problem.\n  Much of the problem lies in the fact that private litigation has \nevolved over the years as a result of court decisions rather than \nexplicit congressional action.\n  Private actions under rule 10(b) were never expressly set out by \nCongress, but have been construed and refined by courts, with the tacit \nconsent of Congress.\n  But the lack of congressional involvement in shaping private \nlitigation has created conflicting legal standards and has provided too \nmany opportunities for abuse of investors and companies.\n  First, it has become increasingly clear that securities class actions \nare extremely vulnerable to abuses by entrepreneurs masquerading as \nlawyers. As two noted legal scholars recently wrote in the Yale Law \nReview:\n\n       * * * The potential for opportunism in class actions is so \n     pervasive and evidence that plaintiffs' attorneys sometimes \n     act opportunistically so substantial that it seems clear that \n     plaintiffs' attorneys often do not act as investors' \n     ``faithful champions.''\n\n  It is readily apparent to many observers in business, academia--and \neven Government--that plaintiffs' attorneys appear to control the \nsettlement of the case with little or no influence from either the \n``named'' plaintiffs or the larger class of investors.\n  For example, during the extensive hearings on the issue before the \nSubcommittee on Securities, a lawyer cited one case as a supposed \nshowpiece--using his words--of how well the existing system works. This \nparticular case was settled before trial for $33 million.\n  The lawyers asked the court for more than $20 million of that amount \nin fees and costs. The court then awarded the plaintiffs' lawyers $11 \nmillion and the defense lawyers for the company $3 million.\n  Investors recovered only 6.5 percent of their recoverable damages. \nThat is 6\\1/2\\ cents on the dollar.\n  That is a case cited by those who are opposed to this legislation as \na show-case example of how the system works.\n  This kind of settlement sounds good for entrepreneurial attorneys, \nbut it does little to benefit companies, investors or even the \nplaintiffs on whose behalf the suit was brought.\n  It should not surprise anyone that those who benefit most from the \nflaws in the current system are the same people who are the most \nvociferous in opposing the provisions in this bill that would clean up \nthe mess.\n  It is not the companies, nor investors nor even plaintiffs--large or \nsmall--who are fueling the opposition.\n  The loudest squeals come from the lawyers who will no longer be able \nto feather their nests by picking clean as many corporate defendants as \npossible.\n  A second area of abuse is frivolous litigation. Companies, \nparticularly in the high-technology and bio-technology industries, face \ngroundless securities litigation days or even hours after adverse \nearnings announcements.\n  In fact, the chilling consequence of these lawsuits is that \ncompanies, especially new companies in emerging industries, frequently \nrelease only the minimum information required by law so that they will \nnot be held liable for any innocent, forward-looking statement that \nthey may make.\n  In fact, I received a letter just this past Monday from Raytheon Co., \none of the Nation's largest high-technology firms.\n  Raytheon made a tender offer of $64 a share for E-Systems, Inc., a \n41-percent premium over the closing market price. Let me allow Raytheon \nto explain what happened next:\n\n       Notwithstanding the widely held view that the proposed \n     transaction was eminently fair to E-Systems shareholders, the \n     first of eight purported class action suits was filed less \n     than 90 minutes after the courthouse doors opened on the day \n     that the transaction was announced. Ninety minutes, Mr. \n     President. This was a letter sent to me on June 19.\n  You tell me we do not have a problem here. Minutes after \nannouncement, the lawsuits, before any examination, any inquiry is \nmade, 90 minutes later there is a lawsuit being filed for millions of \ndollars claiming unfairness. That is what is wrong, and that is what \nthis bill tries to correct. This ought not to be a matter of division \nin this body. This is a mess, and it should be cleaned up.\n  No one lawyer could possibly have investigated the facts this \nquickly. What the lawyers want is to force a quick settlement. That is \nall this is. This is a holdup. You would get arrested in most States if \nyou try to do this to a retailer.\n  The Supreme Court in Blue Chip Stamps versus Manor Drug Store echoed \nthis concern about abusive litigation, pointing out:\n\n       [I]n the field of Federal securities laws governing \n     disclosure of information, even a complaint which by \n     objective standards may have very little success at trial has \n     a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to \n     its prospect of success at trial . . . the very pendency of \n     the lawsuit may frustrate or delay normal business activity \n     of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.\n\n  The third area of abuse is that the current framework for assessing \nliability is simply unfair and creates a powerful incentive to sue \nthose with the [[Page S 8895]] deepest pockets, regardless of their \nrelative complicity in the alleged fraud.\n  The result of the existing system of joint and severable liability is \nthat plaintiffs' attorneys seek out any possible corporation or \nindividual that has little relation to the alleged fraud--but which may \nhave extensive insurance coverage or otherwise may have financial \nreserves.\n  Although these defendants could frequently win their case were it to \ngo to trial--we all know it happens--the expense of protracted \nlitigation and the threat of being forced to pay all the damages makes \nit more economically efficient for them to settle with the plaintiffs' \nattorneys, and that is what happens.\n  The current Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, as well as two former \nChairmen, Richard Breeden and David Ruder, have all spoken out against \nthe abuses of joint and several liability.\n  Chairman Levitt said at the April 6 hearing of the Securities \nsubcommittee that he was concerned, in particular, ``about accountants \nbeing unfairly charged for amounts that go far beyond their involvement \nin particular fraud.''\n  Frequently, these settlements do not appreciably increase the amount \nof losses recovered by the actual plaintiffs, but instead add to the \nfees collected by the plaintiff's attorneys.\n  Again, the current system has devolved to a point where it favors \nthose lawyers who are looking out for their own financial interest over \nthe interest of virtually everybody else involved, and that is the \nfact.\n  The bill before us today contains four major initiatives to deal with \nthese complex problems. Let me identify them briefly.\n  First, the legislation empowers investors so that they, not their \nlawyers, have greater control over their class action cases by allowing \nthe plaintiff with the greatest claim to be the named plaintiff and \nallowing that plaintiff to select their counsel.\n  That sounds so commonsensical, I do not know why we have to write it \ninto law, but that is what you have to do. In fairness to the \nplaintiff, that ought to be the lead plaintiff.\n  Second, it gives investors better tools to recover losses and \nenhances existing provisions designed to deter fraud, including \nproviding a meaningful safe harbor for legitimate forward-looking \nstatements so that issuers are encouraged, instead of discouraged, from \nvolunteering much-needed disclosures that potential investors ought to \nhave in making decisions about whether to invest or not.\n  Third, it limits opportunities for frivolous or abusive lawsuits and \nmakes it easier to impose sanctions on those lawyers who violate their \nbasic professional ethics.\n  Fourth, it rationalizes the liability of deep-pocket defendants, \nwhile protecting the ability of small investors to fully collect all \ndamages awarded them through a trial or settlement.\n  I would like to go into each of these provisions in a bit more \ndetail.\n\n\n                          empowering investors\n\n  The legislation ensures that investors, not a few marauding \nattorneys, decide whether to bring a case, whether to settle, and how \nmuch the lawyers should receive, and that is the way it ought to work.\n  The bill strongly encourages the courts to appoint the investor with \nthe greatest losses--usually an institutional investor like a pension \nfund--to be the lead plaintiff.\n  This plaintiff would have the right to select the lawyer to pursue \nthe case on behalf of the class.\n  So for the first time in a long time, plaintiffs' lawyers would have \nto answer to a real client, not one they have hired.\n  We are bringing an end to the days when a plaintiffs' attorney can \ncrow to Forbes magazine that ``I have the greatest practice of law in \nthe world. I have no clients.''\n  That is one of the lawyers talking. A practice without clients, and \nthat is what this has turned into.\n  The bill requires that notice of settlement agreements that are sent \nto investors clearly spell out important facts such as how much \ninvestors are getting--or giving up--by settling and how much their \nlawyers will receive in the settlement.\n  This means that plaintiffs would be able to make an informed decision \nabout whether the settlement is in their best interest--or in their \nlawyers' best interest.\n  Again, what a radical thought to be included in the bill, allowing \nthe plaintiffs to decide what is in their interest rather than the \nattorneys deciding it. The fact we even have to write this into law \ntells you volumes about the mess the present system is in.\n  And the bill would end the practice of the actual plaintiffs \nreceiving, on average, only 6 to 14 cents for every dollar lost, while \n33 cents of every settlement dollar goes to the plaintiffs' attorneys. \nThis is the average you get back as a plaintiff under the present \nsystem.\n  The bill would require that the courts cap the award of lawyers' fees \nbased upon how much is recovered by the investors. And that is what it \nought to be, how much do the investors get back as plaintiffs, then you \nset the fees.\n  Simply putting in a big bill will not guarantee the lawyers \nmultimillion-dollar fees if their clients are not the primary \nbeneficiaries of the settlement.\n  Taken together, Mr. President, these provisions should ensure that \ndefrauded investors are not cheated a second time by a few unscrupulous \nlawyers who siphon huge fees right off the top of any settlement.\n  The bill requires auditors to detect and report fraud to the SEC, \nthus enhancing the reliability of independent audits.\n  The bill maintains current standards of joint and several liability, \nfor those persons who knowingly engage in a fraudulent scheme, thus \nkeeping a heavy financial penalty for those who would commit knowing \nsecurity fraud.\n  The bill restores the ability of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to pursue those who aid and abet in securities fraud, a \npower that was diminished by the Supreme Court in last year's Central \nBank decision.\n  The bill clarifies current requirements that lawyers should have some \nfacts to back up their assertion of securities fraud by adopting the \nreasonable standards established by the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Again, Mr. President, imagine that--you have to have facts to \nback up your assertion. I thought that is what they taught you. I \nlearned that in the first year of law school. Now I have to write it \ninto the legislation here because we get these 90-minute lawsuits being \nfiled. So we require that in the bill as well.\n  This legislation is there for using a pleading standard that has been \nsuccessfully tested in the real world. This is not some arbitrary \nstandard pulled out of a hat or crafted in committee; it follows the \nFederal courts.\n  The bill requires the courts, at settlement, to determine whether any \nattorney violated rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nwhich prohibits lawyers from filing claims that they know to be \nfrivolous.\n  If a violation has occurred, the bill mandates that the court must \nlevy sanctions against the offending attorney. Though the bill does not \nchange existing standards of conduct, it does put some teeth into the \nenforcement of these standards.\n  The bill provides a moderate and, I think, thoughtful statutory safe \nharbor for predicative statements made by companies that are registered \nwith the SEC.\n  Further, the bill provides no such safety for third parties, like \nbrokers, or in the case of merger offers, tenders, roll-ups, or the \nissuance of penny stocks. There are a number of other exceptions to the \nsafe harbor provisions, as well, Mr. President, which my colleagues can \nlook at.\n  Importantly, anyone who deliberately makes a false and misleading \nstatement in a forecast is not protected by the safe harbor. My \ncolleague from New York made that point, and I emphasize it again here \nthis afternoon.\n  By adopting this provision, the Senate will encourage, we think, \nresponsible corporations to make the kind of disclosures about \nprojected activities that are currently missing in today's investment \nclimate.\n  This legislation preserves the rights and claims of small investors. \nThe legislation preserves the rights of investors whose losses are 10 \npercent or more of their total net worth of $200,000.\n  These small investors will still be able to hold all defendants \nresponsible for paying off settlements, regardless of the relative \nguilt of each of the named parties. [[Page S 8896]] \n  But while the bill will fully protect small investors, so that they \nwill recover all of the losses to which they are entitled, the bill \nestablishes a proportional liability system to discourage the naming of \ndeep-pocket defendants, merely because they have deep pockets.\n  The court would be required to determine the relative liability of \nall the defendants and thus deep-pocket defendants would only be liable \nto pay a settlement amount equal to their relative role in the alleged \nfraud.\n  A defendant who was only a 10 percent responsible for the fraudulent \nactions would be required to pay 10 percent of the settlement amount.\n  In some circumstances, the bill requires solvent defendants to pay \n150 percent of their share of the damages to help make up for any \nuncollectible amount in the lawsuit.\n  By creating a two-tiered system of both proportional liability and \njoint and several liability, the bill preserves the best features, I \nthink, of both systems.\n  There has been an unfortunate tendency during the course of many \ndebates on these proposed reforms for advocates on both sides to \nincrease the rhetoric, to use increasingly extreme examples in order to \npoliticize and polemicize the atmosphere of this debate.\n  When the steam of overheated rhetoric blows off, when the extremists \non both sides have been discounted, I believe we are left with the \ninescapable conclusion: Action is needed--and needed now, Mr. \nPresident--to make the securities litigation system work in the manner \nfor which it was designed.\n  A system of litigation in which merits and facts matter little, in \nwhich plaintiffs recover less than lawyers, in which defendants are \nnamed solely on the basis of the amount of their insurance coverage, or \nthe size of their wallets, does not serve us well at all.\n  In short, we have a system in which there is increasingly little \nintegrity and confidence--a system incapable of producing confidence \nand integrity in our Nation's capital markets.\n  This bill is an important step in repairing an ailing system. It is a \nbill that has strong bipartisan support within this Chamber. And it has \nbroad support outside these walls, as well, from virtually every \nsegment of the business and investment community.\n  Mr. President, this legislation needs to be enacted and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I noted that our colleague from New Mexico was on the \nfloor. I do not know whether or not he is still here. I see him now.\n  I yield the floor, and we will now hear from the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say that when I first \nstarted working on this legislation--actually, it came to me after \nreading some articles about the litigation and the contention of both \nsides as to what was happening to class action lawsuits as they applied \nto securities and to companies that issued stocks and securities and \nbonds--I came to a conclusion that it would be a very interesting thing \nto look into and, perhaps, see what I could do.\n  I made one glaring mistake. I had arrived at the conclusion that \nthere was something very, very wrong, but I failed to understand, I say \nto my friend and cosponsor--and we varied. I put it in one time and the \nSenator put it in the next time. It was Domenici-Dodd and then Dodd-\nDomenici. But I failed to recognize how those lawyers, small in number, \nfor this is not the whole of America, this is a small group. I failed \nto recognize or perceive how tough they were going to be in saving \ntheir domain--and tough they are, and tough they are to this day. They \nare getting people to run advertisements in our States--in my State, it \nis not so easy because Representative Richardson, a Democrat, voted for \nthe House reform; I am for it here, and all the Representatives from \nNew Mexico voted for it. I do not know where Senator Bingaman is, but \nhe was a cosponsor. Maybe he does not like the bill on the floor. So I \nam not talking for myself on these ads. Can you imagine what point we \nhave reached, in terms of lawyering, and the old concept of who the \nlawyers work for? Who do they belong to? They belong to the justice \nsystem and they work for the courts of America. Here they are running \nads and protecting their domain. It is rather amazing. I never thought \nwe were going to get into this when we started down this path, but I \nsoon found out.\n  I want to say that, while this cries out for reform, apparently our \njudges are not going to make the reform, although they created the \nrules; these are court-created private rights of action, as I \nunderstand it. Section 10b private lawsuits are not statutory. Judges \ncreated it. They are not going to fix it. Although, there seems to be a \ntendency, in the last 6 months, for the judges to be a little more \nthrough this process. Senator Dodd explained that somewhere they caught \nthem red-handed. Ninety minutes after an announcement of a merger \nintention, they are suing for collusion or fraud and just claiming huge \ndamages. The courts are beginning to say, ``What is this?''\n  But I began to find out, when we started having our first hearings, \nthat we were talking about some very, very rich lawyers--not rich over \n40 years of practice or an accumulation of assets, but because they \nmade millions every year--not a few hundred thousand dollars, but \nmillions. And surely it would be tough for them to ever appreciate that \nmaybe they were not adding very much of a positive nature to the United \nStates society, or to securities or bonds or stocks, or to the \nplaintiffs that they sued for as a class.\n  Now, our country is suffering from hyperlexia. That is a nice word, \nand I believe it means a serious disease caused by an excessive \nreliance on law and lawyers. Hyperlexia. It is a disease--and a disease \nit is. For those who think that hyperlexia, relying upon law and \nlawyers, is the basic ingredient for good regulation, for good \nbehavior, you have just told the American people that it is going to \ncost you an awful lot of money for that, because it is inconclusive, \nand very vague. Each case sets its own pattern. So people do not know \nhow to behave and what the law is.\n  So from this Senator's standpoint, I do not think we would be here if \nit were not for the chairman of the Banking Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, who took this \ncause on and, obviously, is leading it here on the floor today. He \nbrought a balance to it, because he had a feel for both sides. I thank \nhim tonight because we are going to make some good, solid law. When it \nis interpreted by our courts and by the bar of America, we are going to \nend up doing right, because those who are cheating and ripping off \nstockholders--they are going to still get stuck, but those doing almost \nnothing wrong, except their company's stock price goes up or down, they \nare no longer going to get stuck for millions in settlements just to \npay to the lawyers.\n  So, from this Senator's standpoint, I do not usually use words like \nvexatious or vexatiousness, but I found that the Supreme Court \ndescribed this confusing system, ``presents a danger of vexatiousness, \ndifferent in degree and kind from that which accompanies litigation in \ngeneral.'' I believe my good friend Senator Dodd alluded to that; that \nis, there is a degree and a kind of vexatiousness about this that is \nmuch different from a normal complaint in a lawsuit in negligence or \nother Common Law torts.\n  So let me define the word. I tried to find out what does the word \nmeans, because to me it meant to bring fear or such. It comes from a \nverb, to vex, which means, ``to harass, to torment, to annoy, to \nirritate and to worry.'' And, as a noun it is synonymous with \n``troublesome.'' In the legal context it means ``a case without \nsufficient grounds brought in order to cause annoyance to the defendant \nor a proceeding instituted maliciously and without probable cause.''\n  It is time that we stop vexatious securities litigation, and fix it \nwe will. During our hearings--and I am no longer on the Banking \nCommittee, and I will help the chairman out wherever I can for the next \ncouple of days as we attempt to pass this legislation, but obviously \nthe responsibility and the credit is to the Banking Committee and those \nwho are working on it now.\n  During the hearings, we found that the threat of a huge jury award is \nbeing misused to sue emerging, rapidly [[Page S 8897]] growing \ncompanies, especially in the high-technology and biomedical \ntechnologies where stock prices are volatile under the best of \ncircumstances. A drop in a stock price is all that these--and I will \ncall them, for the remainder of my discussion on the floor, I will name \nthose lawyers involved in this as a new kind of lawyer. I will call \nthem entrepreneurial lawyers, because they are in it to manage the \nsuit, and in a very real sense the lawsuit becomes their business \nrather than the business of the plaintiff. The way it is currently \nstructured, they do not even have to respond to anyone.\n  Let me proceed.\n  Cases settle regardless of merit. We could go on with many, many \nreasons for this litigation not serving the public good. But let me \nwrap up with just one on this first part of my comments. This system is \nnot deterring fraud because insurance companies, most of the time, make \nthe settlements and pay the money. So what we have and what is wrong \nwith this system is very, very fundamental. Lawyers, not clients, \ncontrol these cases. That is number one.\n  Number two, this system obstructs voluntary disclosure of \ninformation. Who will voluntarily disclose information when they are \napt to be liable for just doing that?\n  And the last is defendants are forced to settle meritless cases. When \nyou add that up, it is time to change the system.\n  The Wall Street Journal labeled these cases as ``the class action \nshakedown racket.'' That is what it is, a shakedown racket.\n  Let me talk about who wins when one of these lawsuits is settled, for \nthis is the most significant part of it all. Investors are only \nrecovering about 7 cents on the dollar when compared with the amount of \nlosses alleged. The lawyers earned on average $2.12 million per \nsettlement, about 30 percent of the whole, during a 12-month period \nending July of 1993 according to a study by the National Economic \nResearch Association.\n  Other studies confirm that investors recover only 6 to 14 cents under \nthe system. Obviously, the system is not working, because the SEC and \nothers who have analyzed it say that a system, to be working, is \nsupposed to do the following. The primary yardstick is that it enables \ndefrauded investors to seek compensatory damages and thereby recover \nthe full amount of their losses. So we ought to start by measuring this \nsystem against the criterion of full amount of losses recovered. You \nwill find it fails. On a scale of A through F--F being failure. It gets \nworse than an F in terms of its ineffectiveness.\n  As investors are recovering a few cents on the dollar, attorneys are \nboasting that these securities class actions are a perfect practice, \naccording to--I think my friend from Connecticut quoted this one--one \nof these distinguished lawyers, who said in Forbes magazine, ``The \nreason this is a great practice is because there are no clients.''\n  These are clientless lawsuits. These are clientless lawyers who claim \nto be acting in the best interests of investors. The institutional \ninvestors believe that these lawsuits are merely transferring money \nfrom one set of shareholders to another with the plaintiffs' class \naction lawyers taking a lion's share. That looks a lot like greenmail.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. You speak of clientless lawyers and clientless cases. Is \nthat the reason all of the money goes to the lawyers and not to the \nclients?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You got it. As a matter of fact, what it really means \nis that the lawyers have quickly become more interested in settling a \nlawsuit on terms that are satisfactory to their pockets. So, if it \nlooks like they can fight on but they are going to get $6 million in \nthis settlement and the others are going to get 8 cents on their \nshares, that is looking pretty good.\n  What prevents it from happening? Maybe the judges are getting more \ninvolved now. But, normally, for many and many a year, nobody had \nanything to say about it. In reality, although if you had a lawyer \nhere, he would tell you that he is bound by this and he is bound by \nthat and the judge can do this and the judge can do that. But history \nsays they are getting the lion's share of the money and the client or \nplaintiff is not getting very much.\n  Does one think the client is managing the case and calling the shots? \nIn many cases the members of the class do not even know what is \nhappening. Let me also tell you, plaintiffs are not making very much \nunless they are very fortunate. If they are professional plaintiffs, \nthey are doing pretty well because they receive bonuses of $10,000 to \n$15,000 for letting the lawyers use their names, and, frankly, we are \ngoing to prohibit that. I think that ought to be prohibited and should \nhave been prohibited. It has no place in solid lawyering. What happens \nis some people have shares in 300 or 400 companies and the lawyers the \nsame person's name on 20, 30, 50 lawsuits. These are individuals with \n10 shares and the lawyers give them this bonus. The rest of the class \ndoes not make very much, but that fellow does very well. I think we had \none, Mr. President, who was 92 or 94 years old that we found out--do \nyou remember that case? He had a lot of these. He had 10 shares of \nstock and he was a very big friend of these entrepreneurial law firms. \nHe was readily available. He pulled the trigger.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that the judge referred to him in \none case as ``the unluckiest investor in the world'' because he was \nalways suing for losses. He did not invest in order to make any money. \nHe invested so he could be a professional plaintiff, and he was in \ncourt so often the judge referred to him in that manner.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was not there when that was done and I do not recall \nit, but it surely seems right to me. And if you say it, it happened. It \nis exactly what is happening.\n  The race to the courthouse has been described by both the chairman of \nthe full committee and by Senator Dodd. I will not proceed beyond \nsaying that whenever you find, in the American judicial system, that a \nsubstantial portion of a certain kind of lawsuit is based upon the \npremise that whoever gets to the courthouse first gets to control the \nlawsuit, then it seems to me you do not have to have that situation \nvery long until you ought to look and see what is this all about? \nBecause it is an invitation to craft poor complaints, to state anything \nyou want or invent things and then waste a year and a half of time, \nmoney, and take depositions to try to find out whether you have a \nlawsuit or not. When I started practicing law--maybe that is passe--\nthat was not the way to practice. Now it seems to be for many of those, \nand they would like to keep it that way for this system.\n  It also makes us do sloppy legal work--not us but those who are doing \nit--sloppy legal work. The cookie-cutter complaint, which is probably \nthe one the Senator referred to as to Raytheon--cookie-cutter \ncomplaint. All the allegations are the same, case after case. Senator \nD'Amato, we have one, they always use the same allegations and the same \nwords. The lawyers just change the name of the company being sued--it \npops out of the computer. In fact, I think some of them have terminals \nwhere they are hooked into the stock market. The stock is going to \nfluctuate and the computer is going to spit out a lawsuit.\n  The lawyer just signs his name on it. But a judge took one of these \nnot so lightly because a plaintiff's lawyer inserted in the complaint \nthe name of the company he was suing: Philip Morris. They accused \nPhilip Morris of fraudulently manufacturing toys, t-o-y-s, not \ncigarettes. Philip Morris does not manufacture toys, a typical cookie \ncutter complaint--a demand for hundreds of millions of dollars in \ndamages. This bill is about stopping this kind of lawsuit. It is shoot, \naim, ready. Instead of ready, aim, shoot, it is shoot, aim, ready.\n  The National Association of Securities and Commercial Lawyers \nsuggests that 56 percent of the cases they had hand picked to provide \ndata on to the Securities Subcommittee were filed within 30 days of the \ntriggering event. A triggering event is usually a missed earnings \nprojection, a so-called earnings surprise. Twenty-one percent of the \ncases were filed within 48 hours of [[Page S 8898]] the triggering \nevent. The stock prices dropped, and class action suits are filed with \nlittle due diligence to investigate the basis of the case.\n  But you can count on it. If the lawyer is a good entrepreneur and \nsticks with it, he will get paid something even for that kind of suit, \nwhether there is anything to the suit. Companies have to settle.\n  Of the 111 cases filed in 1990 and 1991, 25 percent were filed by pet \nplaintiffs, the plaintiff that we described a while ago. In 25 percent \nof the cases, they went out and hired the plaintiff and paid them a \nbonus. Even if they had a lawsuit that was decent, the point of it is \nthat was an effort to get to the courthouse quick with the pet \nplaintiff. So you could be the lead counsel, or at least you could \nmaybe be representing $500 million worth of securities for a $150, \n$200, $300 pet plaintiff.\n  So from this Senator's standpoint, the bill before us is a very good \napproach to settling and solving these problems. As I see it, the \ndetails of this bill will be debated and amendments will be offered. So \nI am not going to go into details.\n  But I would like to just close with one current situation. I know \nabout it because a company has one of its biggest production plants in \nNew Mexico. The general counsel for Intel testified that Intel had been \nsued. When it was a startup, such a suit probably would have bankrupted \nthe company long before it investigated in microchips.\n  This is an example of the innovation and entrepreneurship that these \ncases are threatening to snuff out. So let me give you one about Intel. \nIf this had been filed when it was a young company, we would not have \nIntel.\n  On December 19, 1994, Intel was sued over the flaw in the Pentium \nchip. Despite the fact that it would take 29,000 years for the chip's \nflaw to become apparent, and despite the fact that on December 20, \n1994, Intel responded to market concerns about the chip by implementing \nits ``no questions asked'' replacement policy. The lawyers who filed on \nDecember 19 are asking $6 million in fees for 1 day's work. Even though \nthey dropped the suit and Intel did not have to pay anything to the \nshareholders, the lawyers have inserted a provision in the settlement \nwhich forbids defendants, the defendant Intel, from publicly discussing \nthe fee or any other provision of the settlement.\n  S. 240 before this Senate would require disclosure of settlements, \neven this kind of settlement--nothing to the plaintiffs, everything to \nthe lawyers. With better disclosure I doubt whether that will happen \nvery often.\n  Can you imagine a public disclosure for that? We did not do anything \nfor anyone, but we get $6 million. That is nice. It is interesting. \nWould you not like to be doing that? It is pretty good. It might even \nbe better than being a Senator. Who knows?\n  Well, there are many more like this. I have a great deal of \nexplanation.\n  Prof. Joseph Grundfest of Stanford Law School has said that the \nplaintiffs lawyers have done little if anything to earn their hefty \nrequest.\n  Says Grundfest: ``much of the settlement would have come about even \nif no lawsuit was filed * * * to reward lawyers for that at all is the \nequivalent of double-dipping.''\n  Mesa Airlines' officers and directors were sued for keeping their \nmouth shut. They had a corporate policy not to talk to analysts. The \nanalysts make some projections about Mesa. The airline neither \nconfirmed nor denied whether they agreed or disagreed with the \nanalysts. The mesa officers just tried to run an efficient airline. The \nplaintiff's lawyers have alleged that Mesa's failure to talk about \nanalysts' projections was ``deemed to be acceptance'' of the content of \nthe analysts' prediction. The company missed the earnings projections, \ntheir stock price dropped, and they got sued.\n  Prudential Bache Securities. Investors represented by the firm who \ntestified before the committee received 4 cents on the dollar under the \nclass action lawsuit settlement. The firm took $6 million plus \nexpenses. Other investors who hired their own lawyers, and went to \narbitration came away fully compensated.\n  Frivolous litigation is time-consuming and distracts chief executive \nand other corporate officials from productive economic activity. It has \nbeen estimated that defending one of these lawsuits is as costly as \nstarting up a totally new product line.\n  These frivolous lawsuits are such a menace to publicly traded \ncompanies on the NASDAQ that the NASDAQ Self-Regulatory Organization \ndecided to recommend reforms to Senator Dodd and me.\n\n\n                            system is broken\n\n  The conclusion of any one who has examined the issue carefully is: \nThe current securities implied private litigation system is broken. The \nsystem is broken because too many cases are pursued for the purpose of \nextracting settlements from corporations and other parties, without \nregard to the merits of the case. The settlements yield large fees for \nplaintiffs' lawyers but compensate investors only for a fraction of \ntheir actual losses. Janet Cooper Alexander of Stanford University has \nproven that most securities class actions are settled by the parties \nwithout regard to whether the case has merit. Chairman of the SEC, \nArthur Levitt acknowledged that ``virtually all securities class \nactions are settled for some fraction of the claimed damages, and some \nalleged that settlements often fail to reflect the underlying merits of \nthe cases. If true, this means that weak claims are overcompensated and \nstrong claims are undercompensated.'' Prof. John Coffee has concluded \nthe plaintiffs' attorneys in many securities class actions appear to \n``sell out their clients in return for an overly generous fee award,'' \nand that the defendants may also join in this collusion by passing on \nthe cost of the settlement to absent parties, such as insurers.''\n  The plaintiffs' lawyers like to sue the officers and directors, and \nthe accountants, underwriters and issuers. These cases are brought \nunder joint and several liability which means that any one defendant \ncould be made to pay the entire judgment even if he or she were only \nmarginally responsible. If a person is one percent liable he/she could \nbe asked to write a check for 100 percent of the awarded damages. That \nis not fair.\n  Our bill builds upon the State law trend of imposing proportionate \nliability.\n  Under proportionate liability each person found responsible pays a \nshare of the damages that is equivalent to the harm he or she caused.\n  Our bill would retain joint and several liability for the really bad \nactors, but would provide proportionate liability for those parties \nonly incidentally involved. In response to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission's staff concern we also included a special provision to \naddress the problem of the insolvent codefendant. We believe this \nprovision strikes the correct balance. This liability reform is \nimportant to outside officers and directors, auditors and others who \noften get named in the law suit but who have little if any true \nliability. It helps change the economics that drive these frivolous \ncases.\n\n\n                           BIG MONEY DAMAGES\n\n  The system seeks huge monetary recoveries from outside directors, \noutside lawyers, and independent accountants who may be only marginally \ninvolved in activities for which corporate officers should be primarily \nliable. Experienced people are declining to serve on boards because of \nthe liability exposure. This denies growing companies the expertise \nthey need to succeed. The system is not deterring fraud because \ninsurance companies pay most of the settlement amount.\n  The current system also discriminates against defendants. People who \nhave deep pockets are often named in the law suits to coerce \nsettlements. Accountants bear the brunt of our current system of joint \nand several liability. Suing the accountant insures that the settlement \nwill be 50 percent larger because of their deep pocket.\n  The fundamental purposes of the Federal securities laws are to \npromote investor confidence and deter fraud. But the system is failing \nits deterrent mission. A system where the merits don't matter isn't a \ndeterrent. A system where most settlement funds are paid by insurance \ncompanies isn't a deterrent.\n  A system that is having a chilling effect on corporate disclosure is \nactually working at cross-purposes with its objective. Class action \nsecurities cases inhibit voluntary disclosure by corporations, \ndiscouraging them from making any public statements except [[Page S \n8899]] when absolutely required, for fear that anything they say which \nmight move the company's stock price might trigger a lawsuit.\n  In order for our capital markets to function efficiently, for Wall \nStreet analysts to evaluate stocks, or for main street investors to \nbuy, hold, or sell a stock, they need a lot of information. An \nimportant type of information is the projections of how the company \nwill do in the future--the so-called forward-looking statement.\n  By its definition, a forward looking statement is a prediction about \nthe future. Earnings projections, growth rate projections, dividend \nprojections, and expected order rates are examples of forward looking \nstatements. Predictions about the future have become one of the more \ncommon types of frivolous securities lawsuits filed.\n  Few people know why it is important for the bill to provide a safe \nharbor for predictive statements. Let me ask a few questions to help my \ncolleagues understand.\n  First, do you believe that earnings projections about the future are \npromises?\n  Second, do you believe stock volatility is stock fraud?\n  Third, do you believe that projections about future earnings should \nbe unanimous among every single employee in the company in order for \nthat prediction to be eligible for protection for abusive lawsuits?\n  Fourth, do you believe that it is fraud when an officer or director \nor other employee receives a significant portion of his compensation in \nstock options sells stock regularly?\n  Fifth, if you believe that any statement about future performance \ncan, and should be used against you no matter how well intended, no \nmatter how well reasoned, regardless of how dramatic circumstances \nchange?\n  The five statements I just read are the basis for most predictive \nstatement, class action securities cases.\n  To me, these cases represent everything that I find discouraging \nabout our legal system--professional plaintiffs, fishing expeditions \nfor documents, boiler-plate fraud accusations, contingency fee lawyers, \nand settlement that resemble legal blackmail.\n  A safe harbor is needed to encourage companies to make information \navailable. To keep the system honest, there are laws on the books to \nmake sure that executive trades do not create even the appearance of \nillegal insider trading, the process is highly regulated by the SEC. In \naddition, most companies have their own internal policies regulating \nwhen executives can make trades. These controls ensure that executives \ndo not trade during lengthy black out periods within months of \nimportant announcements. The SEC also has imposed rules regarding \nexecutive selling that require prompt reports, which are then available \nto the investing public.\n  First, if you believe that efficient capital markets need \ninformation, you agree with investors, the SEC, and securities \nanalysts. As the California Public Employees Retirement System \n[CALPERS] recently stated, ``forward-looking statements provide \nextremely valuable and relevant information to investors.''\n  SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt recently wrote: ``There is a need for \na stronger safe harbor than currently exists. The current rules have \nlargely been a failure * * *.''\n  Former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden testified:\n\n       Shareholders are also damaged due to the chilling effect of \n     the current system on the robustness and candor of \n     disclosure. . . . Understanding a company's own assessment of \n     its future potential would be among the most valuable \n     information shareholders and potential investors could have \n     about a firm.\n\n  Second, if you believe that disclosure of information helps investors \nmake intelligent decisions you should be calling for reform because the \nvery nature of forward-looking statements makes them particularly \nfertile ground for abusive lawsuits. If a company fails to meet \nanalysts' profit expectations, or production of a new product is \ndelayed, it is often faced with a law suit. As a result, companies are \nincreasingly reluctant to disclose forward-looking information. \nNumerous studies have documented this trend. According to testimony \ngiven by James Morgan, National Venture Capital Association, one study \nfound that over two-thirds of venture capital firms were reluctant to \ndiscuss their performance with analysts or the public because of the \nthreat of litigation.\n  Keeping quiet is not an escape route from these frivolous cases. One \ncompany in my State had a policy not to talk to analysts which \ndeveloped from a fear of being sued. But they were sued anyway for \nfailing to disagree with an analysts' projection. The legal theory was \nthat the company incorporated by silence the analysis's estimations. \nMesa Airlines is not the only company to be sued for keeping its mouth \nshut.\n  Third, if you recognize that predictions about the future do not \nalways come true and that investing has some risks attached, you should \nsupport the statutory safe harbor: Institutional investors are the most \nprofessional, sophisticated investors in our markets. In addition, they \nhave a fiduciary duty to retirees to prudently manage their pension \nfunds. These institutional investors have argued that forward looking \nstatements accompanied by warnings should be per se immune from \nliability. The Council of Institutional Investors told the SEC that any \nsafe harbor must be 100 percent safe. This means that all information \nin it must be absolutely protected from law suits even if it is \nirrelevant or unintentionally or intentionally false or misleading. The \nbill does not go as far as the institutional investors suggested. We \nthink it strikes the correct balance.\n  The SEC Rule 175 permits issuers to make forward looking statements \nabout certain categories of information provided that the prediction is \nmade in good faith with a reasonable basis. Currently, this SEC safe \nharbor rule actually discourages issuers from voluntarily disclosing \nthis information. To quote the SEC:\n\n       Some have suggested that companies that make voluntary \n     disclosure of forward-looking information subject themselves \n     to a significantly increased risk of securities antifraud \n     class actions.'' As such, ``contrary to the Commission's \n     original intent, the safe harbor is currently invoked on a \n     very limited basis in the litigation context.'' Critics state \n     that the safe harbor is ineffective in ensuring quick and \n     inexpensive dismissal of frivolous private lawsuits. (SEC \n     Securities Act of 1993 Release No. 7101, October 1994)\n\n  An American Stock Exchange survey supports that conclusion. It found \nthat 75 percent of corporate CEO's limit the information disclosed to \ninvestors out of fear that greater disclosure would lead to an abusive \nlawsuit.\n  As the SEC has realized, forward-looking statements are predictions--\nnot promises. This bill recognizes that a reasonable basis for such \ninformation doesn't have to be a unanimous basis. This bill creates a \nstatutory safe harbor which:\n  Provides a clear definition of ``forward looking statement'' for both \nthe 1933 and 1934 acts;\n  Covers written and oral statements;\n  Requires that the predictive statement contain a Miranda warning \ndescribing the statement as a prediction and a disclosure that there is \na risk that the actual results may differ materially from those \npredicted;\n  No safe harbor protection for statements knowingly made with the \nexpectation, purpose, and actual intent of misleading investors. There \nis no so-called license to lie under this bill;\n  Protects statements made by issuers, persons acting on their behalf \nsuch as officers, directors, employees, and outside reviewers retained \nby the issuer. Accounting and law firms are eligible for the safe \nharbor, brokers and dealers are not;\n  No safe harbor protection for initial public offerings [IPOs], penny \nstocks, roll-up transactions and issuers who have violated the \nsecurities laws;\n  Provides the SEC with new authority to sue for damages on behalf of \ninvestors in predictive statement cases. The SEC's recovery should be \nmuch better than the average of 6 cents on the dollar currently \nrecovered by private attorneys;\n  Encourages SEC to review the need for additional safe harbors.\n  New Mexico is a high-technology State. It is the home to Los Alamos \nand Sandia National Laboratories. We have more engineers and PhD's per \ncapita than any State in the Union. High technology and high growth \ncompanies are our future, yet they are the companies that are hit most \noften by frivolous lawsuits. They have volatile stock. I do not really \nsee how New Mexico can expect to develop the spinoff companies from the \nlabs and to [[Page S 8900]] grow high technology companies unless we \npass legislation that has a meaningful safe harbor for predictions \nabout the future.\n  I am pleased that the final bill includes a statutory safe harbor. \nOriginally, S. 240 contained an instruction to the SEC to develop a new \nsafe harbor. However, the SEC has been working on it for more than a \nyear and they are gridlocked. They held some very good hearings and \nsome of the material presented before them has been very useful to the \ncommittee in developing its statutory safe harbor.\n  We want to get back to basics. The central principle underlying the \nsecurities laws is that investors should receive accurate and timely \ndisclosure of the financial condition of publicly traded companies.\n  The objective of this bill is to recognize that litigation isn't \nGeorge Orwell's 1994 version of Big Brother looking out for investors' \nbest interest. We reject ``stock volatility is fraud''; we reject \n``justice is pennies for lawyers''; We reject ``equity is millions for \nlawyers.''\n  S. 240 will encourage disclosure, strengthen confidence, realine the \nrole of the entrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers with the best interests \nof their clients, and change the risk/benefit equation of taking cases \nto the jury.\n  The basis of our bill is to make the plaintiffs' bar, ``Stop, think, \ninvestigate, and research.''\n  The spirit motivating this bill is the obligation that Chairman \nLevitt identified, ``to make sure the current system operates in the \nbest interest of all investors. This means focusing not just on the \ninterests of those who happen to be aggrieved in a particular case, but \nalso on the interests of issuers and the markets as a whole.''\n  With S. 240, we have decided to take a historic step. For the first \ntime since Congress created the Federal securities laws in 1933 and \n1934, we have decided to revisit section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 in order \nto fix many of the problems created by the courts and our own failure \nto act during the past 60 years. If you would like to put an end to the \ninconsistency and confusion, you should support S. 240. If you would \nlike to relieve the courts of the burden of revisiting 10b-5 every year \nand put an end to the judicial activism associated with this area of \nthe law, vote for this bill. If you want to allow the abuse of \ninvestors and companies, the stifling of job creation and the continued \nshaping of the contours of the law to continue, you should vote against \nit. In the end, S. 240 will give courts greater guidance to deal with \nmeritorious securities class actions and greater incentive to eliminate \nmost, if not all, of the frivolous ones. We owe it to investors, \ncompanies, and our capital markets to take this historic step.\n  Mr. President, hopefully, in the next few days, we will change this \nlaw and go to conference with the House, and maybe before this year is \nout, set some of these things straight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleagues now for \nwell over an hour very carefully. This is an important piece of \nlegislation, and it deserves very careful attention. I think perhaps \nthe best summary, in a sense, of some of the statements we have heard \nwas the comment made by my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, \nwho said that there might well be a tendency in the course of debating \nthis bill to use increasingly extreme examples and overheated rhetoric. \nI think that was his exact quote. And we have already seen some of that \nat work over the opening debate that has taken place now for well over \nan hour.\n  I do not know of anyone who differs with the goal of deterring \nfrivolous lawsuits, and sanctioning appropriate parties when such \nlawsuits are filed. My colleague from Connecticut at one point said \nthis bill is an important step in repairing an ailing system. Parts of \nthis bill are an important step in doing that. Other parts of this bill \nwill, in my judgment, contribute to an unhealthy system. And the \nchallenge that is before the Senate over the next few days as we work \nthrough this legislation is to be able to distinguish between those \nparts in this legislation.\n  In the course of this consideration, amendments will be offered. \nAmendments were offered in committee. Some were decided by very close \nvotes. We hope by proposing those amendments to be able to focus on \nwhat the problems are. But let me just generally make the point that \nthis legislation as now drafted will affect far more than frivolous \nsuits. The examples that have been cited, the horror cases, are \nexamples that any of us would want to address and try to deal with. \nThis bill goes beyond that. This bill overreaches that mark and, in \nfact, in my judgment, will make it more difficult for investors to \nbring legitimate fraud actions. That is the essential question. That is \nthe discernment we have to make here.\n  Jane Bryant Quinn said in an article less than a week ago in the \nWashington Post, entitled ``Making it Easier to Mislead Investors,'' \nand I quote from the opening of this article:\n\n       A lawsuit protection bill speeding through Congress will \n     give freer rein to Wall Street's eternal desire to hype \n     stocks. It's cast as a law against frivolous lawsuits that \n     unfairly torture corporations and their accountants, but the \n     versions in both the House and Senate do far more than that. \n     They effectively make it easier for corporations and \n     stockholders to mislead investors. Class action suits against \n     the deceivers would be costly for small investors to file and \n     incredibly difficult to win. I'm against frivolous lawsuits. \n     Who is not? But these bills would choke meritorious lawsuits, \n     too.\n\n  At the end of this long article, she concludes as follows, and I \nquote:\n\n       Baseless lawsuits do indeed exist. Lawyers may earn too \n     much from a suit, leaving defrauded investors too little. The \n     incentives to sue should be reduced, but not with these \n     bills. They let too many crooks get away.\n\n  And an article in the U.S. News & World Report, the most recent \nissue, by Jack Egan entitled, ``Will Congress Condone Fraud,'' says in \npart, and I quote, speaking about this legislation:\n\n       It just might come to be remembered as legislation that has \n     steeply tilted the playing field against investors. It makes \n     it very hard for shareholders to sue over legitimate \n     grievances.\n\n  And, at the end, it goes on to say:\n\n       The pendulum has swung too far toward the lawyers, and now \n     it is swinging too far the other way. Unfortunately, some \n     major investor frauds may have to take place before it again \n     moves back toward the center.\n\n  The challenge for the Senate is to get this pendulum in the right \nplace to begin with, here, now, over the course of the next few days so \nthat they do not have to have major investor frauds in order to swing \nthe pendulum back toward the center.\n  This legislation, and certain of its provisions, goes too far. In \nfact, two provisions that were in the original bill as introduced were \ndropped in the course of evolving this legislation. Those provisions, \nhad they remained in the bill, would deal with a number of the problems \nwhich we intend to outline over the next few days in the course of its \nconsideration. That was in the original proposed legislation, and was \ntaken out. As a consequence, the legislation, in my judgment, has been \nweakened, and the balance has tilted in an unfair and unjust way.\n  The fact is that this bill will make it harder to bring securities \nfraud actions and to recover losses. Individual investors, local \ngovernments, pension plans, all will find it more difficult to bring \nfraud actions and to recover their full damages as a result of this \nlegislation.\n  I know examples are going to be used, but I say to my colleagues, you \nhave to move beyond those examples. The provisions in the bill which \ndeal with the egregious examples that would be cited ought to be in \nthis bill and they ought to be passed. The difficulty is that the bill \noverreaches and it goes too far. Let me give you some instances of \nthat.\n  The safe harbor provision will for the first time protect fraudulent \nstatements within the Federal securities laws. Individual investors \nwill not be able to sue people who make fraudulent projections of \nimportant items such as revenues and earnings.\n  The SEC has been working to address the question of forward looking \nstatements, but the Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, has raised very \nserious questions about the safe harbor provision in this legislation. \nIf I wanted to engage in the Senator's rhetorical combat that he spoke \nabout earlier, I would say, rather than safe harbor, it is a pirate's \ncove that is in this legislation. The proportionate liability provision \nwill for the first time put fraud [[Page S 8901]] participants ahead of \ninnocent victims and individual investors. Fraud victims will not \nrecover their full damages.\n  The argument is made that you have people who are held liable, they \nvary in their proportionate share of the responsibility, and the deep-\npocket people are held entirely liable when the principal malefactor \ngoes bankrupt or cannot pay the award. This is in a suit that is proven \nto be successful, been upheld as being meritorious in court. Well, \nthere is a problem amongst the malefactors. But to throw the burden on \nthe innocent victim as a solution to that problem is a departure which \nreally astounds one.\n  In other words, you are the victim of the fraud. A number of people \nhave participated in it in varying degrees, and you are going to be \nheld to assume a large part of the burden before the participants in \nthe fraud have to be responsible. As a consequence, fraud victims will \nnot recover the full damages.\n  The managers of the bill speak about its balance. In fact, the bill \nhas a tilt, as this column in U.S. News & World Report said, and I \nquote it again:\n\n       It just might come to be remembered as legislation that's \n     steeply tilted the playing field against investors.\n\n  There is not included in this legislation provisions that the SEC and \nthe State securities regulators feel are necessary to protect victims \nof securities fraud. I was interested that the Senator from Connecticut \nquoted Arthur Levitt as saying in a hearing there is a need for change.\n  That is quite true. But Chairman Levitt criticizes the measure that \nis now before us. If you are going to cite Arthur Levitt as supporting \nthe proposition for change, which actually none of us is contending \nagainst here--we are not coming to the floor and saying do nothing, \njust leave the existing law. We are saying that there are some \nprovisions in this legislation that ought to be passed, but there are \nother provisions that overreach and go too far, and Arthur Levitt says \nthe same.\n  The very person cited in a sense as an expert for the proposition \nthat change ought to be made has also told us that some of the changes \ncontained in this legislation are undesirable.\n  In addition to the safe harbor issue, which we will come back and \nrevisit in the course of the amending process, is the proportionate \nliability issue. This bill does not extend the statute of limitations \nfor securities fraud actions. Fraud victims will not have time to bring \ntheir cases to court. That in fact was a provision that was in the \noriginal bill as introduced and has been dropped from the provision now \nbefore us.\n  The bill does not restore the ability of investors to sue individuals \nwho aid and abet violations of the securities laws. Fraud victims will \nnot be able to pursue everyone who helped commit a securities fraud.\n  It is asserted that this bill as is has reached the proper balance, \nbut the fact remains that it is opposed, the legislation as before us, \nby a host of securities regulators, by State and local government \nofficials, by consumer groups, by labor unions, by bar associations, \nand others, including the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation, the Government Finance Officers Association, the National \nLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and a number of the large trade unions, \nincluding the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers.\n  The assault from the other side has been on the lawyers. These groups \ndo not represent the lawyers. These groups represent the public, \nconsumers, investors, and they have all reached the judgment that this \nbill is unbalanced--unbalanced.\n  Let me just speak for a moment or two about the background. It is \nasserted by some that there is a crisis in the securities litigation \nsystem that is threatening our capital markets. Let us take a look very \nquickly at our capital markets and some statistics about it.\n  For 1993, the U.S. equity market capitalization stood at $5.2 \ntrillion, over one-third of the world total. More than 600 foreign \ncompanies from 41 different countries are listed on our exchanges and \nmore foreign companies come every year. Average daily trading volume on \nthe New York Stock Exchange has increased from 45 million shares in \n1980 to 291 million shares in 1994. From 1980 to 1993, mutual fund \nassets increased by more than 10 times to $1.9 trillion.\n  In effect, Mr. President, what this demonstrates is that the U.S. \ncapital markets remain the largest and the strongest in the world.\n  Now, this, I would submit, is not in spite of the Federal securities \nlaws but in part because of the Federal securities laws. This \ntremendous growth in the American marketplace and its preeminent \nposition worldwide is not in spite of Federal securities laws but in \npart because of Federal securities laws. The Federal securities laws \nhave generally provided for sensible regulation and self-regulation of \nexchanges, brokers, dealers, and issues.\n  This regulation has helped to sustain investor confidence in our \nmarkets. Without that confidence in the markets, you are not going to \nget the kind of dominant position that we have had. And confidence in \nthe markets on the part of investors is a consequence not only of the \npublic regulatory scheme administered by the SEC but also because \ninvestors know that they have effective remedies against people who try \nto swindle them.\n  In other words, if you weaken unreasonably or improperly these \nremedies, you are going to affect investor ability to have recourse in \ninstances in which they have been unfairly or improperly exploited, and \nthe consequence of that is you begin to cast a doubt over the integrity \nof the securities markets.\n  Both Republican and Democratic Chairmen of the Securities and \nExchange Commission have stressed the crucial role of the private right \nof action in maintaining investor confidence.\n  In 1991, then-Chairman Richard Breeden testified before the Banking \nCommittee, and I quote:\n\n       Private actions . . . have long been recognized as a \n     ``necessary supplement'' to actions brought by the Commission \n     and as an ``essential tool'' in the enforcement of the \n     Federal securities laws. Because the Commission does not have \n     adequate resources to detect and prosecute all violations of \n     the Federal securities laws, private actions perform a \n     critical role in preserving the integrity of our securities \n     markets.\n\n  Current Chairman Arthur Levitt echoed this very point in testimony \ndelivered this year.\n  The Securities Subcommittee held hearings over the past 2 years \nreviewing the Federal securities litigation system. It received \ntestimony from plaintiffs' lawyers, from corporate defendants, from \naccountants, from academics, from securities regulators, and from \ninvestors. There was considerable disagreement among the witnesses over \nhow well the existing securities litigation system is functioning. Some \nargued, and my colleagues who have already spoken argue, American \nbusiness, particularly younger companies in the high-technology area, \nface a rising tide of frivolous securities litigation. Corporate \nexecutives suggested that securities class actions are filed when a \ncompany fails to meet projected earnings or its stock drops.\n  Clearly, some frivolous securities cases are filed as, indeed, some \nfrivolous cases of every sort are filed. However, the Director of the \nSEC's Division of Enforcement testified in June 1993 with respect to \nstatistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts:\n\n       The approximate aggregate number of securities cases, \n     including Commission cases, filed in Federal district courts \n     does not appear to have increased over the past 2 decades. \n     Similarly, while the approximate number of securities class \n     actions filed during the past 3 years is significantly higher \n     than during the 1980's, the numbers do not reveal the type of \n     increase that ordinarily would be characterized as an \n     ``explosion.''\n\n  Some said that these actions were inhibiting the capital formation \nprocess. In fact, initial public offerings have been setting records in \nrecent years: $39 billion in 1992; $57 billion in 1993. The $34 billion \nin initial public offerings in 1994 was exceeded only by the records \nset in the previous 2 years.\n  On May 22, the New York Times reported, and I quote:\n\n       One of the great booms in initial public offerings is now \n     under way, providing hundreds of millions in new capital for \n     high-tech companies, windfalls for those with good enough \n     connections to get in on the offerings and millions in profit \n     for the Wall Street firms underwriting the deals.\n\n  Asserting a crisis in securities litigation, which the figures do not \nseem to bear out, this bill makes it harder to bring lawsuits. We \nshould ask ourselves [[Page S 8902]] not simply whether these changes \nwill result in fewer lawsuits, but whether each proposed change will \nmake the securities laws serve our Nation better. We should ask whether \nlegitimate cases can still be brought or whether the provisions in this \nlegislation, which it is asserted are designed to screen out the \nfrivolous cases, will go beyond that and, in effect, make it difficult \nto bring legitimate cases.\n  I hope Members will focus on this very issue. It is very important \nnot to become, as it were, mesmerized by these extreme examples which \nmy colleague from Connecticut said would obviously be cited, because no \none is protecting the extreme examples.\n  The question is whether the provisions here will make it impossible \nor highly difficult to bring legitimate actions, whether it will swing \nthe pendulum too far in the other direction. One of the articles I \nquoted said:\n\n       Unfortunately, some major investor frauds will have to take \n     place before it, again, moves back toward the center.\n\n  We do not want that to happen. We have an opportunity here on the \nfloor by correcting this legislation to prevent that from happening.\n  Let me very quickly turn to some of the major defective provisions in \nthe legislation.\n  First is the so-called safe harbor provision. This legislation has a \nstatutory definition of an exemption from liability for forward-looking \nstatements which the bill broadly defines to include both oral and \nwritten statements. Examples include projections of financial items \nsuch as revenues and income for the quarter or for the year, estimates \nof dividends to be paid to shareholders, and statements of future \neconomic performance, such as sales trends and development of new \nproducts. In short, forward-looking statements include precisely the \ntype of information that is most important to investors deciding \nwhether to purchase a particular stock.\n  The SEC currently has a safe harbor regulation for forward-looking \nstatements that protects specified forward-looking statements that were \nmade in documents filed with the SEC. To sustain a fraud suit, the \ninvestor must show that the forward-looking information lacked a \nreasonable basis and was not made in good faith.\n  The SEC, recognizing the desirability of having some safe harbor for \nforward-looking statements, has been seeking to define it in \nregulation.\n  It has been conducting, in fact, a comprehensive review of its safe \nharbor regulation. This legislation, as originally introduced by \nSenators Domenici and Dodd, would have allowed the SEC to continue this \nregulatory effort. And Chairman Levitt endorsed that approach. However, \nthe committee print substitute for S. 240, unlike the bill as \nintroduced, abandoned this approach in favor of enacting a statutory \nsafe harbor.\n  The committee print now before us, in effect, protects fraudulent \nforward-looking statements. For the first time, such statements would \nfind shelter under the Federal securities law. In a letter to the \ncommittee, Chairman Levitt, expressing his personal views about a \nlegislative approach to safe harbor, stated:\n\n       A safe harbor must be thoughtful so that it protects \n     considered projections but never fraudulent ones.\n\n  The bill, as reported, provides safe harbor protection for all \nstatements except those knowingly made with the expectation, purpose, \nand actual intent of misleading investors. The committee report states \nthat expectation, purpose, and actual intent are separate elements, \neach of which must be proven by the investor, otherwise the maker of \nthe statement is shielded.\n  This language so troubled Chairman Levitt that he wrote to committee \nmembers on May 25, the morning of the markup. He stressed that the \nsubstitute committee print failed to adhere to his belief that a safe \nharbor should never protect fraudulent statements.\n  I want to be very clear about this. No one is arguing whether there \nshould be some provision for a safe harbor. The question is: What \nshould that provision be? What is reasonable? What is proper? What is \nbalanced? What constitutes overreaching? The chairman of the SEC said \nthe following in that letter to the committee on the morning of the \nmarkup:\n\n       I continue to have serious concerns about the safe harbor \n     fraud exclusion as it relates to the stringent standard of \n     proof that must be satisfied before a private plaintiff can \n     prevail. As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I cannot embrace proposals which would allow \n     willful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor \n     protection. The scienter standard in the amendment may be so \n     high as to preclude all but the most obvious frauds.\n\n  He warned that the bill's standard of ``knowingly made with the \nexpectation, purpose, and actual intent of misleading investors'' was a \nfar more stringent standard than currently used by the SEC and the \ncourts. The committee report states that the safe harbor provision is \nintended to encourage disclosure of information by issuance. \nEncouraging reasonable disclosure is one thing. Encouraging fraudulent \nprojections is obviously yet another.\n  The safe harbor provision that is in this bill, which was not in the \noriginal bill as introduced by Senators Dodd and Domenici--this safe \nharbor provision before us would hurt investors trying to make \nintelligent investment decisions and penalize companies trying to \ncommunicate honestly with their shareholders. It runs counter to the \nentire philosophy of Federal securities laws, the very laws that have \nhelped give us such strong markets, laws that rest on the premise that \nfraud must be deterred and punished when it occurs. That is one of the \nmajor areas in which attention will have to be focused over the next \nfew days.\n  Next I turn to the proportionate liability provision in the bill. The \ndifficulty with the proportionate liability section in the bill is we \nneed to understand the issue of liability for reckless conduct.\n  In 1976, the Supreme Court held that a defendant is liable under \nFederal securities antifraud provisions only if he or she possesses the \nstate of mind known in the law as ``scienter.'' Conduct that is \nintended to deceive or mislead investors satisfies the scienter \nrequirement. While the Supreme Court did not decide the question, \ncourts in every Federal circuit have held that reckless conduct also \nsatisfies the scienter requirement. This follows the guidance of \nhundreds of years of court decisions in fraud cases. As the Restatement \nof Torts states, ``The common law has long recognized recklessness as a \nform of scienter for the purposes of proving fraud.''\n  Now, the most commonly accepted definition of reckless conduct was \nset forth by the Seventh Circuit in the Sundstrand case. That \nstandard--and I will quote it, an order which attached joint and \nseveral liability--said:\n\n       A highly unreasonable omission involving not merely simple, \n     or even gross, negligence, but an extreme departure from the \n     standards of ordinary care and which present a danger of \n     misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the \n     defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been \n     aware of it.\n\n  Now, recklessness liability is often applied to the issuers' \nprofessional advisers--attorneys, underwriters, accountants. And under \njoint and several liability, all parties who participate in a fraud are \nliable for the entire amount of the victim's damages--both those \nparties who intended to mislead the investors, and those whose conduct \nwas reckless.\n  The rationale for this is that a fraud cannot succeed without the \nassistance of each participant, so each wrongdoer is held equally \nliable.\n  This bill limits joint and several liability under the Federal \nsecurities laws to certain defendants, specifically excluding \ndefendants whose conduct was reckless. This change will hurt investors \nin cases where the perpetrator of the fraud is bankrupt, has fled, or \notherwise cannot pay the investors' damages. In those cases, innocent \nvictims of fraud will be denied full recovery of their damages. \nChairman Levitt said:\n\n       The Commission has consistently opposed proportionate \n     liability.\n\n  Before the Securities Subcommittee, he said:\n\n       Proportionate liability would inevitably have the greatest \n     effect on investors in the most serious cases (for example, \n     where an issuer becomes bankrupt after a fraud is exposed). \n     It is for this reason that the Commission has recommended \n     that Congress focus on measures directly targeted at \n     meritless litigation before considering any changes to the \n     liability rules.\n\n  Now, even the authors of the measure before us recognize something of \na problem, so they have tried to make [[Page S 8903]] some compensating \nfeatures with respect to proportionate liability, and we will address \nthose in greater detail when we propose an amendment.\n  Let me just simply make this point. They would provide coverage to \nvictims with a net worth under $200,000 who lose more than 10 percent \nof that net worth. Well, that hardly is meaningful. Virtually anyone \nwho owns a home has a net worth of $200,000. And to require many small \ninvestors to lose more than 10 percent of that net worth--in other \nwords, you would have to lose $20,000 before you would be made whole by \nthose who have participated in or condoned the fraud.\n  There is another provision for a 50-percent overage, but neither \nprovision will make fraud victims whole. They will protect only a tiny \nnumber of investors. For most investors, the balance of their losses \nmay be uncollectible. So the innocent party is going to be called upon \nto bear this burden. Just think of the equities of that.\n  Reckless participation. Participants will no longer be responsible \nfor the result of their conduct. Innocent investors--individuals, \npension funds, county governments--will have to make up the loss. This \nis not fairness--certainly not to the investors.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that this legislation, as reported, \ndoes not contain provisions to help investors bring meritorious suits. \nIn his letter to the members of the Banking Committee, Chairman Levitt \nstated:\n\n       In addition to my concerns about the safe harbor, there is \n     not complete resolution of two important issues for the \n     Commission. First, there is no extension of the statute of \n     limitations for private fraud actions from 3 to 5 years.\n\n  My very able, distinguished colleague from Nevada, who is a member of \nthe subcommittee that considered this legislation, and is extremely \nknowledgeable on all aspects of it, will later, in the course of the \namending process, address this specific provision.\n  For over 40 years, courts held that the statute of limitations for \nprivate rights of action under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, the principal antifraud provision of the Federal \nsecurities laws, was the statute of limitations determined by \napplicable State law. While these statutes varied, they generally \nafforded securities fraud victims sufficient time to discover and bring \nsuit.\n  In 1991, in the Lampf case, the Supreme Court significantly shortened \nthe period of time in which investors may bring such securities fraud \nactions. By a 5 to 4 vote, the Court held that the applicable statute \nof limitations is 1 year after the plaintiff knew of the violation and \nin no event more than 3 years after the violation occurred. This is \nshorter than the statute of limitations for private securities actions \nunder the law of more than 60 percent of the States today.\n  This shorter period does not allow individual investors adequate time \nto discover and pursue violations of securities laws. Testifying before \nthe Banking Committee in 1991, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden stated \n``the timeframes set forth in the [Supreme] Court's decision is \nunrealistically short and will do undue damage to the ability of \nprivate litigants to sue.'' Chairman Breeden pointed out that in many \ncases,\n\n       Events only come to light years after the original \n     distribution of securities and the . . . cases could well \n     mean that by the time investors discover they have a case, \n     they are already barred from the courthouse.\n\n  The FDIC and the State securities regulators joined the SEC in favor \nof overturning the Lampf decision.\n  On this basis, the Banking Committee in 1991 without opposition \nadopted an amendment to a banking bill. The amendment lengthened the \nstatute of limitations for securities fraud actions to 2 years after \nthe plaintiff knew of the securities law violation, but in no event \nmore than 5 years after the violation occurred.\n  When the bill reached the Senate floor in November 1991, some \nSenators indicated they would seek to attach additional provisions \nrelating to securities litigation. They argued that the statute of \nlimitations should not be lengthened without additional reform of the \nlitigation system. No arguments were raised specifically against the \nextension of the statute of limitations. To expedite consideration of \nthe bill, the extension of the statute of limitations was dropped. \nSenators Domenici and Dodd included the extended statute of limitations \nin their comprehensive securities litigation reform bill, both in the \nlast Congress and in this Congress.\n  There was no rationale for dropping that provision out. Chairman \nLevitt testified before the Securities Subcommittee in April 1995, \n``extending the statute of limitations is warranted because many \nsecurities frauds are inherently complex, and the law should not reward \nthe perpetrator of a fraud who successfully conceals its existence for \nmore than 3 years.''\n  I defy any of my colleagues to explain to us why the perpetrator of \nthe fraud ought to be given a shorter period of time in which to get \naway with this fraudulent conduct.\n  Finally, let me turn to the failure to restore aiding and abetting \nliability. This was another matter touched on by Chairman Levitt when \nhe expressed his disappointment that ``the draft bill does not fully \nrestore the aiding and abetting liability eliminated in the Supreme \nCourt's Central Bank of Denver opinion.''\n  Prior to that decision, courts in every circuit in the country had \nrecognized the ability of investors to sue aiders and abettors of \nsecurities frauds. Most courts required that an investor show that a \nsecurities fraud was committed, that the aider and abettor gave \nsubstantial assistance to the fraud, and that the aider and abettor has \nsome degree of scienter--intent to deceive or recklessness toward the \nfraud.\n  Why should the aiders and abettors of the fraud escape any liability? \nAs Senator Dodd stated at a May 12, 1994, Securities Subcommittee \nhearing, ``aiding and abetting liability has been critically important \nin deterring individuals from assisting possible fraudulent acts by \nothers.'' Testifying at that hearing, Chairman Levitt stressed the \nimportance of restoring aiding and abetting liability for private \ninvestors:\n\n       persons who knowingly or recklessly assist the perpetration \n     of a fraud may be insulated from liability to private parties \n     if they act behind the scenes and do not themselves make \n     statements, directly or indirectly, that are relied upon by \n     investors. Because this is conduct that should be deterred, \n     Congress should enact legislation to restore aiding and \n     abetting liability in private actions.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association and the \nAssociation of the Bar of the City of New York also endorsed \nrestoration of aiding and abetting liability in private actions.\n  In summing up, let me simply say I support the goal of deterring and \nsanctioning frivolous securities litigation. This bill, though, will \ndeter legitimate fraud actions as well. By protecting fraudulent \nforward looking statements, and by restricting the application of joint \nand several liability, this bill may undermine the investor confidence \non which our markets depend. Further, it fails to include provisions \nthat are needed to ensure that investors have adequate time and means \nto pursue securities fraud actions.\n  We are not alone in concluding this legislation will threaten our \nmarkets by undermining investor confidence. Since the Banking Committee \napproved this bill we have received letters of opposition from \nsecurities regulators, State and local government officials, consumer \ngroups and others, which I will place in the Record following this \nstatement.\n  The assertion is, on the other side, there is a certain private \ninterest involved. We are trying to get at the abuse of the existing \nsecurities laws. But, in effect, independent observers, as it were, the \nsecurities regulators, local government officials, State government \nofficials, have looked at this thing and they say this is excessive. \nThis is overreaching.\n  In a June 8, 1995 letter, the Government Finance Officers Association \n[GFOA] strongly supported our position. Consisting of more than 13,000 \nState and local government financial officials, the GFOA's members both \nissue securities and invest billions of dollars of public pension and \ntaxpayer funds. In its letter, the GFOA opposed S. 240 as reported:\n\n       We support efforts to deter frivolous securities lawsuits, \n     but we believe that any legislation to accomplish this must \n     also maintain an appropriate balance that ensures the rights \n     of investors to seek recovery against those who engage in \n     fraud in the securities markets. We believe that S. 240 does \n     not [[Page S 8904]] achieve this balance, but rather erodes \n     the ability of investors to seek recovery in cases of fraud.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association, which \nrepresents the 50 State securities regulators, wrote earlier this week \n``to express * * * opposition to S. 240 as it was reported out of the \nBanking Committee.'' The letter expresses ``NASAA's view that the bill \nsucceeds in curbing frivolous lawsuits only by making it equally \ndifficult to pursue rightful claims against those who commit securities \nfraud.''\n  And they mention the amendments pertaining to safe harbor, \nproportional liability, the statute of limitations, and aiding and \nabetting liability as being desirable changes to be made in this \nlegislation.\n  On May 23, 1995, 12 separate groups wrote to the Committee, including \nthe National League of Cities, the American Council on Education, and \nthe California Labor Federation of the AFL-CIO They wrote that the \ncommittee print ``has not moved at all in the direction of the \nachieving the balance we believe is so critical.''\n  The St. Louis Post Dispatch had an editorial headed ``Don't Protect \nSecurities Fraud''; the Los Angeles Times, ``This Isn't Reform--It's a \nSteamroller: GOP bill curbing lawsuits would flatten the small \ninvestor''; the Philadelphia Inquirer, ``Going easy on crooks in 3-\npiece suits''; and other papers across the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters that I cited \nand earlier made reference to, the articles, and these editorials be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the securities markets are crucial to \nour economic growth; we should evaluate efforts to tamper with them \nvery, very carefully. I hope in the course of our consideration of this \nmeasure over the next few days that Members will focus on the issues. I \nmean, the issue is not an extreme example for which there are \nprovisions in the bill to deal with, with which no one quarrels. The \nissues are these items which I have cited about which we have heard \nfrom the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, from the \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, from the North American \nSecurities Administrators Association, from a broad range of consumer \ngroups, and from leading editorials and columnists across the country.\n  I very much hope my colleagues will support amendments to correct the \nflaws in this legislation. If that were to be done, then we could move \nforward with a piece of legislation that I think would accomplish the \nproper balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Chairman of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission I have no higher priority than to protest \n     American investors and ensure an efficient capital formation \n     process. I know personally just how deeply you share these \n     goals. In keeping with our common purpose, both the SEC and \n     the Congress are working to find an appropriate ``safe \n     harbor'' from the liability provisions of the federal \n     securities laws for projections and other forward-looking \n     statements made by public companies. Several pieces of \n     proposed legislation address the issue of the safe harbor and \n     the House-passed version, H.R. 1058, specifically defines \n     such a safe harbor.\n       Your committee is now considering securities litigation \n     reform legislation that will include a safe harbor provision. \n     Rather than simply repeat the Commission's request that \n     Congress await the outcome of our rulemaking deliberations, I \n     thought I would take this opportunity to express my personal \n     views about a legislative approach to a safe harbor.\n       There is a need for a stronger safe harbor than currently \n     exists. The current rules have largely been a failure and I \n     share the disappointment of issuers that the rules have been \n     ineffective in affording protection for forward-looking \n     statements. Our capital markets are built on the foundation \n     of full and fair disclosure. Analysts are paid and investors \n     are rewarded for correctly assessing a company's prospects. \n     The more investors know and understand management's future \n     plans and views, the sounder the valuation is of the \n     company's securities and the more efficient the capital \n     allocation process. Yet, corporate America is hesitant to \n     disclose projections and other forward-looking information, \n     because of excessive vulnerability to lawsuits if predictions \n     ultimately are not realized.\n       As a businessman for most of my life, I know all too well \n     the punishing costs of meritless lawsuits--costs that are \n     ultimately paid by investors. Particularly galling are\n      the frivolous lawsuits that ignore the fact that a \n     projection is inherently uncertain even when made \n     reasonably and in good faith.\n       This is not to suggest that private litigation under the \n     federal securities laws is generally counterproductive. In \n     fact, private lawsuits are a necessary supplement to the \n     enforcement program of the Commission. We have neither the \n     resources nor the desire to replace private plaintiffs in \n     policing fraud; it makes more sense to let private forces \n     continue to play a key role in deterrence, than to vastly \n     expand the commission's role. the relief obtained from \n     Commission disgorgement actions is no substitute for private \n     damage actions. Indeed, as government is downsized and \n     budgets are trimmed, the investor's ability to seek redress \n     directly is likely to increase in importance.\n       To achieve our common goal of encouraging enhanced sound \n     disclosure by reducing the threat of meritless litigation, we \n     must strike a reasonable balance. A carefully crafted safe \n     harbor protection from meritless private lawsuits should \n     encourage public companies to make additional forward-looking \n     disclosure that would benefit investors. At the same time, it \n     should not compromise the integrity of such information which \n     is vital to both investor protection and the efficiency of \n     the capital market--the two goals of the federal securities \n     law.\n       The safe harbor contained in H.R. 1058 is so broad and \n     inflexible that it may compromise investor protection and \n     market efficiency. It would, for example, protect companies \n     and individuals from private lawsuits even where the \n     information was purposefully fraudulent. This result would \n     have consequences not only for investors, but for the market \n     as well. There would likely be more disclosure, but would it \n     be better disclosure? Moreover, the vast majority of \n     companies whose public statements are published in good faith \n     and with due care could find the investing public skeptical \n     of their information.\n       I am concerned that H.R. 1058 appears to cover other \n     persons such as brokers. In the Prudential Securities case, \n     prudential brokers intentionally made baseless statements \n     concerning expected yields solely to lure customers into \n     making what were otherwise extremely risky and unsuitable \n     investments. Pursuant to the Commission's settlement with \n     Prudential, the firm has paid compensation to its defrauded \n     customers of over $700 million. Do we really want to protect \n     such conduct from accountability to these defrauded \n     investors? In the past two years or so, the Commission has \n     brought eighteen enforcement cases involving the sale of more \n     than $200 million of interests in wireless cable partnerships \n     and limited liability companies. Most of these cases involved \n     fraudulent projections as to the returns investors could \n     expect from their investments. Promoters of these types of \n     ventures would be immune from private suits under H.R. 1058 \n     as would those who promote blank check offerings, penny \n     stocks, and roll-ups. It should also address conflict of \n     interest problems that may arise in management buyouts and \n     changes in control of a company.\n       A safe harbor must be balanced--it should encourage more \n     sound disclosure without encouraging either omission of \n     material information or irresponsible and dishonest \n     information. A safe harbor must be thoughtful--so that it \n     protects considered\n      projections, but never fraudulent ones. A safe harbor must \n     also be practical--it should be flexible enough to \n     accommodate legitimate investor protection concerns that \n     may arise on both sides of the issue. This is a complex \n     issue in a complex industry, and it raises almost as many \n     questions as one answers: Should the safe harbor apply to \n     information required by Commission rule, including \n     predictive information contained in the financial \n     statements (e.g. pension liabilities and over-the-counter \n     derivatives)? Should it extend to oral statements? Should \n     there be a requirement that forward-looking information \n     that has become incorrect be updated if the company or its \n     insiders are buying or selling securities? Should the safe \n     harbor extend to disclosures made in connection with a \n     capital raising transaction on the same basis as more \n     routine disclosures as well? Are there categories of \n     transactions, such as partnership offerings or going \n     private transactions that should be subject to additional \n     conditions?\n       There are many more questions that have arisen in the \n     course of the Commission's exploration of how to design a \n     safe harbor. We have issued a concept release, received a \n     large volume of comment letters in response, and held three \n     days of hearings, both in California and Washington. In \n     addition, I have met personally with most groups that might \n     conceivably have an interest in the subject: corporate \n     leaders, investor groups, plaintiff's lawyers, defense \n     lawyers, state and federal regulators, law professors, and \n     even federal judges. The one thing I can state unequivocally \n     is that this subject eludes easy answers.\n       [[Page S 8905]] Given these complexities--and in light of \n     the enormous amount of care, thought, and work that the \n     Commission has already invested in the subject--my \n     recommendation would be that you provide broad rulemaking \n     authority to the Commission to improve the safe harbor. If \n     you wish to provide more specificity by legislation, I \n     believe the provision must address the investor protection \n     concerns mentioned above. I would support legislation that \n     sets forth a basic safe harbor containing four components: \n     (1) protection from private lawsuits for reasonable \n     projections by public companies; (2) a scienter standard \n     other than recklessness should be used for a safe harbor and \n     appropriate procedural standards should be enacted to \n     discourage and easily terminate meritless litigation; (3) \n     ``projections'' would include voluntary forward-looking \n     statements with respect to a group of subjects such as sales, \n     revenues, net income (loss), earnings per share, as well as \n     the mandatory information required in the Management's \n     Discussion and Analysis; and (4) the Commission would have \n     the flexibility and authority to include or exclude classes \n     of disclosures, transactions, or persons as experience \n     teaches us lessons and as circumstances warrant.\n       As we work to reform the current safe harbor rules of the \n     Commission, the greatest problem is anticipating the \n     unintended consequences of the changes that will be made in \n     the standards of liability. The answer appears to be an \n     approach that maintains flexibility in responding to problems \n     that may develop. As a regulatory agency that administers the \n     federal securities laws, we are well situated to respond \n     promptly to any problems that may develop, if we are given \n     the statutory authority to do so. Indeed, one possibility we \n     are considering is a pilot safe harbor that would be reviewed \n     formally at the end of a two year period. What we have today \n     is unsatisfactory, but we think that, with your support, we \n     can expeditiously build a better model for tomorrow.\n       I am well aware of your tenacious commitment to the \n     individual Americans who are the backbone of our markets and \n     I have no doubt that you share our belief that the interests \n     of those investors must be held paramount. I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on safe harbor and other issues \n     related to securities litigation reform.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that this morning you and \n     the members of the Banking Committee will be considering S. \n     240 and that you will be offering an amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute. While I have not had the opportunity to \n     analyze fully the May 24th manager's amendment to the \n     Committee print, I appreciate your leadership and efforts to \n     address the concerns of the Commission in drafting your \n     alternative.\n       The safe harbor provision in the amendment, in my opinion, \n     is preferable to the blanket approach of H.R. 1058. It \n     addresses a number of the concerns pertaining to the size of \n     the safe harbor and the exclusions from the safe harbor. The \n     Committee staff appears to be genuinely interested in the \n     Commission's views of its draft legislation and has attempted \n     to be responsive. I was pleased to see the latest draft \n     deleted the requirement that a plaintiff must read and \n     actually rely upon the misrepresentation before a claim is \n     actionable. Your attempt to tailor the breadth of the safe \n     harbor of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the more \n     narrow safe harbor of the Securities Act of 1933 was \n     encouraging. However, I continue to believe that the \n     definition should be further narrowed to parallel the items \n     contained in my letter of May 19th. Moreover, there remain a \n     number of troubling issues.\n       I continue to have serious concerns about the safe harbor \n     fraud exclusion as it relates to the stringent standard of \n     proof that must be satisfied before a private plaintiff can \n     prevail. As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful \n     fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection. The \n     scienter standard in the amendment may be so high as to \n     preclude all but the most obvious frauds. I believe that \n     there should be a direct relationship between the level of \n     scienter required to prove fraud and the types of statements \n     protected by the safe harbor. My letter of May 19th indicated \n     the discreet list of subjects that are suitable for safe \n     harbor protection, assuming a simple ``knowing'' standard. \n     Accordingly, if the Committee is unwilling to lower the \n     proposed scienter level to a simple ``knowing'' standard, the \n     safe harbor should not protect forward-looking statements \n     contained in the management's discussion and analysis \n     section. This would be better left to Commission rulemaking.\n       In addition to my concerns about the safe harbor, there is \n     no complete resolution of two important issues for the \n     Commission. First there is no extension of the statute of \n     limitations for private fraud actions from three to five \n     years. Second, the draft bill does not fully restore the \n     aiding and abetting liability eliminated in the Supreme \n     Court's Central Bank of Denver opinion. I am encouraged by \n     the Committee's willingness to restore partially the \n     Commission's ability to prosecute those who aid and abet \n     fraud; however, a more complete solution is preferable.\n       I also wish to call your attention to a potential problem \n     with the provision relating to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure. I worry that the standard employed in \n     your draft may have the unintended effect of imposing a \n     ``loser pays'' scheme. The greater the discretion afforded \n     the court, the less likely this unintended consequence may \n     appear.\n       I would like to express my particular gratitude for the \n     courtesy and openness displayed by the Committee and its \n     staff. I hope we will continue to work together to improve \n     the bill so as to reduce costly litigation without \n     compromising essential investor protections.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Government Finance\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 13,000 state and local government financial officials \n     who comprise the membership of the Government Finance \n     Officers Association (GFOA) to bring to your attention \n     serious concerns we have with the Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act, S. 240, recently approved by the Senate Banking \n     Committee. As you know, the GFOA is a professional \n     association of state and local officials who are involved in \n     and manage all the disciplines of public finance. The state \n     and local governmental entities our members represent bring a \n     unique perspective to this proposed legislation because they \n     are both investors of billions of dollars of public pension \n     funds and temporary cash balances, and issuers of debt \n     securities as well.\n       We support efforts to deter frivolous securities lawsuits, \n     but we believe that any legislation to accomplish this must \n     also maintain an appropriate balance that ensures the rights \n     of investors to seek recovery against those who engage in \n     fraud in the securities markets. We believe that S. 240 does \n     not achieve this balance, but rather erodes the ability of \n     investors to seek recovery in cases of fraud.\n       The strength and stability of our nation's securities \n     markets depend on investor confidence in the integrity, \n     fairness and efficiency of these markets. To maintain this \n     confidence, investors must have effective remedies against \n     those persons who violate the antifraud provisions of the \n     federal securities laws. In recent years, we have seen how \n     investment losses caused by securities laws violations can \n     adversely affect state and local governments and their \n     taxpayers. It is essential, therefore, that we fully maintain \n     our rights to seek redress in the courts.\n       S. 240 would drastically alter the way America's financial \n     system has worked for over 60 years--a system second to none. \n     Following are the major concerns state and local governments \n     have with this ``reform'' legislation:\n       Fraud victims would face the risk of having to pay the \n     defendant's legal fees if they lost. S.\n      240 imposes a modified ``loser pays'' rule that carries the \n     presumption that if the loser is the plaintiff, all legal \n     fees should be shifted to the plaintiff. The same \n     presumption, however, would not apply to losing \n     defendants. The end result of this modified ``loser pays'' \n     rule is that it would strongly discourage the filing of \n     securities fraud claims by victims, regardless of the \n     merits of the cases. This is particularly true for state \n     and local governments that have lost taxpayer funds \n     through investments, involving financial fraud in \n     derivatives, for example, but who simply cannot afford to \n     risk further taxpayer funds by taking the risk that they \n     might lose their case and have to pay the legal fees of \n     large corporations. The argument is made that a modified \n     loser pays rule is necessary to deter frivolous lawsuits, \n     but we understand there are only 120 companies sued \n     annually--out of over 14,000 public corporations, and that \n     the number of suits has not increased from 1974.\n       Fraud victims would find it exceedingly difficult to fully \n     recover their losses. Our legal standard of ``joint and \n     several'' liability has enabled defrauded investors to \n     recover full damages from accountants, brokers, bankers and \n     lawyers who help engineer securities frauds, even when the \n     primary wrongdoer is bankrupt, has fled or is in jail. S. 240 \n     sharply limits the traditional rule of joint and several \n     liability for reckless violators. This means that fraud \n     victims would be precluded from fully recovering their \n     losses.\n       Wrongdoers who ``aid and abet'' fraud would be immune from \n     cases brought by fraud victims. As you know, aiders had been \n     held liable in cases brought by fraud victims for 25 years \n     until a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling last year eliminated such \n     liability because there was not specific statutory language \n     in federal securities law. If aiders and abettors are immune \n     from liability, as issuers of debt securities, state and \n     local governments would become the ``deep pockets,'' and as \n     investors they would be limited in their ability to recover \n     losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the state \n     securities regulators have recommended full restoration of \n     liability of aiders and abettors and GFOA supports that \n     recommendation.\n       Wrongdoers would be let off the hook by a short statute of \n     limitations. We had supported the modest extension of the \n     statute-- [[Page S 8906]] from one year from discovery of the \n     fraud but no more than three years after the fraud to two \n     years after the violation was, or should have been, \n     discovered but not more than five years after the fraud was \n     committed--that was contained in an earlier version of S. \n     240. We are disappointed that this extension was removed in \n     the Committee's markup of the legislation and hope it will be \n     restored when the full Senate considers the bill.\n       Under S. 240, corporations could deceive investors about \n     future events and be immunized from liability in cases \n     brought by defrauded investors. Corporate predictions are \n     inherently prone to fraud as they are an easy way to make \n     exaggerated claims of favorable developments to attract \n     investors. The ``safe harbor'' in S. 240 is a very broad \n     exemption and immunizes a vast amount of corporate \n     information so long as it is called a ``forward-looking \n     statement'' and states that it is uncertain and there is risk \n     it may not occur. Such statements are immunized even if they \n     are made recklessly. We believe this opens a major loophole \n     through which wrongdoers could escape liability while fraud \n     victims would be denied recovery.\n       Access to fair and full compensation through the civil \n     justice system is an important safeguard for state and local \n     government investors, and is a strong deterrent to securities \n     fraud. We believe. S. 240 as written does not provide such \n     access to state and local governments or to other investors. \n     Just as state and local government investors are urged to use \n     extreme caution in investing public funds, the Senate should \n     use extreme caution in reforming the securities regulation \n     system.\n       We hope you will work to bring about needed changes in the \n     legislation when it is considered by the full Senate. If \n     there is any way we can help in this effort, please do not \n     hesitate to call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Catherine L. Spain,\n     Director, Federal Liaison Center.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.\n     Re S. 240, the ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.''\n\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The full Senate may consider as \n     early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week, S. 240, the \n     ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' On \n     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators \n     Association (NASAA), we are writing today to express the \n     Association's opposition to S. 240 as it was reported out of \n     the Banking Committee. In the U.S., NASAA is the national \n     voice of the 50 state securities agencies responsible for \n     investor protection and the efficient functioning of the \n     capital markets at the grassroots level.\n       While everyone agrees on the need for changes to the \n     current securities litigation system, not everyone is \n     prepared to deny justice to defrauded investors in the name \n     of such reform. Proponents of the bill make two claims: \n     first, that they have modified the bill to satisfy many of \n     the objections to the earlier version; and second, that the \n     bill will not prevent meritorious claims from going forward. \n     Neither claim is accurate. First, the changes made to the \n     bill do little to resolve the serious objections to S. 240 \n     raised by NASAA and its members. In fact, it may be argued \n     that during the Banking Committee's deliberations the bill \n     was made less acceptable from the perspective of investors. \n     Second, it is NASAA's view that the bill succeeds in curbing \n     frivolous lawsuits only by making it equally difficult to \n     pursue rightful claims against those who commit securities \n     fraud.\n       The reality is that the major provisions of S. 240 will \n     work to shield even the most egregious wrongdoers among \n     public companies, brokerage firms, accountants and others \n     from legitimate lawsuits brought by defrauded investors. Do \n     we really want to erect protective barriers around future \n     wrongdoers?\n       NASAA agrees that there is room for constructive \n     improvement in the federal securities litigation process. The \n     Association supports reform measures that achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     providing relief to honest companies and professionals who \n     may unfairly find themselves the targets of frivolous \n     lawsuits. Regrettably, S. 240 as approved by the Senate \n     Banking Committee fails to achieve this necessary balance.\n       Although this bill has been characterized in some quarters \n     as an attempt to improve the cause of defrauded investors in \n     legitimate lawsuits, that simply is not the case. Attempts to \n     incorporate into the bill provisions that would work to the \n     benefit of defrauded investors were rejected when the Banking \n     Committee considered the bill. At the same time, the few \n     provisions in the original bill that may have worked to the \n     benefit of defrauded investors were deleted.\n       For example, during the Committee' deliberations: (1) the \n     rather modest extension of the statute of limitations for \n     securities fraud suits contained in the original version was \n     deleted; (2) attempts to fully restore aiding and abetting \n     liability under the securities laws were rejected; (3) a \n     regulatory safe harbor for forward-looking statements \n     contained in the original version of S. 240 was replaced with \n     an overly broad safe harbor for such information, making it \n     extremely difficult to sue when misleading information causes \n     investors to suffer losses; and (4) efforts to loosen the \n     strict limitations on the applicability of joint and several \n     liability were rejected, making it all but impossible for \n     more than a very few to ever fully recover their losses when \n     they are defrauded. The truth here is that this is a one-\n     sided measure that will benefit corporate interests at the \n     expense of investors.\n       As state government officials responsible for administering \n     the securities laws in our jurisdictions, we know the \n     important role private actions play in the enforcement of our \n     securities laws and in protecting the honesty and integrity \n     of our capital markets. The strength and stability of our \n     nation's securities markets depend in large measure on \n     investor confidence in the fairness and integrity of these \n     markets. In order to maintain this confidence, it is critical \n     that investors have effective remedies against persons who \n     violate the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.\n       When S. 240 is considered on the Senate floor, it is \n     expected that several pro-investor amendments will be offered \n     in an attempt to inject some balance into the measure. Among \n     the amendments we expect to be offered are those that would: \n     (1) extend the statute of limitations for private securities \n     fraud actions; (2) fully restore aiding and abetting \n     liability under the securities laws; (3) replace the\n      expansive safe harbor for foward-looking statements with a \n     directive to the Securities and Exchange Commission to \n     continue its rulemaking efforts and report back to \n     Congress; and (4) lift the severe limitations on joint and \n     several liability so that defrauded investors may fully \n     recover their losses.\n       On behalf of NASAA, we respectfully encourage you to vote \n     in favor of all such amendments when they are offered on the \n     Senate floor. If all four amendments are not adopted, we \n     respectfully encourage you to oppose S. 240 on final passage.\n       NASAA regrets that the Association cannot support the \n     litigation reform proposed as reported out of the Senate \n     Banking Committee. The Association believes that this issue \n     is an important one and one that should be addressed by \n     Congress. However, NASAA believes that is more important to \n     get it done right than it is to get it done quickly. S. 240 \n     as it was reported out of the Banking Committee should be \n     rejected and more carefully-crafted and balanced legislation \n     should be adopted in its place.\n       If you have any questions about NASAA's position on this \n     issue, please contact Maureen Thompson, NASAA's legislative \n     adviser.\n           Sincerely,\n     Philip A. Feign,\n       Securities Commissioner, Colorado Division of Securities, \n     President, North American Securities Association.\n     Mark J.

Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato: Our organizations have been actively \n     involved in the securities litigation reform debate. We are \n     writing today to express the very serious concerns our \n     organizations and individual members have with the major \n     provisions of S. 240, the ``Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act,'' introduced by Senators Dodd and Domenici, and \n     with the substitute language that emerged on Monday.\n       Let us be clear: our organizations strongly believe that \n     any securities litigation reform must achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     providing relief to honest companies and professionals who \n     may find themselves the target of a frivolous lawsuit. We \n     agree that abusive practices should be deterred, and where \n     appropriate, sternly sanctioned. At the same time, the \n     doorway to the American system of civil justice must remain \n     open for those investors who believe they have been \n     defrauded.\n       Although we understand that some of the specifics of S. 240 \n     remain under discussion, [[Page S 8907]] we are extremely \n     disappointed to see that the substitute language now being \n     circulated (and expected to be marked up on Thursday, May \n     25th) has not moved at all in the direction of achieving the \n     balance we believe is so critical to resolving this debate. \n     While we appreciate the fact that some of the provisions we \n     found most objectionable in the bill as introduced were \n     deleted, we are dismayed to find other equally troubling \n     provisions inserted in the new draft. Perhaps most disturbing \n     is that the one pro-investor provision found in S. 240 as \n     introduced--the extension of the statute of limitations--has \n     been dropped entirely in the latest version of the bill.\n       Collectively, our organizations and those with which we \n     have worked closely on this issue represent tens of millions \n     of ordinary Americans who increasingly must rely on \n     investments to build retirement nest eggs, finance the \n     college education of children, and to save for major \n     purchases, such as a home. The organizations represent the \n     thousands of state and local governments, that participate in \n     the securities markets both as investors of pension funds and \n     temporary cash balances and as issuers of municipal debt. Our \n     ranks also include colleges and universities and other \n     institutions of higher learning, as well as labor \n     organizations, that participate in the securities markets as \n     investors of endowment and pension funds.\n       Our general and primary concerns with respect to the \n     provisions of S. 240, as well as with other proposals that \n     now are under discussion or are present in the House version \n     of this legislation, include;\n       Unreasonable standards for fraud pleadings, burden of proof \n     and damages;\n       Any form of ``means testing'' for access to justice of \n     recovery, including conferring a special status on certain, \n     larger investors;\n       Limits on joint and several liability that will work to \n     immunize from liability certain professional groups;\n       ``Loser pays'' rules;\n       Expansive safe harbor exemptions from private liability for \n     forward looking statements (we believe the more appropriate \n     response is SEC rulemaking in this area); and\n       Expanding the scope of this bill to go beyond cases \n     involving private class actions brought under the 1934 \n     Securities Exchange Act.\n       At the same time, we have expressed support for major \n     reform proposals, including:\n       An early evaluation procedure designed to weed out clearly \n     frivolous cases, with sanctions imposed in certain instances;\n       A more rational system of determining liability based on \n     proportionate liability for reckless violators and joint and \n     several liability for knowing violators, with provisions made \n     for special circumstances in which knowing securities \n     violators are unable to satisfy a judgment;\n       The right to contribute among liable defendants according \n     to proportionate responsibility.\n       Certification of complaints and improved case management \n     procedures;\n       Improved disclosure of settlement terms;\n       Curbs on potentially abusive practices on the part of \n     plaintiffs' attorneys;\n       A reasonable extension of the statute of limitations for \n     securities fraud suits; and\n       Restoration of liability for aiding and abetting securities \n     fraud.\n       Although some people may mistakenly believe that the \n     markets run on money, the truth is that the markets run on \n     public confidence. As investors ourselves and as \n     representatives of investors, we can tell you that the \n     confidence we have in the marketplace will be dramatically \n     altered if we come to believe that not only are we at risk of \n     being defrauded, but that we will have no recourse to fight \n     back against those who have victimized us. We fear that is \n     exactly what will be the case if S. 240 or its substitute \n     version is enacted. There should be little doubt that under \n     such a scenario many investors will seriously reconsider \n     whether they want to remain in the marketplace.\n       Finally, we want to take this opportunity to put to rest \n     the frequently voiced claim that no defrauded investor with a \n     meritorious case will be denied justice under these reform \n     proposals.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to S. 240, the so-called ``Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act.'' In our earlier analysis of the bill \n     (January 25, 1995), we discussed the eight most harmful \n     provisions for consumers, seniors, and investors. We stressed \n     that S. 240 would effectively eliminate private enforcement \n     of the securities law and greatly reduce the likelihood that \n     innocent victims of fraud could recover their losses from \n     corporate and individual wrongdoers.\n       Now that the Banking Committee's substitute has been issued \n     in preparation for the markup on Thursday, May 25, we are \n     deeply concerned that the bill has not moved in the direction \n     of balanced reform. On the whole, the bill is now even worse \n     for average Americans. The intentions of the Senate Banking \n     Committee's substitute bill are clear--to promote the \n     interests of big corporations, big accounting firms, big \n     brokerage firms and big investment banking houses at the \n     expense of average Americans. The bill is now entirely anti-\n     consumer, anti-senior, anti-investor, and pro-defendant, pro-\n     industry, and pro-wealthy. Any pretensions of protecting \n     small investors and meritorious fraud actions have been \n     abandoned.\n       Only one of our concerns (the insider-dominated \n     disciplinary board for accountants) has been addressed, while \n     seven deeply troubling provisions remain or have gotten even \n     worse. We have attached a consumer critique of the Banking \n     Committee's substitute which explains our strong opposition, \n     as well as a recent article which highlights the urgency of \n     our concerns.\n       S. 240 strikes a blow to the heart of the middle class and \n     average, hard-working Americans who depend on the federal \n     securities system to protect their savings, investments, and \n     retirements. A study published in the 1991 Maine Law Review \n     found that 87% of managers surveyed were willing to commit \n     financial statement fraud, more than 50% were willing to \n     overstate assets, 48% were willing to understate loss \n     reserves, and 38% would ``pad'' a government contract. In \n     addition, securities fraud is increasing at an alarming rate. \n     Cases brought by federal and state regulators have increased \n     by more than 45% in just five years.\n       Moreover, a new major financial fraud that could rival the \n     savings and loan fiasco--involving high-risk, highly \n     speculative derivative securities--is just being discovered. \n     Orange County is not alone. Already, 40 American communities \n     and public institutions across the country have reported \n     derivatives losses totalling some $3 billion. And indications \n     are that fraud may have played a large role in many of those \n     disasters.\n       Clearly, this is no time to be immunizing fraud and \n     removing vital investor protection laws that have served \n     American consumers so well for decades. We urge you to vote \n     against S. 240 in the markup on Thursday.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Vuernick,\n       Legal Policy Director, Citizen Action.\n     Mern Horan,\n       Legislative Representative, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Mary Griffin,\n       Counsel, Consumers Union.\n     Joan Claybrook,\n       President, Public Citizen.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     M. Kristen Rand,\n       Director of Federal Policy, Violence Policy Center.\n       Attachment.\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 1995]\n\n                           Friends of Fraud?\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Of all the bills making their way through this Congress, \n     the most devastating to its area of the law may be one that \n     has had relatively little attention: legislation to weaken \n     the protection of the public against securities fraud.\n       The House passed a bill in March. Now the Senate Banking \n     Committee is working on its version. To judge how devastating \n     the legislation would be, consider what it would have done to \n     some of the most notorious recent fraud cases.\n       In the 1980's Prudential Securities brokers lure customers \n     to invest in risky securities with deliberately false \n     statements about how much they would make. The defrauded \n     investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission sue \n     Prudential Securities, and in the S.E.C. case alone the firm \n     agreed to repay more than $700 million to the victims.\n       The victims would probably have been unable to sue if one \n     section of the current House bill had been law. Known as the \n     ``safe harbor'' provision, it immunizes from suits by the \n     defrauded all ``forward-looking statements'' about \n     securities. Companies and their agents could make false \n     ``projections'' and ``estimates'' of future performance, even \n     if they were deliberate lies, without fear of lawsuits by \n     those defrauded.\n       The chairman of the S.E.C., Arthur Levitt Jr., is concerned \n     about the ``safe harbor'' provision. He has just written to \n     the Senate [[Page S 8908]] committee urging it not thus to \n     protect ``purposefully fraudulent'' financial predictions.\n       That is not the only part of the pending legislation that \n     would make it difficult--perhaps impossible--for victims of \n     fraud to sue. Another is a provision of the House bill \n     requiring anyone who brings a securities fraud suit to show \n     at once, when he or she sues, the state of mind of the \n     defendant indicating fraudulent intent. That kind of \n     information is usually found only during the discovery phase \n     of a case.\n       For example, two months ago shareholders in Koger \n     Properties Inc. won an $81.3 million judgment in a fraud suit \n     against its accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche. During \n     pretrial discovery, the plaintiffs' lawyers found that the \n     partner in charge of the audit owned stock in Koger, a \n     violation of accounting standards. They could not have known \n     that when they sued.\n       Still another provision of the House bill, and the Senate's \n     as it stands, would limit what is called ``joint and several \n     liabilities.'' That allows the victims of fraud to recover \n     from others involved if the principal fraud perpetrator is \n     not able to pay.\n       Last month, for example, Steven Hoffenberg of Towers \n     Financial Corporation pleaded guilty to securities fraud and \n     criminal conspiracy in a Ponzi scheme that cost investors \n     $460 million. He said his accountants and lawyers helped \n     carry out the fraud by issuing false financial statements and \n     making misleading statements to the S.E.C. Towers is \n     bankrupt, so the victims are suing the lawyers and \n     accountants.\n       Some of the worst scams in recent history would have left \n     the defrauded investors with little or no recourse if the \n     ``joint and several liability'' limit had been in effect. The \n     victims of Charles Keating, the great savings and loan \n     swindler, would have been out of luck when he went to prison \n     and said he was broke.\n       The legislation sounds highly specialized, and it is. But \n     it would have widespread effects on real people. In addition \n     to individual investors who have been defrauded, many local \n     governments have lost large sums in recent years and are \n     suing brokerage firms and others. The big example is Orange \n     County, California, which lost more than $1 billion, but \n     there are dozens more.\n       It is a peculiar time to weaken legal protections: a time \n     of spectacular financial frauds. The latest involves the \n     Foundation for New Era Philanthropy, whose scam attracted \n     many charities and such investors as Lawrence S. Rockefeller \n     and William E. Simon. New Era collapsed last week, and the \n     S.E.C. charged its founder with ``massive'' securities fraud.\n       But this Congress evidently does not care a lot about the \n     victims of fraud. It is listening to the lobbyists for \n     accounting firms and insurance companies, whose political \n     action committees have made large campaign contributions, and \n     others who want to operate without fear of being sued for \n     securities fraud.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, U.S. \n           Public Interest Research Group, Citizen Action, Public \n           Citizen, Violence Policy Center\n\n\n  consumer critique of S. 240 ``Private Securities Litigation Reform \n                                 Act''\n\n       (1) Abrogation of joint and several liability, which would \n     effectively immunize professional wrongdoers. The original S. \n     240 eliminated joint and several liability in a wide class of \n     cases, favoring large corporations, accountants, brokers and \n     bankers--who have been found liable--over defrauded victims. \n     The substitute S. 240 restricts joint and several liability \n     even further.\n       Under joint and several liability, if one wrongdoer is \n     found liable but has no assets, the victim can be reimbursed \n     fully by the other wrongdoers, without whose assistance the \n     fraud could not have succeeded. This traditional aspect of \n     America's legal system for fraud is based on the policy that \n     it is more fair for other wrongdoers to pay for a loss that \n     cannot be collected from one of the co-conspirators than it \n     is for the victims to go uncompensated. The rule has enabled \n     swindled consumers to recover full damages from accountants, \n     brokers, bankers, lawyers and other wrongdoers who \n     participate in securities scams, even when the primary \n     wrongdoer has no assets left, has fled, or is in jail.\n       The original S. 240 sharply limited this rule, immunizing \n     reckless wrongdoers from joint and several liability. If S. \n     240 had been in effect, most investors would not have \n     recovered their life savings in the Charles Keating/Lincoln \n     Savings & Loan debacle. Although Keating had become bankrupt, \n     the victims recovered their damages from the accountants, \n     bankers, and lawyers who assisted Keating. Despite extensive \n     testimony to Congress that restricting joint and several \n     liability will reduce recoveries for defrauded victims and \n     encourage more fraud, the substitute bill restricts joint and \n     several liability even further.\n       Under the substitute, in the all-too-often cases where a \n     knowing violator's share is uncollectible, the liability of \n     reckless violators for the uncollectible share would be \n     subject to a lower ``cap'' than under the original bill. The \n     rest of the uncollectible share simply will be lost to the \n     defrauded victims. Although the ``cap'' would not apply to \n     victims with a net worth over $200,000 and recoverable \n     damages of more than 10% of their net worth, that basically \n     eliminates anyone who owns a house.\n       Adjudged perpetrators of securities fraud are given a gift \n     while fraud victims are denied full recover of the money that \n     was stolen from them--that is the policy of S. 240. Under the \n     substitute, it will be virtually impossible for many victims \n     of fraud to recover a large part of their losses.\n       (2) Failure to restore the liability of those who aid and \n     abet fraud. The original S. 240 failed to restore aiding and \n     abetting liability for accountants, lawyers, brokers, bankers \n     and others who assist primary wrongdoers in committing \n     securities fraud. The substitute also fails to do so.\n       Last year, in the Central Bank of Denver case, the Supreme \n     Court overturned in a 5-4 ruling 25 years of established \n     precedent (including all 11 federal appellate courts that \n     addressed the issue) by wiping out aiding and abetting \n     liability of accountants, lawyers, brokers, bankers and \n     others who assist primary wrongdoers in committing securities \n     fraud. This right of action has played a vital role in \n     compensating swindled consumers in the major financial frauds \n     of the last several decades and must be restored by Congress. \n     Central Bank severely weakens the deterrence of securities \n     fraud because it sends a dangerous signal to the markets that \n     a primary enforcement tool has been eliminated. That not only \n     hurts defrauded consumers, it hurts all Americans. S. 240 \n     fails to address this issue for obvious reasons--the entire \n     thrust of the bill is to further immunize defendants from \n     liability.\n       In their Congressional testimony, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (``SEC'') and state regulators \n     recommended restoring aiding and abetting liability. Even \n     Senator Dodd has stressed the importance of restoring the \n     liability of those who aid and abet securities fraud. During \n     a May 12, 1994 hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on \n     Securities, Senator Dodd stated ``Lawyers, accountants, and \n     other professionals should not get off the hook, in my view, \n     when they assist their clients in committing fraud . . . The \n     Supreme Court has laid down a gauntlet for Congress . . .  In \n     my view, we need to respond to the Supreme Court decision \n     promptly and I emphasize promptly.''\n       (3) Discrimination against small shareholders. The original \n     S. 240 contained a blatantly discriminatory wealth-test for \n     filing securities fraud class actions. The substitute \n     replaces the wealthiest with an equally discriminatory \n     wealth-control provision.\n       The substitute adds a new provision that sets up a strong \n     presumption that the ``most adequate plaintiff'' in any \n     private class action is the plaintiff that has the largest \n     financial interest in the outcome of the action. The bill \n     then grants this ``most adequate plaintiff'' the power to \n     select the lead counsel and control the case, including \n     settling for any amount or even dismissing the case.\n       Perhaps no other change to S. 240 makes plainer the real \n     motives behind the bill and makes hollower any pretensions to \n     protect meritorious fraud actions. This ``most affluent \n     plaintiff'' requirement would have a devastating effect on \n     average consumers who are defrauded in the\n      securities markets. Mutual funds and large investors, who \n     may have close ties to big corporate fraud defendants \n     (e.g., mutual fund managers enjoy ready access to \n     information from corporate managers) and who may care less \n     about full recovery because its loss reflects a smaller \n     proportion of total investment than smaller investors' \n     losses, can afford to accept less than full recoveries, \n     would have complete control over class actions at the \n     expense of average investors. What makes a mutual fund \n     that has lost $1 million of its $1 billion portfolio more \n     adequate to represent a class of defrauded investors than \n     an elderly widow who has lost $27,000 out of her $30,000 \n     net worth?\n       Aside from raising the specter of collusive intervention by \n     large investors simply to dismiss cases or enter into \n     sweetheart settlements, the substitute virtually precludes \n     small investors from being able to obtain attorneys willing \n     to invest their time on cases in which they can have no \n     control and may not be paid fairly (or at all) by lead \n     counsel.\n       This provision also directly contradicts the primary \n     rationale for class actions--to give average investors who \n     cannot afford to litigate against major corporate defendants \n     on their own a means by which they could band together to \n     seek a remedy for their losses.\n       (4) Inadequate efforts to deal with unwarranted secrecy. As \n     we outlined in our January letter, the original S. 240 made \n     no effort to address the serious problem of defendant-coerced \n     secrecy orders covering all the underlying documents relevant \n     to the fraud. These orders remain in effect throughout the \n     litigation and generally require that, once a case is \n     terminated, the documents be destroyed or returned to the \n     defendants. Such secrecy orders block significant corporate \n     wrongdoing from public scrutiny and allow defendants, at the \n     time of settlement, to proclaim their innocence without fear \n     of contradiction. The substitute continues to ignore this \n     problem, further demonstrating that the bill is not really \n     intended to solve the real problems in securities litigation.\n       (5) Imposition of ``loser pays'' fee shifting. The original \n     S. 240 abrogated a 200-year-old legal principle reflecting \n     our national policy in favor of access to justice. It did so \n     by requiring losing parties who decline to accept out-of-\n     court resolution of their cases to pay all of the prevailing \n     parties' legal fees and costs.\n       The substitute simply replaces this ``loser pays'' rule \n     with a different ``loser pays'' [[Page S 8909]] rule--\n     mandatory sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure which includes a strong presumption in favor \n     of shifting all legal fees and costs to the loser. The new \n     provision suffers from the same flaw as the original--average \n     consumers who have just lost their retirement savings in a \n     financial fraud cannot afford to take the risk that they \n     might lose their house as well if they lose their case. \n     Moreover, the new rule would prolong cases, waste more \n     resources on litigating additional issues, and add to the \n     money spent on legal fees by requiring the court to make \n     specific findings regarding compliance by every party and \n     every attorney, even when no party requests it.\n       The end result of this ``loser pays'' rule will be a severe \n     chill on the assertion of securities fraud claims, regardless \n     of their merits.\n       (6) Free reign for false statements. The original S. 240 \n     allowed the SEC to consider creating a safe harbor exemption \n     for corporate predictive statements--the substitute creates a \n     ``safe ocean'' exemption from fraud liability for corporate \n     predictions that essentially grants would-be wrongdoers a \n     license to lie. The substitute adopts a wholesale exemption \n     which would completely immunize a vast amount of corporate \n     information (``any statement, whether made orally or in \n     writing, that projects, estimates, or describes future \n     events'') so long as it is called a forward-looking statement \n     and states that it is uncertain and may not occur, even if \n     they are made with reckless disregard for their accuracy. \n     This is a gaping loophole through which wrongdoers could \n     escape liability while fraud victims would be denied \n     recovery.\n       Corporate ``forward-looking statements'' are prone to fraud \n     as they are an easy way to make exaggerated claims of \n     favorable developments in order to attract cash. They \n     continue to be a favorite tool of con artists, promoters and \n     illegal insider traders to artificially pump up the price of \n     public company stock in order to profit at investors' \n     expense. The substitute's safe harbor provision creates an \n     incentive to provide bad information to consumers and a \n     disincentive to provide the best available information. It \n     would effect an upheaval in the mandatory corporate \n     disclosure system in the United States, with immense \n     potential adverse market consequences.\n       Finally, by itself, the safe harbor would eliminate many, \n     if not most, fraud class actions. The safe harbor provision \n     would require, with limited exemptions, that every class \n     action member prove actual knowledge of and reliance on the \n     fraudulent statement, an (almost) impossible requirement in \n     class action suits. Under this provision, even purposefully \n     fraudulent forward-looking statements could be made without \n     the possibility of redress through a class action lawsuit.\n       The SEC is currently in the middle of a rulemaking \n     proceeding to study forward-looking statements and has \n     requested that Congress allow it to complete its process. We \n     believe that Congress should defer establishing a safe harbor \n     provision until the agency experts have thoroughly reviewed \n     this matter.\n       (7) A flawed limitations period. The current statute of \n     limitations--1 year from discovery of the fraud but in no \n     event more than 3 years after the fraud--is generally \n     regarded as too short. The original S. 240 extended the \n     period to 2 years after the violation was or should have been \n     discovered but not more than 5 years after the fraud. Rather \n     than heed the SEC and the state securities regulators, who \n     testified that the limitations period should be even longer, \n     the substitute simply drops the extension entirely. There is \n     now not a single provision in the bill that would increase \n     recoveries for fraud victims--it is totally one-sided and \n     should really be called the ``Wrongdoer Protection Act of \n     1995.''\n       (8) An insider-dominated disciplinary board for \n     accountants. The substitute deletes the provision of the bill \n     that would have allowed the trade association for the \n     accountants--the AICPA--to be a sham self-disciplinary board \n     for public accountants. This is the only one of our original \n     concerns that has been adequately addressed by the substitute \n     bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 1995]\n\n                 Making It Easier to Mislead Investors\n\n                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)\n\n       A lawsuit-protection bill speeding through Congress will \n     give freer rein to Wall Street's eternal desire to hype \n     stocks.\n       It's cast as a law against frivolous lawsuits that unfairly \n     torture corporations and their accountants. But the versions \n     in both the House and Senate do far more than that. They \n     effectively make it easier for corporations and stockbrokers \n     to mislead investors. Class action suits against the \n     deceivers would be costly for small investors to file and \n     incredibly difficult to win.\n       I'm against frivolous lawsuits. Who isn't? But these bills \n     would choke meritorious lawsuits, too. They affect only \n     claims filed in federal court, so bilked investors would \n     still have the option of seeking justice in a state courts. \n     But the federal law would set a terrible precedent and leave \n     the markets more open to fraud.\n       The congressional proposals started out as a way of \n     protecting companies against so-called strike suits--lawsuits \n     filed against companies whose stock price unexpectedly \n     plunges.\n       The companies complain that ``vulture lawyers'' lie in wait \n     for these drops in price. When they occur, the lawyers find \n     willing plaintiff and immediately file suit. The usual \n     charge: that the firm, its executives and accountants misled \n     investors with falsely optimistic statements. That's not \n     true, the companies say, but they tend to settle just to \n     avoid the legal expense. If so, this represents a grave \n     cost--on corporations, shareholders and economic efficiency.\n       But are strike suits really overwhelming corporations? \n     There's evidence on both sides of this issue, but most of it \n     fails to document the executives' broad complaints.\n       As an example, take the new study by Baruch Lev, a \n     professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He \n     looked at public companies whose share price fell more than \n     20 percent in the five days around the time of a \n     disappointing quarterly earnings report. There were 589 such \n     cases, from 1988 through 1990. But related class action suits \n     were filed against only 20 of the firms.\n       Lev compared those 20 companies with similar firms where no \n     lawsuits were filed. Among other things, the litigated \n     companies tended to put out rosy statements--in some cases, \n     just before releasing the bad earnings report. By contrast, \n     the firms that weren't sued tended to publish more sober \n     statements and to warn investors in advance that earnings \n     would be lower than expected.\n       Lev warns that his sample is too small to reach statistical \n     conclusions. But his basic data undermine the claims that \n     companies are bombarded with lawsuits whenever their stock \n     goes down.\n       The new bills contain many provisions to worry investors. \n     For example, if you lost a class action suit, you might have \n     to pay the legal fees for the other side. Psychologically, \n     that could stop you from suing no matter how badly you'd been \n     burned.\n       The bills also give excessive protection to so-called \n     forward statements, which are the business projections that \n     corporations make.\n       Under current law, it's all right to make a reasonable \n     projection, even if it doesn't come true. But a company can \n     be held liable for making an unreasonable projection that \n     misleads investors. In many of the cases where lawsuits are \n     brought, ``executives are telling the public that everything \n     is going to be great while they're bailing out and selling \n     their own stock,'' Jonathan Cuneo, general counsel of the \n     National Association of Securities and Commercial Law \n     Attorneys, told my associate Louise Nameth.\n       If these bills become law, however, companies could get \n     away with making misleading, even reckless statements. To win \n     a class action lawsuit, you would have to prove that a \n     falsehood was uttered with a clear intent to deceive. That's \n     incredibly tough to do.\n       This provision, in particular, troubles Arthur Levitt Jr., \n     chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ``The law \n     should not protect persons who make material statements they \n     know to be false or misleading,'' he says, ``nor should it \n     protect offerings such as penny stocks, nor persons who have \n     committed fraud in the past.''\n       Baseless lawsuits do indeed exist. Lawyers may earn too \n     much from a suit, leaving defrauded investors too little. The \n     incentives to sue should be reduced. But not with these \n     bills. They'd let too many crooks get away.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, June 26, 1995]\n\n                      Will Congress Condone Fraud?\n\n                             (By Jack Egan)\n\n       Some of the most unpopular people in Washington these days \n     are shareholders' lawyers who sue companies at the drop of a \n     stock, usually claiming that management deceived investors \n     about the outlook and is liable for losses when shares fall.\n       Lawmakers have concluded--without much supporting \n     evidence--that this happens far too frequently, hamstringing \n     corporations and causing executives to be wary of making \n     forecasts. And so legislation is zipping through Congress to \n     curb ``frivolous'' or ``speculative'' lawsuits against public \n     companies. The high-sounding Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995 easily passed the House in March. It was \n     approved by the Senate's banking panel and will soon be taken \n     up by the full body.\n       It just might come to be remembered as legislation that \n     steeply tilted the playing field against investors. The bill \n     may make executives feel easier about discussing what they \n     see ahead, with shareholders benefiting from more candid \n     disclosure. But it makes it very hard for shareholders to sue \n     over legitimate grievances. The House version even protects \n     management when it lies, provided the deception is a \n     projection.\n       Unhappy Levitt. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \n     which has always viewed private actions as complementing its \n     own limited enforcement abilities, is not happy. In a letter \n     to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato \n     sympathizing with ``the punishing costs of meritless \n     lawsuits,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also wrote that the \n     House-passed bill might ``compromise investor protection.'' \n     And while the Senate Banking Committee's bill is more \n     moderate, the SEC chairman complained in another letter that \n     shareholders were still hampered from bringing suits against \n     ``all but the most obvious frauds.''\n       The crusade to throttle shareholder lawsuits has been \n     spearheaded by high-tech companies and the big accounting \n     firms. The stocks of technology companies tend to be quite \n     volatile, flying high and suddenly nose- [[Page S \n     8910]] diving, often when companies fail to meet ambitious \n     earnings expectations. That makes them especially vulnerable \n     to mugging by lawsuit; according to the American Electronics \n     Association, which represents the industry, 9 out of 10 suits \n     are settled out of court--averaging $8.6 million--simply to \n     avoid the cost of lengthier litigation.\n       But claims that nuisance lawsuits are hurting the ability \n     of such companies to raise capital come at a time when \n     technology shares have led the stock market to an all-time \n     high and initial public offerings are running at record \n     levels. ``There are 200 to 300 companies sued each year out \n     of 20,000 that are registered,'' notes Democratic Sen. \n     Richard Bryan of Nevada--about the same as 20 years ago. ``I \n     also oppose frivolous lawsuits, but that issue is really a \n     trojan horse for firms that simply want to limit their \n     liability.''\n       The accounting firms felt stung by large liability verdicts \n     against them in connection with the S scandal of the early \n     1990s. But the cases that produced the biggest judgments were \n     brought not by individual shareholders but by the federal \n     government, seeking to recoup its depleted S insurance \n     fund. Nevertheless, the ``Big Six'' are eagerly backing the \n     bill because it would bar shareholders from suing outsiders \n     who are parties to securities fraud--like accountants.\n       When the full Senate debates the bill, perhaps at the end \n     of June, efforts may be made to make it less hostile to \n     shareholders and to deal with some of the SEC's objections. \n     The Clinton administration has yet to weight in. But a veto \n     threat from the president would be risky, since the lopsided \n     vote in the House is enough for an override.\n       Shareholders already are barred from suing brokerages and \n     must arbitrate instead. ``The pendulum had swung too far \n     toward the lawyers, and now it's swinging too far the other \n     way,'' notes Richard Kraut, an attorney with Washington-based \n     Storch & Brenner, which specializes in securities law. \n     ``Unfortunately, some major investor frauds may have to take \n     place before it again moves back toward the center.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the St. Louis (MO) Post-Dispatch, May 9, 1995]\n\n                     Don't Protect Securities Fraud\n\n       The House has passed and the Senate is considering a bill \n     to make it much harder for defrauded investors to bring \n     class-action suits against investment firms that defraud \n     them, as well as the accountants who helped them. The impetus \n     for such legislation is the same as that driving tort \n     revision, only with even less justification.\n       The Senate bill is sponsored by New Mexico Republican Pete \n     Domenici and, surprisingly, Christopher Dodd, Democrat of \n     Connecticut.

But there isn't one; the \n     number of suits has remained nearly constant in the last 20 \n     years, despite huge growth in the volume of securities. \n     However, recent events have created a new problem: Many \n     accounting firms that put their names to false documents \n     during the junk bond craze and the thrift debacle are finding \n     themselves in court more often than ever before. They want \n     protection. This bill would give it to them.\n       It would prohibit lawyers and accountants from being named \n     as primary defendants in a class action unless the plaintiffs \n     first can show that these defendants had actual knowledge of \n     the fraud and the precise state of mind of those they helped \n     perpetrate it. That can only be done by the discovery process \n     in a lawsuit, not beforehand. The bill would also bar any \n     plaintiff from suing who had less than 1 percent or $10,000 \n     invested in the securities in question. This will keep a lot \n     of people out of court.\n       When they do get in, if they lose, they will be responsible \n     for court costs if they have holdings of more than very \n     limited size, clearly a deterrent to small-investor suits for \n     securities fraud.\n       These are just the highlights of a complex bill whose \n     provisions work against not only the rights of small \n     investors, but even large government bodies, such as Orange \n     County or the city of Joplin, Mo., which lost huge amounts on \n     derivatives that may have been sold to them without full \n     disclosure.\n       Among those senators on the Banking Committee who are in a \n     position to slow down the bill is Missouri's Christopher S. \n     Bond.

On \n     Wednesday the House approved a drastic revision of the \n     nation's securities laws as part of the GOP's agenda for \n     legal reform. The proposed Securities Litigation Reform Act, \n     which is a key provision in the ``contract,'' would sharply \n     curb the ability of investors and shareholders to sue \n     stockbrokers, accounting firms and companies for fraud.\n       The measure, authored by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport \n     Beach), simply goes too far. It is one thing to craft \n     legislation directed at curbing specific abuses of securities \n     litigation, but the House measure would amount to a wholesale \n     dismantling of the system that enables investors and \n     shareholders to seek redress for financial fraud.\n       Opponents, including state securities administrators as \n     well as consumer groups, maintain that the bill would \n     virtually destroy the ability of citizens of modest means to \n     sue when they are victims of fraud. Arthur Levitt Jr., the \n     chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has \n     worked to improve investor protections, has reservations \n     about the measure. So has U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. Small \n     wonder.\n       The proposed law would tilt the legal system in favor of \n     corporations and their accounting firms, lawyers and \n     investment firms by making it too easy for them to defend \n     themselves against shareholder suits.\n       What might such a law portend for cases like Orange County? \n     County officials are seeking legal recourse against Merrill \n     Lynch Co., which sold high-risk securities to the county's \n     ill-fated investment pool, utilmately triggering its \n     bankruptcy. The fear is that the proposed law could be \n     interpreted by the courts in ways that would work against \n     plaintiffs in cases like this one.\n       Under the House bill, a judge could require the losers in a \n     securities fraud case to pay the legal expenses of the winner \n     if the judge determined that the investors' complaint did not \n     originally possess substantial merit. Currently there is no \n     ``loser pays'' general provision. The proposed law also would \n     demand that the plaintiff show that the company or its \n     officials acted knowingly and recklessly in committing the \n     fraud. The current standards are simpler: They allow \n     investors to sue for fraud if a company withholds information \n     or issues misleading information that affects the market \n     price.\n       Between these two standards there perhaps is a sensible \n     middle ground--but that's not to be found in the House bill.\n       Cox casts his bill as a limitation against so-called \n     ``strike suits,'' brought by shareholders who file lawsuits \n     when the share price drops in a company in which they own a \n     small part of the stock. The congressman likes to point out \n     that high-technology companies are a favorite target of such \n     lawsuits. Abuses of such lawsuits absolutely do exist and \n     should certainly be curbed, but the House bill, as drawn, is \n     overly broad in its potential application.\n       The Senate will take up the securities reform bill soon. We \n     urge it to take a reasoned approach to the problems posed by \n     frivolous securities lawsuits. The current House bill is not \n     the answer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the Philadelphia (PA) Inquirer, June 4, 1995]\n\n                 Going Easy on Crooks in 3-Piece Suits\n\n                            (By Jeff Brown)\n\n       True or false: Republicans are the law-and-order people who \n     want to see more crooks go to jail and stay there longer?\n       True--unless the crook wears a three-piece suit instead of \n     a ski mask. Corporate executives, accountants, securities \n     industry pooh-bahs--they need special protection against \n     claims they're thieves.\n       This, in a nutshell, is the point of the Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995, approved, 11 to 4, by the \n     Senate Banking Committee on May 24 and likely to reach the \n     Senate floor this month. It's meant to discourage \n     ``frivolous'' claims. But what about legitimate ones?\n       Unlike a similar House bill passed in March, the version \n     sponsored by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), the committee \n     chairman, doesn't include a sweeping requirement that the \n     loser in a stock-fraud case pay the winner's legal fees. But \n     a trial judge could implement ``loser pays'' by finding the \n     plaintiff had engaged in ``abusive litigation.''\n       Loser pays could deter stockholders from filing legitimate \n     lawsuits by making it too risky to challenge rich \n     corporations.\n       The D'Amato bill has other flaws as well, says Securities \n     and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt. ``Willful \n     fraud'' would be made easier by a ``safe harbor'' provision, \n     he says, because executives would be overly protected from \n     lawsuits regarding misleading projections about a company's \n     performance.\n       Stock frauds usually use bloated financial projections to \n     entice investors. D'Amato would require a new, higher level \n     of proof--essentially, that a company intended to mislead, \n     giving defrauded investors the nearly insurmountable task of \n     establishing a corporate executive's state of mind. An \n     executive could make virtually any projection, then insulate \n     himself against a fraud verdict by adding that things might \n     not turn out that way.\n       The bill has some good provisions to protect investors \n     joining in a class action from abuse by their own attorneys, \n     and it would ensure that plaintiffs are illegitimate victims \n     and not stooges for ambulance-chasers.\n       But federal court figures don't support Republican claims \n     there's a flood of frivolous suits. There are only a few \n     hundred class-action securities cases filed a year, while \n     there are more than 14,000 public companies. And, of course, \n     many securities suits are legitimate--just ask the victims in \n     the Crazy Eddie or Lincoln Savings & Loan cases. Class \n     actions are the cheapest way for small investors to fight \n     abuses by well-heeled corporations.\n       SEC lawyers say most people who commit stock fraud could be \n     charged with criminal [[Page S 8911]] violations that carry \n     prison terms. But they aren't because in criminal cases, \n     prosecutors need proof beyond a reasonable doubt. So most \n     stock-fraud cases, which are tough for jurors to grasp, go to \n     civil court, where only a preponderance of evidence is \n     required.\n       Still, a crook is a crook, whether he burgled your home or \n     lied to sell you stocks at an inflated price. And the D'Amato \n     bill would relax the penalties for many stock crooks.\n       It would scrap rules that make each participant in a fraud \n     liable for the entire sum-ordered returned to investors or \n     paid in fines. Under the current ``joint and several'' \n     liability rules if one defendant can't come up with his \n     share, the others have to pay it.\n       Instead, D'Amato would establish ``proportional \n     liability,'' in which, with few exceptions, each defendant \n     would pay a percentage of the penalty equal to his share of \n     guilt, as determined at trial. Thus, if the defendant who \n     owes 80 percent is bankrupt, the defrauded investors would be \n     unable to recover most of what they are owed, even if another \n     defendant has the money.\n       This provision was aggressively sought by the accounting \n     profession after some firms were assessed hefty penalties for \n     S frauds.\n       Proportional liability is like letting the getaway driver \n     off with a speeding ticket if he didn't intend for his \n     partner to shoot the bank teller. It protects the partially \n     guilty at the expense of the investor who is completely \n     innocent.\n       Surely, most corporate executives are honest. But since \n     there's little evidence that frivolous lawsuits are a real \n     problem, it looks as if business groups seek ``reform'' \n     legitimat lawsuits.\n       A cynic could guess what goes through their minds when they \n     see a thief in a three-piece suit held to account:\n       ``There, but for the grace of God, go I.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 240. I \nwas an original cosponsor of this bill in this Congress, and in the \nlast Congress.\n  Mr. President, securities litigation reform is not a household issue. \nIt is not one that many people follow. But the fact is that it is very \nimportant for our economy, and very important for job creation in our \ncountry.\n  Very simply, this bill will attempt to put an end to frivolous class \naction lawsuits that are filed against America's publically traded \ncompanies.\n These are lawsuits that have little and often no bearing. They are \nfiled for the sole purpose of blackmailing the companies. They are not \nlawsuits; they are legalized blackmail into settling suits rather than \ngoing to court. Everyone that has followed the issue at all knows, or \nwho has ever been sued knows, that it is often cheaper to settle up \nfront than it is to go all the way to trial with the cost of lawyers \ntoday. Of course, once the suit is settled, the attorneys that brought \nthem keep the money. They keep the larger portion of it. It has become \na cottage industry for certain lawyers that has been created over the \nlast 20 years. I think it is time to put an end to it. And that is the \npurpose of this bill.\n  The problem is dramatic. Since 1980, there has been a 73-percent \nincrease in the number of civil suits filed in Federal court. It is \nestimated that class action suits have increased three fold in just the \nlast 5 years.\n  The cost of these suits is no small matter. At the end of 1993, class \naction suits were seeking $28 billion in damages.\n  The impact of these suits is having a detrimental effect on our \neconomy. Many companies are afraid to go public and sell stock. By \nremaining private, they can avoid these kinds of suits, but they also \nsacrifice an increase in growth and jobs that can come from going \npublic. This is costing America jobs.\n  Some have suggested that companies from overseas are afraid to \nestablish businesses in America out of fear that they too will fall \nvictim to these suits. This is costing America jobs as well and \neconomic growth.\n  Money that would otherwise be spent on new job growth, and on \nresearch and development is paid out to lawyers to settle these suits \nor money is spent fighting them.\n  Furthermore, excessive costs are passed along to consumers in the \nform of higher prices. All of this has a ripple affect on our economy. \nMr. President, it is making America less competitive and creating fewer \njobs\n at a time in this country's history when we should become competitive, \nand we should be creating more jobs in order to stay competitive.\n\n  In my home State of North Carolina alone, 116 companies have \ncontacted me and asked for help in passing this bill. They are united \nin their effort to end the abusive lawsuits that are being filed. \nTogether, these companies in one small State alone, in North Carolina, \nemploy 118,000 people. That is why the bill is so important not only to \nNorth Carolina but to the Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, let me assure you that nothing in this bill will \nprevent anyone from filing a legitimate fraud case against any company. \nNot one sentence in this bill will restrict anyone's rights who has a \nlegitimate complaint.\n  If it did, I do not think 50 Members of the Senate would have \ncosponsored the bill.\n  Also, please do not be fooled by the ads you are seeing or hearing on \nthis bill. They are not paid for by consumers. They are paid for by \ntrial lawyers--wanting to protect their lucrative industry.\n  Consumers will be helped by this bill. Any consumer that has a job--\nor wants a job--or wants to keep a job will be helped by this bill.\n Not one consumer with a legal, legitimate lawsuit will be hurt by this \nbill.\n\n  Mr. President, a point that is not often made is that the consumers \nand plaintiffs in the class action suits rarely benefit from these \nlawsuits. You would think that the consumers and plaintiffs are \nreceiving the benefits. But they are not. Study after study shows that \nlawyers get the vast major portion of any settlement.\n  We had testimony that the average investor received 6 or 7 cents for \nevery $1 lost in the market because of these suits--and this is before \nthe lawyers are paid. So after the lawyers are paid, there is \npractically nothing left.\n  Mr. President, I particularly want to note that an important part of \nthis bill is the reform of proportionate liability rules. This bill \nrequires that those who are responsible for causing a loss pay their \nfair share. But it does not require them to pay more than their fair \nshare except in certain extenuating circumstances.\n  This will stop the tactic of going after the deep pockets--like the \naccountants. The rule is sue everybody and anybody, and then get the \nrich defendants to do the paying.\n\n       Under this bill, if a party to the suit is found to have \n     contributed to a loss but did not do so knowingly, that \n     person pays only the percentage of the loss he or she caused. \n     For example, if this person caused 2 percent of the loss, \n     they pay 2 percent of the liability claim.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly support S. 240. I think we need to act on \nit now. And I am going to oppose any amendment that I think will weaken \nthis bill. I think it needs to be passed as it is. This bill has \nalready been moderated enough in committee to give it bipartisan \nsupport. So I urge the Senate to pass S. 240 as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 240. I should like to make \na couple of preliminary observations.\n  This is not the kind of riveting stuff that keeps everybody in \nAmerica who is watching on television at the edge of their seats. Much \nof this discussion is esoteric, technical, and full of legal nuances, \nbut no one should conclude from that preliminary observation that it \ndoes not have an enormous impact on millions and millions of Americans. \nEveryone who has a retirement account in which he or she has invested \nin securities, millions of small investors, all have a stake in this \nlegislation.\n  The American securities market is acknowledged by all to be the \nworld's safest and most effectively regulated, and the underpinning for \nthis system has been twofold. No. 1, the powers which the Congress has \nvested in the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate and keep \nthe marketplace honest, fair and open to investors is one important \naspect, in addition to the adjunctive support provided by State \nsecurities administrators in the respective 50 States. But as has been \npointed out by my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nMaryland, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, private causes \nof action are recognized by security regulators to be an equally \nimportant part [[Page S 8912]] in keeping the marketplace free from \nfraud.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about something that is academic, \nas if there were problems in the past and all of those have been taken \ncare of. The New York Times in an article dated Friday, June 9 of this \nyear makes this observation, and I quote:\n\n       Securities regulators say they are opening investigations \n     into insider trading at a rate not seen since the mid 1980's, \n     the era in which Ivan Boesky, who went to jail for trading on \n     inside information, became a household name.\n\n  And then later I quote again.\n\n       ``It's a growth industry,'' said William McLucas, Director \n     of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission. ``In terms of raw numbers, we have as many cases \n     as we have had since the 1980's, when we were in the heyday \n     of mergers and acquisition activity.''\n\n  The North American Association of Securities Administrators estimates \nthat each year there is approximately $40 billion of fraud in the \nsecurities marketplace. So millions of investors, people who do not \nthink of themselves as stock barons but have their small retirements \ninvested in the securities market, can be affected by what this \nCongress does on this legislation.\n  In my view, Mr. President, the bill pits innocent investors, many of \nwhom are elderly and are dependent upon those investments for their \nsole source of retirement, on one side and those who are trying to \nimmunize themselves from liability by reason of their own fraud on the \nother side.\n  I recognize the need for some changes in our securities litigation \nsystem. I do not appear before my colleagues this evening as a defender \nof the status quo.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the sponsors of this bill \nbecause in a number of areas the bill which they have introduced \nimproves the present system, and it does so in these areas without \ndisadvantaging the innocent investors who may have been defrauded. \nThese areas include the prohibition of referral fees to brokers, \nprohibition on attorney's fees paid from SEC settlements, no bonus \npayments to class plaintiffs, elimination of conflicts of interest, \npayment of attorney's fees on a percentage basis, and improved \nsettlement notices.\n  Mr. President, I think all of us would agree that those are important \nand positive changes which impact the securities litigation system in \nAmerica. And if we are not in unanimity, there is virtually a consensus \neverywhere that these go a long way to correcting abuses in the \nsecurities litigation system. But any system must be balanced, and it \nmust be fair so that it does not preclude meritorious suits.\n  The Trojan horse that brings this legislation to the floor unfurls \nthe ensign of preventing frivolous lawsuits. I share that conclusion, \nas does the distinguished ranking member, who previously spoke in the \nChamber. But the passengers inside this Trojan horse have very little \ninterest in deterring frivolous lawsuits. Their primary objective is to \nshield themselves, to immunize themselves from liability as a result of \ntheir own, in some instances, intentional fraud and, in other \ninstances, reckless misconduct.\n  It is for that reason my colleague and friend, the junior Senator \nfrom Alabama, Senator Shelby, and I introduced our own bill earlier \nthis year, S. 667, as an alternative to the legislation that is before \nus today. Our bill is a carefully tailored, fair approach that would \nprevent frivolous actions from proceeding while at the same time \nprotecting meritorious actions.\n  Let me make a comment about frivolous lawsuits. I think there is a \nlegitimate problem there, but the way in which we deal with frivolous \nlawsuits is to impose sanctions on attorneys who file frivolous \nlawsuits and make them be financially responsible for their misconduct \nin filing those frivolous lawsuits. I favor enhancements to rule 11 \nunder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and earlier this year I was \nprivileged to offer the Frivolous Lawsuit Prevention Act which is \ndesigned to provide an additional power to Federal judges once a \ndetermination is made that a frivolous lawsuit or claim is made to \nimpose sanctions, and that means financial responsibility so that the \ndefendant who is required to defend that frivolous lawsuit can make his \nor her or its expenses whole again. I support that.\n  I submit to my colleagues that this legislation which we have before \nus this evening is far more than an attempt to curb frivolous lawsuits \nbecause if that were its purpose, I would be in the vanguard of urging \nmy colleagues to adopt this legislation.\n  S. 667, which has been endorsed by numerous groups including the \nNorth American Association of Securities Regulators, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the Government Finance Officers Association \ncontains reform measures that will improve the system for all \nAmericans.\n  S. 667 also contains many provisions to eliminate abusive suits and \nto protect all parties to litigation including a novel proposal for an \nearly evaluation procedure designed to weed out those cases that are \nclearly frivolous cases and, as I said previously, to impose sanctions \nwhen necessary.\n It provides for a rational, proportionate liability system.\n\n  Mr. President, it protects the defrauded investors fully so that when \nthere is an uncollectible judgment against the primary wrongdoer, they \ncan fully recover the amounts of their losses. It provides a reasonable \nregulatory safe harbor provision, as my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, pointed out earlier this evening. \nAnd importantly, S. 667 also contains other measures to preserve \nmeritorious suits.\n  It restores aiding and abetting liability eliminated last year by the \nSupreme Court in the Central Bank of Denver case by a 5 to 4 decision. \nThe effect of that case was to wipe out liability of aiders and \nabetters and to immunize them from lawsuits based upon their own \nreckless misconduct that has been responsible for losses incurred by \ninnocent investors.\n  S. 667 would also extend the statute of limitations for security \nfraud action in a manner suggested by the SEC and virtually every other \nunbiased witness who appeared before the Banking Committee. It codifies \nthe reckless standard of liability with current law with the Sunstrand \ncase, which Senator Sarbanes referred to, and it restricts, Mr. \nPresident, secret settlements, protective orders, and the sealing of \ncases so that the public really knows what happens in these cases.\n  In my judgment, the bill that Senator Shelby and I sponsored is \nreasonable, targeted, and balanced. It solved those problems that have \nbeen identified while preserving the system that has made our capital \nmarkets the envy of the world as the strongest and most safe. By \ncontrast, Mr. President, the bill before us today makes radical changes \nin our securities laws, laws that have worked exceedingly well over the \npast six decades.\n  Let me discuss some of the arguments made for these radical changes. \nThe primary premise of those who support S. 240 deals with an \nallegation that there has been an explosion of class action security \nlawsuits and that we must undertake these radical reforms in order to \nprevent this abuse.\n  The Congressional Research Service, at my request, prepared a report \nthat was issued on May 16 of this year and entitled ``Securities \nLitigation Reform: Have frivolous shareholder suits exploded?'' Let me \nread to you some of the findings of the CRS study. Again, Mr. \nPresident, I quote:\n\n       While some current legislation . . . and the outcry of \n     various corporate executives suggest that the volume of \n     warrantless securities litigation has exploded to crisis \n     proportions, evidence of this ``explosion'' is far from \n     definitive. We know that in the 1990's, the number of annual \n     Federal class action, securities cases filed has returned to \n     the proximate level of such filings during the early and mid-\n     1970's.\n\n  And I continue with the quote.\n\n       By the standards of the docket sizes faced by Federal \n     courts, the upper limits of these potentially ``abusive'' \n     securities suits remain exceptionally small; the filings have \n     never exceeded 315 yearly in 20 years.\n\n  ``* * * 315 cases a year in the past 20 years.'' Let me reiterate \nthat point again. ``* * * 315 cases in 20 years.''\n  In fact, when multiple filings are consolidated, because some \ncompanies face more than one lawsuit as a result of the allegation of \nsecurities fraud, approximately 120 to 150 companies are sued each \nyear.\n  Mr. President, that is out of some 14,000 registered companies --\n14,000 registered companies. And approximately 120 to 150 companies get \nsued each year.\n  The CRS goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S 8913]]\n\n       There are observers who argue that shareholder suits \n     legally and unfairly exploit the high stock price volatility \n     often observed among high tech firms.\n\n  However, another analysis of these high tech firms indicates that \ntheir unusually short, and unpredictable product cycles may, in fact, \npredispose their management toward a greater tendency to suppress \nproper disclosure or to provide false ones.\n\n       On balance, the evidence does not appear to be compelling \n     enough for one to definitively assert that warrantless class \n     action suits have exploded.\n\n  Mr. President, let us take an even closer look at the underlying \npremise upon which opponents would rewrite, in my view, in a radical \nway, our highly successful 60-year-old securities law. First, we are \ntold there is an explosion of securities fraud cases. The CRS report \ndemonstrates that this simply is not the case.\n  Let me invite my colleagues' attention to a chart that I have had \nprepared. These are securities class action lawsuits filed from 1974 to \n1993. In 1974, over here, perhaps 290 cases; 20 years later, in 1993, \napproximately 290 cases. So in more than 20 years, when the population \nof America has geometrically increased, when the amount of general \ncivil litigation--general civil litigation, not securities class \nactions--has grown dramatically, the number of class actions brought on \nbehalf of securities plaintiffs has remained relatively constant, \nsomewhere at the highest point, 315, and currently 290 cases.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am astounded by this chart. The proponents of this bill \nhave been saying, since we started in the committee, that there has \nbeen an explosion in class action lawsuits filed--an explosion. We are \ngoing to hear tonight from all quarters. What the Senator is showing us \ntonight is really extraordinary. There has been no explosion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. My colleague is correct. Over the past 20 years, the \nnumbers have been relatively constant. This represents one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the 235,000 Federal suits filed in 1994--one-tenth of 1 \npercent. There were 235,000 cases filed in the Federal court system in \nAmerica last year, and one-tenth of 1 percent involved class action \nsecurities lawsuits. So my distinguished colleague is correct in her \nobservation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I just say to my friend, thank you for this very \nstraightforward chart because we are going to hear it all over the \nplace in this U.S. Senate. And I am going to refer back to your chart, \nI say to my friend. Thank you very much for setting the record \nstraight. There is no explosion of these class action lawsuits. Those \nare the facts. And I thank my friend for presenting it in such a clear \nfashion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And I thank my colleague for posing the question. \nSecurities class action suits have actually declined sharply in the \nlast 20 years relative to both the number and the proceeds--the number \nand the proceeds--of initial and secondary public offerings, stock \nmarket trading volume, and every other measure of economic activity. To \nclaim that suits by victims of financial swindles have constituted an \nexplosion in civil litigation is patently false.\n  Now, we are also told, Mr. President, that so many companies are \nbeing sued that they are being distracted from other businesses. This \nis simply not true. According to figures from Securities Class Action \nAlert, only about 140 public companies were sued in securities fraud \nactions last year out of some 14,000 public companies reporting to the \nSEC. The only suits that have been going up are business suits against \neach other; that is, companies suing companies--companies suing \ncompanies, not suits by individuals against businesses. So if the \ncompanies who are suing each other are so troubled by litigation, why \ndo they not just stop suing each other?\n  Mr. President, I think I have the answer. It is because they do not \nwant to prevent themselves from being able to sue. They just want to \nprevent private individuals from being able to sue them. It is as \nsimple as that. These companies would also have us believe that because \nof these suits, companies are fearful of going public, that they cannot \nraise the capital in the securities market.\n  Mr. President, there is no credible evidence that I am aware of that \nsupports this astounding proposition. The existence of these suits has \nhad no discernible impact on capital formation of business. The Dow \nJones Industrial Average has just surpassed 4,000--an all-time high. I \nwould invite my colleagues' attention to this chart. In terms of the \ninitial public offerings, over the period of time that we have \nreferenced here, they have gone up by approximately 9,000 percent in \nthe last 20 years.\n  In the last 20 years, initial public offerings have risen by 9,000 \npercent--now, that is the number, Mr. President, of initial public \nofferings--while the capital raised, that is the amount raised by these \ninitial public offerings, has increased by 58,000 percent. So both in \nterms of numbers and in terms of the dollars raised, they have gone up \n9,000 and 58,000 percent, respectively. Let me say, I am glad to hear \nthat, because that is important that we have the necessary capital \nformation to finance new enterprises. That is the essence of the free \nenterprise system.\n  The contention is invariably made that every time a stock drops to \nany degree, regardless of the reason, that there is a great rush to the \ncourthouse and lawsuits are filed based solely upon the fact that the \nstock has declined in value. I want to address that assertion.\n  In examining this contention, there are three studies that have been \ncalled to my attention that reject that thesis.\n  One study by Prof. Baruch Lev of the University of California at \nBerkeley, involved public companies whose share price dropped by more \nthan 20 percent in the 5 days following a disappointing earnings \nreport.\n  Although there were 589 such cases where the stock dropped at least \n20 percent from 1988 through 1990, class action suits were filed \nagainst only 20 of those firms, approximately 3.4 percent.\n  Moreover, Professor Lev compared those 20 firms with similar firms \nthat were not sued and found that the firms that faced litigation \ntended to put out rosy projections, or forward-looking statements, just \nbefore releasing the bad earnings report, the issue that my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland so ably addressed that operates \nunder the rubric of safe harbor, of which much more will be said during \nthe course of this debate by him and, I am sure, my other colleagues.\n  By contrast, the firms that were not sued tended to publish more \nsober statements warning investors in advance that earnings would be \nlower than expected.\n  There was another study conducted by the firm of Francis, Philbrick, \nSchipper from the University of Chicago which searched for lawsuits \nagainst companies sustaining 20 percent declines in earnings and sales.\n  The author reported that, out of 51 such at-risk firms during 1988 to \n1992, only 1 of the 51 was the target of a shareholder suit related to \nan earnings announcement.\n  And still a third such study performed by Princeton Venture Research \nshows that between 1986 and 1992, less than 3 percent of the companies \nwhose stock dropped by more than 10 percent a day were sued.\n  So the claim that companies are bombarded with suits whenever their \nstock goes down is simply not supported by the studies I have seen. \nNone of these studies, even using a 20-percent stock drop, found even \n3.5 percent of the companies in this classification that were sued.\n  Even the Senate Banking Committee staff report published last year, \nunder the able direction and support of Senator Dodd and his staff, \nconcluded, and I quote:\n\n       There is also no clear evidence of the extent to which \n     price declines drive securities class actions to be filed.\n\n  But the proponents of S. 240 tell us, most of these suits are filed \njust so the plaintiffs can get a settlement. Again, the documentation \ndoes not support this conclusion.\n  The Senate staff report, to which I previously referred, examined \nsentiments of Federal judges regarding meritless litigation and found, \nand this again is directly from the staff report:\n\n       Seventy-five percent of the judges surveyed . . . thought \n     that frivolous litigation was a small problem or no problem \n     at all.\n\n  [[Page S 8914]] The SEC told the subcommittee that surveys had shown \nthat ``most judges believed that frivolous litigation was not a major \nproblem and could be dealt with through prompt dismissals.'' And I \nbelieve the enhanced provisions of the Federal Code of Civil \nProcedures, that deals with frivolous lawsuits, is an absolutely \nappropriate and responsible way to deal with errant and irresponsible \nlawyers who file clearly frivolous lawsuits.\n  I believe the strengthening of those provisions under the law, \ntargeted and tailored, is the most effective way of curtailing lawyer \nabuse.\n  The evidence clearly shows we ought not to throw the baby out with \nthe bathwater.\n  S. 240 goes well beyond what is needed to deal with the abuses that \nexist in today's system. Every Member has cause to be concerned, \nbecause once this bill is passed and the next fraud comes along, \nwhether it be a derivative disaster in your State, another Keating, a \nMilken or a Boesky, your constituents will want to know why you \nsupported legislation that took their rights away to recover for their \nlosses as a result of such fraudulent activity.\n  Unfortunately, there are provisions in S. 240 that would effectively \ngut private actions under the securities laws, eliminate deterrence and \nhurt average Americans who depend on the system to protect their \nsavings, their investments, and their retirements. These provisions \nwould give free rein to the next Charles Keating and could cause \nincalculable damage to States and localities that suffer the same fate \nthat Orange County has recently faced.\n  Among the most troublesome provisions in S. 240 is the safe harbor \nexemption from fraud liability for forward-looking statements that \nessentially allows executives to say almost anything and be immunized \nfrom liability as a result of such misstatements.\n  Senator Sarbanes has indicated he will be offering an amendment to \ncorrect this problem, and I intend to join him as a cosponsor of that \namendment. It is something that concerns the Federal and State \nregulators; the SEC has written, the National Association of Securities \nAdministrators has written, government finance officers, and consumer \ngroups all have written the committee expressing their concern.\n  Corporate predictions, called forward-looking statements, inherently \nare prone to fraud as they are an easy way to make exaggerated claims \nof favorable developments to attract investors to part with their cash.\n  In fact, the Federal securities laws were passed in large part \nbecause of the speculative stock projections that led to the stock \nmarket crash in 1929.\n  Recognizing the inherent potential for exaggerated claims, forward-\nlooking statements by public companies were not even permitted until \n1979.\n  I think that bears repeating. Until 1979, no forward-looking \nstatements were made as a result of the experience that we had in the \n1920's and the predilection of those seeking to embellish their own \nprospects for earnings to attract investors to invest as a result of \nthese extravagant and flamboyant claims.\n  Since 1979, the SEC, recognizing some forward-looking statements may \nbe important, has allowed limited predictions and protected them from \nliability if they are made in good faith and with a reasonable basis. \nNevertheless, false predictions continue to be a favored tool of con \nartists, promoters and the illegal inside traders to pump up the price \nof their stock in order to profit at the expense of innocent investors.\n  S. 240 sponsors have not explained to my satisfaction why corporate \nstatements that are made in bad faith with no reasonable basis or even \nwith reckless disregard for their falsity need to be immunized from \nliability when fraud has occurred. I hope during the course of this \ndebate we might have such an explanation. We are talking about \nstatements made in bad faith with no reasonable basis and with reckless \ndisregard for their falsity. I know of no public policy, Mr. President, \nthat suggests that kind of conduct ought to be shielded from liability. \nUnhappily, S. 240 in its present form would do just that.\n  Moreover, the SEC is in the middle of a rulemaking process to study \nforward-looking statements and has asked Congress to allow it to \ncomplete its process. The original S. 240, as my colleague from \nMaryland has pointed out, would have done so. It is a technical area, \nhighly complex and, frankly, it is a subject best left to the \nadministrative agency in a rulemaking process rather than in a broad \nlegislative enactment.\n  However, in committee, a virtual unlimited exemption or safe harbor--\nmy colleague has aptly referred to this, not as a safe harbor but a \npirate's cove, and I think he makes a compelling argument. Any \nstatement either made orally or in writing that projects estimates or \ndescribes future events, so long as it is called a forward-looking \nstatement, is immunized as a result of the legislative draft that is \nbefore us, even if that statement is made recklessly.\n  This is a gaping loophole through which wrongdoers or victims of \nfraud would be denied recovery. The effects of these changes, I think, \nare difficult to forecast, but I think they would have a devastating \nimpact on the market.\n  I remind my colleagues that it is already extremely difficult to win \na securities case. Under the 1934 Securities Act, a plaintiff must \nprove fraud or reckless behavior. Recklessness is defined as ``highly \nunreasonable conduct that involves not merely simple or even gross \nnegligence, but an extreme departure from standards of ordinary care.''\n  So I think it is important for our colleagues to understand that no \none under the 1934 act is liable as a result of his or her simple \nnegligence, ordinary negligence, or even gross negligence. It requires \na higher standard of misconduct--namely, reckless conduct. That seems \ntough enough to me. Anyone who makes a projection and meets this \nstandard ought to pay his or her victims.\n  A second troublesome provision in S. 240 is the severe limits on \njoint and several liability, even when the primary wrongdoer is \ninsolvent. America's legal system for fraud traditionally has been \nbased on joint and several liability. Under this standard, if one \nwrongdoer is found liable but has no assets, the victim can be \nreimbursed fully by the other wrongdoers without whose assistance the \nfraud could not have succeeded. The underlying premise for this legal \nrationale is in that scale of justice--in the balance. Who should bear \nthe burden of the loss? The innocent investor, who is totally without \nfault--no fault whatsoever--or a defendant whose conduct is at least \nreckless and may be subject to intentional fraud? Who ought to bear the \nburden? The philosophy that undergirds the American system of \njurisprudence for centuries has said that under those cases, the scales \nof justice weigh in favor of the innocent victim, the one who had no \nresponsibility, did not in any way contribute to the misdeed which \ncaused the loss.\n  The rule has enabled swindle victims to recover full damages from \naccountants, brokers, bankers and lawyers who participate in securities \nscams when the primary wrongdoer has no assets left, has fled the \njurisdiction, or may be in jail. The original S. 240 sharply limited \nthis rule, immunizing reckless wrongdoers from joint and several \nliability.\n  If that had been the law, most investors would not have recovered \ntheir life savings in the Charles Keating/Lincoln Savings & Loan \ndebacle. Although Keating had become bankrupt, the victims recovered \ntheir damages from the accountants, bankers, and lawyers who assisted \nMr. Keating. Of the $240 million in judgments imposed in favor of class \naction plaintiffs, nearly 50 percent--or $100 million of those \nrecoveries--were against accountants, bankers and lawyers--not the \nprimary wrongdoers, but individuals who conducted and assisted Mr. \nKeating in perpetrating the fraud.\n  Despite extensive testimony, particularly by the SEC, that \nrestricting joint and several liability will reduce recoveries for \ndefrauded victims and encourage more fraud, the bill, as reported, \nrestricts joint and several liability even further.\n  In the all-too-often cases in which a knowing violator is bankrupt, \nin jail, has fled, the liability of reckless violators to the \nuncollectible share would be capped. That is, there would be a \nlimitation. Those who are proportionately [[Page S 8915]] liable under \nthe system that is incorporated in this print of S. 240 would be \nsubject only to their proportionate share, even though the innocent \nvictim is unable to recover his or her full amount.\n  There is one exception, as was pointed out, and that would be with \nrespect to victims whose net worth is under $200,000 and have \nrecoverable damages of more than 10 percent of their net worth.\n  May I suggest, Mr. President, that is a very narrow window of \nopportunity. People who own their own homes, automobiles, and have the \nmost modest of assets frequently might have a net worth of $200,000. So \nwe are not talking about the goliaths of business people who are \nextraordinary affluent; we are talking about tens of millions of \nAmericans who would be excluded from recovery under this provision. \nThat cap on joint and several liability means it will be virtually \nimpossible for a great many of those victims to recover their losses.\n  The bill also does several other very damaging things. The bill would \nalso turn over control of class actions to the wealthiest investors, \neven though their interests may not be as extensive as the small \ninvestors' that the class action device was designed to protect. It \nrelegates small investors to a second-class status and makes the \nsecurities markets strictly a playgrounds for the big boys--the \nwealthy.\n  In committee, a new provision was added that requires courts to \ndesignate the ``most adequate plaintiff''--words of art--in a private \nclass action. This ``most adequate plaintiff''--defined as the \nplaintiff with the largest financial interest in the case--is given the \npower to select lead counsel, control the case, and even to make \nsettlement agreements for any amount or even dismissing the case.\n  This change to S. 240 makes plain the real motives behind the bill \nand makes hollow any protections that this is to protect meritorious \nfraud actions. This ``most affluent plaintiff\" requirement would simply \nwipe out average investors who are defrauded. The wealthiest investors \nmay have close ties to big corporate defendants who can afford to \naccept less than the full recoveries. But it gives them complete \ncontrol over class actions at the expense of average investors.\n  Aside from raising a specter of collusive intervention by large \ninvestors, and simply dismiss cases or enter into sweetheart \nsettlements, the substitute virtually precludes small investors from \nbeing able to obtain attorneys willing to invest their time on cases \nover which they have no control and for which they may not be paid.\n  This also directly contradicts the reason why class actions were \ndevised in the first instance, and that is to give average investors, \nwho cannot afford to fight big corporations by their own means, the \nability to band together and collectively seek a remedy for their \nrelief. Instead, this provision gives preference to wealthy investors \nwho can afford to seek redress for their losses on their own.\n  S. 240 also eliminates a principal investor protection provision that \nwas originally part of S. 240, as the distinguished ranking member of \nthe committee, the senior Senator from Maryland, points out. That deals \nwith the statute of limitations issue. Currently, the statute of \nlimitations is 1 year from the point of the discovery of the fraud on \nthe part of the victim, but in no event for more than 3 years after the \nfraud. The SEC, the North American Association of Securities \nAdministrators--every regulator that I am aware of, who offered \ntestimony or correspondence, indicated that this period is simply too \nshort. It provides insufficient time for meritorious, legitimate \nplaintiffs to bring their action. The original S. 240 extended the \nperiod to 2 years after the violation was, or should have been, \ndiscovered by the injured plaintiff, not more than 5 years after the \nfraud itself.\n  As the Senator from Maryland pointed out, we dealt with this issue \nback in 1991 under the Lampf case. That case will have particular \nrelevance to a number of my colleagues, because immediately after the \nLampf case, which gave a retroactive interpretation to the law, \nsurprising most securities litigators by concluding that there was only \na one to three-year statute of limitations, immediately thereafter, \nCharles Keating filed a motion to dismiss.\n  A number of my colleagues joined me in supporting an amendment to the \nlegislation that restored the 2-5 year provision retroactively, so that \nthose cases for dismissal would not find themselves dismissed simply \nbecause the statute of limitation provision came as a surprise.\n  What this provision seeks to do with respect to the prospective cases \nis the same 2-5 year. As the distinguished Senator from Maryland \npointed out, when this proposal came to the floor to correct the \nretroactive abridgement or shortening of the statute of limitation from \n2-5 to 1-3, there was no objection. Everyone agreed.\n  The only issue--and it was a legitimate question--should we not take \na broader look at security litigation reform? There was no objection to \nthe premise you need a longer period of time.\n  I must say that the SEC has been very clear, and their testimony has \nbeen compelling, that even with all of the resources that the SEC can \ncommand and marshal, it takes an average of 2.25 years to complete an \ninvestigation of an alleged securities fraud. That is the SEC, with \nimmense resources.\n  We, by failing to provide for the statute of limitations correction \nwhich was originally part of this bill and in rejecting the advice of \nthe SEC, the North American Association of Security Administrators, and \nvirtually everyone that testified from a regulatory public policy point \nof view, we give comfort to those who perpetrate fraud on innocent \ninvestors.\n  I will offer an amendment that deals with that issue either later \nthis evening or tomorrow, as our time permits.\n  I might just add that Senator Dodd, one of the prime sponsors, \nindicated he, too, believes S. 240 needs to be amended to reflect that \nstatute of limitations issues we just talked about. Obviously we will \nwelcome his support.\n  S. 240 also fails to restore the aiding and abetting liability for \nprivate suits and eliminates the ability of the SEC to sue aiders and \nabettors for reckless behavior as opposed to fraudulent conduct.\n  Members will recall, Mr. President, I cited in the Keating case that \nrecovery of $100 million was from aiders and abettors. If S. 240, as \nthis legislation is being processed today, was the law back in 1991, \nthat $100 million could not have been recovered. It could not have been \nrecovered because the court, just last year, in another case that was a \nsurprise to those who follow the securities industry issues, held that \na ruling that had been in effect for 25 years, namely, that aiders and \nabettors were covered under the provisions of the securities law, that \naiders and abettors were, in fact, not covered, and under a 5-4 Supreme \nCourt decision, Central Bank of Denver, such liability for aiders and \nabettors is eliminated.\n  We are not talking about proportionately. We are not talking about \njoint and several liability. We are talking about aiders and abettors. \nThey have a free ride. They are home free. All you need to do is get \nyourself in the aider and abettor category and you can have a field \nday. It is ``Katie bar the door,'' do whatever you wish, and insofar as \na private cause of action, you are precluded from recovery.\n  Mr. President, no matter how anyone feels on securities litigation \nreform, can it possibly be in the best interest of America to insulate \nfrom liability a category of persons whose conduct has inflicted upon \ninnocent investors enormous financial loss, maybe even wiping out \neverything that a retired person might have in his or her investment?\n  I indicated that the Supreme Court also imposed a limitation even on \nthe SEC--even on the SEC. They can only move against aiders and \nabettors under a much stricter standard. The defendant must knowingly--\nand that is the standard which even the SEC is forced to meet now as a \nconsequence of the decision. We will be offering an amendment on this, \nMr. President.\n  I note that Senator Dodd, who has worked for many, many years--and \nall who work with him on the committee and consider ourselves his \nfriend and close colleague acknowledge Senator Dodd's fine work. Last \nyear, in an April 29, 1994, ``Dear Colleague'' letter, Senator Dodd \nmade this observation:\n\n\n[[Page S 8916]]\n\n       Allowing private actions against aiders and abettors is an \n     indispensable part of our securities enforcement system, and \n     I believe Congress must consider legislation to reinstate \n     liability in this area.\n\n  Senator Dodd was absolutely right on the mark in 1994. The reason is \neven more compelling in 1995, based upon some of the information that I \nshared with Members earlier from those on the SEC that tell us about \nthe amount of fraudulent activity. In this particular instance we \ntalked of insider trading.\n  Senator Dodd reiterates:\n\n       Lawyers, accountants and other professionals should not get \n     off the hook, in my view, when they assist their clients in \n     committing fraud. . . . The Supreme Court has laid down a \n     gauntlet for Congress. . . . In my view, we need to respond \n     to the Supreme Court's decisions promptly and I emphasize \n     promptly.\n\n  As Senator Dodd so often does, he speaks with precision, eloquence, \nand cogency. He is right on the mark, Mr. President. We need to do that \nin the course of processing any securities legislation.\n  Mr. President, this bill, also as reported by the Banking Committee, \ndeals with the Securities Act of 1933--that is another provision--not \nthe 1934 act. The 1933 act targets fraud in initial offerings of \nsecurities to the public. Initial public offerings historically have \nbeen rife with fraud by huckster promoters peddling new securities.\n  The 1993 act holds such wrongdoers strictly liable. The bill as \nreported, however, makes it nearly impossible to hold crooks who sell \nphony securities strictly liable for their fraud.\n  S. 240 also retains some highly burdensome pleading requirements--\nburdens that must be met by fraud victims, plaintiffs in these class \nactions. By ``pleadings,'' we are talking about an illegal document \nthat commences a lawsuit in which a plaintiff--in this instance a \nvictim of fraud--states forth his cause of action. Those pleading \nrequirements under S. 240 are exceedingly burdensome.\n  Under current law, fraud plaintiffs are not required to state \nspecific facts establishing the defendant's intent. That is a \nsubjective state of mind. It seems pretty reasonable. It is a pretty \nonerous burden to be able to allege with particularity what the \nsubjective thought process would be of a defendant.\n  The reason for that is because such facts are normally only uncovered \nlater during a deposition or discovery process when there is a chance \nto examine the defendant or defendants under oath.\n  One of the ways the original S. 240 tried to block cases was through \nimpossible pleading standards requiring plaintiffs to state specific \nacts demonstrating the state of mind of each defendant. Witness after \nwitness indicated that this would prevent, for all practical purposes, \nmany fraud victims from recovering their money.\n  The bill as reported merely replaces the impossible standard with the \nharshest standard currently used. In my view, and in the view of those \nwho regulate the securities market, it is not much of an improvement \nover the original language and would prevent legitimate plaintiffs from \neven asserting a cause of action.\n  S. 240 also contains an unfair and inflexible limit on victims for \nrecovery. The bill contains a formula designed to limit the amount \nwrongdoers have to pay their victims. Basically, if the company stock \ngoes up during a 3-month period following public exposure of the fraud, \nfor whatever reason, the victims' recovery is reduced accordingly.\n  Finally, Mr. President, S. 240 would shield evidence of fraud from \nthe public. S. 240 purports to attempt to eliminate secret settlements. \nThe bill fails to ban the almost universal secrecy orders that are \nrequired by defendants as a condition of producing documents during \ndiscovery.\n  These orders remain in effect throughout litigation and generally \nrequire that, once a case is over, documents be destroyed or returned.\n  Such secrecy orders block significant corporate wrongdoing from \npublic scrutiny.\n  Moreover, these orders allow defendants to proclaim their innocence \nafter settlement without fear of contradiction--and permit them to \nclaim the cases are frivolous when they visit with Members of Congress. \nAnd because the documents upon which the case was predicated are \nsealed, there is no effective rebuttal.\n  I would note one final irony of S. 240.\n  The bill violates one of the primary tenets of Republican theory--\nthis is, returning government functions to the private sector.\n  For 60 years, private attorneys general have supplemented the \nantifraud efforts of Federal regulators at the SEC and at the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Such an enforcement scheme is entirely consistent with the Republican \ncontract.\n  But as CBO noted in its cost estimate on S. 240, if private rights of \naction are curtailed, substantial government involvement, including \nincreased SEC efforts, will be needed to assure that the markets remain \nfair.\n  Morever, as CBO stated in its June 19 letter to the committee, the \nSEC will have to double or triple its resources allocated to this \nfunction--and the cost to the American taxpayer could be up to $250 \nmillion over the next 5 years.\n  That is to say, by reason of the restrictions placed on private \ncauses of action, if one has a view of regulating the marketplace \neffectively the burden essentially now falls almost exclusively to the \nSEC, and they would have to up staff and the cost as estimated by CBO \nis $250 million; $250 million paid by the American taxpayer.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to pages 30-32 of the committee \nreport for CBO's estimate.\n  This confirms the view of the last Republican Chairman of the SEC, \nRichard Breeden, who testified that the elimination of private actions \nwould require the Commission to hire 800-900 more lawyers to police the \nmarkets.\n  Even if Congress should choose to appropriate the added money--which \nI seriously doubt--the system will not be as effective.\n  I hope each Member of this body will remember that when the next \nfinancial debacle hits, average Americans, many of whom may be people \nwho live in your district, will be unable to runner their losses.\n  Last week, my constituents who were victims of the Keating scandal \nvisited Washington, along with other Keating victims from other States.\n  One way Jeri Mellon from Henderson, NV, a community just 10 miles out \nof Las Vegas. She is head of the Lincoln bondholders committee. She and \nJoy Delfosse came to see me.\n  Every Member of Congress should be standing up for the Joy Delfosses \nand Jeri Mellons in their States, not the Charles Keatings.\n  These are retirees whose life savings would have been wiped out if \nthey had not been able to recover as a result of the Keating fraud. And \nthat ability to recover would have been lost if aiders and abettors had \nnot been liable. And that ability to recover may have been lost if the \nstatute of limitations had not been extended. And that recovery may \nhave been lost as a result of the proportionate liability proposal \ncontained in this legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be pleased to do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is right to bring up real people in this \nconversation. Because oftentimes we get into the legalese and we forget \nwhat we are doing here. So I appreciate the fact that the Senator from \nNevada brings up the people that he met. I was with him at that \noccasion. We met people from Florida. We met people from Arizona. We \nmet people from Nevada and California.\n  I want to ask the Senator a question, because I think anyone watching \nthis debate ought to listen to the response of the Senator. My friend \nfrom Nevada who is addressing this Chamber is a learned attorney. He \nhas great experience in seeking justice for people.\n  Is it the Senator's opinion that the people who were bilked by \nCharles Keating would have recovered as much as they have recovered, \nwhich as I understand it is between 40 percent and 60 percent of their \nlosses, if S. 240 had been the law of the land?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The answer to the question of the Senator is unequivocally \nclear. They would have been unable to recover as much as they did. I \nwould simply point out to my distinguished colleague from California, \nthese are innocent people. These are not people who in any way \nparticipated in any scam. They are not lawyers. They are ordinary folks \nwhose retirement was on the line. These were retirees. [[Page S 8917]] \n  It is interesting. As I know the distinguished Senator knows, they \nwent to what they describe kind of as a neighborhood bank, Lincoln \nSavings and Loan. They knew everybody and they would come in and say, \n``How are you Suzy?'' And, ``How are you John?'' And, ``How is the golf \ngame and how are you enjoying retirement?''\n  And they would say, ``Look, what is this stock offering you have, \nAmerican Continental Corp.?''\n  And they were told, ``You know, you would be crazy not to put money \nin that, absolutely crazy. There is a much larger return than you would \nget just if you put this in a regular savings account in the bank.''\n  These are the people, I tell my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia, real Americans from every State of all political \npersuasions, of all political philosophies--real people, and the impact \nupon them is what this debate is all about this evening.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one last question for my friend. As we saw these \npeople tell their stories, it was very moving. They are older. They \nwere targeted by Charles Keating. And what they told us is--and this is \nthe question for my friend--they went to file their suits, because they \nwere clearly led to believe that their investments were protected, and \nthe salespeople for Charles Keating were told to lead them down this \nprimrose path. They called them the meek and the ignorant. They sought \nout ``the meek, the weak and the ignorant.'' That is a quote from \nCharles Keating's brochures to their salesmen.\n  We know that Charles Keating put his whole family on the payroll and \ndrained all this money that he stole. And is it not true, I say to my \nfriend, that he went bankrupt?\n  Mr. BRYAN. He went bankrupt.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he could not be touched by these \npeople because he had a lot of lawyers who protected him. And he went \nbankrupt.\n  Is it not true that these good, decent senior citizens had to go to \nthe aiders and abettors?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is precisely the case.\n  As the distinguished California Senator knows, having read the \nprovisions of the print before us, the thing that is particularly \nalarming is that there are several provisions in this law that is being \nproposed in its current form, as to the pleading standard, safe harbor, \nthe ability to stay or to prevent discovery--that is ascertaining what \nthe facts are--so long as there is a motion to dismiss; all of those \nwere tactics that were used by Mr. Keating and his lawyers. All of \nthose.\n  If the law in 1991 was the same as it will be if this is passed, \ntogether with the Supreme Court decisions that S. 240 fails to correct, \nthose people might never have gotten into the courthouse door.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me thank my friend again for bringing this down to \nwhat happens to people when we act here in this body, and to say to my \nfriend that we ought to make any bill pass the Keating test.\n  We ought to look at any bill when we are done amending it. I hope we \namend this bill and make it better, and put it to the Keating test. \nWould those good people, those innocent senior citizens, be able to \nrecover when we are ``done with reforming,'' I put in quotes, the \nsecurities law? Yes. We should go after those frivolous lawsuits. We \nall want to do that. But there are an awful lot of good companies out \nthere that need to have the frivolous lawsuit aspect of this bill \nlooked at. But, my goodness, let us not forget the real people, the \nretirees, the people who are the targets. Let us not forget them \nbecause it reminds me of the S scandal. We made one mistake once. I \ndo not want to see us make another one.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia. I know some of my colleagues have waited for a while. I \nwill finish, and yield the floor in a couple of minutes.\n  The Senator from California speaks with such clarity and conviction. \nShe is absolutely right to remind us that a little more than a decade \nago a big mistake was made with respect to the savings and loan \nindustry. We spent billions and billions of dollars as a result. If we \ndo not correct this legislation, as my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland, the distinguished colleague from California, and others will \npoint out, we are opening the door to every charlatan and con artist in \nAmerica to prey on innocent investors with impunity, and there almost a \nsense of deja vu. It may not happen tomorrow. But it will happen, and \nthe consequences will be frightening. I do not think we want to make \nthat mistake. America's securities markets have served as the world's \nfinest. The Lincoln Savings & Loan in Orange County could be in my \nState. It could be in your State. I do not want to have to explain to \nthe good citizens of my State why I allowed this happen, and why my \nfailure to take action precluded them from being recovered as a result \nof frauds perpetrated upon them. Each and every one of us share that \nconcern.\n  I have a number of letters from State and local officials. I am not \ngoing to belabor my colleagues this evening with all of those. But let \nme point out as this issue has been framed that it is the lawyers. \nFrankly, the lawyers do bear some responsibility here.\n  We talked about rule 11. And I am in favor of banging the lawyers \nthat file frivolous lawsuits over the head and hit them in the \npocketbook. Count me at the head of the line for them. But under the \nguise of getting the lawyers, unpopular since Shakespeare's time. \n``Kill the lawyers first''--every student of Shakespeare recalls that \nquote. Let us try to give here a more objective view.\n  You have people such as the Association of Governing Boards of \nUniversities and Colleges who have expressed their concern and support \nthe kinds of amendments that we are going to be offering, and oppose \nthe legislation in its current form; the Association of Jesuit Colleges \nand Universities; the Council of Independent Colleges; the Government \nFinance Officers Association. These are not closet groups of trial \nlawyers. The Association of Clerks and Recorders; Election Officials \nand Treasurers; the Municipal Treasurers Association of the United \nStates and Canada; the National Association of College and University \nBusiness Officers; the National Association of County Treasurers and \nFinance Officers; the National Association of State Universities and \nLand Grant Colleges; the North American Security Administrators.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that one can make the case that these \nare simply closet advocates for trial lawyers, who I understand are the \nmost disdained group of professionals in America. I understand that. I \nam not unmindful of that.\n  But we ought not with the antipathy that we feel toward them for \nwhatever reason wipe out the right of innocent investors to sue. And \nthe bill before us in its current print will do precisely that unless \nwe accept the amendments that the Senator from Maryland, the Senator \nfrom California, and I believe the Senator from Florida as well maybe \nhave.\n  I thank my colleagues for yielding.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. President, the United States has the largest and the best capital \nmarkets in the world. In no small part that is because markets in the \nUnited States are seen as open and fair. And it is one important reason \nover 50 million Americans are able to participate in our securities \nmarkets. Every investor can be confident that our markets are honest, \nand it is very clear that private securities litigation has played an \nimportant role in keeping them honest.\n  At the same time, there is real need for reform. One study conducted \nin the 1980's that was cited in the Banking Committee's report on S. \n240 found that every single American corporation that suffered a market \nloss of $20 million or more in its capitalization had been sued. In \nother words, every corporation whose stock at one time declined in \nvalue by $20 million or more was sued for securities fraud during the \nperiod covered by the study.\n  Another study included in the committee report stated that one out of \nevery six companies less than 10 years old that received venture \ncapital had been sued at least once and that such lawsuits consumed an \naverage of over 1,000 hours of time of the management of these \ncompanies and an average of $692,000 in legal fees. [[Page S 8918]] \n  What these statistics demonstrate is that either our capital markets \nare literally overrun with fraud or that there are at least some \nunsupportable lawsuits being filed. The clear consensus of the Banking \nCommittee was that the evidence did not and does not support the \nconclusion that our markets are suffering an epidemic of fraud. Rather, \nthe committee's conclusion was very clear that there are abusive \nsecurity lawsuits being filed, that these suits result in significant \nadverse consequences for our capital markets and for our economy \ngenerally and that, therefore, the reform is necessary. The fact is \nthat securities fraud litigation can be very lucrative, even in cases \nwhere there is no fraud. Some would say particularly in cases where \nthere is no fraud.\n  The Supreme Court made that point very clear in the case of Blue Chip \nStamps versus Manor Drug Store. The Court in dictum stated that in \nsecurities fraud cases ``even a complaint which by objective standards \nmay have very little success at trial has a settlement value to the \nplaintiff out of proportion to its prospect of success * * *.''\n  The Court's opinion was, of course, stated in the driest possible \nlanguage. In the language of my hometown of Chicago what the Court was \nreally saying was in this area of the law plaintiffs and lawyers who \nare willing to game the system have all the clout. These few people, \nand they are a few people, know that they have the corporations and \nother ancillary parties over a barrel, and they are taking advantage of \nthat fact. They win settlements in all too many cases because of that \nleverage rather than because of the merits of the case.\n  What is more, Mr. President, under current law, small investors in a \nclass action case do not really control the case, their lawyers do. One \nplaintiff lawyer demonstrated the temptation that a few lawyers have \nsuccumbed to all too clearly. He said:\n\n       I have the greatest practice of law in the world; I have no \n     clients.\n\n  The opportunity for coercive settlements is not the only problem in \nthis area. The Supreme Court made it clear again in the Blue Chip case \nthat ``the very pendency of the lawsuit may frustrate or delay normal \nbusiness activity of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the \nlawsuit.''\n  The reason for that is not just the cost of defending against \nlitigation, it is the cost and disruption that flow from the company's \nattempts to respond to plaintiff's request for discovery, and discovery \nis not a minor matter. The committee report again stated:\n\n       According to the general counsel of an investment bank, \n     ``discovery costs account for roughly 80 percent of the total \n     litigation costs in security fraud cases.''\n\n  Companies have had to produce over 1,500 boxes of documents and to \nspend well over $1 million just to comply with the costs of fact-\nfinding, of discovery. It is not just a matter of documents. The time \nthe key employees of the company may have to spend responding to \nrequests for information may keep them and, often does keep them, from \ntending to the business of the company and, therefore, that also works \nto coerce settlements.\n  Some might argue that this is a technical legal issue and one that is \nnot important to the general American public. However, I would suggest \nthat just the opposite is true. Every American, whether he or she \ninvests in our capital markets or not, has an interest in seeing to it \nthat reform is enacted.\n  The Director of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nmade that point very well. Testifying before the Senate Banking \nCommittee in the last Congress, he stated that:\n\n       There is a strong public interest in eliminating frivolous \n     cases because, to the extent that baseless claims are settled \n     solely to avoid the costs of litigation, the system imposes \n     what may be viewed as a tax on capital formation.\n\n  Chairman Arthur Levitt of the SEC reinforced the point in his \ntestimony before the Banking Committee. He stated that:\n\n       There is no denying that there are real problems in the \n     current system--problems that need to be addressed not just \n     because of abstract rights and responsibilities, but because \n     investors and markets are being hurt by litigation excesses.\n\n  Mr. President, these excesses and the tax they impose on our capital \nmarkets and on our economic growth are particularly onerous because \nthey do not even achieve what they are ostensibly designed to achieve--\nthe protection of investors who suffer losses. All too often, under the \ncurrent system, investors receive settlements that amount to only about \n10 percent, or even less, of their damages, and that is another whole \nset of problems, to hold out false hopes to people in which they may \nreceive less than 10 percent recovery.\n  The direct legal expenses in settlements paid are, again, only part \nof the tax. There are also a variety of indirect costs, costs that fall \nparticularly heavy on the entrepreneurial and high-tech companies on \nwhich our future economy depends.\n  Of course, investors want to be protected from fraud, but they also \nwant to be able to get as much information as possible, and they also \nwant to be sure that their companies are focused on their business \ninstead of on potential lawsuits and litigation.\n  Mr. President, it is important for us all to remember that investors \nare not just investors. Investors are also employees who want their \ncompanies to do well. There are also parents who want to see expanded \neconomic opportunity for their children. They are also participants in \nthe United States economy, and they want to see the kind of strong \ngrowth and job creation that goes along with a strong economy.\n  Our world economy is more and more competitive. Our future prosperity \ndepends on our ability to meet and beat that international competition, \nand that means we need a continuing supply of new ideas, new products, \nand new companies that can produce the jobs for tomorrow. These major \nissues may seem a long way from the arcane securities law issues we are \ndebating and discussing this evening. But, Mr. President, the \nconnection is both strong and direct.\n  A recent book by Hendrick Smith entitled ``Rethinking America,'' I \nthink, illustrates the connection. That book has chapter after chapter \nrecounting the challenges facing American business in this new global \neconomy. It talks about how some American businesses are succeeding and \nhow some are not.\n  One of the points it makes in some detail is the short-term focus \nthat afflicts so many American corporations, an affliction that is not \nshared by our major international competition.\n  American corporations are all too often intensely focused on the \nshort-term price of their stock instead of the long-term growth and \nprosperity of the business. This short-term focus, which the current \nstate of our securities laws helps to foster, distracts senior \nmanagement, makes too many of our businesses less creative, and \nundermines the ability of American businesses to make the investments \nthat have the best long-term payoff.\n  Our securities laws have also rendered many of our businesses mute, \nvirtually unable to talk to their investors and owners because of the \nfear of lawsuits. And that fear not only disadvantages the companies \nand investors, it also hurts all of us because it is an impediment to \nthe smooth functioning of our capital markets. It makes it less likely \nthat capital is allocated in a way that produces the most and best new \njobs and new products.\n  Let me emphasize that point. New jobs and new products. The engine of \nour economy depends in large part on the vitality of our capital \nmarkets and, in the final analysis, Mr. President, that is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  I cosponsored S. 240, along with Senator Dodd and other members of \nthe committee because this bill has been based on the recognition of \nall of these facts. S. 240 acknowledges the multiple rolls and multiple \ninterests that we all have in this area, and it is based, I think, on \nan understanding that we are all in this together. We must maintain \nstrong investor protection while making it more difficult to file \nfrivolous or abusive lawsuits.\n  We must create a climate where new businesses that create new jobs \nand new products can get the capital they need while ensuring that \ndefrauded investors have the right to recover their damages.\n  S. 240, as introduced by Senators Dodd and Domenici, went a long way \ntoward achieving all of those objectives. The bill attempted to reduce \ntransaction costs so that investors who [[Page S 8919]] are harmed see \na smaller portion of their recoveries consumed by attorney's fees and \nother miscellaneous costs. It was designed to help our capital markets \ncreate more jobs and create greater long-term economic growth, \nsomething that is also very good for investors.\n  The original bill has been modified in a number of important ways. \nSome of these changes represent improvements in the original bill, \nothers represent new concepts. The bill before us is not perfect. In \nsome areas, quite frankly, I would have written it differently and I \nsuspect everybody in the Senate almost always feels the same way about \nmajor legislation.\n  I think it is clear, however, that this bill is a good-faith attempt \nto balance the competing public objectives in this area and that \nlooking at the overall legislation it successfully achieves balance and \nthat, I think, is a very important notion as we address this issue. \nAchieving balance is important to keeping our capital markets vital, \nand it is important to our economic prosperity.\n  It is important, Mr. President, again to keep in mind what this area \nof the law is all about and what the bill does and does not do. This \nmay get a little technical, but I guess a lot of the conversation here \nhas gone into the particular aspects of the bill that are the most \ncontroversial.\n  What we are talking about has to do with private rights of action for \nfraud under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and rule 10b-5 \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n Those laws did not expressly provide private parties with a right to \nsue corporations or other parties involved in the issuance and sale of \nsecurities. However, this area of law has evolved out of a long series \nof judicial decisions, not legislative actions.\n\n  S. 240 will help reduce frivolous and abusive security suits, and it \nachieves that objective without encouraging fraud and without \nundermining the rights of investors, and particularly small investors, \nto recover where there actually is fraud.\n  Some argue that the bill is somehow unbalanced because it limits \njoint and several liability and because it does not extend the statute \nof limitations in private section 10(b) cases. The bill, however, holds \neveryone--I emphasize that--everyone who commits ``knowing'' securities \nfraud jointly and severally liable. Other defendants may be only \n``proportionately'' liable; that is, they may be only responsible for \nthe share of the harm that they cause. That ensures that parties who \nmay be only 1 percent or 2 percent responsible for the fraud are not \nadded defendants in cases simply because they have deep pockets.\n  Proportionate liability is far from a new concept. We have had it in \nthe tort area in my own State of Illinois for a number of years. It is \nan important and necessary change. Without it, many people will not \ndeal with the small entrepreneurial, startup companies that are the \nmost likely to be sued--and I point out that are most likely to create \njobs--because the potential liability is so much greater than the \nprofit that can be earned from doing business with these companies. \nMany companies are increasingly unable to find accounting firms and law \nfirms willing to do business with them and are having increasing \ndifficulty in attracting the best people to sit on their boards of \ndirectors. And the result of that is, again, less information and less \nprotection for investors and greater hurdles for the new companies on \nwhich our economic future depends.\n  Of course, in some cases, the parties most responsible for fraud are \njudgment proof; that is, they have no assets at all that can be found. \nIn those situations, this bill provides, I think, substantial \nprotection for small investors. First, it says that defendants that are \nproportionately liable have their share of responsibility increased up \nto 50 percent of their proportionate share, so that all investors are \nbetter compensated for the losses they have suffered. For small \ninvestors, those with a net worth of under $200,000, who suffer a loss \nof at least 10 percent of their net worth, every defendant is jointly \nand severally liable for paying those damages--a provision in this bill \nthat I think ensures that small investors get that extra protection.\n  The proportionate liability provisions are not the only provisions, \nhowever, that have been the subject of criticism. Some argue that S. \n240 is flawed because of a provision that it does not include, and that \nis the provision that has to do with an extension of the statute of \nlimitations.\n  Mr. President, it is true that S. 240 is silent on the issue of the \nstatute of limitations. But this is not to disadvantage small investors \nor any other investors. Four years ago, in a case known as the Lampf \ndecision, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the \nimplied rights of action for private parties under section 10(b) were \nsubject to the same statute of limitations that applied more generally \nin other areas of the securities law--1 year from the date of discovery \nof the fraud, or 3 years from the date of the fraud.\n  It is worth noting that the court did not disadvantage section 10(b) \ncases relative to other security cases; it simply said that the same \nstatute of limitations applies, which is hardly a revolutionary idea. \nIn the 4 years since the Lampf decision was rendered, there has been no \nsubstantial evidence presented that investors are being harmed by that \ndecision.\n  Statutes of limitation, by their very nature, have some degree of \narbitrariness to them. In this area, the evidence is that the \noverwhelming number of cases are being brought within a year of the \ntime the alleged fraud occurs, which tends to indicate that a longer \nstatute may not be needed. Most cases are not filed just before the \nstatute of limitations expires, so the 1-year/3-year statute of \nlimitations does not seem to be making it difficult for plaintiffs to \nprepare their complaints.\n  My own conclusion is that, in light of the evidence, a case has not \nbeen made for giving section 10(b) implied private rights of action in \nfraud cases a longer statute of limitations than other Federal \nsecurities law related cases.\n  Mr. President, one of the provisions of this bill that has been the \nsubject of some attention has to do with the issue of whether or not it \nincludes something that has been called the English rule or losers pay. \nThat has been a rule that never frankly has been applied in American \njurisprudence. It is the English rule that says if you file the lawsuit \nand you lose, then you have to pay the cost of litigation. However, \nthis bill does not have loser pay in it. The bill simply requires the \njudge to look at rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a \nrule that already exists and pertains to all kinds of civil litigation \nand which calls for sanctions for frivolous lawsuits to determine in \nthese securities cases whether or not any party has violated rule 11 \nand, if so, to impose sanctions.\n  That is a far cry, Mr. President, from the English rule, from what \nhas been called ``loser pays.''\n  The bill also establishes what is called a ``safe harbor.'' This \nprovision in some ways offers more protection for investors and less, \nfrankly, for issuers of security than do some of the leading court \ndecisions in this area today.\n  And so what is at issue here with the safe harbor question has to do \nwith what are known as forward-looking statements, statements by \nissuers of securities that describe future events or that estimate the \nlikelihood of selected future events occurring.\n  SEC rule 175 states that forward-looking statements made with a \nreasonable basis and in good faith cannot be used as a basis for a \nfraud action. That is already law.\n  However, Mr. President, as a practical matter, the safe harbor that \nit provides turned out to be not very safe at all. What added real \nprotection was a third circuit case that recognized what is called the \nbespeaks caution doctrine, a doctrine that is now recognized in at \nleast five circuits. Under this doctrine, under the bespeaks caution \ndoctrine, forward-looking statements accompanied by meaningful \ncautionary statements, that is, statements that indicate the risks the \nforward-looking statements will not come true, are as a matter of law \nimmaterial and therefore cannot be used as a basis for fraud action.\n  Under this bill, however, the bespeaks caution doctrine would not \napply to issuers who made statements with the actual intent of \nmisleading investors even if they were accompanied by meaningful \ncautionary statements. [[Page S 8920]] \n  To that extent, Mr. President, this legislation is more protective of \ninvestor's interests in that regard than the evolving state of the law \nin at least five circuits in this country.\n  Again, these are all highly technical areas, and there is a lot more \nthat I can say about the issues and other issues raised by this \nlegislation. However, I instead want to make one final point.\n  A simplistic analysis of this bill says this is a fight between the \nlawyers and the corporations and that the proponents of the bill, the \npeople who support the bill, are somehow engaged in lawyer bashing. I \ncannot speak for every supporter of this bill, but I wanted to make it \nas clear as I can that as a lawyer myself, I care very much about the \nprofession, and my view is that lawyer bashing has no place in this \ndebate. The great bulk of the work of lawyers in the securities \nlitigation area has been of enormous benefit to investors and to the \npublic generally. The securities plaintiffs bar, frankly, has been \nparticularly helpful in helping small investors, and it has played an \ninstrumental role in keeping our capital markets respected worldwide. \nThey have provided a necessary check in a system that, again, presumes \nhonesty.\n  I would not have agreed to cosponsor this bill if I concluded that it \nwould limit their important and legitimate role of the trial bar, of \nthe securities bar, or if I believed this bill would take away from \ninvestors opportunities to recover damages from those who, in fact, had \ndefrauded them.\n  What makes this bill necessary, however, are the abuses by a \nrelatively small number of people who have thrown the system out of \nbalance. S. 240 does nothing more than restore that balance, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I want to conclude by congratulating again Senator Dodd and Senator \nDomenici and the leadership of the Banking Committee for all the hard \nwork that has been put into this legislation and for the way everyone \nhas worked together in a bipartisan fashion and in good faith to \nresolve some of the complicated issues in this area as they have \narisen.\n  This bill may be a bill that leaves none of us fully satisfied, \neverybody is going to have another idea. But the compromises \nrepresented in S. 240 are good ones. They will be good for our capital \nmarkets. This bill will be good for economy. This bill will be good for \njob creation, and it will be good for the American people, generally, \nin all their roles.\n  On that basis, I support this legislation and I urge its passage by \nthe Senate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the \npending legislation and to offer a motion on behalf of Senator Biden, \nSenator Shelby, Senator Feingold, and myself to refer the bill to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary in order to consider some very important \nissues which have not had a hearing in the Banking Committee, because \nthe Banking Committee under its own procedures does not customarily \ntake up questions on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding \nwhich the pending legislation makes a great number of very significant \nchanges.\n  The rules which govern court procedure are customarily fashioned by \njudges, and they are established by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates with an advisory committee which considers the details of these \nprovisions. They are complicated on matters such as how pleadings are \nformulated, how specific you have to be, and what to say to get in \ncourt before you are entitled to discovery; what rules govern when you \ntake depositions, for example; that is, when questions are asked by one \nside of the parties on the other side. What happens with respect to \nsanctions when lawyers do not operate in good faith or bring frivolous \nlawsuits, or what happens on class representation.\n  These are the kinds of questions which I have had some experience \nwith, although not recently. But I had experience when I practiced \ncivil law before coming to the U.S. Senate. And on the Judiciary \nCommittee, having been a member there for 14\\1/2\\ years, I have had \nsome continuing familiarity with these issues, but nothing compared to \nthe individuals who are in the courts every day.\n  On that subject, I discussed some of the issues raised by this bill \nwith a longstanding friend of mine going back to college days at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Judge Edward R. Becker, who is now a very \ndistinguished jurist on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit, and one of the premier Federal judges in the country.\n  Judge Becker was appointed to the Federal Court in 1971. He served \nfor 10 years as a trial judge day in and day out, and for the past 14 \nyears he has been on the court of appeals and is a recognized expert on \nFederal procedure, lectures in the field, and is highly regarded as one \nof the most knowledgeable of the Federal judges.\n  Some of the comments which Judge Becker has made to me in a \nrelatively brief letter illustrate to some extent the problems which \nare present in the current legislation.\n  I compliment the Senator from California, the Senator from Nevada, \nand the Senator from Maryland, the ranking member of the committee, the \nchairman of the committee, and also the Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who \nhave drafted this legislation, for the very constructive work which \nthey have done. But there are many very, very important provisions \nwhich have not been subjected to the kind of analysis which comes only \nwith real experience in the courts on a day-in and day-out basis.\n  Having had that experience, I know the difference between the \nlegislative process and the judicial interpretive process. Those judges \nsee these matters day in and day out. They know what happens in a very \npractical sense. They have a much deeper familiarity with the way they \nwork out than we do in the Congress.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, and as my colleagues know, frequently \nin our hearings in the Senate, only one or two Senators are present. \nWhen markup occurs it is done as carefully as we can, but not with the \nkind of craftsmanship which judges employ day in and day out.\n  These are some of the comments which Judge Becker has made which I \nthink are worthy of consideration. They are not dispositive of all of \nthe issues but are illustrative of the kinds of complex matters which \nwe think require a great deal more consideration than we have had so \nfar.\n  This legislation is enormously important. It is enormously important \nas it governs the securities field where capital is formed so that the \nfree enterprise system can function, so that when representations are \nmade in the prospectuses that sufficient information is given to \ninvestors to know what is happening, to see to it that the \nrepresentations are honest, and that the millions and millions of \npeople who invest in securities are protected--and not that there is \nany absolute guarantee that they will earn dividends or make money on \ncapital gains because there is a certain amount of risk, but that there \nare representations honestly made, that they are protected against \nfraud, and that the procedures balance the concerns of the companies, \nnot subjecting them to frivolous litigation but balance the concerns of \nthe investors.\n  Judge Becker has made this comment, for example, on the rule of \nprocedure which governs the designation of lead counsel:\n\n       Most of the provisions prescribe things the courts already \n     do--for example, designating lead counsel--or at least can do \n     within the exercise of their discretion. Section 102 \n     constitutes congressional micromanagement with the untoward \n     effect of depriving judges of the flexibility which is \n     indispensable for effective case management.\n\n  One of the bill's important provisions relates to sanctions, which \nare important in litigation to ensure that the court has the \nflexibility to manage the case and that lawyers do not abuse the \nprocess, that is, they do not bring frivolous lawsuits, and frivolous \nlawsuits are brought. We know that as a matter of fact. Really no one \ncontests that. Or no one contests the need for limiting frivolous \nlawsuits. And there is a generally recognized need that we ought to \nhave reform in this field.\n  Some of the provisions of current law, for example on joint and \nseveral [[Page S 8921]] liability, have imposed very extensive \nliability on accountants who do not know the inner workings of the \nrepresentations but are held under the concept of joint liability. \nThere needs to be a close look at the kind of liability imposed.\n  So that when you talk about frivolous lawsuits and how to deter them, \nwe do need to have very substantial review of that issue. But I have \nfound that the provision of the bill regarding the rule which requires \nmandatory sanctions by the court perhaps goes too far, and we do not \nknow that for sure really until we analyze it in some detail. But this \nis what Judge Becker had to say about that:\n\n       Mandatory sanctions are a mistake and will only generate \n     satellite litigation.\n\n  And by satellite litigation, Judge Becker was referring to the \nsituation where, after the case is over, then a whole new litigation \nprocess starts as to whether sanctions are really required.\n  Under present law, the judge has discretion to award sanctions, and \nthere has to be a motion made by the party that thinks that the other \nparty has acted inappropriately. Before a party can ask for sanctions, \nthe party must give notice to the other party of its view that \nsomething wrong has been done in order to give the allegedly offending \nparty an opportunity to correct it.\n  That is done in litigation to try to have the parties work it out. If \nsomebody does not like what the other party is doing, they say, ``Wait \na minute; you ought to stop that.'' It gives that party a chance to \nreflect on the reasons. If it does not stop, then the party can make a \nmotion for sanctions. But under this legislation, the judge has the \nobligation on his own to review the record and to impose sanctions. \nThat is contrary to the American system of adversarial litigation where \nthe judge does not have the responsibility for making that \ndetermination on his own; one of the parties who feels aggrieved says \nto the court: Something wrong has been done here, and I make a motion \nto have it corrected. This is more like the inquisitorial system which \nthe French have where the judge is the moving party.\n  Judge Becker has this to say after commenting on the satellite \nlitigation.\n\n       The flexibility afforded by the current regime enables \n     judges to use the threat of sanctions to manage cases \n     effectively. Well managed cases almost never result in \n     sanctions. The provision for mandatory review--\n\n  That is, without prompting by the parties--\n\n       will impose a substantial burden on the courts and prove \n     completely useless in the vast majority of cases. Requiring \n     courts to impose sanctions without a motion by a party also \n     places the judge in an inquisitorial rule which is foreign to \n     our legal culture, which is based on the judge as a neutral \n     arbiter model.\n\n  The judge then refers to a rule drafted by a very distinguished \njudge, Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, who is chairman of the Judicial Conference of the Advisory \nCommittee on Civil Rules. And this is what Judge Higginbotham says \nought to be done:\n\n       In any private action arising under this title, when an \n     abusive litigation practice is brought to the District \n     Court's attention by motion or otherwise, the Court should \n     promptly decide, with written findings of fact and \n     conclusions of law, whether to impose sanctions under rule 11 \n     or rule 26(g)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or \n     its inherent power.\n\n  And that is really giving discretion to the court. Perhaps on \nanalysis the provision in the bill on mandatory would be retained. But \nI think it is indispensable, Mr. President, that that kind of careful \nanalysis be made.\n  Other provisions set out in the current bill make very substantial \nchanges to the Federal rules. There is a requirement that the potential \noutcome of the suit be disclosed, and there are special disclosures \nrelating to settlement terms. These provisions have an impact on rule \n23, the class action rule. The bill also contains certain unique \nprovisions governing the appointment of lead counsel in class actions, \nnone of which have been given a hearing.\n  I discussed with the chairman of the committee, the Senator from New \nYork, Senator D'Amato, the procedures used by the committee, and I \nthink I am accurate in stating--and he can comment on this if the truth \nis to the contrary--that this is a provision added very late, and there \nhad not been hearings.\n  There are also changes in the rules relating to discovery under rule \n26, and there are differences in rules relating to the specificity of \nallegations of pleadings, affecting rule 9.\n  Without going into any great detail, these are all matters which \nreally ought to be reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which has the \nexpertise under our Senate rules for handling matters of this sort. It \nis not the kind of a matter which is customarily brought before the \nBanking Committee.\n  This same issue was raised by the Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, in a letter dated May 25, 1995, to \nSenator D'Amato. Chairman Levitt commented as follows:\n\n       I also wish to call your attention to a potential problem \n     with the provision relating to rule 11 of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure. I worry that the standard employed in \n     their draft may have the unintended effect of imposing a \n     loser-pays scheme. The greater the discretion afforded the \n     court, the less likely this unintended consequence may \n     appear.\n\n  The loser-pays scheme, Mr. President, is one which Great Britain has \nwhere the loser has to pay the costs of litigation, and that is a very, \nvery abrupt and drastic change in our litigation procedure.\n  The bill currently provides for mandatory sanctions and contains a \npresumption that the loser will pay sanctions and that the appropriate \nsanction is the other party's attorneys' fees. This would have a very \nmajor, chilling effect on bringing any litigation.\n And that presumption can be overcome but it starts off on an unequal \nfooting where the same requirement is not imposed on the defense, on \nthe other side in the litigation. I am sure that there will be \nconsideration of this substantive revision in the course of the \nanalysis of this bill. But this again is something which really ought \nto have the benefit of a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Mr. President, I had advised the chairman, the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato], that I would not be in the position to vote on this \nmatter until others had a chance to come to the floor, specifically \nSenator Biden. I know that there are other Senators on the floor who \nwish to speak at this time. And it would be my hope that we can move to \na vote this evening. I do not want to keep Senators here unnecessarily \nbut I believe that Senators are present with the expectation of having \na vote on final passage on the highway bill where there is still one \nmatter which is left to be worked out.\n  But I do want to make that stressed statement that until Senator \nBiden returns we have an opportunity to have debate on this subject. \nThere are some matters I want to discuss with the Senator, the \nchairman, the Senator from New York, who is necessarily absent at this \ntime.\n  Before yielding the floor--I shall not hold the floor very much \nlonger--there will not be more than one final statement that I will \nmake, as I see my colleague from Utah, rising. I do want to make a \nbrief comment about the bill generally as to information provided to me \nby the chairman of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission who has \nraised very substantial problems with the bill. I want to call those to \nthe attention of my colleagues. This is a letter to me from Chairman \nRobert Lam, dated April 19, 1995, in which Chairman Lam makes this \nstatement. ``I have considered the major elements of both'' Senate bill \n240, which is the one currently being considered, and Senate bill 667, \nwhich is a different bill introduced by Senators Shelby and Bryan. It \nis the conclusion of Chairman Lam of the Pennsylvania Securities \nCommission that the other bill, the one not on the floor, is much \npreferable. Chairman Lam concludes by saying, Senate bill ``240, on the \nother hand, tilts the balance too far in favor of corporate interests \nand would have the practical effect of depriving many defrauded \ninvestors the ability to cover their losses.''\n  In a letter dated June 20, 1995--I shall include both of these \nletters for the record, so I do not have to take much time. Chairman \nLam writes as follows,\n\n       As presently constituted, S.240 not only would affect \n     negatively Pennsylvania investors but also Pennsylvania \n     taxpayers should the Commonwealth Treasury Department [[Page S \n     8922]] again become a potential victim of wrongdoing in \n     securities transactions undertaken on behalf of the \n     Commonwealth. The importance of the potential negative \n     effects of this Bill on the Commonwealth is reflected by the \n     Treasury Department's recent suit against Salomon Brothers \n     for damages resulting from alleged wrongful conduct engaged \n     in by Salomon in connection with its bidding on government \n     bonds.\n\n  And Chairman Lam of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission concludes \nwith this statement.\n\n       As a participant in the capital formation process, I would \n     like to emphasize that our financial markets run most \n     efficiently when there is a high degree of public confidence \n     in the integrity of the marketplace. Money is merely the \n     medium of exchange between this confidence and the honest \n     entrepreneur. As written, S.240 will not advance the goal of \n     making capital available to growing U.S. companies. It will \n     result in small investors avoiding participation in our \n     capital markets when they discover that they are unable to \n     bring suit against the perpetrators of aiders and abettors of \n     a securities fraud or, upon winning such a suit, fail to be \n     made whole because the Bill adopts the concept of ``caps'' on \n     total defendant liability.\n\n  I do ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the full text of \nthese two letters from Chairman Lam be made a part of the record at the \nconclusion of my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, Mr. President--the favorite words of any \nspeech, and with finality--I will pursue this motion as the evening \nprogresses and do believe that it is very important that the full range \nof considerations raised by Chairman Lam be considered, issues that \nhave otherwise been raised, but especially these procedural questions \nbe considered by the Judiciary Committee which under our rules has the \njurisdiction to consider them.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of Senator Biden, Senator Shelby, Senator \nFeingold, and myself, I do move to commit the pending bill, Senate 240, \nto the Committee of the Judiciary.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1.\n\n\n                          Pennsylvania Securities, Commission,\n\n                                                   April 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       RE: Pending Securities Litigation Reform Bills S. 240 and \n     S. 667\n       Dear Arlen: In my capacity as the Chairman of the \n     Pennsylvania Securities Commission, I am writing to express \n     my views on the two major securities litigation reform bills \n     now before the Senate. The Pennsylvania Securities Commission \n     is responsible for investor protection and overseeing the \n     capital formation process in the Commonwealth.\n       It is my view that any securities litigation reform \n     legislation must be carefully balanced so that it provides \n     relief to companies and professionals who may be the subject \n     of frivolous lawsuits while preserving a meaningful private \n     remedy for defrauded investors. While much of the debate in \n     Washington has focused on how to protect honest companies and \n     professionals from vexatious lawsuits, I believe there is an \n     equally compelling need to maintain the ability to deter and \n     detect wrongdoing in the financial marketplace.\n       From my vantage point, there continues to be an \n     unacceptably high level of fraud and abuse in today's capital \n     markets, particularly with respect to small investors. As the \n     limited resources of government are insufficient to pursue \n     every case of wrongdoing, the ability of defrauding investors \n     to maintain a private cause of action to recover their \n     investment without fear of financial ruin remains critically \n     important to the overall successful enforcement of the \n     securities laws.\n       It is against this backdrop that I have considered the \n     major elements of both S. 240, the ``Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act,'' introduced by Senators Domenici and \n     Dodd, and S. 667, the ``Private Securities Enforcement \n     Improvements Act,'' introduced by Senators Shelby and Bryan. \n     It is my conclusion that S. 667 is very much the preferable \n     legislative vehicle for resolving the securities litigation \n     reform debate. S. 667 achieves the critical balance between \n     making the litigation system more fair and more efficient, \n     while preserving the critical role that private actions play \n     in maintaining the integrity of our financial markets. S. \n     240, on the other hand, tilts the balance too far in favor of \n     corporate interests and would have the practical effect of \n     depriving many defrauded investors the ability to recover \n     their losses.\n       Among the provisions of S. 667 that I support are: (1) an \n     innovative early evaluation procedure designed to weed out \n     clearly frivolous cases; (2) a more rational system of \n     determining liability among defendants; (3) certification of \n     complaints and improved case management procedures; (4) curbs \n     on potentially abusive attorney practices; (5) improved \n     disclosure of settlement terms; (6) a reasonable safe harbor \n     for forward looking statements; (7) restoration of aiding and \n     abetting liability; (8) a reasonable extension of the statute \n     of limitations for securities fraud suits; (9) codification \n     of the recklessness standard of liability as adopted by \n     virtually every U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and (10) \n     rulemaking authority to the SEC with respect to fraud-on-the-\n     market cases. A detailed comparative analysis between S. 667 \n     and S. 240 is enclosed.\n       S. 667 proves that it is possible to craft securities \n     litigation reform measures that target abusive practices \n     without sacrificing the opportunity for recovery by \n     defrauding investors. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to \n     become a co-sponsor of S. 667.\n       Securities litigation reform is one of the most important \n     issues for small investors that will be considered by the \n     104th Congress. It is my hope that the Senate will give \n     serious consideration to S. 667 as the appropriate response \n     for constructive improvement in the federal securities \n     litigation process. If you have any questions about my \n     position on securities litigation reform, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me at (215) 635-6262 or Deputy Chief \n     Counsel G. Philip Rutledge at (717) 783-5130. I would be \n     pleased to provide you or your staff with any additional \n     information you may require on this most important issue to \n     individual Pennsylvania investors.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Robert M. Lam,\n     Chairman\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Pennsylvania      \n                                            Securities Commission,\n\n\n                                 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n\n                                                    June 20, 1995.\n     Re: amendments to Senate bill 240, ``Private Securities \n         Litigation Reform Act''\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, 530 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Arlen: It is my understanding that Senate Bill 240 is \n     now before the full U.S. Senate for consideration.\n       The Pennsylvania Securities Commission is charged under the \n     Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972 with the protection of \n     investors. While the Commission has stated its position in \n     previous correspondence (April 17, 1995) that it favors \n     certain securities litigation reforms (as contained in \n     S.667), it believes that S.240, as currently constituted, \n     does not achieve the appropriate balance between protecting \n     investors and discouraging frivolous lawsuits against honest \n     companies and professionals. Instead, the practical effect of \n     S.240 would be the elimination of private actions under \n     federal law for Pennsylvanians who found themselves to be a \n     victim of securities fraud.\n       It is my understanding that amendments to S.240 will be \n     offered on the Senate floor to strengthen its investor \n     protection provisions, i.e. extending the statute of \n     limitations for civil securities fraud actions (Pennsylvania \n     recently extended its statute of limitations period for \n     securities fraud to four years); fully restoring liability \n     for aiding and abetting securities fraud; restoring joint and \n     several liability so defrauded investors can be made whole; \n     and peeling back the immunity for companies to make \n     outrageous claims of future profits or performance.\n       The Commission asks you to support adoption of these \n     amendments. If, however, all these vital investor protection \n     amendments are not adopted, the Commission, on behalf of \n     Pennsylvania investors, strongly urges you to vote against \n     S.240.\n       As presently constituted, S. 240 not only would affect \n     negatively Pennsylvania investors but also Pennsylvania \n     taxpayers should the Commonwealth Treasury Department again \n     become a potential victim of wrongdoing in securities \n     transactions undertaken on behalf of the Commonwealth. The \n     importance of the potential negative effects of this Bill on \n     the Commonwealth is reflected by the Treasury Department's \n     recent suit against Salomon Brothers for damages resulting \n     from alleged wrongful conduct engaged in by Salomon in \n     connection with its bidding on government bonds.\n       As a participant in the capital formation process, I would \n     like to emphasize that our financial markets run most \n     efficiently when there is a high degree of public confidence \n     in the integrity of the marketplace. Money is merely the \n     medium of exchange between this confidence and the honest \n     entrepreneur. As written, S. 240 will not advance the goal of \n     making capital available to growing U.S. companies.

Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has been \npatient and is scheduled to be the next speaker.\n  Before we hear from her, I have been asked to perform a few \nhousekeeping details. Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has asked me to announce on his behalf that he cannot come \nhere at the moment. I am sure the Senator from Illinois is delighted \nthat that means she will not be delayed further. But he did ask that \nthe statement be made on his behalf that as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee he opposes the referral contained within this motion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 8:30 this evening Senator D'Amato be \nrecognized to make a motion to table the motion to commit the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, there are issues, and I \nneed to discuss them with the chairman which I talked to him about \nearlier. And also my principal cosponsor, Senator Biden, is not \navailable yet to make an argument.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request \nthat at 8:30 this evening Senator D'Amato be recognized to make a \nmotion to table the motion to commit the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? What is the \nparliamentary situation here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a motion to commit the bill to the \nJudiciary Committee pending.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is there further debate in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the motion or on the bill? Either?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. You can debate either.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. At the conclusion of Senator Biden's remarks, I ask \nunanimous consent that he yield the floor back to me for the purpose of \nmaking a tabling motion. I would like to simply state that Senator \nHatch has indicated that he is not in favor of the motion for \nsequential referral, and that this is not a new matter. This matter has \nlegislatively been on an agenda now for some four years. That is the \nonly comment I will make.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. What I \nam about to say, I say standing next to my good friend from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, who has worked tirelessly on this bill, with \nwhich I disagree, but I want to make a very brief statement.\n  I strongly support the position taken by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. This litigation makes numerous precedent-setting changes \nin the country's judicial system. While my colleagues in the Banking \nCommittee had a chance to examine the changes the bill would make to \nour Nation's security laws, it seems to me that we may have skipped a \nvery important step. The so-called Securities Reform Act makes \nsignificant revisions to the Federal rules of evidence relating to \nmandatory rule 11 sanctions and rule 26 discovery proceedings, and yet, \nit has not been referred to the Judiciary Committee.\n  I hold myself partially responsible for that. In truth, I say to my \nfriend from Connecticut, I should have been hollering for this in my \ncommittee before this time. I was mildly preoccupied with other things \nbefore the committee. To tell you the truth, it was called to my \nattention by my friend from Pennsylvania, and I realize this is a \nserious mistake, in my view, and that we have not had this before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In the past, bills that have made changes to the Federal rules of \nevidence were referred to the Judiciary Committee to enable the \ncommittee with expertise to review the work on this legislation. This \nbills is no different. Similarly, limiting joint and several liability, \nrestricting the statute of limitations, changing the rules of class \naction suits in favor of large investors, are all judiciary-related \nissues. Yet, the Judiciary Committee never had a day of hearing on any \nof these specific issues.\n  If the bill becomes law, companies could potentially get away with \nmaking misleading, even fraudulent, statements about their earnings. \nYet, to win a class action suit, you would have to prove a falsehood \nwas made with a clear intent to deceive. That is an incredibly tough \nstandard. I will admit some frivolous lawsuits are filed. Some lawyers \ndo make too much from a suit, leaving defrauded investors with little. \nBut I do not believe this massive bill is the answer.\n  So in order to protect the small investors, it seems to me that we \nshould at least look at the significant changes in the rules of \nevidence. If this bill passes, I make the prediction to us all here, we \nwill be back in two, three, four years undoing it, after another Orange \nCounty or another insider trading scandal, or after millions of people \nare defrauded with some other scam that occurs.\n  Quite frankly, I think we would be wise to take a close look, with a \nspecific time for referral, if need be, to the Judiciary Committee, to \nlook at these changes in the rule of ethics.\n  I do not profess to have expertise in the securities industry, but we \ndo know something about the rules of evidence and the shifting burden \nof truth.\n  I thank my colleague for his indulgence, and I thank the Senator from \nIllinois. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for not getting up and \nsaying, ``Why, Joe, did you not do this earlier?\"\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I intend to make a motion to table.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to say, Mr. President, this has been about 4 years on \nthis matter.\n  This hour, we are now under consideration of the bill--I say this \nwith all due respect to my good friends on the Judiciary Committee; it \nhas been no secret that this legislation has been pending--at this \nparticular hour to secure sequential referral, in effect, would kill \nthe legislation.\n  I think all of our colleagues ought to be aware of that at this \njuncture. This is our opportunity in a moment to move on this. We have \nhad extensive hearings, heard from lawyers and others on all sides, and \nworked closely with them.\n  With all due respect to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould hope this motion to table would be approved.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to table the motion. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to commit.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1467\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the request of the majority leader, S. 440 \nis now the pending business.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. STEVENS], for himself, Mr. \n     Murkowski, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Bennett, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1467.\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no agency of the Federal government may take any action \n     to prepare, promulgate, or implement any rule or regulation \n     addressing rights of way authorized pursuant to Revised \n     Statutes 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932), as such law was in effect \n     prior to October 21, 1976.\n       (b) This section shall cease to have any force or effect \n     after December 1, 1995.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in response to the request, we have \nagreed to this amendment which is a moratorium on proceeding with the \nregulations as proposed by the Department of the Interior that have not \nbeen issued in final form yet, but we know they are under \nconsideration.\n  Let me state that this amendment does not affect any judicial action \nor decision instituted since 1976, any pending judicial action or any \nfuture judicial action. It is not intended to affect any case law with \nrespect to rights of way granted pursuant to Revised Statutes 2477. \nThis deals simply with the proposal to issue regulations to, in effect, \ndetermine through sovereign power that the rights of the States would \nbe invaded as those States rights were known under Revised Statutes \n2477, which was repealed in 1976.\n  I have offered this on behalf of my colleague Senator Murkowski and \nthe two Senators from Utah, Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett. I do \nbelieve it will achieve the goal of just having a moratorium on the \npreparation of regulations so that the committees involved and the \nStates involved may try to work this out without very expensive \nlitigation that would ensue, and in the case of our State it would be \njust a disastrous prospect of litigating some 600 or more separate \nrights-of-way.\n  I am grateful to the Senate for having delayed the action until this \ntime to enable us to have a proposal go to the House, which I hope the \nHouse will agree with, to establish this moratorium. It will simply \ndelay the process as far as the administrative regulations that were \nproposed by the Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am glad we could come to an agreement on an \namendment to restrict the Department of the Interior or any other \nFederal agency from taking any action on finalizing a rule or \nregulation with respect to Revised Statute 2477 until December 1, 1995. \nThis will allow some of my colleagues, including my colleague from \nArkansas, to take a careful look at this issue. I want to make it clear \nthat we will be offering legislation in the future to resolve this \nproblem for Alaska.\n  R.S. 2477 simply states: The right-of-way for the construction of \nhighways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby \ngranted. The 1866 law was repealed by FLPMA in 1976. But between 1866 \nand 1976, R.S. 2477 allowed the creation of property rights across \nFederal lands for rights-of-way. These rights-of-way have provided \nessential access through the Western States--and especially in Alaska. \nRecognizing this, Congress intentionally protected the R.S. 2477 \nrights-of-way in FLPMA. However, the Department of the Interior \nproposed regulations in August of 1994 to make it much more difficult \nto establish right-of-way claims across Federal lands established under \nthe Revised Statutes 2477.\n  DOI claims the reason they are doing the regulations is to make a \nlogical process to get R.S. 2477 rights-of-way recognized. BUT the \nregulations would actually:\n  Override State law with restrictive new definitions of highway and \nconstruction;\n  Put a cloud on the title to R.S. 2477 roads, treating them as invalid \nuntil proven valid;\n  Prevent any future expansion of scope of an R.S. 2477 right-of-way, \npreventing making the right-of-way any wider, so a dogsled trail will \nremain a dog sled trail;\n  Set a sunset on administrative and court action on validity of R.S. \n2477 by extinguishing claims not filed within 2 years and 30 days after \nfinal rule is issued;\n  Although a claimant could still turn to the courts, DOI states that \nthe regulations serve as notice to claimants for purpose of the Quiet \nTitle Act, which provides a 12-year statute of limitations--but true to \nform, DOI did not put a time limit on themselves to process the claims;\n  Construction and maintenance will not be permitted without approval \nof DOI with 3 days notice, preventing the fixing of washed out roads \nuntil DOI approval.\n  The draft R.S. 2477 regulations from the Department of the Interior \nare nothing more than an attempt to prevent legal access across our \npublic [[Page S 8925]] lands. It would impose an impossible task on \nState and local governments to make all claims for rights-of-way on \nFederal lands and then have to validate each one of the\n claims. Nowhere would this be more burdensome than in my State which \nis one-fifth the size of the United States and more than twice the size \nof Texas--yet has less roads than Vermont.\n\n  There regulations are clearly an effort to make sure Alaska and other \nWestern States cannot have access across Federal lands. This amendment \nto stop the Department of the Interior from taking any action to \nimplement the final rules and will provide us time to look at the best \napproach to finally resolving the R.S. 2477 issue.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Arkansas for his cooperation on the \nSteven's R.S. 2477 amendment. As chairman of the Energy and National \nResources Committee I intend to have hearings on this matter soon and \nwill be working on a legislative or administrative solution. The \nSenator from Arkansas has expressed interest in working with me on this \nissue, and I appreciate that offer. However, if we work in good faith, \nbut fail to find a solution by the December date in the Steven's \namendment, the Senator from Arkansas has assured me that there will be \na further extension.\n  I want to join with the senior Senator from Alaska and also thank our \ncolleagues: Senator Warner, Senator Bumpers, Senator Chafee, and \nSenator Baucus, and as a consequence of their willingness to \nacknowledge the concerns expressed by the Western States, I would like \nfor the Record to submit a list of States that currently have an \ninterest in R.S. 2477. There are 16 States, and I might add for the \nRecord that the Eastern States are included but they are taken \ncollectively and not listed by name. So clearly this is a western \nissue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nUSDI Draft Report to Congress--R.S. 2477, the History and Management of \n R.S. 2477 Rights-of-Way Claims on Federal and Other Lands, March 1993\n\n       Existing public land records indicate that approximately \n     1,453 R.S. 2477 rights-of-way have been recognized to date \n     across BLM lands. At least two R.S. 2477 highways have been \n     recognized in National Park Units--the Burr Trail located in \n     both Capitol Reef National Park and Glen Canyon National \n     Recreation Area in Utah and the Glade Park Road in the \n     Colorado National Monument.\n       Information regarding other Federal land management \n     agencies was not available for this draft report. Few \n     recognized claims are thought to exist across other agency \n     lands.\n\n\n                             pending claims\n\n       Currently, there are approximately 3,947 pending claims on \n     file with the BLM nationwide. Utah has the greatest number \n     pending, with claims to 3,815 roads. Most other BLM States \n     have very few claims pending. Some new assertions, that are \n     not reflected on the table below, have been filed with \n     various Federal agencies since the initiation of this study. \n     However, the table below does reflect the general situation \n     regarding filed claims.

CROSSING ELIMINATION; STATEWIDE CROSSING FREEZE.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--\n       (1) Railroad-highway grade crossings present inherent \n     hazards to the safety of railroad operations and to the \n     safety of persons using those crossings. It is in the public \n     interest--\n       (A) to eliminate redundant and high risk railroad-highway \n     grade crossings; and\n       (B) to limit the creation of new crossings to the minimum \n     necessary to provide for the reasonable mobility of the \n     American people and their property, including emergency \n     access.\n       (2) Elimination of redundant and high-risk railroad-highway \n     grade crossings is necessary to permit optimum use of \n     available funds to improve the safety of remaining crossings, \n     including funds provided under Federal law.\n       (3) Effective programs to reduce the number of unneeded \n     railroad-highway grade crossings, and to close those \n     crossings that cannot be made reasonably safe (due to reasons \n     of topography, angles of intersection, etc.), require the \n     partnership of Federal, State, and local officials and \n     agencies, and affected railroads.\n       (4) Promotion of a balanced national transportation system \n     requires that highway planning specifically take into \n     consideration the interface between highways and the national \n     railroad system.\n       (b) Partnership and Oversight.--The Secretary shall foster \n     a partnership among Federal, State, and local transportation \n     officials and agencies to reduce the number of railroad-\n     highway grade crossings and to improve safety at remaining \n     crossings. The Secretary shall make provisions for periodic \n     review to ensure that each State (including State \n     subdivisions and local governments) is making substantial, \n     continued progress toward achievement of the purposes of this \n     section.\n       (c) Crossing Freeze.--If, upon review, and after \n     opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary determines that a \n     State or political subdivision thereof has failed to make \n     substantial, continued progress toward achievement of the \n     purposes of this section, then the Secretary shall impose a \n     limit on the maximum number of public railroad-highway grade \n     crossings in that State. The limitation imposed by the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall remain in effect until \n     the State demonstrates compliance with the requirements of \n     this section. In addition, the Secretary may, for a period of \n     not more than 3 years after such a determination, require \n     compliance with specific numeric targets for net reductions \n     in the number of railroad-highway grade crossings (including \n     specification of hazard categories with which such crossings \n     are associated).\n       (d) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such \n     regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8924-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8935-S8943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Grams, who has been waiting for several hours now, \nbe permitted to put in his opening statement, Senator Boxer her opening \nstatement, and that then we go to Senator Shelby for the purposes of \nsubmitting his amendment on proportional liability that we have already \nagreed to vote on at 10:55. So I propound that as a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 240, the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  As we all know, the United States is facing a litigation crisis. \nPiles of new and often frivolous lawsuits are being filed every day in \nour Nation's courtrooms, bottling up our judicial system and crowding \nout those suits which have merit and demand justice.\n  Already, the Senate has addressed the problems in our product \nliability laws and debated the issue of medical malpractice reform.\n  But few areas of our tort system deserve and require as comprehensive \na review as the field of securities litigation.\n  Let me briefly describe the problem. For years, a small number of \nattorneys have made it their life's work to bring class-action lawsuits \nagainst companies whose stock values--for one reason or another--have \nfallen.\n  These so-called strike suits are rarely filed with any evidence of \nfraud or wrongdoing--in fact, they are often filed simply with the \nknowledge that the value of a stock has dropped.\n  This is possible because of the implied right of action developed by \nthe courts under rule 10(b)-5 of the Securities Act of 1934. Because \nCongress has failed to limit this right of action through statute, it \nis relatively simple for attorneys to file frivolous cases and harass \ndefendants under these judge-made rules.\n  Even worse, these attorneys rarely serve any real injured class of \ninvestors. Instead, they use professional plaintiffs who buy nominal \namounts of stock, simply to serve as the pawns of an expensive chess \nmatch.\n  Due to the costly array of litigation expenses, such as extensive \ndiscovery, defendants will often choose to settle cases, rather than \nbring them to a final judgment in court.\n  In addition, under joint and several liability, plaintiffs' attorneys \ncan bring secondary defendants, such as accountants, directors, and \nothers, into these cases and force them to settle as well.\n  These settlements are often too small to benefit the alleged class of \ninjured investors. But they are not too small to make a healthy living \nfor an attorney who is motivated solely by profit, not justice.\n  To call this the practice of law would be inaccurate. It is more \nappropriately called legal blackmail or extortion, and it is happening \nevery day, at the expense of job providers, workers, and consumers.\n  S. 240 addresses this problem by placing some important limitations \non the implied right of action in rule 10(b)-5.\n  By helping put the brakes on the attorneys' race to the courthouse, \nthis legislation would make it easier for defendants to protect \nthemselves from frivolous ``strike'' suits, encourage voluntary \ndisclosure of information from issuers of stock to potential investors, \nand reduce the cost of raising capital which is so necessary for jobs \ncreation.\n  It includes a number of important provisions, including tougher \npleading requirements for securities fraud actions, mandatory sanctions \nfor attorneys who file needless litigation, and restrictions on \nwindfall recoveries for plaintiffs who profit from a rebound in the \nmarket after an alleged fraud.\n  I am also pleased that S. 240 reforms the rules governing secondary \ndefendants. This measure establishes a two-tiered system which allows \nmost parties to be held proportionately liable only for the percentage \nof damages attributable to their actions; in other words, it puts an \nend to the practice of ``deep pockets'' litigation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not a perfect bill. There are many \nof us who believe it should do more. [[Page S 8936]] \n  We could, for example, have a stronger safe harbor protection for \nforward-looking statements or a ``loser pays'' provisions similar to \nthe bill passed by the House. Today, however, we cannot let the perfect \nbe the envy of the good.\n  Likewise, there will be attempts made to weaken this bill--efforts \nwhich I urge my colleagues to reject. In particular, I hope this body \nwill resist any attempt to extend the statute of limitations already \nfound in law. If our purpose is to reduce frivolous litigation and \nprotect consumers from higher prices, any such effort must be rejected.\n  There are some critics of the bill who suggest that this legislation \nis bad for the average American.\n  Well, Mr. President, tell that to the innocent defendant who's forced \nto settle for millions of dollars simply because of one crafty lawyer, \ntell it to the worker who was laid off because his employer had to pay \nattorneys' fees instead of his salary, tell it to the consumer who has \nto pay higher prices for everyday products simply because of the cost \nof frivolous litigation.\n  And most importantly, tell it to the hard-working, honest attorneys \nwho watch the public image of their profession being stomped into the \nground by a few quick change artists. They are the ones who suffer \nbecause of the abuses in our current system. They are the ones who need \nour help.\n  By voting for this legislation, we will take an important step \nforward in helping reduce the cost of frivolous litigation, litigation \nwhich robs job providers the opportunity to buy new equipment for plant \nsafety, provide higher pay and better benefits for employees, and to \ncreate new jobs.\n  And that hurts average, hard-working, middle-class Americans--my kids \nand yours.\n  For their sake--in the name of justice--we must pass this important \nmeasure to fix our badly broken tort system. I, tonight, urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort and to vote for S. 240.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I know it has been a \nvery long and hard day for many of us. Some of us felt very strongly \nabout Dr. Foster, and we had a tough day on that one. Some of us had \nour bases closed, and it has been awfully difficult sometimes to face \ndisappointments like this.\n  But here we are, it is 9:20 and we have a bill before us that is very \nimportant. I want to speak to this bill and as I told the chairman, my \nfriend, I will do it as quickly as I can, but I wanted to cover some of \nthe important issues that we face.\n  I speak to this bill not only as a Senator from California but as a \nformer stockbroker, a former stockbroker will understand the sacred \nresponsibility of recommending investments to people who need those \ninvestments to be sound. I can tell you, in those days, if I invested \nin a stock for an elderly person, I literally worried a lot about them, \nand if things turned around, I was very quick to get on the phone and \ntalk with them about it. I took this responsibility very seriously, and \nmost stockbrokers do.\n  But there are those broker-dealers, investment advisers, and others \nwho do not take their responsibilities as seriously as they should. So \nI think it is very important, in light of Orange County--and those were \nmy constituents who were left holding the bag because there were some \nbroker-dealers who were more than dishonest, unscrupulous, and they had \ndone it before and they continued to do it. I want to make sure that \ninvestors are protected.\n  When the debate opened on S. 240, we heard a great deal of discussion \nby its proponents about companies who were being sued unfairly. No one, \nMr. President, should be sued unfairly. The vast majority of businesses \nare decent, are good, and they do not deserve frivolous lawsuits. Those \nfrivolous lawsuits should be stopped. I am ready to stop them. They do \nhappen. But as my friend from Nevada, Senator Bryan, said, let us not \nuse the issue of frivolous lawsuits to take this legislation so far \nthat it hurts legitimate plaintiffs, legitimate lawyers. We do not want \nto stop decent people in their tracks, innocent investors. We do not \nwant them to be stuck or ruined. We do not want them, in some cases, \nfrankly, to be financially destroyed because we are writing a law that \nperhaps goes too far.\n  Our colleague from Nevada showed us very clearly that there is no \nexplosion of these investor lawsuits. Indeed, it is extraordinary. They \nhave remained very level--the same number now as we saw 20 years ago. \nThat does not mean they are all perfect lawsuits. Some of them are \nfrivolous. But the fact is we have no explosion here, and that has been \nclearly stated by my friend from Nevada.\n  We need to approach this bill from our own experience. I want to say \nthat this is a very complicated issue. I want to say to those who may \nbe watching this debate, it may be complicated, but it could easily \naffect you. It is just like the S crisis, when the Congress acted to \nderegulate and walked away. It was a complicated bill. People did not \nfollow it, and then they got burned. So we have to be very careful.\n  I have met the victims of Charles Keating. I talked about that with \nmy friend from Nevada. I met the victims from the Orange County \nbankruptcy, and I say to them that I do not intend to forget them as we \ngo through this bill. I want to try to make this bill better. I will \nsupport it and perhaps offer amendments to do that. I want to make sure \ninvestors are not shut out of the courtroom. That is not the American \nway. That is what motivates me.\n  I want to tell a little bit about this bill by way of some charts \nthat I have. I want to show you what newspapers have been saying about \nthis bill, S. 240. There are many people who take it to the floor and \nthey have extolled this bill in its current form. They like it. Many of \nthem have worked very hard on it and they are very close to it. I want \nyou to see what some of the newspapers are saying about S. 240.\n  The Palm Beach Post of June 5, 1995:\n\n       Congress has set out to help stop market con artists. \n     Congress is creating legislation that would virtually strip \n     the rights of defrauded investors--the bill installs heat \n     shields around white collar crooks and brokers or accountants \n     who aid and abet their scams. Investors who know the \n     legislation do not like it.\n\n  This is Jane Bryant Quinn from Newsweek. She is an advocate for \ninvestors, and she says:\n\n       S. 240 makes it easier for corporations and stockbrokers to \n     mislead investors. Class action suits against deceivers would \n     be costly for small investors to file and incredibly \n     difficult to win.\n\n  How about the Seattle Times, May 29, 1995, a month ago. They say \nthis, and so many colleagues have embraced this, and some say it does \nnot go far enough:\n\n       This legislation has proceeded almost unnoticed because it \n     is hideously complicated, and there may be a feeling it does \n     not touch many lives. Wrong. Taxpayers have a vital stake in \n     these changes. Longstanding protections are in jeopardy.\n\n  The Raleigh, NC, News and Observer:\n\n       S. 240 is bad news for investors, private and public. It \n     would tie victims in legal knots while immunizing white-\n     collar crooks against having to pay for their misdeeds.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer, in June 1995:\n\n       A crook is a crook, and S. 240 would relax penalties for \n     many stock crooks.\n\n  The St. Louis Post Dispatch, May 1995:\n\n       Don't protect securities fraud.\n\n  The Contra Costa Times in my home State:\n\n       Why would any Member of Congress vote to protect those \n     involved in fraud at the expense of investors?\n\n  That is a reasonable question.\n  The Seattle Post Intelligencer:\n\n       The legislation is opposed by the U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors, the Government Finance Officers Association, the \n     American Association of Retired Persons, and the North \n     American Securities Administrators Association.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not only is that a diverse group from which you just \ncited, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation, the American Association of Retired Persons, and the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association. Now, none of those \ngroups has a vested interest, so to speak, in this conflict.\n  I understand that you have the trial lawyers who have a vested \ninterest and the corporations who have a vested interest, and they are \nat one another, [[Page S 8937]] and they are at sort of loggerheads \nover this thing. One makes one set of assertions and the other makes \nanother set of assertions.\n  Everyone whom you cited there--as did the Senator from Nevada earlier \nin the debate, who listed additional organizations as well--all of whom \nare sort of outside the fray, they are coming and taking an outside, \nobjective look at this thing. They have reached the judgment that this \nlegislation is deficient. We are not getting outside groups reaching \nthe judgment that the legislation, as is, is OK. The outside groups \nthat say it is OK are players in the legislation. There are groups that \nsay it is bad who are also players. But these are all organizations, in \neffect, that represent the public interest, the consumer. We have a \nwhole list of consumer organizations as well. I think it is very \nimportant. I think Members really have to stop and think about this, \nbecause we are getting the same thing out of the editorial boards of \nthe newspapers around the country. Overwhelmingly, those editorial \nboards are critical of this legislation.\n  They see it goes too far. Most write editorials and say there are \nsome bad practices that need to be corrected, but this legislation goes \nwell beyond that and overreaches.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding. I think it is a very important \npoint. None of those organizations have a vested interest in this \nconflict, unlike many other groups that do have such an interest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague, the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, for his statements.\n  I would say what we are doing here is just showing what the one \nnewspaper is quoted as saying. There is a list of many, many pages, and \nI will at some point in this debate go further into it.\n  My friend is so right. So many consumer groups oppose this: Consumer \nFederation of America, Consumers for Civil Justice, Consumers Union, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police oppose this. Why? Because they are \nworried about their retirement. They do not want some scam artist to \nget away with it.\n  As this debate moves forward, we will go more and more into the \ngroups who oppose this legislation.\n  I am going to ask for the next series of charts which show who are \nthe main targets of investor fraud. We talk about the companies, and \nbelieve me, I want to help the good companies. I do not want to help \nthe companies that defraud investors. I think we need to look at who \nthe targets are.\n  This is an article that appeared in the New York Times in May of this \nyear, a month ago. ``If the Hair is Gray, Con Artists See Green, the \nElderly are Prime Targets.''\n  When we talk about changing security laws that protect investors, we \nneed to step back and look at who the targets are, who are the ones \nmost likely to get hurt if we weaken these laws too much.\n  Let me read a little bit:\n\n       Betty Norman was no match for the telephone con men who \n     emptied her pockets of more than $40,000.\n       A plain-talking widow who runs a small motel in Michigan, a \n     town of State prisons and apple orchards, Mrs. Norman, born \n     and raised here, was taught to believe that people are \n     essentially honest. So she trusted salespeople who picked up \n     details about her life in seemingly casual telephone chats \n     while pitching her pens, costume jewelry and other trinkets. \n     After being swindled out of thousands of dollars, she lost \n     even more to people promising to recover her original \n     investments.\n\n  Now, this is what Mrs. Norman says:\n\n       ``It makes you feel like taking your life, to think you \n     you've been skinned,'' said Mrs. Norman, 68, who for months \n     was too mortified to reveal it to her grown children. ``I've \n     been struggling along. People here have lent me money and I'm \n     trying to get it paid back.''\n\n  So, we are seeing that--whether it is selling goods to the elderly or \nselling them investments--clearly, the elderly are the prime targets.\n  Now, I want to show something that I think is extraordinary. It is \nreally something that ought to go to the Smithsonian. It is actually \none Charles Keating gave to his salespeople when they were trying to \ncon innocent senior citizens. I know that every single Senator, from \nboth parties, would be sick if they took a look at this.\n  You are now a trainee for Charles Keating, and they blow up this \npaper. Here is what it says. They want to get someone to write a check \nfor $20,000 to Charles Keating's company, American Continental Corp., \nin care of Lincoln Savings & Loan. You remember Lincoln Savings & Loan, \nright?\n  Here is the training document for the salespeople. To show how cruel \nthese people are, how awful they are, this is the name they put, the \nfictitious name: Edna Gert Snidlip, 1 Geriatric Way, Retiredville, \nCalifornia, account number. And they are trying to get this sample \nelderly person to write a check for $20,000. This is the way they think \nof senior citizens.\n  I will show what they said on another piece of paper that we have \nblown up, another document that shows what they handed out.\n  At the very end, number 13, and these are all the things they have to \nthink about, ``Always remember, the weak, meek, and ignorant, are \nalways good targets.''\n  Now, what we have to do as we look at S. 240 is make sure that it \npasses the Keating test. Can we get a crook like Charles Keating, if we \nweaken our securities laws too much?\n  What the Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, is trying to do, \nand the Senator from Nevada is trying to do, and the Senator from \nAlabama, and this Senator, and I hope others, we are trying to fix S. \n240, so we do not allow these charlatans, these crooks, these \ncriminals, to target elderly people, to go after the weak, the meek, \nand the ignorant as targets, and get away with it.\n  Remember, the Senator from Nevada, who was a prosecutor, has said if \nS. 240 had been the law of the land, the people who were conned by \nCharles Keating would not have recovered what they have now recovered. \nIt is about 40 to 60 percent of their losses.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is that an instruction sheet they gave to their \nsalesmen?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is an instruction sheet they gave to their \nsalespeople, exactly. This was in the period of discovery, when the \nattorneys went in to make their case against Charles Keating, they were \nable to come up with these documents which are on file at the court. We \ntook them out.\n  I thought it shows the people of America that there are, sad to say, \nbad people, bad people who will try to get the elderly to make \ninvestments that are no good.\n  As the Senator knows, the Keating case, they led people to believe \nthat their investments were, in fact, insured by the Federal \nGovernment, and people lost everything.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Might I make an inquiry?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I understand the horrible and the terrible things that \nwere done to these people, the unscrupulous tactics that were used, but \nI ask what the relevance of insider trading is to the legislative \nproposal that we have before us.\n  This legislation does not deal with insider trading. Insider trading \nremains completely banned. There are other existing sections of the \nsecurities law which deals with insider trading. We do not make it any \neasier for insider trading to occur.\n  The fact is that this bill does not protect fraudulent conduct. It \nabsolutely does not.\n  If you knowingly advertise falsely, you will be in violation of this \nbill, the safe harbor does not protect these false statements nor does \nit apply to ITO's or to small emerging companies. Also, the Securities \nExchange Commission will still have the authority to bring any suit \nthat it can bring today.\n  When we bring up the name of Charles Keating, and the terrible things \nthat his salespeople were trained to do, we imply that this legislation \nwill allow this kind of conduct. This legislation will not sanction \nthat kind of conduct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I respond to my friend that we are changing the laws \nthat protected the people who were conned by Charles Keating.\n  The fact of the matter is, Charles Keating ripped off the assets of \nthe savings and loan, went bankrupt, and these poor people who were \nleft with nothing had to go after other people. And in this bill you \nmake it far more difficult. That is why Senator Shelby is offering an \namendment on this.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The other point--I would like to just finish my point \nbecause my friend raised two issues. My [[Page S 8938]] colleague is \nasking me about insider trading. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Does the Senator know what fraud provisions we are \nchanging? I would like to know. If she can point out to me a particular \nprovision that will permit fraud, then I want to strike it. You say we \nhave changed the law without identifying what section we have changed \nand allude to the practices of somebody we all agree was contemptible \nbut his actions are not relevant. If you can point it out these \nprovisions I would be delighted to review them.\n  The comment that we will make it possible for people to engage in \nfraudulent conduct and wipe away the protections that now exist, is \nnot, in my opinion, square with the facts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to respond to my friend very clearly. I am \nmaking an opening statement tonight. I told my friend, I will be \nsupporting amendments to make this bill better; amendments that will \nnot leave people prey to people like Charles Keating. The Senator wants \nto know specifically? You can talk about the safe harbor. We are going \nto do that. I was happy to hear my friend from Connecticut saying maybe \nhe will have a little change there. We welcome that. We are going to \nlook at pleadings. And on insider trading, which we are going to talk \nabout, the bill is silent about it. That is my problem.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. But this legislation does not deal with insider trading. \nInsider trading provisions are as vigilant and tough as ever. If there \nare constructive suggestions to make insider trading laws more \neffective, to appropriately protect defrauded people, we should \ncertainly consider them. But this bill, as it does not address insider \ntrading.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is my point.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. To suggest that this bill will somehow make it easier \nfor insider trading, because that is the implication when you cite \nCharles Keating and his misdeeds, that somehow we are going to make it \neasier for these people to prey on the elderly to is not true. I might \njust make one observation, this bill does, makes it possible for those \nwho are truly aggrieved, not the entrepreneurial lawyer, to bring suit \nagainst violators and to receive their fair share of the settlement \nmoney.\n  It allows the institutional investors and the pension managers who \nare at risk, whose clients are at risk, to have the opportunity to \nmanage a lawsuit, instead of giving this control to lawyers who have no \nconcern for the defrauded investors. These lawyers do not give two \nhoots and a holler about the stockholders, and walk off with millions \nof dollars in settlement fees when the stockholders get a penny or 2 \npennies per share. I suggest to the Senator that this bill helps \npensioners, who hold $4.5 trillion in securities, by giving them the \nauthority to choose the lawyers who control the suits. It gives them \nthe ability to agree to a settlement as opposed to a charlatan, who \nowns 10 shares of stock and now is employed by lawyers.\n  That is what we tried to do with this legislation. I point this out \nbecause as I listen to my colleague's statement it sounds to me like \nthis legislation will open a door for the Charles Keatings, this is \njust not accurate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could just reclaim my time--and I will yield in a \nmoment--I really need to say to my friend from New York: He may not \nagree with me, but to stand there and say that it --and my friend is a \ngood debater--it is unequivocal that pensioners are better off--you \nshould see the people who oppose your bill.\n  It seems to me--\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I know the people who oppose the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me read the list: American Association of Community \nColleges, American Association of Retired Persons, American Council on \nEducation, American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the \nAssociation of Community College Trustees, the Association of Governing \nBoards of Universities and Colleges. It goes on. The Consumer \nFederation of America. Et cetera, et cetera.\n  I just read before--the Senator was not on the floor--some \nincredible, incredible editorials that have been written across this \nNation by people who have no vested interest at all.\n  How about the Investors Rights Association of America? How about the \nMunicipal Treasurers Association of the United States and Canada?\n  My friend has to, I hope, leave a little bit of room for dissension \nhere. I know the bill was voted out overwhelmingly. But in the course \nof this debate I am going to be supporting amendments and perhaps \noffering some that are going to improve this bill. Because I do not \nagree with my friend. I do not agree with my friend that investors are \nbetter protected. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Maryland \nwho sought to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would say to the distinguished Senator from New York, \non the morning of the markup of this bill in the committee, the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote to us and \nstressed that the substitute committee print failed to adhere to his \nbelief that a safe harbor should never protect fraudulent statements. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       I continue to have serious concerns about the safe harbor \n     fraud exclusion as it relates to the stringent standard of \n     proof that must be satisfied before a private plaintiff can \n     prevail. As Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful \n     fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection. The \n     scienter standard in the amendment may be so high as to \n     preclude all but the most obvious frauds.\n\n  That is not me talking. That is me quoting the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. He expressing very deep concern \nabout the safe harbor provision in this legislation. So there is a very \ndirect answer to the Senator from New York.\n  Second, we offered in the committee an aiding-and-abettingamendment. \nEarlier in the debate the distinguished Senator from Nevada pointed out \nabout half of the recovery in the Keating case that helped these \nelderly citizens who had been swindled to get at least some of their \nmoney back, about half of the money they got back was because they were \nable to move against aiders and abettors.\n  There is no aider and abettor provision in this legislation for \nprivate litigants--which is, of course, how they were able to proceed \nin order to get their money back. And later there will be an amendment \noffered to provide aider and abettor liability in private actions.\n  So there again, unless we get that provision in, the ability that \npeople who have been swindled in the Keating matter had to recover at \nleast some of their losses would otherwise not be available to them.\n  So I say to my friend from California, there are two very clear \nexamples to support the proposition she was just arguing.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DODD. May I make a comment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Without losing my right to the floor, and briefly, I \nyield to my friend.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from California.\n  Mr. President, we are dealing here with apples and oranges. Talking \nabout the Keating case has the desired effect because people recall \nwhat happened to innocent investors. But under the Keating situation we \nwere talking about a failure of the bank regulatory system. Here we are \ntalking about securities laws, two entirely different areas of the law.\n  What Mr. Keating and his cohorts were charged with was not violation \nof fraud and forward-looking statements, they lied to them about \npresent facts. That is a vastly different situation. No safe harbor \nprovisions were necessary in the Keating case, because he told those \npeople, in these absolutely ridiculous and outrageous statements and \ninstructions, that ``your money is being guaranteed. You are \nprotected.'' It was not forward looking, he was lying about the present \nsituation.\n  What the safe harbor provisions deal with are forward-looking \nstatements, entirely different fact situations than existed in the \nKeating case.\n  I want to go into that at some length and I will later on, on this, \nbut that is a very different fact situation than what we are talking \nabout here.\n  Last, I just make this one point.\n  One of the major provisions of S. 240 has to deal with the \nrequirement that we have the auditors reach out. Look, this is a \nprovision that was added by Congressman Wyden on the House side [[Page S \n8939]] who for years had 30 hearings on this provision which we have \nincorporated in this bill. Had that provision, by the way--one \nprovision of this bill that does apply to Keating--had the auditors \nbeen required to seek out the fraud which does not exist on the books, \nthat is the one area, I would argue, in S. 240 that might have made a \ndifference in the Keating case.\n  What we have done with this bill is add a new requirement that \nauditors must do that. That would have assisted in the prosecution of \nMr. Keating. That is a part of this bill. But forward-looking \nstatements and lying about present facts are very different, and safe \nharbor would not have applied.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  I say it is my understanding--and we are going to debate this--that \nit is not as clear as the Senator made it. We are going to bring that \nout as we move forward in this debate.\n  My friend from New York says insider trading is not in this bill; \nexactly my point. I would like to see us connect insider trading to \nthese forward-looking statements. And I want to explain what I am \ntalking about. We know insider trading. ``It's back, but with a new \ncast of characters.'' That is Business Week. That is December 1994.\n  I want to quote from a book written by Gene Marcial, ``The Secrets of \nWall Street'':\n\n       Don't kid yourselves: Very little has changed on Wall \n     Street. Half a dozen years after the scandals of the 1980's, \n     when any number of Street veterans were charged with \n     violations of securities laws and several high-profile \n     insiders were marched off to jail, insider trading and market \n     manipulation--in cases 100 percent illegal--are still the \n     most zealously desired play in the financial world. It's \n     almost the only way to make the truly big bucks. All the \n     market savvy in the world will come up short if you're \n     playing against other investors who have market savvy plus \n     inside information: Sorry, but that is the way the game is \n     played.\n\n  How does that fit into this bill? What this bill does not address is \nforward-looking statements made in combination with insider trading.\n  Let me show you what I mean. Here is a forward-looking statement. \nCrazy Eddie. Some of you may remember a business run by a crook. Here \ncomes the forward-looking statement.\n\n       We are confident that our market penetration can grow \n     appreciably . . .\n       Glowing evidence of consumer acceptance of the Crazy Eddie \n     ``Name'' augurs well for continuing growth outside of New \n     York . . .\n\n  All during the time of this forward-looking statement, Crazy Eddie \nand his friends are unloading the stock, and they are unloading it at a \nhigh point. And after awhile, just a little bit later, you see this \nforward-looking statement was fraudulent and the top officer flees the \ncountry with millions of dollars, and the CEO is convicted of fraud.\n  So my point, I say to my friends--and what I tried to do in the \ncommittee, but we could not get agreement at that time, I am hoping we \ncan get an agreement--is to make a point that, if you have a forward-\nlooking statement in connection with insider trades, in other words, \nyou can show--because, by the way, the insider trades are definitely \nrecorded with the SEC, fortunately; some have 40 days to do it; I would \nlike to make it 5 business days--if you can show that there is a \nforward-looking statement in connection with an insider trade, that you \nmeet the heightened Keating requirement and you cannot take advantage \nof the safe harbor. My understanding is that if we made that change, it \nwould be very helpful to this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. As I see the fact situation here, in the Crazy Eddie case, \nthese are knowingly false statements that were made. The provisions of \nS. 240 are fine. My point is that the insider trading laws are on the \nbooks. Frankly, if you have some new ideas on insider trading--we do \nnot cover cattle rustling in this bill either. It does not mean it may \nnot be important.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May not be important?\n  Mr. DODD. My point is you have very good laws today. We wrote some \nlaws on insider trading which I dealt with in our committee a few years \nago. But the implication here is somehow that Crazy Eddie would have \ngone scot-free if S. 240 were the law of the land.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is not suggesting that, is she?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I would like to explain it before my friend gets too \nagitated. Let me explain it to my friend.\n  What I am suggesting--and I tried to explain it to my friends in the \ncommittee, but no one was interested in talking about it. I am trying \nto explain it now. The Senator is right. He made clearly false \nstatements. But he might get away with it under the new safe harbor \nbecause it is a more difficult standard to meet. What we are saying is \nthat, if you can show, going into the case, unequivocally that in \nconnection and conjunction with a false statement, a forward-looking \nstatement, there is insider trading, you do not have to meet the \nrequirements of the new safe harbor, and you do not have to meet the \npleadings requirement because what we are really saying is here ipso \nfacto, if you are unloading a stock the day after you make a phony \nstatement, that should meet the heightened requirement.\n  Mr. DODD. Is there anything that you believe--we now know in this \ncase there were knowingly false statements that were made. Is there \nanything in S. 240 that would in any way make it possible for a Crazy \nEddie to have gone scot-free?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Why?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because the safe harbor is quite different the way it is \nwritten in S. 240, and it would be much more difficult for investors to \nmove against this particular company.\n  Mr. DODD. S. 240 says knowingly false statements.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know. But it is a much higher level. You have to know \nthe intent and all the rest.\n  All we are saying is in cases of insider trading--I hope my friends \ncan go along with this because I think it is good law; that is, ipso \nfacto, if you can show that there is insider trading in connection with \na forward-looking statement, that you meet the new safe harbor and the \npleading requirements. That is all we are suggesting.\n  We will be offering that amendment. I hope we can have some support. \nI think it makes a lot of sense.\n  I want to say something about the laws that deal with insider \ntrading. I hope my friends can help me on this because I think we all \nwant to go after the bad people. I know we do.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, I cannot give a \ndefinitive answer to his question because there has not been a court \ninterpretation of the standard that you had put in this bill, the safe \nharbor. But it is clear that under this standard, that Crazy Eddie was \nheld to a standard that was not as stringent as the standard you have \nwritten into this legislation. That is clear. There is no argument \nabout that. The standard by which Crazy Eddie was held under the \nexisting law was a less stringent standard than the standard the \nSenator has written into this bill, because his standard--he says it is \nknowingly made with the expectation, purpose, and actual intent of \nmisleading investors, and, of course, the Chairman of the SEC indicated \nhe was fearful that this would allow willful fraud and still enjoy the \nbenefit of safe harbor protection.\n  The other thing, I say to my friend, because I wanted to make this \npoint earlier, is that I do think that the insider trading issue is \nmore related to this bill by far than cattle rustling, if I may state \nthat to my colleague, because, as I understand it, his effort was to \ncounter my good friend from California to say, ``Well, you know, what \nhas insider trading got to do with this bill? What does cattle rustling \nhave to do with this bill?'' I think there is a difference between \ninsider trading as it relates to this kind of legislation and cattle \nrustling.\n  Mr. DODD. I think my colleague from Maryland fully understood the \npoint I was making on this. Yes, there is a different standard we are \napplying here. But the implication of using Crazy Eddie as an example I \nthink is wrong.\n  But, second, what we are trying to do here is to minimize the kind of \nfrivolous litigation where some people have a position that there \nshould be no safe harbor, that we should do away with safe harbor \naltogether. I disagree with that. I think you can make a case for that. \n[[Page S 8940]] \n  But the idea of arguing, on the one hand, that we ought to have a \nsafe harbor, and, second, making it so transparent that anyone can \nbring a lawsuit based on any kind of forward-looking statement is going \nagainst the trend of the balance we are trying to strike here where you \nhave companies withholding information, pulling back, fearful that \nanything they say, no matter how well intended, becomes the automatic \nsubject of a litigation when stocks fluctuate.\n  So we are trying to strike that balance, if I might just say to my \ncolleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could bring my dear friend back into the \nparameters, no one that I know of out here has argued that there should \nbe no safe harbor whatever, which is the statement the Senator just \nmade.\n  Mr. DODD. I said some may. I do not know.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is a red herring. It is a diversionary thing.\n  Mr. DODD. Crazy Eddie is a red herring.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We are trying to get at what is a proper approach on \nthe safe harbor issue. Now, it is a complicated issue. The Senator \nhimself said that earlier in the day, a very complicated issue. But the \npotential for harm and damage, if you do not get it right, is enormous.\n  Mr. DODD. On both sides.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is enormous.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague agree, on both sides?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not quite. Because until 1979 the SEC would not even \npermit forward-looking statements and yet our markets did very well. \nThey grew. People prospered. Investments were made. The SEC would not \neven allow a forward-looking statement because they were so worried \nabout what might happen to the investors.\n  Then people came in and made the argument, well, you know, this is \ndifficult; we ought to be able to make some projection. And they began \nto try to accommodate that, which is what they have been trying to do. \nSo we have been trying to make some changes. But you have to get it \nright. And when the chairman of the SEC comes in with a letter when he \ncame to the committee, it ought to give you pause. You ought to pause. \nYou ought to stop and think about this thing.\n  We ought not to have to enact something, then have devastation happen \nto investors and then come back and try to get it right, I say to my \nfriend.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield on that, we are already seeing--\nthe reason the bill exists at all is because of the kind of devastation \nthat can occur here. And so we are trying to strike that balance here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. And we have to strike the balance in the \nright place. That is all I am saying to my distinguished friend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may reclaim my time at this point, I have enjoyed \nthe give and take but I am bringing it back to real people. And my \nfriends can talk all they want about safe harbor and all that. Let me \ntell you what I am talking about.\n  I used to be a stockbroker, I say to my friend, and I took that job \nvery seriously. And I had a lot of widows and they came into me and, \nGod, I worried. I am not concerned about the good people that my friend \nfrom Connecticut talks about. I want to help them. I want to protect \nthem from frivolous lawsuits. I wish to also, however, say while I am \ndoing that I do not want to hurt the average investor, and they can \ntell you from today until tomorrow it has nothing to do with the \nKeating case. Fine, they can say it all they want. But I will prove it \nas we go through this debate. But I wish to take you back to what \nhappened to real people. This is just one case. There are many. I will \nshow you another article behind here.\n  ``Regulatory Alarms Ring on Wall Street'' New York Times, Friday June \n9, 1995:\n\n       With the frenzy of merger deals and takeover battles these \n     days, it seems like old times on Wall Street in more ways \n     than one. Securities regulators say they are opening \n     investigations into insider trading at a rate not seen since \n     the mid 1980's, the era in which Ivan Boesky, who went to \n     jail for trading on inside information, became a household \n     name.\n\n  The point I am trying to make, my friends, yes, I want to have a safe \nharbor. I voted for the safe harbor that was in the Dodd-Domenici bill. \nAnd my friend from Connecticut said, well, we have moved past that. We \ncan do better.\n  I think what was in the Dodd-Domenici bill made sense to give this to \nthe SEC and let them develop a safe harbor. They know more than any of \nus.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on this one?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is absolutely correct. I asked a year and a \nhalf ago. A year and a half ago I said to the SEC, in response to the \nletter by the chairman, a year and a half ago I said, ``Look, let's let \nyou do it. Would you get some answers back.''\n  Month after month we inquired: What are you going to do on this? We \nwould like to know. A year and a half went by and the SEC basically, \nbecause they wanted no change whatsoever, refused to provide any \nresponse. I say that to my colleague in frustration. We have had this \nhappen with other agencies. They were not interested in doing this at \nall, despite their claims to the contrary. That is why we put the \nprovision in here. Frankly, I would have preferred that they would have \ndone it. But, frankly, after a year and a half, the patience of a \nSenator runs out when an agency refuses to respond.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I know of his good faith and his good \nwill and his good patience, but you know what? I think it is dangerous: \nWell, we tried and they did not do it, so we are going to write this \nour way.\n  I was in the House when we started the whole mess with the S's. \nEveryone thought: We can handle it; we know what is best; we will \nregulate them. Great. We do not need the agency to tell us how to do \nit. We are going to legislate.\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut, whom I admire--and we are \nfriends, and we agree on 98 percent of the things around here--on this \nparticular case, I hope he can get some more patience because I am a \nlittle concerned about the direction, and it is not just me. It is list \nafter list of consumer groups and senior groups and securities \nadministrators. They have no ax to grind. They are scared for the \ninvestors.\n  We do not want to go too far. We should find that balance. We should \ncrack down on frivolous lawsuits, but let us be careful.\n  The point I am making with this, as my friend from Maryland pointed \nout, there is a tougher standard now. That is the whole point of the \nbill. Let us not play games with it. It is a tougher standard to meet, \non purpose. The Senator himself has said, others have said we are \nworried about these suits against good, decent people and we are \nraising the bar; we are making it tougher.\n  What I am suggesting is if in connection with a forward-looking \nstatement there is insider trading and it is clear and convincing and \neveryone knows it because they have to file it, then that should meet \nthe standard right away, and the case moves over.\n  That is all I am saying. I hope I can work with my friend from \nConnecticut. I think when he looks at it he is going to think this is \ngood. He does not want to protect people who make these statements; \nthey are false; they dump their stock.\n  You know what happened? All the people in here that bought it on the \nbasis of this lost so much. And I think there are ways we can work \ntogether to strengthen this bill so that when we have this connection--\nby the way, it happens many, many times with this insider trading, with \nthese false statements, and the public gets it in the neck. And now \nthey have to meet a higher standard.\n  And my friend from New York, I do not agree with him on this business \nabout choosing the attorney. Now, in this bill we say the richest \nperson, the person with the most invested gets to pick the attorney.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If I might I ask, does the Senator mean to tell me that, \nfor example, the pension manager of the city of New York, a $20-some-\nodd billion fund, should not be given greater latitude given the \nmagnitude of the investment they manage than a professional plaintiff \nwho buys 10 shares of stock and who is retained basically by a lawyer \nwho rushes to file a suit? You would not want to give to the pension [[Page S \n8941]] managers the ability to have a greater say in who is selected \nwhen half of the dollars lost are invested by pension funds?\n  I would say I would rather have that any time. So when you say who is \ngoing to pick the lawyer, I would rather have people who have a real \nstake, who really invested billions of dollars, who really have \nsomething at risk, pick the lawyer. Than entrepenurial lawyers who \nsimply watch for the stock to move 5 points one way or the other way. \nThe Senator feels one way, I feel the public needs to be protected, and \nthe way to protect the stockholders, the little people is to give them \na say. They do not get a say now. They absolutely do not. What is going \non now is a travesty.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I assume that was a question, and so I will attempt \nto answer it this way. I say to my friend, we have a disagreement, and \nso does the SEC. They do not agree. They want to work on this \nprovision. Just to say because someone has the most money, that is the \nend of it, they get to pick the lawyer, I think is a problem.\n  If you look at the Keating case, by the way, it is very interesting \nbecause in some of these cases, as the SEC pointed out in their recent \ncommunication, it may well be that the largest stockholder is somehow \nin cahoots with the fraudulent individual.\n  Now, I would rather give--\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Are you really suggesting--\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I finish my point, I say to my friend? I so admire my \nfriend's tenacity, but let me finish my point and then I will be so \nhappy to yield. Two people from Brooklyn, and I know it is hard. Two \npeople from Brooklyn, I know it is hard. I want to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. You do not have to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to remember my point, which is that under \nthe current law, the judge gets to make the decision based on who is \nthe most competent lawyer. I would assume judges are not dumb. They \nknow if there is a phony plaintiff. I think that is another area on \nwhich we can perhaps compromise that the SEC has found problems with.\n  My colleagues will be glad to know that I am reaching the end of my \nremarks tonight. I know my chairman is absolutely thrilled with that, \nbut I want to point out that I was yielding to many of my colleagues \nthroughout this time. I wanted to do that. I think we have some \nlegitimate differences.\n  Look, I only have one goal here. This is a tough issue for me. I \nrepresent so many wonderful companies who are complaining about this. I \nwant to resolve this in the right way. I represent so many investors \nthat got bilked.\n  Why do I represent all these people? Because I come from the largest \nState. I have 32 million people. I have thousands and thousands of \ninvestors, thousands of companies, and I want to be able to support a \nbill that strikes the balance that my friend from Connecticut talked \nabout.\n  I think this bill, in its current form, does not do that. Now, I am \nnot the only one to say that. Respected people in this Senate have said \nit tonight, people like Dick Bryan, people like Paul Sarbanes. These \nare not people who do not know their facts. These are fair people.\n  We have a list of people who look after consumers, who look after \ninvestors who are begging us to fix this bill. I want to make sure that \nwhen this process ends, we have adopted some amendment, we have made \nsure that we do not have unintended consequences. We certainly had them \nin the S debacle. Not one of us ever dreamed we would have the \nproblems we had when we deregulated.\n  Please, please view my comments tonight in the spirit in which they \nare offered. I want to be able to support a bill that does the right \nthing, but let us heed what Arthur Levitt and the SEC is saying in \nregard to the safe harbor, in regard to joint and several, in regard to \nthe statute of limitations, in regard to the provisions regarding \nselecting an attorney. These are complicated matters, but the bottom \nline for me is making sure we protect the investors and that we protect \nthe good business people, and if we do the wrong thing, we could be \nvery, very sorry.\n  So let us proceed with caution, with comity. I hope we can improve \nthis bill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \namendments that will be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I will be brief considering the late \nhour.\n  I cannot let go unchallenged the statement that would imply that \nsomehow this legislation will open up the door for people like Charles \nKeating to do the kinds of things that he did. This legislation does \nnot deal with the criminal law or criminal conduct.\n  This bill does deal with the civil suits which are being brought and \nstating that there has to be a showing of intent to cause harm when \nmaking forward statements. These forward statements are defined in a \nvery limited fashion, they include only projections. In order for a \nstatement to be a projection, the company must state that it is a \nprojection and warn investors that these projections may not come true.\n  If we want companies to be able to make these projections, and most \npeople agree that it is in the consumers interest that they make them, \nthen you have to give them this protection against frivolous suits. The \nquestion of who should represent the people, is not, in my opinion, a \nquestion of rich investors trampling the concerns of small investors. \nWe are trying to give pension funds which operate on behalf of millions \nof people, many of whom are in the public sector, more control over \ntheir suits. We want to address more investors' concerns, not fewer. \nThat is what we are attempting to do with this legislation.\n  Fraudulent conduct is not protected by the safe harbor section in \nthis bill. This bill specifically excludes from protection any \nstatements made with the expectation, purpose, and intent of misleading \ninvestors. If you are trying to mislead your investors you do not get \nprotection. It is designed to protect honest companies from abusive \nsuits.\n  There will be amendments to attempt to improve on the language of the \nbill. We will have exhaustive debate on all the issues on which my \ncolleagues have concern and we will have votes on those amendments.\n  I just do not think it is fair to bring up the cases of Charles \nKeating or Crazy Eddie in which criminal violations were committed and \nwhich have absolutely no relation to the provisions in this \nlegislation. One could easily assume when they hear the names of these \noutstandingly monstrous cases that are indelibly imprinted on so many \npeople that somehow we are going to open the door to these kinds of \nactions. That is just not fair, and it is not an accurate \nrepresentation of what we are attempting to do here. Although I \ncertainly believe that reasonable people can disagree, as is their \nright, but I do not believe these analogies are correct or fair, with \nrespect to this legislation.\n  Finally, I will conclude by saying that I did not sponsor this \nlegislation, because I thought that the initial provisions of the \nlegislation would have precluded and made it impossible for many people \nwho are truly wronged to bring a suit. It was only after we were able \nto craft a compromise and some of the most onerous provisions, both of \nthe original legislation and of the draft, were dropped, did I sponsor \nthis bill.\n  For example, along the way, there was thought that an intentional \nmisstatement would be protected in the safe harbor if a person did not \nrely upon it, which meant that somebody could actually deliberately \ndistort the facts and could not be sued unless the person who brought \nthe suit actually read that statement.\n  I could not support that, and I insisted that provision in the draft \nbe dropped. We now have a provision which says only that there has to \nbe an intentional misstatement.\n  It is in that spirit that we crafted an agreement. I might point to \nthe House bill which has loser pays provision. We do not have a \nprovision like that, but, yes, we do have a provision that says the \ncourts shall ascertain, upon a dismissal of a suit, whether or not \nthere has been an abuse, because too many of my colleagues in the law \nhave brought these suits because it is an easy thing to get a company \nto settle.\n And that is not what the judicial system should be about, to wring out \nsettlements from [[Page S 8942]] people because they have wealth or \nbecause they cannot stand the litigation that might hurt them for 2 or \n3 years; litigation that is meritless, or will keep them from doing \nbusiness or obtaining the necessary financing. That is simply wrong. \nSo, yes, we have sought to change that.\n\n  Do we seek to change that to disadvantage people? No, but to make the \nsystem operate on the basis that it should, to protect the truly \naggrieved, to give them the right to sue, and to give the people who \nreally lose the ability to decide who is going to represent them. A \nlawyer who finds his plaintiffs by pressing a button on a computer and \ncalling up his list of investors with 10 shares in any particular \ncompany should not speak for the class of defrauded investors. That is \nwrong and is making a mockery of the system. That is why people are \nangry. The business community is absolutely right when they say we need \nfundamental change.\n  As I have said, I initially had great reservations about this \nlegislation. My friend Senator Dodd knows that, as does Senator \nDomenici. I studied this legislation and became convinced that many of \nthe original reforms were necessary, while others, I felt went too far. \nI mention this to explain why I have not been a cosponsor--because I \nwanted to achieve a balance. When you have balance, there are parties \non both sides who are not happy because, unfortunately, they all want \ntheir side to be more balanced. Some want loser pays. Some want a \nlarger safe harbor; they would like companies to have no responsibility \nand no ability for anyone to sue them. Well, that is wrong. Of course \non the other side, some of the lawyers want to be able to bring suit on \nanything that moves and some things that do not. They do not want to \nhave accountability. The judges do not want to have to finding. They \nare overburdened and overworked, sometimes they have a year or 2-year \nbacklog of cases. Here is Congress telling them they have made those \nfindings, that they are in the public interest and the public has to be \nserved. We are suffering in this country as a result of these frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  So one way for us to find the balance is ask the Judges only to look \nat cases which are dismissed, to find out whether or not sanctions \nshould be brought. We hope that will help deter frivolous suits. Maybe \nafter one or two sanctions are imposed we will have sent a message to \nthose who are abusing the system.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can proceed on this tomorrow. As I \nunderstand it, Senator Shelby will lay down the first amendment. We \nwill come into session at 9 o'clock. We will move to this bill at 9:30, \nwhen Senator Shelby will offer his amendment dealing with proportionate \nliability, and I hope to hear debate from both sides. We will vote at \n10:55.\n  If there is nothing further----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very quick. I think we have \nhad a good opening debate. I very strongly commend to my colleagues the \nvery thoughtful and perceptive statements that were made by Senator \nBryan and Senator Boxer. I hope Members will review those very \ncarefully.\n  We have to focus this debate on what the real issues are that divide \nus. There are provisions in this legislation--I was listening to the \nchairman of the committee talking just now, and he mentioned a number \nof provisions that we are not contesting. We accept those and think \nthey are designed to deal with some abuses that have been taking place. \nBut we do want to get the focus on other provisions where we think a \nproper balance has not been struck, where we think investors will be \njeopardized, and where we think immunity is being provided to potential \nwrongdoers that ought not to be provided to them.\n  This is a very complicated question, there is no doubt about it. My \ngood friend from New York, the chairman now, got very excited about the \nappointment of the lead plaintiff in a class action. Well, let me read \nyou what the SEC said about that, and it is not all black and white, I \nadmit that. Here is what they said:\n\n       One provision of section 102 requires a court generally to \n     appoint as lead plaintiff the class member that has the \n     largest financial interest in the case. While this approach \n     has merit, it may create additional litigation concerning the \n     qualification of the lead plaintiff, particularly when the \n     class member with the greatest financial interest in the \n     litigation has ties to management or interests that may be \n     different from other class members.\n\n  Now, I am not pretending this is simple. There is the problem. The \nSEC has stated this, and we need to think about it and address it. We \nmay be making a mistake. I am sort of puzzled a bit by the absolute \ncertainty of the people on the other side of this. I think this is \ncomplicated. I am not absolutely certain that the position I am \nadvocating anticipates all of the problems. But, clearly, outside \nobservers, in many respects, are far more knowledgeable than we are--\nthe State securities regulators, the chairman of the SEC, and the \nfinance officer people have all come in here expressing a lot of \nmisgivings. One group said, ``We think you need these amendments. If \nyou get these amendments in, we will take a different view of the bill. \nWithout these amendments, we oppose the bill.'' They, in effect, are \nsaying they recognize that there are other aspects or features of the \nbill that are acceptable or desirable.\n  As I said earlier, parts of this bill are desirable; parts of it are \nnot desirable. We need to address, in my judgment, the undesirable \nparts. If we can do that, I think we can end up strengthening the bill, \nchanging its thrust, achieving a better balance, and eliminating, \nhopefully, the differences between us.\n  As the very able Senator from California pointed out, that is the \nquest that she is on now, as we come to address this legislation.\n  So, again, I strongly commend to my colleagues the opening statement \nof Senator Bryan and the opening statement of Senator Boxer. I say to \nthem that this is a complicated issue. They need to consider it very \ncarefully, because we will have to live with the consequences of this \nthing. As one commentator observed, ``The pendulum had swung too far \ntoward the lawyers, and now it is swinging too far the other way. \nUnfortunately, some major investor frauds may have to take place before \nit again moves back toward the center.''\n  I want to get it to the center before we send it out of here, so the \nmajor investor frauds will never happen. I do not want a situation \nwhere we send it out of here, then the major investor frauds happen, \nand everybody comes back and says, oh, my goodness, we overreached. Let \nus correct it now and avoid it. Get the pendulum, as this says, in the \ncenter to begin with.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I do not debate what my \ncolleague has said. Some of us have been at this for 4 or 5 years \ntrying to strike a balance.\n  As I pointed out earlier today, the first couple of years, any \nsuggestion about doing anything in this area was greeted, in many \nquarters, with total hostility. A threshold has been reached in the \nlast year or so now, and the people are finally agreeing that the \npresent system is not working well. And it has taken some time to get \npeople to agree to that particular position.\n  As my colleague from Maryland knows far better than I, as you try and \nput together a legislative package here, it is in a complicated area \nwhere, unfortunately, only a relatively small number of people get \ninvolved in issues like this. The galleries are empty.\n  Not for lack of people who are probably in the building covering \nthese matters, but this does not help itself to the 30-second sound \nbite, to the 30-second campaign ad or a bumper sticker. These are \nhighly complicated areas.\n  Striking the balance is truly my interest here. In the years I have \nspent as chairman of the Security Subcommittee and as ranking minority \nmember, I have authored many pieces of legislation in this area, and \nforever keeping in mind confidence.\n  Investor confidence. Confidence in our markets is what has made our \nmarkets so attractive to people. Why people, as the Senator from \nMaryland pointed out, why people come from around the world. It is not \njust because the dollars are here, but the confidence they have in our \nmarkets.\n  I think there has been an erosion in that confidence because of some \nof the activities we have seen. Trying to strike that balance is truly \nthe interest of this Senator, the Senator from [[Page S 8943]] New \nYork, the Senator from New Mexico, and others.\n  There will be some amendments. Some of them, as my colleagues know, I \nsupport. The statute of limitations, I support that. My colleague from \nNew York wants that. I wanted to keep that in the bill.\n  We will be together on a few of these things. When we deal with the \nlegislative process, it is darn near impossible to strike that perfect \nbalance all the time.\n  The Senator from Maryland is correct. Anyone who sits here and says \nwith absolute certainty they know what will happen as a result of \nlegislation they pass, has not been here very long, or never been in \nthe legislative process. We know the system is not working well. We are \ntrying to correct it.\n  Obviously, how the markets respond, what happens down the road in \nmany ways, we will have to deal with as it occurs. Maybe we have not \ngone far enough. Maybe we have gone far in some areas.\n  No one here claims perfection. Clearly, we need to address a present \nsituation that is not working. My hope and desire over the next 2 or 3 \ndays, we have the four, five, six amendments that I think we will have, \nthat possibly we can address some of these issues, modify the bill if \nthat is necessary, in a few areas to accommodate some of these \ninterests, but move the process along so we have a chance to address \nthe underlying concerns people have raised about the present situation.\n  I thank my colleague for listening. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8935-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

A bill to clarify the scope of coverage and amount of payment \nunder the Medicare Program of items and services associated with the \nuse in the furnishing of inpatient hospital services of certain medical \ndevices approved for investigational use; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       the advanced medical devices access assistance act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 955, the Advanced \nMedical Devices Access Assurance Act of 1995, which is aimed at \naddressing two serious threats to high quality health care in the \nUnited States: restricted access for our senior citizens to the most \nadvanced medical technologies; and our country's loss of clinical \nresearch activities to overseas facilities.\n  I am pleased to be joined in cosponsorship of this bill by Senators \nGregg, Frist, Kennedy, Kassebaum, Grams, Wellstone, Chafee, Hutchison, \nand D'Amato.\n  At the outset, I want to recognize the outstanding leadership of our \nHouse colleague, Chairman Bill Thomas, who introduced the companion \nmeasure as H.R. 1744 on June 6. Representative Thomas was the first in \nCongress to [[Page S 8946]] step forward and take steps to correct the \nproblem this legislation addresses. His leadership has been--and will \ncontinue to be--invaluable as we seek to move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, the Thomas-Hatch legislation was prompted as a result \nof recent changes in Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] \nreimbursement practices for medical procedures which include the use of \nso-called next generation devices, that is, medical devices that are \nundergoing clinical trials, yet which have a precursor device which has \nbeen approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and \neffective.\n  In December 1994, HCFA advised its regional administrators that \nMedicare must only reimburse for items and services that are reasonable \nand necessary; according to HCFA, reimbursement of reasonable and \nnecessary procedures precludes payment for the use of experimental or \ninvestigational services.\n  The HCFA policy change came on the heels of an HHS inspector general \ninquiry in which patient records were subpoenaed from over 100 \nhospitals nationwide, including virtually all of the premier medical \nresearch bodies in this Nation.\n  The effect of this change in HCFA policy is to deny Medicare \ncontractors discretion to pay for any of a beneficiary's hospital costs \nand related services if an investigational device were being used, even \nif such a device were a refinement of a proven, FDA-approved \ntechnology.\n  Examples might be a pacemaker which is made in a smaller version or a \npacemaker with a new type of lead.\n  This policy denies patients in the Medicare population the benefits \nof the best available medical therapies which are often life-saving and \nlife-enhancing.\n  In effect, in adopting such a policy, HCFA has created a two-tiered \nhealth care delivery system, consisting of privately insured \nindividuals who can access these improved devices and Medicare \nbeneficiaries who cannot. That is a situation which must be corrected.\n  Although our senior citizens are the immediate victims of this unwise \npolicy, all Americans will ultimately suffer.\n  Medicare's position not only deprives this Nation's elderly \npopulation of the most advanced, efficacious care and treatment \navailable, but it also significantly interferes with clinical \nadvancements that might otherwise be available for generations to come.\n  In addition, I wish to note there are other negative effects of the \nHCFA policy.\n  First, it undermines the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to \npress for clinical trials to prove the scientific validity of device \nstudies.\n  Second, it delays advances in medical device technology for all \nAmericans, not just those eligible for Medicare.\n  Third, it has a disproportionate impact on small-to-medium medical \ndevice companies, those who traditionally have been the leaders in \ndeveloping innovative technology, and who simply cannot afford millions \nof dollars for clinical trials.\n  Fourth, the policy exacerbates current over-regulatory trends in the \nUnited States which are driving manufacturers offshore and jobs to \nother countries.\n  And fifth, it runs contrary to the recent report of the Physician \nPayment Review Commission, which stated that Congress should authorize \nan additional coverage option for Medicare so that:\n\n       For devices subject to Food and Drug Administration \n     approval, and for other services that the Health Care \n     Financing Administration has not approved for coverage, \n     Medicare should pay up to the cost of standard care when the \n     device or service is clearly substituting for an established \n     one and is being evaluated in a Food and Drug Administration-\n     approved or other approved study.\n\n  The situation giving rise to the legislation we offer today was first \nbrought to my attention a year ago by officials of the LDS Hospital in \nSalt Lake City, UT.\n  LDS Hospital, which ranks among the top in the Nation for cardiac \nprocedures, was among the more than 100 hospitals which had received a \nsubpoena from the HHS inspector general for records relating to \nMedicare reimbursement of cardiac procedures reaching as far back as 10 \nyears ago.\n  Included on the list of devices that are affected by this policy are \nimplantable cardiac defibrillators, which are devices that are \nimplanted in a patient's body and assist in correcting life \nthreatening, irregular heart rhythms.\n  My colleagues may be aware of the problem with reimbursement for \nstate-of-the-art defibrillators, as it was reported by John Carey in \nthe June 12 issue of Business Week.\n  In reporting on the HCFA policy and its impact on clinical research \nand patient care, Mr. Carey wrote:\n\n       In some cases, the impact on the quality and cost of care \n     was dramatic. Cardiac arrest survivors typically need \n     defibrillators to shock their hearts back to normal whenever \n     the fragile organ races out of control. For several years, \n     the standard device was so large that it had to be implanted \n     in patients' abdomens. But Minneapolis-based Medtronic, Inc. \n     built a much smaller version that could fit in the pectoral \n     region. In trials at the Mayo Clinic, says cardiologist \n     Stephen C. Hammill, the new device reduced deaths from the \n     actual operation from 3.8% of patients to zero--and cut \n     hospital costs after implantation from $24,000 to $18,000. \n     Yet Mayo's doctors could no longer use the device for \n     Medicare patients--unless they found another way to pay the \n     bills.\n\n  Let me put this in the words of one of Utah's preeminent \ncardiologists, Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, professor of medicine and chief \nof the division of cardiology at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake. Dr. \nAnderson has advised me:\n\n       Since notification of the OIG investigation and statement \n     of the HCFA policy, the Division of Cardiology at LDS \n     Hospital has been instructed by its Counsel to avoid use of \n     any newer, incremental technologies in Medicare patients, \n     including pacemakers, defibrillators, and interventional \n     coronary devices (such as angioplasty catheters and stents) \n     that are not final market approved.\n       Unquestionably, this has made our Medicare patients second \n     class citizens, as these newer devices are generally smaller, \n     more efficient and effective, last longer, and can be \n     implanted with lower operative risk.\n\n  Dr. Anderson also notes a recent tendency for these new devices to be \ndeveloped overseas and not readily available here. Several firms have \nindicated to him that initial research is now being done in Europe and \nelsewhere and that the devices will be only available here after final \nFDA approval, often with a delay of years.\n  Or, let me put it in the words of another distinguished Utah \ncardiologist, Dr. James W. Long, attending cardiothoracic surgeon at \nLDS Hospital. Dr. Long, has related to me:\n\n       As a cardiothoracic surgeon, I am extremely troubled by the \n     growing restrictions which are preventing us from \n     implementing great medical technologies for our patients in \n     Utah. Clearly, three major impediments exist: First, \n     reimbursement problems; second, product liability concerns; \n     and third, FDA constraints. Those barriers are exercising a \n     major chilling effect on the development and implementation \n     of medical technologies which offer the hope of improving \n     quality of life while offering cost-effectiveness.\n\n  Dr. Long goes on to state:\n\n       The current posture of HCFA to deny Medicare reimbursement \n     for any hospital charges when a new, ``investigational'' \n     device is used is an example of how problems with \n     reimbursement lead to discrimination against the Medicare \n     population. To illustrate, I can no longer implant a new, \n     improved heart valve undergoing clinical evaluation because \n     reimbursement for ALL hospital charges for the surgery and \n     care (not just the heart valve charges) will be denied. This \n     is even more frustrating when one considers that these \n     clinical evaluations are being conducted with the approval of \n     the FDA as well as local, hospital internal review boards or \n     medical devices whose efficacy and safety have already been \n     demonstrated in preclinical testing.\n\n  Mr. President, as has been demonstrated, over time, increasingly \nimproved devices have been developed that are far more efficient and \nefficacious than each prior version of the device. Such refinements \nhave not only improved the functioning of the device from a patient \nperspective, but also have: First, increased the longevity of the \ndevice, thereby minimizing the need for replacement; second, improved \nthe ability to monitor the device without the need for hospitalization; \nand third, minimized the invasiveness of the procedure require to \nimplant the device.\n  Not only have patient outcomes been greatly improved, but the overall \ncosts and consumption of resources within the health care system have \nbeen reduced.\n  My concerns about the HCFA policy were reinforced by evidence \nrevealed at a recent hearing before the Finance Committee. [[Page S \n8947]] \n  During the committee's May 16 hearing on the solvency of the Medicare \nProgram, Dr. John W. Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai Hospital and \nthe Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, shocked members by \nrevealing that his medical center has virtually discontinued clinical \nresearch on investigational devices for Medicare beneficiaries because \nof the HCFA ruling.\n  Dr. Rowe related to the committee that:\n\n       The Inspector General of HHS has indicated that if a \n     patient is given an investigational device--that is something \n     that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for \n     general use--during their experience in the hospital--let me \n     be clear on this--then the entire reimbursement or payment \n     for the admission to the hospital is not allowed and the \n     hospital is liable for treble damages.\n\n  Dr. Rowe went on to make the point that, whereas Medicare \nhistorically has not paid for research, there are differences between \nreal research and marginal refinements of innovations.\n  In subsequent correspondence to me, Dr. Rowe added another critical \npoint. He said:\n\n       Mount Sinai's decision to stop all clinical trials was made \n     after careful deliberation and with great regret and \n     consternation, but is the only rational position that can be \n     taken by an institution which, under normal circumstances, \n     performs a large number of such trials.\n       This outcome is also a particularly unfortunate one given \n     our belief that the controls put in place by the FDA's IDE \n     approval process and Mount Sinai's own Institutional Review \n     Board assure that there is an appropriate level of safety, \n     efficacy, and oversight with respect to each such device. In \n     the end, we believe that Medicare's position not only \n     deprives this nation's elderly population of the most \n     advanced, efficacious care and treatment available, but \n     significantly interferes with clinical advancements that \n     might otherwise be available for generations to come.\n\n  A survey released June 7 by the Health Industry Manufacturers \nAssociation reveals the problems inherent in this new HCFA policy.\n  HIMA found that 71 companies have had clinical trials with their \nproducts brought to a halt due to the new HCFA policy. The response of \n40 percent of those companies was to limit the clinical research to \nnon-Medicare patients, in other words, denying those seniors access to \nthe latest medical technologies.\n  Even more indicative of this policy's ill effects, 59 percent \nsurveyed had moved clinical trials overseas, and 57 percent said they \nplan to move future trials overseas.\n  It is clear that due the uncertainty generated by the recent change, \nclinical trials are being stopped around the country. Many medical \ntechnology companies are moving their life saving research technologies \nout of the United States to Europe, Canada, and Japan.\n  This loss of research will erode the base of expertise in an industry \nwhere the United States has traditionally led the world.\n  Mr. President, this policy must be changed for the benefit of our \nNation's elderly and all Americans. The bill I am introducing today \nwill accomplish this, and will do so without increasing Medicare costs.\n  Under S. 955, coverage would be limited to circumstances in which the \ndevice in question is used in lieu of an approved device or otherwise \ncovered procedure. This latter provision permits the use of devices \nthat are often used in lieu of far more invasive and costly procedures. \nBecause these investigational devices reduce hospital stays, mortality \nand the need for repeat procedures, it is likely that this legislation \nwill reduce total treatment costs over the long term.\n  In fact, the legislation specifically states that the amount of \npayment for any item or service associated with the use of an \ninvestigational device may not exceed the amount which would have been \nmade for the approved device. This will ensure the bill's budget \nneutrality.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I want to discuss for a moment one \nother factor which led us to introduce S. 955.\n  After Senator Gregg and I decided to explore legislation in this \narea, we contacted both HCFA and the OIG.\n  The IG's office advised us that ``This is an open active \ninvestigation in the OIG. It is the policy of the OIG not to comment on \ninvestigations which are active.''\n  HCFA officials, however, were extremely helpful, and shared with us \nthe results of the considerable time they have spent on this issue.\n  Two factors, however, led us to conclude that legislation is \nnecessary.\n  First, we were not persuaded that the agency's efforts would be \nconcluded as quickly as we would like. And, second, while we agreed \nwith HCFA's conclusion that Medicare should not be subsidizing pure \nresearch, we did not feel that these clinical investigations could be \ntermed as such.\n  We were, however, concerned that the concept underlying the agency's \nproposed rule-making could lead to more regulation at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, in that FDA is considering a system whereby \ninvestigational devices would be certified as eligible for Medicare \nreimbursement. With the device approval rate lag already the subject of \nmounting congressional concern, a process which adds even more review \nis not viable.\n  As I close, I would like to note the considerable support this \nlegislation enjoys. It is supported by the American Academy of \nOrthopedic Surgeons, American College of Cardiology, American Hospital \nAssociation, American Medical Association, Association of American \nMedical Colleges, Association of Professors of Medicine, California \nHealth Care Institute, Catholic Health Association, Cleveland Clinic, \nCoalition of Boston Teaching Hospitals, Federation of American Health \nSystems, Greater New York Hospital Association, Health Industry \nManufacturers Association, Mayo Clinic, Medical Device Manufacturers' \nAssociation, North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, \nSociety of Thoracic Surgeons, and last but not least, the Utah Life \nScience Industries Association.\n  In introducing this legislation today, it is our hope that the bill \ncan be incorporated in this year's reconciliation legislation and moved \nswiftly to the President for signature. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Advanced Medical Devices Access Act of 1995.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nespecially my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, in introducing this \nimportant piece of legislation. The Advanced Medical Devices Access \nAssurance Act of 1995 was developed to ensure that our senior \npopulation can be treated with the most advanced--and most cost-\neffective--medical technology available in the United States.\n  As chairman of the Aging Subcommittee in the Senate, I hear \nconstantly from older individuals who are concerned about their medical \noptions: They read about a breakthrough technology that is being \nexplored, and want an opportunity to have access to such a product. \nBelieve me, these folks are often more up-to-speed about their medical \nchoices than you or I; they take the time to do their homework on their \nhealth care.\n  As my colleague, Senator Hatch, has mentioned, this bill is designed \nto get at the heart of a problem which has arisen from a Health Care \nFinancing Administration policy. HCFA has ruled that it will not \nprovide Medicare reimbursement for any episode--any portion of the care \nassociated with the device, including the hospital stay--which uses a \nmedical device not defined as ``reasonable or necessary.'' ``Reasonable \nand necessary'' excluded medical devices which are being implanted \nunder an FDA investigation device exemption, or IDE.\n  In other words, if a surgeon who is performing state-of-the-art \nmedicine wants to take advantage of a product which has been granted an \nIDE, he or she can only do so on their population under age 65. The \nrandom nature of a person's date of birth controls their ability to \nreceive the most modern care, to get that technology that we are \nconstantly touting as the ``best in the world.''\n  A clear backlash from this policy has also been seen in the form of a \nmass exodus of clinical trials being conducted in the United States. \nThe brain drain in medical device development and manufacturing in this \ncountry has already begun to have devastating results. Not only does \nthe United States now have an atmosphere unconducive to research and \ndevelopment, but it has evolved into an environment that is \nunattractive for investment capital to be risked on medical devices. \nNot only does this relegate the citizens of this [[Page S \n8948]] country to antiquated generations of technology, it moves jobs \nand innovation overseas.\n  I am hopeful that the administration will listen to the plea we are \nmaking here today to address this critical issue. While it may seem \nlike a small item on the agenda of the day, it is probably the greatest \naccomplishment we could achieve for those individuals whose lives and \nmedical care we can so easily improve.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to join Senator Hatch and \nother Members of the House and Senate in sponsoring this important \nbipartisan legislation. Insurance coverage for physician and hospital \ncosts in clinical trials is essential to the progress of medicine.\n  The current policy under Medicare is especially counterproductive, \nbecause it denies reimbursement even if expensive care would be \nrequired if the patient does not participate in the clinical trials.\n  The current rules are clearly impeding research at leading hospitals \naround the country. Needed medical care is being denied to many elderly \npatients. It's time to change the rules and take this step to enhance \nresearch and improve patient care.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nAdvanced Medical Devices Access and Assurance Act of 1995 which would \nensure that seniors can participate in clinical trials that involve \ninvestigational medical devices. It signifies a bipartisan first step \ntoward addressing patient concerns about access to the latest \ntechnologies. It also addresses the medical research community's \nconcerns about its ability to continue clinical trials and keep our \nNation at the forefront of state-of-the-art medicine, and industry's \nconcerns about being forced to ship all of its resources and brainpower \noverseas.\n  Minnesota's patients, researchers, and world-famous medical device \nindustry have a clear stake in both the upcoming Medicare and FDA \nreform debates. Researchers and industry need to know that the \nGovernment will create a favorable environment for innovation, thus \npropelling this country's leadership position into the 21st century. \nAnd, Minnesota's patients need to know that they will have access to \nthe best technologies and the latest treatments and that, when \nappropriate, these will be covered by their health insurance policies.\n  Unfortunately, access to leading-edge technologies and next \ngeneration medical devices for seniors--the population for whom they \nare often most appropriate--has recently been jeopardized by the \nMedicare Program's refusal to pay for them in clinical trials.\n  A next generation device could be a pacemaker that enables a person \nto lead a more normal life than a traditional pacemaker. It could be a \npacemaker that would last longer than an older model and be more \nreliable. Next generation devices are medical devices which are \nundergoing clinical trials, yet which have a precursor device which has \nbeen approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration [FDA] as safe \nand effective. Medical devices--unlike drugs--are continually updated \nand improved incrementally even after they are approved by the FDA.\n  But currently, Medicare just flat-out denies payment for the surgery \nor illness if an investigational device is used. Medicare will pay for \nthe costs associated with the hospital stay and procedure only if the \nsoon-to-be-obsolete device is used and not the newest model. Therefore, \neven though the patient potentially benefits from receiving a modified \nand updated pacemaker and clinical studies are necessary to prove what \nworks and what does not, hospitals and physicians are being forced to \nexclude seniors from clinical trials. Providers and manufacturers would \nrather more their studies to Europe where everybody has health \ninsurance than confront reimbursement practices that discourage \nparticipation in clinical trials. But patients want the leading-edge \ntechnologies available in the United States as quickly as possible.\n  Some may surmise that Medicare has refused to pay for this technology \nbecause of safety concerns. But any next generation device involved in \na clinical trial has already received approval from the FDA to test the \ndevice in humans. During a study of an FDA-approved investigational \ndevice, physicians and hospitals follow strict procedures. Hospitals \nand physicians must have the informed consent of the patient in order \nfor the patient to be eligible to participate in the investigational \ndevice studies. And the manufacturer of the device is prohibited from \npromoting or commercializing the device or charging a price that \nexceeds the amount necessary to recover its costs.\n  So how much would it cost the Medicare Program to pay for the most \nadvanced technologies? Currently, Medicare pays a lump sum for \nsurgeries and hospitalization based on the illness of the patient. If \nyou need a pacemaker and choose to be a part of an FDA-approved \nclinical trial, it shouldn't matter to the Medicare Program whether you \nget the next generation model of the pacemaker or the current model--as \nlong as the FDA has approved the clinical trial and you gave your \ninformed consent to participate. In other words, Medicare should pay \nthe hospital a lump sum based on the illness of the patient regardless \nof which device is used.\n  This legislation provides a commonsense solution that protects \npatient safety, access to high-quality health care, and Federal \ndollars. For the sake of Minnesotans, we must meet these standards \nduring the broader Medicare and FDA reform debates.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 958. A bill to provide for the termination of the Legal Services \nCorporation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               legal services corporation termination act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, with a Federal debt of \n$4,898,068,854,045.71 as of the close of business yesterday, Wednesday, \nJune 21, it is time to ask ourselves a question: Should Congress \ncontinue to force the American taxpayers to provide $400 million every \nyear to pay the salaries of, and to otherwise fund, a cadre of liberal \nlawyers to push their social policies down the throats of local \ngovernments and citizens?\n  I think not--and I suspect most Americans will agree, which is why I \ntoday offer legislation to put an end to Federal funding of the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  North Carolina has been harassed by the LSC for years and, adding \ninsult to injury, LSC attorneys in my State--whose salaries are \nfederally subsidized--are now demanding through the courts that the \nState of North Carolina pay them $320,000 in additional attorney's \nfees.\n  Mr. President, a few details about this specific outrage may be in \norder.\n  In 1975, Legal Services attorneys successfully took on the State of \nNorth Carolina on behalf of applicants enrolled in the Federal Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children and Medicaid programs. And what was \nthe great offense by North Carolina's local Departments of Social \nServices to justify this law suit? In the arrogant judgment of the \nLegal Services lawyers, it was taking the local Departments of Social \nServices too long to process benefits.\n  Since that time, the local Departments of Social Services have done \ntheir best to follow the numerous court-imposed requirements. In the \nmeantime, the Legal Services attorneys have collected--now get this, \nMr. President--an estimated $1 million in attorney's fees from the \nState of North Carolina. But that doesn't satisfy them. On June 14, a \nlittle more than a week ago, the Legal Services attorneys demanded \nanother $320,000 in attorney's fees.\n  So, Mr. President, these Legal Services attorneys are paid with \nFederal funds through the Legal Services Corporation and with State and \nlocal Legal Services agencies to sue the State of North Carolina. In \naddition to the taxpayers' money they receive to dismantle local \ngovernment policies, the Legal Services attorneys are demanding \nadditional money for themselves--out of the pockets of North Carolina's \ntaxpayers.\n  The legislation I introduce today will fix this costly problem--by \nending Federal funding of Legal Services Corporation, which like most \nother social programs spawned in the 1960's, has strayed far from any \nmeaningful purpose and deserves a quiet funeral. [[Page S 8949]] \n  For the record, the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 \nostensibly to provide legal assistance to low-income citizens in civil, \nnoncriminal matters. Its first annual budget, for fiscal year 1976 was \n$92 million. It will cost the taxpayers $400 million in 1995. It does \nnot provide services directly, it makes grants to local agencies which \nin turn are charged with providing legal services to those who can't \nafford a lawyer--low-income individuals, migrants and immigrants, and \nminorities.\n  Mr. President, it is precisely these local agencies throughout the \ncountry which, instead of carrying out the mission of providing legal \nassistance to those who can't afford it, have promoted a liberal public \npolicy and propaganda mechanism. It\n has unmercifully harassed law-abiding citizens and has imposed \ncountless dollars in litigation costs upon hapless small businessmen, \nfarmers, and so forth.\n\n  Another example from North Carolina:\n  The Department of Labor, in conjunction with local legal services \nagencies, has done its best to dismantle the H-2A Immigrant Farm Labor \nProgram--a Federal program allowing small farmers to employ temporary \nimmigrant workers for seasonal harvests. Since North Carolina's farmers \nhave had difficulty finding citizens to work on their farms, this \nprogram is a must for the survival of many of these small farms.\n  There is no other reason for the local legal service agency to harass \nNorth Carolina's farmers beyond furthering the protection and rights of \nimmigrants brought in to work.\n  Mr. President, the North Carolina Growers Association is today mired \nin a legal battle to protect the rights of farmers to participate in a \nprogram designed by Congress to assist farming production. The irony is \nthat the American taxpayer is forced to fund the LSC and its liberal \nassault on law-abiding citizens, North Carolina's farmers included.\n  Of course, the LSC has not limited its activities to bullying \ncitizens. The corporation has set its sights on changing State laws \nthrough litigation and direct lobbying as well as tearing apart \nprograms designed to help the poor and needy.\n  For example, as the Heritage Foundation notes in its publication \n``Rolling Back Government: A budget plan to rebuild America,'' the LSC \nrecently filed a lawsuit in New Jersey challenging that State's welfare \nreform initiatives. In New York City, the LSC filed suit against HELP, \na proven nonprofit organization that assists the homeless. The LSC has \neven pursued cases to provide free public education for illegal aliens. \nThe Heritage Foundation report concludes, ``rather than helping the \npoor settle landlord disputes, wills, and other common legal problems, \nthe LSC increasingly is concerned with public policy.''\n  Perhaps William Mellor, president of the Washington-based Institute \nfor Justice, said it best in his February 1, 1995, editorial, ``Want \nWelfare Reform? First Fight Legal Services Corporation.'' Mr. Mellor \nwrites:\n\n       Instead of just helping the poor with problems such as \n     child support and rent disputes, LSC lawyers have worked for \n     years to get the courts to enshrine a constitutional right to \n     welfare.\n\n  Mr. President, is this the kind of arrogant absurdity that was \nintended for LSC? Why should the U.S. Congress be concerned with--as \ncandidate Bill Clinton put it--``changing welfare as we know it,'' when \nthe taxpayers are required to pay lawyers to convince the Federal \ncourts to make welfare a constitutional right?\n  The American people in the 1994 election emphatically stated that \ngovernment is running their lives. There is far more waste in \ngovernment than the American people should be forced to pay for.\n  Congress, for a half century, has been wasting billions of dollars, \nrunning up a Federal debt of about $4.9 trillion. Fortunately, for the \nAmerican people, the House of Representatives has proposed eliminating \nfunding for the Legal Services Corporation, the cost of which has \nexploded from $92 million in fiscal year 1976 to $400 million in fiscal \nyear 1995. And according to the Heritage Foundation, despite this large \nbudget and tremendous growth, only 4 percent of the Nation's poor \ndirectly benefited from the LSC in 1993.\n  So, Mr. President, the legislation I offer today, to eliminate \nFederal funding of the Legal Services Corporation, is long past due. \nWhile saving the taxpayers millions of dollars, my bill will end the \nforced sponsorship by the U.S. taxpayers of an agency the purpose and \nmission of which was laid aside and forgotten long ago in its rush to \npromote a leftwing social agenda. It's time for the Legal Services \nCorporation to be discarded--forever.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 959. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage capital formation through reductions in taxes on capital \ngains, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  capital gains formation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Faircloth, I rise today to introduce the Capital Gains \nFormation Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, reducing the high rate on capital gains has long been \na priority of mine. Earlier this year, I joined my good friend, the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer, in \nintroducing the Archer-Hatch capital gains bill in Congress. In the \nSenate, this was S. 182. A modified version of this bill was passed by \nthe House in April.\n  Now that the Congress is on the verge of passing a budget resolution \nthat will almost certainly allow for some tax reductions, Senator \nLieberman and I concluded that it is now the right time to introduce a \nbipartisan capital gains tax reduction bill that will contribute to \neconomic growth and job creation. We are exceptionally pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senator Faircloth.\n  Our bill combines the best elements of the House-passed capital gains \nbill with a targeted incentive to give an extra push for newly formed \nor expanding small businesses. Like the capital gains measure the House \npassed in April, our bill would allow individual taxpayers to deduct 50 \npercent of any net capital gain. This means that the top capital gains \ntax rate for individuals would be 19.8 percent. Also like the House \nbill, it grants a 25-percent maximum capital gains tax rate for \ncorporations. Our bill also includes the important provision of the \nHouse-passed bill that would allow homeowners who sell their personal \nresidences at a loss to take a capital gains deduction.\n  Unlike the House measure, however, the bill we are introducing today \ndoes not include provisions for indexing assets. Many of our Senate \ncolleagues have expressed concern that indexing capital assets would \nresults in undue complexity and possibly lead to a resurgence of tax \nshelters. While I support the concept of indexing capital assets to \nprevent the taxation of inflationary gains, we felt it important to \nstreamline this bill to ease its passage in the Senate. I hope that \nsome form of indexing can be developed, perhaps by a Senate-House \nconference committee, that will achieve the goals of indexing without \nadding undue complexity, or the potential for abuse, to the code.\n  In addition to the broad-based provisions listed above, our bill also \nincludes some extra capital gains incentives targeted to individuals \nand corporations who are willing to invest in small businesses. We see \nthis add-on as an inducement for investors to provide the capital \nneeded to help small businesses get established and to expand.\n  Mr. President, this additional targeted incentive works as follows: \nIf an investor buys newly issued stock of a qualified small business, \nwhich is defined as one with up to $100 million in assets, and holds \nthat stock for 5 or more years, he or she can deduct 75 percent of the \ngain on the sale of that stock, rather than just the 50 percent \ndeduction provided for other capital gains.\n  In addition, anytime after the end of the 5-year period, if the \ninvestor decides to sell the stock of one qualified small business and \ninvest in another qualified small business, he or she can completely \ndefer the gain on the sale of the first stock and not pay taxes on the \ngain until the second stock is sold. In essence, the investor is \nallowed to roll over the gain into the new stock until he or she sells \nthe stock and keeps the money. We think that this additional [[Page S \n8950]] incentive will make a tremendous amount of capital available for \nnew and expanding small businesses in this country.\n  Let me just add, Mr. President, that these special incentives should \nreally make a difference in the electronics, biotechnology, and other \nhigh-technology industries that are so important to our economy and to \nour future. The software and medical device industries in Utah are \nperfect examples of how these industries have transformed our economy. \nWhile these provisions are not limited to high-tech companies by any \nmeans, these are the types of businesses that are most likely to use \nthem because it is so hard to attract capital for these higher risk \nventures.\n  Our economy is becoming more connected to the global marketplace \nevery day. And, it is vital for us to realize that capital flows across \nnational boundaries these days at the speed of light. Therefore, we \nneed to be concerned with how our trading partners tax capital.\n  Unfortunately, the United States has the highest rate on individual \ncapital gains of all of the G-7 nations, except the United Kingdom. \nAnd, even in the United Kingdom, individuals can take advantage of \nindexing to alleviate capital gains caused solely by inflation. Germany \ntotally exempts long-term capital gains on securities. In Japan, \ninvestors pay the lesser of 1 percent of the sales price or 20 percent \nof the net gain. I think it is no coincidence, Mr. President, that \nGermany's saving rate is twice ours and Japan's is three times as high \nas ours. In order to stay competitive in the world, it is vital that \nour tax laws provide the proper incentive to attract the capital we \nneed here in the United States.\n  We are aware that some of the opponents of capital gains tax \nreductions have asserted that such changes would inordinately benefit \nthe wealthy, leaving little or no tax relief for the lower- and middle-\nincome classes. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, \ncapital gains taxation affects every homeowner, every employee who \nparticipates in a stock purchase plan, or every senior citizen who \nrelies on income from mutual funds for their basic needs during \nretirement.\n  The current law treatment of capital gains only gives preferential \ntreatment to those taxpayers who incomes lie in the highest tax \nbrackets. Under the Capital Formation Act of 1995, the benefits will \ntilt decidedly toward the middle-income taxpayer. A married couple with \n$39,000 in taxable income who sells a capital asset would, under our \nbill, pay only a 7.5 percent tax on the capital gain. Further, this \nbill\n would slash the taxes retired seniors pay when they sell the assets \nthey have accumulated for income during retirement.\n\n  I also believe there is a misperception about the term ``capital \nasset.'' We tend to think of capital assets as something only wealthy \npersons have. In fact, a capital asset is a savings account--which we \nshould all have--a piece of land, a savings bond, some stock your \ngrandmother bought you, your house, your farm, your 1964 Mustang \nconvertible, or any number of things that have monetary worth. It is \nmisleading to imply that only the wealthy would benefit from this bill.\n  I want to elaborate on this point, Mr. President. Current law already \nprovides a sizeable differential between ordinary income tax rates and \ncapital gains tax rates for upper income taxpayers. The wealthiest \namong us pay up to 39.6 percent on ordinary income but only 28 percent \non capital gains. We certainly feel that this 28 percent is too high. \nBut, my point is that taxpayers in the lower bracket of 28 percent and \nthe lowest bracket of 15 percent enjoy no difference between their \ncapital gains rate and their ordinary income rate. Our bill would \ncorrect this problem and give the largest percentage rate reduction to \nthe lowest income taxpayers.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the introduction of a bipartisan capital \ngains bill couldn't come at a better time than now. There are currently \nsome indications that our economy is slowing down. In fact, some \nexperts feel we may be on the verge of a mild recession. Such a concern \nis always important, but right now, it is critical. Congress is in the \nmidst of formulating a 7-year plan to balance the Federal budget. The \nelements of this plan will have consequences far beyond this year or \neven beyond 2002 when we hope to achieve our goal.\n  Crucial to the achievement of a balanced budget is the underlying \ngrowth and strength of our economy. Small changes in the behavior of \nthe economy can make or break our ability to put our fiscal house in \norder. Thus, especially right now, we can ill afford to have our \neconomy slow down. Such a recession could make it impossible for us to \nbalance the budget. With recession comes the fear of future job \ninsecurity. Both Republicans and Democrats alike can agree that the \ncreation of new and secure jobs is imperative for a vibrant and growing \neconomy.\n  This is where a reduction of the capital gains rate can be so \nimportant. By stimulating the economy and spurring job creation, a cut \nin the capital gains rate can stave off the downturn that appears to be \non its way.\n  This is not just our opinion. Senator Lieberman and I received a \nletter yesterday from Allen Sinai, a well-known and respected \nmainstream economist. In his letter, Dr. Sinai concludes that ``The \nenactment of this bipartisan Senate bill* * *could well help offset \nforces contributing to the current cooling of the U.S. economy.''\n  Many Americans have expressed concern about the wisdom of a tax \nreduction while we are trying to balance the budget. However, Mr. \nPresident, we see this bill as a change that will help us balance the \nbudget. The evidence clearly shows that a cut in the capital gains tax \nrate will increase, not decrease, revenue to the Treasury. During the \nperiod from 1978 to 1985, the tax rate on capital gains was cut from \nalmost 50 percent to 20 percent. Over this same period, however, tax \nreceipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion. The opposite \noccurred after the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital gains tax \nrate. The higher rate resulted in less revenue.\n  Mr. President, the capital gains tax is really a tax on realizing the \nAmerican dream. For those Americans who have planted seeds in savings \naccounts, small or large companies, family farms, or other investments, \nand who have been fortunate enough and worked hard enough to see them \ngrow, the capital gains tax is a tax on success. It is an additional \ntax on the reward for taking risks. The American dream is not dead; \nit's just that we have been taxing it away.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a close look \nat this bill. We believe it offers a solid plan to help us achieve our \ngoal of a brighter future for our children and grandchildren. When it \ncomes down to it, jobs, economic growth, and entrepreneurship are not \npartisan issues. They are American issues. This bill will help us get \nthere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Broad-Based Tax Relief (similar to provisions in House-passed H.R. \n                                 1215):\n\n       (1) Individual taxpayers would be allowed a deduction of 50 \n     percent of any net capital gain. The top effective tax rate \n     on capital gains would thus be 19.8 percent.\n       (2) Corporations would be subject to a maximum capital \n     gains tax rate of 25 percent.\n       (3) Capital loss treatment would be allowed with respect to \n     the sale of a taxpayer's principal residence.\n       (4) Indexing of capital assets would not be included.\n       (5) Would be effective for taxable years ending after \n     December 31, 1994.\n\n\n     II Targeted Incentive to Invest in Small Business Enterprises:\n\n       (1) Provides an exclusion of 75 percent of capital gains \n     from sale of investment in qualified small business stock \n     held for more than five years.\n       (2) Allows 100 percent deferral of capital gains tax, after \n     the five year period, if proceeds from the sale of qualified \n     small business stock are rolled over within 60 days into \n     another qualified small business stock. Gains accrued after \n     the rollover would qualify for a 50 percent deduction if held \n     for more than one year, 75 percent exclusion if held for more \n     than another five years, or at any time, could be rolled over \n     yet again into another qualified small business stock for 100 \n     percent deferral.\n       (3) Would be effective upon date of enactment.\n       Example: A taxpayer buys qualified small business stock in \n     1996 for $10,000. She sells the stock in 2002 for $20,000. \n     She would be allowed to exclude 75 percent of the gain, or \n     $7,500. Of, if she chose to roll over the $20,000 proceeds \n     from the sale into another qualified small business stock \n     within 60 days, she would defer all tax until she ultimately \n     sold the second stock.\n       Qualified small business stock is defined as newly issued \n     stock of corporations with up to $100 million in assets and \n     is an expansion of the current law targeted small business \n     capital gains exclusion added by the 1993 tax act. The \n     changes in the targeted small business stock incentive from \n     current law would:\n       (1) Allow corporations to participate.\n       (2) Remove the current law per-issuer limitation.\n       (3) Repeal the working capital limitation.\n       (4) Expand the list of qualified businesses in which the \n     corporation may engage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Lehman Brothers,\n\n                                                    June 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Lieberman: The Hatch-Lieberman \n     Capital Gains Tax Reduction Proposal would have positive \n     impacts on U.S. economic growth, employment and investment. \n     The enactment of this bipartisan Senate bill, whose main \n     features include a 50 percent exclusion for individual \n     capital gains (a top marginal rate of 19.8 percent), a 25 \n     percent maximum capital gains rate for corporations, and \n     expansion of the current 50 percent exclusion for small \n     business capital stock to 75 percent, as well as other small \n     business provisions, could well help offset forces \n     contributing to the current cooling of the U.S. economy.\n       Indexing capital gains, not included in the Hatch-Lieberman \n     proposal, also would help stimulate economic activity and has \n     the positive dimension of eliminating the distortion from the \n     taxation of illusory gains that come from inflation. It would \n     also be good to have. But of the two measures, capital gains \n     rate reduction and indexing under limitations set by the very \n     important first priority of moving the federal budget into \n     balance, the rate reductions and small business provisions \n     provide more ``bang-for-a-buck''.\n       A stronger economy would be stimulated by the lower cost of \n     capital from a reduction in capital gains taxes, also \n     business and personal saving would rise, and more business \n     capital spending occur. This would come about, in part, from \n     increased stock prices and higher household net worth as \n     investors shifted funds away from other investments into \n     stocks. The stronger economy would lead to increased hiring \n     and new jobs. Wealth, income and profits improvement would \n     raise spending, saving, and purchases of financial assets.\n       With a stronger economy and increased capital formation, \n     greater entrepreneurship, as measured by new business \n     incorporations, ought to raise productivity and thus the \n     potential output of this economy. This supply-side effect, \n     although modest, would tend to limit any potential \n     inflationary effect of the capital gains tax reductions. In \n     addition, an unlocking effect on tax receipts from the \n     unrealized capital gains that would be realized ought to \n     reduce the ex-post cost of this tax measure.\n       Of all the tax reductions being considered by the Congress, \n     the most beneficial, in a balanced way, to both the demand-\n     side and supply-sides of the economy, potentially at the \n     least net cost, would be the capital gains tax rate \n     reductions that are proposed.\n       On several criteria for judging changes in taxes--\n     allocative efficiency, economic growth, savings and \n     investment, international competition and fairness--capital \n     gains tax reduction wins on almost all. The one exception is \n     equity, because higher income families tend to hold \n     proportionately more of the assets that could be subject to \n     capital gains.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Allen Sinai.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted and proud to join \nSenator Hatch in this bipartisan introduction of the Capital Formation \nAct of 1995. As a Democrat, I have often borrowed Paul Tsongas' line \nthat you can't be pro-jobs and anti-business, because the jobs we want \nfor people are going to come from business. The bill we are introducing \ntoday is pro-jobs and pro-business. It gives people at all income \nlevels a reason to put their money in places where that money will help \nbusinesses start and grow and that means more jobs for Americans and \nmore economic prosperity for our country.\n  We are introducing this bill at a time when the American economy may \nbe on the verge of recession. There are those who say we are already in \na recession. One of the most effective things Congress can do to give \nour economy a boost is to cut the capital gains tax rate.\n  We also have a shortage of savings and investment in this country. \nOur personal savings rate is now about one-third of Japan's rate and \nabout one-half of Germany's rate. We are ill prepared to deal with the \neffects of recession, and we are ill prepared for the economic battles \nof the global marketplace. Unlike most other industrialized nations, we \nstifle savings and investment by over-taxing it. Nations like Japan and \nGermany value capital gains. Germany exempts long-term capital gains \nfrom taxes for individuals and Japan taxes these gains at either 1 \npercent of the sales price or 20 percent of the net gain. They reward \ninvestment.\n  Not only have we done too little to encourage investment, too often \nit is actively discouraged. To attack capital gains tax relief as a \nbonanza for the wealthy is quite simply missing the point.\n  The benefits of this capital gains tax cut will not flow just to \npeople of wealth. Anyone who has stock, who has money invested in a \nmutual fund, who has investment property, who has a stock option plan \nat work has a stake in capital gains tax relief. That represents \nmillions and millions of middle class American families. We have \ninformation on 310 major firms that offer their employees stock options \nand stock purchase plans--companies like GTE, Pfizer and Stanley Works, \nto name a few of the companies in my State.\n  Each of those workers and their spouses and children stand to gain \nfrom what we propose today. And these firms are just the tip of the \niceberg.\n  And we're talking about direct beneficiaries--not even counting the \nmany middle and lower income people who will get and keep jobs thanks \nto the investments spurred by the capital gains tax cut.\n  Of course, people who are wealthy can benefit from this proposed \ncapital gains cut, but that is the point. They will benefit if they \ninvest more of their money in ways that help our economy and create \njobs. That benefits everyone. Government doesn't make people rich. But \nGovernment can and should encourage people who have money to use that \nmoney in a way that helps the economy as a whole. That is what this is \nabout. We are simply talking about letting people who are willing to \nrisk their money keep a little bit more of it if they invest that money \nin our economy.\n  People who oppose cutting the capital gains tax are treating profit \nas if it were to be avoided. I believe that we should recognize profit \nas being an advantage of the free market, and we want to encourage it, \nreward it, help it spread its benefits throughout the [[Page S \n8954]] economy to more and more of our people. Opponents also frame \nthis debate in a winners-and-losers context that is totally \ninappropriate to what is at stake here. Because a rising tide of \neconomic growth raises all ships, there need be no losers when capital \ngains taxes are cut by our bill.\n  Finally, let me point out that this capital gains tax is broad but it \nalso has a targeted element. It aims at directing investment in a way \nthat maximizes the benefit for our economy. It promotes investment in \nsmall businesses--the firms that are driving job creation in our \neconomy. It encourages people to leave their investments in small \nbusinesses, start-up businesses for a longer period of time, giving \nentrepreneurs the kind of predictable cash flow they need to make their \nbusinesses succeed.\n  The targeted feature of our capital gains tax cut will be very \nhelpful to the kinds of small businesses we need for our future--the \nhigh technology businesses that will be the source of many new jobs in \nthe next century, and that will be the source of our success in global \nmarkets. These businesses are high risk. They require a lot of capital \ninvestment early on. The payoff is down the road. And the benefits for \nAmerica are, potentially, enormous. Not just jobs and profits for \nAmericans. But exciting new technological innovations. New ways to \neducate our children. New medicines and medical devices. New services, \nand new opportunities for recreation. All these positive changes need \nthe kind of investment our Capital Formation Act will encourage.\n  In closing, let me say that I see this bill as the first leg of a \ntripod of tax relief for the American people. The second leg is the \nPresident's tax credit for children and tax deduction for higher \neducation costs, which I support.\n  The third leg will be a research and development tax credit that is \nbeing developed now and I hope will be introduced in the near future.\n  With these tax proposals, we can help more Americans raise their kids \ntoday, educate them tomorrow, and provide them with good job \nopportunities in thriving American businesses in the future.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senators Hatch \nand Lieberman to introduce the Capital Formation Act of 1995. This \nbipartisan effort sends a clear signal that there is broad-based \nsupport for a capital gains tax cut to stimulate job creation, foster \nsound economic growth, and enhance U.S. international competitiveness.\n  Prior to my election to the Senate, I spent 45 years in the private \nsector running a small business and meeting a payroll. I learned \nfirsthand that a cut in the capital gains tax rate would stimulate the \nrelease of billions of dollars of unproductive capital, unlock economic \nassets, and encourage new investment by both mature and new businesses. \nMoreover, a reduction in capital gains taxes would have a powerful \nimpact on the entrepreneurial segment of the economy, thereby creating \nnew start-up companies and new jobs.\n  I commend Senators Hatch and Lieberman for working together to craft \na bipartisan capital gains tax cut proposal. I am proud to be the first \ncosponsor of this bill, and I sincerely hope that many of our \ncolleagues--Democrats and Republicans--will join this important effort \nto provide much needed tax relief and encourage further economic \ngrowth.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8945-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 400\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Hatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 400, a bill to provide for \nappropriate remedies for prison conditions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 401\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 401, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the excise tax \ntreatment of hard apple cider.\n\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton] and the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 495, a bill to amend the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 to stabilize the student loan programs, improve congressional \noversight, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 593\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Mack] was added as a cosponsor of S. 593, a bill to amend the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize the export of new \ndrugs and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 854\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 854, a bill \nto amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to improve the agricultural \nresources conservation program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 896\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the names of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Pell], the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], \nthe Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], and the Senator from Texas \n[Mrs. Hutchison] were added as cosponsors of S. 896, a bill to amend \ntitle XIX of the Social Security Act to make certain technical \ncorrections relating to physicians' services, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 85\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 85, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate that obstetrician-\ngynecologists should be included in Federal laws relating to the \nprovision of health care.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 103\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Heflin], the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], and the \nSenator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] were added as cosponsors of Senate \nResolution 103, a resolution to proclaim the week of October 15 through \nOctober 21, 1995, as National Character Counts Week, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8954-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8954-S8956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n          THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        EXON AMENDMENT NO. 1462\n\n  Mr. EXON proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 440) to amend title \n23, United States Code, to provide for the designation of the National \nHighway System, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 301.

The limitation imposed by the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall remain in effect until \n     the State demonstrates compliance with the requirements of \n     this section.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \nset forth the reasoning behind a number of my votes with respect to S. \n652, the telecommunications bill. Although S. 652 would not deregulate \nthe telecommunications industry as much or as quickly as I would like, \nit eventually would lead to competition in a number of \ntelecommunications markets that currently are monopolistic. \nSpecifically, the bill would remove artificial barriers to competition \nin the phone services markets as well as in the cable, equipment \nmanufacturing, and other markets. I, therefore, supported final passage \nof S. 652.\n  Much of the debate concerning the bill focused on the issue of RBOC \nentry into the long-distance market. An amendment offered by Senator \nMcCain, No. 1261, would have defined the term ``public interest'' as it \nrelates to the FCC's decision as to whether to allow a Bell to enter \nthe long-distance market. The bill as introduced did not define that \nterm. I voted for the McCain amendment because the absence of such a \ndefinition would give the FCC virtually absolute discretion as to \nwhether a Bell can enter the long-distance market--or, put differently, \nas to whether consumers will enjoy the benefits of full competition in \nthat market.\n  The Senate's rejection of McCain amendment No. 1261 was part of the \nreason for my vote against the Dorgan-Thurmond amendment, No. 1265. The \nDorgan-Thurmond amendment would have added yet another layer of \nregulatory obstacles to the RBOC's entry into the long-distance market. \nThe bill already would have required a Bell to satisfy an extensive \ncompetitive checklist and to secure the FCC's public interest \ndetermination before entering the long-distance market; and even then, \nthe Bell could enter that market only through a separate subsidiary. \nMoreover, the bill would for the first time allow utility and cable \ncompanies to compete for the Bells' local customers, thereby further \nreducing the Bells' ability to subsidize predatory pricing in the long-\ndistance market by raising the prices paid by local customers. Thus, \nthe Dorgan-Thurmond amendment, by requiring the Bells additionally to \nsecure the approval of the Department of Justice before entering the \nlong-distance market, would only delay unnecessarily the arrival of \nfull competition in that market. To paraphrase Holmes, three layers of \nregulatory obstacles is enough.\n  From the outset of the Senate's consideration of S. 652, I was \nconcerned that the bill might mandate discounted telecommunications \nrates for selected groups. The cost of such mandatory discounts is \ninevitably passed on to customers whose rates are not set by Congress, \nand thus often falls, at least in part, on poorer customers who cannot \nmuster the lobbying clout necessary to secure special treatment. \nMoreover, apart from the equities of the issue, I think Government \nexceeds its legitimate role when it sets special telecommunications \nrates for favored groups. I, therefore, supported McCain amendment No. \n1262, which would have struck bill language, contained in section 310, \nthat would force telecommunications providers to provide their services \nto schools and hospitals at discounted rates. After the Senate rejected \namendment 1262, I voted for another McCain amendment, No. 1285, that at \nleast would subject section 310 to means testing. The amendment passed.\n  Finally, I want to set forth in detail my reasons for supporting \nMcCain amendment No. 1276. This amendment would jettison our current \ncrazy-quilt of universal-service subsidies, in favor of a means tested \nvoucher system. The universal-service subsidies and rate-averaging \nschemes currently in place have as their principal effect the \nperpetuation of telephone service monopolies in rural areas. These \nschemes exclude competitors from rural telephone service markets in two \nways. First, by keeping rural rates artificially low, rate averaging \nreduces if not eliminates the incentive of would-be competitors to \nenter the rural services market. Second, the subsidization of existing \nproviders effectively bars the entry into those markets of competitors \nwho would not be similarly subsidized. In contrast, a voucher system \nwould not distort market signals or suppress competition in the markets \nwhose customers it seeks to help. Thus, the need-based voucher system \ndescribed in the McCain amendment would be vastly preferable to the \ncurrent and proposed cost-based schemes, which make the inner-city poor \npay higher phone rates so that customers in remote areas, including \nwealthy resort areas, can enjoy lower rates.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8957-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8957-S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE ABOLITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the new Government of South \nAfrica has just abolished the death penalty.\n  As we all know, South Africa has undergone incredible changes in the \nlast 2 years. They have achieved nothing short of a revolution--\npeacefully, via the ballot box. They have abolished apartheid and \nrebuilt their government and institutions to reflect real majority \nrule. The American people can take pride in the fact that American \nleadership in imposing international sanctions played a significant \nrole in making this negotiated revolution possible, and the Government \nof Nelson Mandela a reality.\n  South Africa has looked to the United States as a model as it creates \nits institutions of government. I recently met with member of \nParliament Johnny DeLange, chairman of the equivalent of our Judiciary \nCommittee in the South African Parliament, who was in the United States \nto study how Congress and the Justice Department interact. Likewise, \nthe new Constitutional Court, the equivalent of the Supreme Court, has \nlooked to American jurisprudence for guidance in a variety of areas of \nthe law.\n  As a lawyer and a Senator, I take pride in the fact that South Africa \nis looking to our legal system and our body of laws as a model. But in \nthe case of the death penalty, after thoroughly examining its practice \nin the United States, the 11 justices of the [[Page S \n8958]] Constitutional Court of South Africa unanimously concluded the \ndeath penalty is cruel and unusual punishment subject to elements of \narbitrariness and the possibility of error.\n  The case before the Constitutional Court, Makwanyane and McHunu \nversus State, stemmed from an intra-family murder-for-hire which \noccurred in July 1987. Five people died when their hut was set on fire. \nBoth men who carried out the attack and the man who hired them were \nconvicted of murder and sentenced to death. The issues raised before \nthe court concerned not the facts of the crime, but rather the \nconstitutionality of the death penalty. Attorneys for the defendants \ncited the long history of racial discrimination and the arbitrary \napplication of the death penalty in the United States as grounds for \noutlawing this ultimate punishment. The South African court heard that \nthe United States practice of leaving capital punishment to the \ndiscretion of the judge and jury opens the door to the inevitable \ninfluences of race, poverty, and the quality of representation.\n  In effect, the South African court came to the same conclusion as \nformer United States Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, who \nconcluded that the death penalty experiment has failed. Although \nBlackmun repeatedly voted to uphold capital punishment in the belief \nthat the law could be channeled to guarantee its fair application, he \nultimately decided that he could no longer ``Tinker with the machinery \nof death.''\n  South Africa had a history of applying the death penalty in an even \nmore arbitrary fashion than the United States. Until the use of the \ndeath penalty was suspended in February 1990, South Africa had one of \nthe highest rates of judicial executions in the world. The previous \ngovernment executed 1,217 people between 1980 and 1989. And, as in the \nUnited States, it was much more common for a black defendant to be \nsentenced to death than a white defendant. In 1988, 47 percent of black \ndefendants convicted of murdering whites were sentenced to death; 2.5 \npercent of blacks convicted of murdering other blacks were sentenced to \ndeath; while no whites convicted of killing blacks were given the death \npenalty.\n  I want to emphasize that the abolition of the death penalty will not \nresult in impunity for those who commit the most heinous of crimes. But \nSouth Africa concluded that even in the country they looked to for \nguidance, the United States, the death sentence had not been shown to \nbe materially more effective at deterring or preventing murder than the \nalternative sentence of life imprisonment.\n  The Government of South Africa has come to the decision that the \nrecognition of the right to life and dignity is incompatible with the \ndeath penalty. I applaud them for it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8957-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    MAJ.

Posted to I Corps \nAdvisory Group, Military Assistance Command Vietnam, he served as order \nof battle advisor and sector intelligence advisor, and then returned \nfrom Vietnam to serve as security officer for the Defense Language \nInstitute in Monterey, CA.\n  After leaving active military duty in 1971, Major General de la \nVergne was assigned to the 6211th U.S. Army Garrison, Presidio of San \nFrancisco, where he served as inspector general, S-1, comptroller, and \ndeputy commander before leaving to assume command of the 2d Battalion, \n363d Regiment, 4th Brigade, 91st Division, training; Returning to the \n6211th in 1981, he served as the garrison commander for 3 years before \nleaving for the 124th ARCOM, where he served as deputy chief of staff, \nresource management, as deputy chief of staff, operations, and then as \nchief of staff and deputy commander prior to his current assignment as \ncommanding general.\n  Major General de la Vergne is a graduate of the Command and General \nStaff College and the Army War College, and he has completed courses at \nthe Intelligence School, the Defense Language Institute, the Industrial \nCollege of the Armed Forces, the Inspector General School, the U.S. \nArmy Institute for Administration and the Army Logistics Management \nCenter.\n  His decorations include the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service \nMedal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air Medal, the Joint Service \nCommendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf \nClusters, the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Bronze Star \nand the Republic of Vietnam Honor Medal First Class.\n  Time and time again, the general has proven his mettle and displayed \nmost excellent leadership. To quote from the citation for his \nDistinguished Service Medal, which will be awarded on the occasion of \nhis official change of command ceremony on June 25, 1995:\n\n       . . . for exceptionally meritorious service of great \n     responsibility:\n       Major General David P. de la Vergne distinguished himself \n     by exceptionally meritorious service in successive positions \n     of great responsibility from 15 March 1988 to 27 March 1995. \n     In all assignments, General de la Vergne displayed unexcelled \n     leadership and absolute dedication. As Chief of Staff and \n     later Deputy Commander, 124th United States Army Reserve \n     Command (ARCOM), Fort Lawton, Washington, he displayed \n     exceptional vision, skill, and tenacity in the management and \n     direction of major Army activities. Culminating his \n     distinguished service as Commander of the 124th ARCOM, \n     General de la Vergne took immediate steps to provide the \n     ARCOM with a positive image of its leaders and mission. \n     General de la Vergne's energetic approach for improvement in \n     training, logistics, and recruiting resulted in the molding \n     of a mission-capable unit. His dynamic leadership and unique \n     managerial abilities were instrumental in achieving \n     significant improvements in the readiness posture of the \n     124th ARCOM elements. This was most evident during the \n     mobilization of nine units to support Operation DESERT SHIELD \n     and Operation DESERT STORM. Major General de la Vergne's \n     unswerving dedication, outstanding service, professional \n     skill, and superb leadership reflect great credit upon him, \n     the United States Army Reserve and the United States Army.''\n\n  I want to thank Major General de la Vergne for his many years of \nservice to this country, and I wish him and his wife, Elinor, all the \nbest.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8958-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF DISTINGUISHED ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY YOUTH\n\n   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of \npride and satisfaction that I commend to your attention a number of \nyoung adults from Anne Arundel County. These outstanding individuals \nare listed below, and they are outstanding because of their character, \ntheir academic achievements, and their contributions to their home \ncommunities.\n  Three years ago, an organization was formed in Anne Arundel County by \none of my college classmates, Dr. Orlie Reid. He and other caring \nindividuals gathered together to discuss what could be done to \nencourage our youth to perform at their highest levels and to be \ncommunity minded, to reinforce the positive and discourage the \nnegative. The Concerned Black Males of Annapolis has done just that \nsince its inception in 1992.\n  On Monday, June 26, 1995, CBM is recognizing 88 young men and women \nat its first annual awards dinner. These students were nominated by \nchurch, school and community leaders. I extend my heartiest \ncongratulations to them all for their efforts, and to the organizers of \nthe Awards Dinner and the founders of Concerned Black Males of \nAnnapolis. A concerned community working with youth sets a fine \nexample, and CBM has proven over the years that it works. My best to \nall of them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8958-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8958-S8959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the White House Conference on Small \nBusiness [[Page S 8959]] met earlier this month to consider issues of \nconcern to small business men and women around the country, and to make \nrecommendations to this Congress about what it can do to make Federal \npolicy more responsive to small business's needs.\n  The men and women who attended the conference represent a vital \neconomic force in the country. There are more than 20 million small \nbusinesses in the United States, and they represent the fastest growing \nsector of the economy. Small businesses provided all of the net new \njobs created between 1987 and 1992. They employed 54 percent of the \nprivate work force in 1990. Small businesses provide two of every three \nnew workers with their first job. Small businesses contributed 40 \npercent of the Nation's new high-technology jobs during the past \ndecade. Together, they truly represent the engine that drives our \nNation's economy.\n  So when small business leaders speak out on issues of concern, it \nwould behoove the members of the Senate and the House to listen. These \nsmall business people are the innovators and the job creators. They are \nthe ones on the front lines who have to wade through government rules \nand regulations every day, pay the taxes, and still find a way to \ncompete in domestic and international markets.\n  If we are interested in economic growth and opportunity in this \ncountry--if we want an economy that is healthy and creating new jobs, \nand can compete around the world--we ought to take note of what small \nbusinessmen and women have to tell us.\n  And, Mr. President, this is what the delegates to the White House \nConference had to say--these are the top-ten vote-getting resolutions \napproved by the Conference:\n  No. 1: Clarify the definition of independent contractor for tax \npurposes--1,471 votes. The Conference called on Congress to recognize \nthe legitimacy of an independent contractor; to develop more realistic \nand consistent guidelines for IRS auditors, courts, employers and State \nagencies to follow.\n  No. 2: Permit a 100 percent deduction for business meal and \nentertainment expenses--1,444 votes. Small businesses typically rely on \nclose personal relationships and customer service to compete for sales, \nrather than expensive advertising campaigns. Expenditures for meals and \nentertainment are often an important part of that effort.\n  No. 3: Strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act--1,398 votes. In \naddition to making the act applicable to all Federal agencies, the \nConference recommended that cost-benefit analyses, scientific benefit \nanalyses, and risks assessments be required.\n  No. 4: Repeal the Federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping \ntransfer tax laws--1,385 votes. As the members of the Conference noted \nin their resolution, ``the negative effect (of these transfer taxes) on \nsmall business, and others, far exceeds the net income to the \nGovernment when all administrative costs to individuals, businesses, \nand government are considered.''\n  No. 5: Reform the Superfund law--1,371 votes. Delegates recommended \nthe elimination of retroactive and strict liability prior to 1987, and \ncalled for sound science, realistic risk assessments, and cost-benefit \nanalyses in assessing health and environmental hazards.\n  Mr. President, we ought to act promptly on all of these issues; bring \nthem to the floor, debate them and vote on each of them at the earliest \ndate practicable. I wanted to begin today, however, by speaking about \none of the top five resolutions in particular, the one that received \nthe fourth highest number of votes, a resolution that endorsed the \nFamily Heritage Preservation Act, S. 628.\n  I introduced that measure earlier this year with the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Helms. Representative Chris Cox \nintroduced the companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  The Federal estate tax is actually one of the most wasteful and \nunfair taxes on the books today, and it is no wonder that small \nbusiness leaders are urging its repeal. By confiscating up to 55 \npercent of a family's after-tax savings, it penalizes people for a \nlifetime of hard work, savings, and investment. It hurts small business \nand costs jobs. The result is that people spend their time, energy, and \nmoney trying to avoid the tax--for example, by setting up trusts and \nother devices--rather than devoting their resources to more productive \neconomic uses.\n  The estate tax hits small family businesses particularly hard. It \nstrips companies of much-needed capital at the worst possible time--\nunder a change of ownership and oversight following the principle \nowner's death.\n  According to a 1993 survey by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, CT \nresearch and consulting firm--9 out of 10 family businesses that failed \nwithin 3 years of the principal owner's death said that ``trouble \npaying estate taxes'' contributed to their companies' demise. Sixty \npercent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second \ngeneration, and 90 percent do not make it to a third generation.\n  If the Tax Code were revised to eliminate these transfer taxes, small \nbusinesses would have a fighting chance; and the Nation would likely \nexperience significant economic benefits by the year 2000. According to \na report by the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation \n[IRET] ``GDP would be $79.22 billion greater, 228,000 more people would \nbe employed, and the amount of accumulated savings and capital would be \n$630 billion larger than projected under present law'' by the end of \nthe century.\n  Small business leaders recognize how counterproductive the estate tax \nreally is, and that's why they specifically endorsed the Family \nHeritage Preservation Act at the White House Conference. That's why my \nbill is supported by the Small Business Council of America, the Small \nBusiness Survival Committee, Americans for Tax Reform, and the 60 Plus \nAssociation. The National Federation of Independent Business and the \nIndependent Forest Products Association have called for estate tax \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking the delegates to the \nWhite House Conference for their thoughtful, hard work. And, I wanted \nto make special note of the work of Mary Lou Bessette, who chaired the \nArizona State delegation and carried out her responsibilities in an \nexemplary manner. She kept the group focused and on track, and was well \nrespected by its members. Another member of the delegation, Sandy \nAbalos, served as Arizona tax chair. Her hard work and determination \nwere reflected in the successful outcome of the Conference.\n  And finally, I wanted to commend Joy Staveley, who was my appointment \nto the Conference, and who served as environmental chair for the State. \nAll four of her environmental resolutions made it into the top 60 final \nrecommendations to emerge from the Conference session.\n  A job well done to all the members of Arizona's delegation and to all \nthe delegates from around the country. Now it's time for the Senate and \nHouse to act on the good advice from the leaders of the Nation's small \nbusinesses. I invite my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of the \nFamily Heritage Preservation Act, and to begin addressing the other \nrecommendations of the White House Conference as well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8958-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8959-S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE 25TH ANNUAL IRISH HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities, and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ, began \nits 1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. This heritage festival \nprogram salutes many of the different ethnic communities that \ncontribute so greatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old \ncountry customs and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity \nto express pride in the ethnic [[Page S 8960]] backgrounds that are a \npart of our collective heritage. Additionally, the spring heritage \nfestivals will contribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden \nState Arts Center's cultural center fund which presents theater \nproductions free of charge to New Jersey's school children, seniors, \nand other deserving residents. The heritage festival thus not only pays \ntribute to the cultural influences from our past, it also makes a \nsignificant contribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Sunday, June 25, 1995, the heritage festival series will celebrate \nthe 25th annual Irish Heritage Festival. Twenty-five years ago, when \nJohn Gallagherr chaired the very first Irish Heritage Festival, he \ninitiated what has become a grand tradition. This year's celebration, \nchaired by Kathleen Hyland continues this tradition of highlighting \nIrish entertainers, food, and crafts, THe day begins early in the \nmorning with a piping competition and will feature traditional Irish \nsports like hurling and Gaelic football. Additionally, a concelebrated \nliturgy with Msgr. Kevin Flanagan of St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, \nin Parsippany assisted by numerous Irish clergy from throughout New \nJersey, will be offered for lasting peace and justice in Ireland. After \nthe liturgy a noon mall show will feature many gifted Irish \nentertainers including: Daniel O'Donnell, Celtic Cross, Richie O'Shea, \nWillie Lynch, Barley Bree, Mary McGonigle, and Mike Byrne Band. Over \n25,000 people are expected to turnout to eat good food, enjoy \ntraditional music and dance, and to avail themselves of the opportunity \nto pay tribute to their Irish heritage.\n  On behalf of the almost 1 million New Jerseyans of Irish descent, who \ncontribute so much energy and vitality to my great and diverse State, I \noffer my congratulations on the occasion of the 25th annual Irish \nHeritage Festival.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8959-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                CAMBODIA\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief \ncomment today about a recent development in Cambodia which I believe \ndoes not bode well for the emergent democracy in that country. Last \nMonday, June 19, the Cambodian National Assembly expelled the \nrepresentative of northern Siem Reap khet and an outspoken critic of \ncorruption in his country's government, former Finance Minister Sam \nRainsy. The move was to be officially announced today.\n  Cambodia held its first democratic elections in May 1993, under the \nguidance of the U.N. Transitional Authority. The fragile multiparty \ncoalition that emerged, less a result of electoral processes than power \npolitics and accommodations among the different factions, has depended \nfor its survival mainly on the expedient relationship between the co-\nprime ministers: Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the Royalist National \nUnited Front for an Independent Neutral Peaceful and Cooperative \nCambodia [FUNCINPEC] and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. \nSince 1993, outside observers have often characterized the growth of \ndemocracy there as two steps forward, one step back.\n  Mr. President, the expulsion of Rainsy is just one such step \nbackward. Rainsy was a founding member of FUNCINPEC, and was appointed \nthe party's second representative to the Supreme National Council--the \npreelection transitional governing body. As the first \nFinance Minister in the newly established government, Sam Rainsy won \npraise for successfully balancing the country's first budget. \nUnfortunately for him, he was also a critic of the country's pervasive \nand entrenched political corruption which brought him into conflict \nwith members of his own, as well as other parties. He complained \npublicly that Cambodia's banking system was riddled with corruption and \nthat most private banks were simply fronts for money laundering. His \ndecision to contract with a French company--Total--to promote \nefficiency in the country's kickback-racked oil distribution system \nbrought him into a jurisdictional dispute with the CPP-headed Commerce \nMinistry, and made enemies of some powerful and politically influential \ndistributors. Similarly, his decision to take on Thai Boon Rong Co. \nover the latter's attempts to extract payments from vendors in the \nOlympic Marketplace made him few high placed friends.\n  Rainsy's continuing allegations became sufficiently embarrassing to \nthe powers-that-be that he was fired from the Cabinet in October last \nyear. Although fired from the Cabinet, Rainsy became even more vocal in \nhis criticisms. For example, he led an attempt in the assembly to \nreview a series of nontransparent contracts between the government and \nseveral influential private contractors, but was rebuffed. Still \napparently uncomfortable with Rainsy's position, Prince Ranariddh --in \na move that many analysts saw as a power play, a flexing of his \npolitical muscle as leader of FUNCINPEC--lobbied to have Rainsy ousted \nfrom the party as well. He was successful, and Rainsy was expelled in \nMay.\n  Things did not stop there, though. Ranariddh then sought to have \nRainsy expelled from Parliament on the grounds that he was elected as a \nmember of a specific party and that, having decided to leave that \nparty, should not be allowed to keep his seat. At one point, he even \nthreatened to resign if Rainsy was not expelled. Rainsy waged an \ninternational campaign to retain his seat, arguing that he was elected \nby the voters of Siem Reap to represent them and not the party. He was \nnot successful, however. Rainsy was expelled by a 9 to 3 vote by a \npermanent committee of the assembly headed by assembly Chairman Chea \nSim, his deputy, and several standing committee chairmen.\n  I view this move with great concern. Mr. President, this situation \nwould be analogous to a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives \ndeciding to vote against the party line or change her party \naffiliation--a move with which we are not unfamiliar--and consequently \nbeing unseated and replaced by the House leadership. The move was made \nwithout a vote of the assembly, or recourse to the Member's \nconstituency; in fact, that the vote would be on the committee agenda \nwas secret from its members until they had gathered to vote on \nunrelated legislation. Moreover, yesterday a report in the Hong Kong \npress indicated that at least two of the deputies whom purportedly \nsigned the expulsion petition--Prince Norodom Sirivut and another MP \nwho preferred to remain anonymous--have said they did no such thing. \nThis is not how representative government works.\n  The point behind the expulsion is clear: internal discontent with the \nleader of the government will not be tolerated. The move is sure to \nhave a chilling effect on other MP's who do not toe the exact party \nline such as Ieng Muli, the present Information Minister and member of \nthe Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. It also signals a severe blow to \nwhat many saw as the only opposition voice to the government outside \nthe Khmer Rouge. I fear that it signals the transformation of the \nNational Assembly from an open deliberative body into one that simply \nserves to rubber-stamp the decisions of the leadership. As one MP put \nit, if the No. 2 man in the country's largest party can be brought \ndown, regardless of the wishes of his constituents, solely for the \nreason of expressing his personal and political opinions, then who is \nsafe?\n  Mr. President, I realize that my disapproval will likely mean little \nto the forces allied against Sam Rainsy. But they should know that I \nand other Members are watching them closely, and with each increasing \nthreat they pose to democracy there they make one less friend here, and \nmake much less likely the coming forth of support--economic or \notherwise--for their country.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8960-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8960-S8961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of calendar number 129, Senate \nResolution 97.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 97) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate with respect to peace and stability in the South China \n     Sea.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations with amendments; as follows:\n  (The parts of the resolution intended to be stricken are shown in \nboldface brackets and the parts of the resolution intended to be \ninserted are shown in italic.)\n                               S. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas the South China Sea is a strategically important \n     waterway through which transits approximately 25 percent of \n     the World's ocean freight, including almost 70 percent of \n     Japan's oil supply;\n       Whereas the South China Sea serves as a crucial sea lane \n     for naval vessels of the United States and other countries, \n     especially in times of emergency;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China, the Republic of the \n     Philippines, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Republic \n     of China on Taiwan, the State of Brunei Darussalam, and \n     Malaysia have overlapping and mutually exclusive claims to \n     portions of the South China Sea, especially in the Spratly \n     Island group;\n       Whereas some of the nations which have claims to portions \n     of the South China Sea are modernizing their military forces, \n     strengthening their ability to project power outside their \n     domestic boundaries, and consequently, are altering the \n     strategic balance of power in the region;\n       Whereas this power projection capability further drives the \n     concern of nations with territorial claims over acts of \n     aggression in the South China Sea by other nations with \n     claims;\n       Whereas these competing claims have led to armed conflicts \n     between several of the claimants;\n       Whereas these conflicts threaten the peace and stability of \n     all of East Asia; and\n       Whereas the 1992 Manila Declaration of the Association of \n     South East Asian Nations, also recognized by the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China, calls \n     on the claimants to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful \n     negotiated solution to the conflicts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) [urges the executive branch to reiterate] reiterates to \n     the claimants in the South China Sea that the United States \n     does not take a position on any individual claim;\n       (2) calls upon all of the claimants to refrain from using \n     military force or similarly aggressive action to assert or \n     expand territorial claims in the South China Sea;\n       (3) urges the executive branch to declare the active \n     support of the United States for the 1992 Manila Declaration \n     of the Association of South East Asian Nations, and calls \n     upon all the claimants to observe faithfully its provisions; \n     and\n       [(4) calls upon the claimants to scrupulously observe the \n     January, 1995 status quo ante pending any negotiations or \n     resolution of the conflicts between such claimants over such \n     claims.]\n       (4) would view with profound concern and disapproval any \n     maritime claim or restriction on maritime activity in the \n     South China Sea not strictly consistent with international \n     law.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution, as amended, be considered and agreed to, the preamble as \namended be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 97), as amended, was considered and agreed \nto.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, as amended, is as \nfollows:\n  The resolution was not available for printing. It will appear in a \nfuture issue of the Record.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/22/senate-section/article/S8962-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--REPORT TO ACCOMPANY S. 240\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.
